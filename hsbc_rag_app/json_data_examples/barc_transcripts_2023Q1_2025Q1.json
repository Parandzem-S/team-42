    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome to Barclays Q1 2023 Results Analyst and Investor Conference Call. I will now hand you over to C.S. Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive; and Anna Cross, Group Finance Director.\nVenkatakrishnan: Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Let me start by saying how pleased I'm with our first quarter's performance for 2023. This was a record quarter of profitability for the bank. We generated 11.3 pence of earnings per share, which is well above the 8.4 pence of EPS in the first quarter of 2022, and our profit before tax of \u00a32.6 billion for this quarter, is up 16% year-on-year. We grew income by 11% or \u00a3741 million year-on-year, to \u00a37.2 billion. This has demonstrated the broad-based and high quality sources of income, which we have across the Group's businesses. Supporting this income momentum, we maintained our focus on costs and our disciplined approach to investment, resulting in a cost to income ratio of 57%. We have delivered a 15% return on tangible equity, with all three of our operating businesses generating a double-digit return. And what this means is that we are very confident of being above 10% for the full-year RoTE, in line with our group target. I'm especially proud that we delivered this strong performance while supporting our customers and clients through what has been a challenging environment for the banking sector globally. As you think about these results, I would like to emphasize three factors, which I think have driven it. The first factor is our risk management approach, developed over a number of quarters and years, which has helped to underpin this performance. The second is a series of disciplined investments over recent years, which have helped to drive top-line growth. And third, our approach to capital management which continues to support attractive shareholder returns. Let me begin first with the risk management. We have highlighted before that we have intentionally positioned the Group's balance sheet to protect against downside risk in a volatile macro-economic and market environment. This risk management has shown itself in different ways. In our Markets business to begin with, we have maintained a defensive risk profile since the start of 2022 and managed our risk well and adroitly throughout. In interest rate risk in our banking book, we have successfully positioned ourselves for rising rates and minimized the capital impacts from the large moves in interest rates which we have experienced. In our credit portfolios, we have maintained robust coverage ratios and limited our risk appetite in specific products and sectors, and added first loss protection to our portfolios where appropriate. Now the U.K., coming to liquidity, has not experienced liquidity concerns that we've witnessed elsewhere in the world. At Barclays, our customer-led liquidity deposit strategy over many, many years has laid the foundation for the highly liquid diverse and stable funding base which we have today. All of these deliberate actions over a long period of time have proven their value in a quarter like this one. We were able to operate normally in a volatile environment, and deliver strong returns to our shareholders. The second big factor is investments. As we turn to investments, you will see that they are behind the income growth that we see in today's results. In our Markets business, our consistent investment in our platform has driven significant growth year-on-year in financing income, including prime, and market share gains over several years. This has contributed to the Corporate & Investment Bank delivering its second highest quarterly income on record, just shy of \u00a34 billion, and a 15.2% return on tangible equity. In our U.S. Cards business, our Gap partnership is performing well and we also grew cards balances organically across our other partner portfolios, while credit continued to normalize in line with our expectations. This growth in U.S. Cards, along with 15% year-on-year AUM growth in our Private Bank, have helped to drive 47% higher income in our Consumer Cards and Payments business with a 10.5% return on tangible equity. Now as we've have mentioned previously, we plan to consolidate our U.K. Wealth business with our Private Bank in this the second quarter of 2023. This will enable us to operate a more efficient, competitive and customer-focused Private Banking and Wealth business from a unified platform. We will update you on this important step in due course. And lastly, turning to our U.K. Consumer business, Barclays U.K. Investment in our transformation program is generating efficiencies, and allowing rates tailwinds to drive strong profitability, while maintaining a cost to income ratio of 56% and generating an RoTE of 20%. Our positive momentum in Barclays U.K. is reflected in the increase in active Barclays app customers, its growing up to 10.7 million users by the end of first quarter of 2023, which is up 8% year-on-year.  In other areas, we are laying the foundation for our future, such as our investments in support of our strategic priority to capture opportunities from the transition to a low carbon economy. In fact this quarter, Barclays helped Nextracker, the leading provider of intelligent, integrated solar tracking and software solutions, raise $730 million through an initial public offering. This was the first major renewable energy IPO since 2021. And the third point is Capital. On Capital, the \u00a3500 million share buyback, which we announced earlier this year, along with other capital items that we have highlighted, have brought our CET1 ratio to 13.6% as expected, around the mid-point of our target range. Our profits delivered 53 basis points of CET1 ratio in the quarter, supporting further capital distributions for our shareholders over the coming year. This remains a key focus for the bank. When we consider our capital allocation, we are carefully balancing capital returns with the disciplined investments about which I just spoke to you, and which are driving improved returns for shareholders. So in summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter for the first quarter of 2023 it's a very strong performance. We generated a 15% RoTE, with double-digit returns across all of our operating businesses. Our risk management and robust liquidity, have helped insulate Barclays from recent events in the industry, and enabled us to continue to support our customers and clients. Our investments are delivering growth and improved returns, and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. With that, thank you for listening, and I'll hand over to Anna to take you through the financials in more detail\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Venkat, and good morning everyone. Q1 was another quarter of consistent delivery, with a statutory return on tangible equity of 15%. Whilst Q1 is usually strong for returns, as Venkat mentioned, we are confident of achieving our RoTE target of above 10% for the year. The cost income ratio was 57%, better than our guidance of low 60s for the year, reflecting Q1 income seasonality. The loan loss ratio was 52 basis points within our 50 basis points to 60 basis points guidance for 2023. Our highly liquid and stable balance sheet positions us well to pursue our returns objectives, with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%, a conservative loan to deposit ratio, and a liquidity coverage ratio of 163%. Our 15% return reflects income growth of \u00a3741 million year-on-year to \u00a37.2 billion, while total costs were flat at \u00a34.1 billion. Within that, operating costs increased \u00a3523 million, offsetting the decrease in Litigation and Conduct. Profit before impairment was up 31%. As we expected, impairment increased \u00a3383 million, against a low comparator, resulting in a 16% increase in profit before tax overall to \u00a32.6 billion. Earnings per share were 11.3 pence, partially offset by the 5 pence full-year dividend, driving the increase of 6 pence intangible net asset value in the quarter to 301 pence per share. I'm now going to emphasize key drivers of our returns; income, costs and risk management. First, Q1 again demonstrated our broad-based income momentum. We are benefiting from the rate environment, and also seeing the results of our targeted investment initiatives. Second, as we invest, we are maintaining cost discipline, driving cost efficiency to mitigate inflation, whilst directing investment into areas which we expect to generate attractive returns for shareholders. And third, we continue to manage risk tightly, which along with our prudent balance sheet positioning and liquidity management, underpin our delivery against targets in this environment. Starting with income on slide 8. Income increased a 11% year-on-year with growth across the Group, partly from margin expansion, but also from client activity and selective growth in the balance sheet. Barclays U.K. grew 19%, mainly from net interest income. Consumer, Cards & Payments increased 47%, including the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, driven mainly by U.S. cards, and also growth in both Payments and the Private Bank. CIB reported its second best quarter on record with income up \u00a338 million at just under \u00a34 billion, including some benefit from the U.S. dollar strength. We are particularly pleased with the quality and diverse sources of strong income growth, which we'll look at on slide 9. The \u00a3741 million increase mainly reflected growth in net interest income from several businesses across the Group. In Barclays U.K., NII grew \u00a3279 million, reflecting broadly stable balances and a stronger margin. In Consumer Cards & Payments, income growth of \u00a3420 million reflected the significant U.S. Cards balance growth, up 30% and improvement in margin. CIB income was broadly flat despite a reduction of around \u00a3370 million in intermediation income in markets. The financing income in markets increased by around \u00a3160 million to just over \u00a3800 million. This reflects the investment we have made in that area over the last few years, as we mentioned at full-year, and also benefit from inflation. Whilst this revenue stream is relatively more stable, it will be subject to fluctuations and seasonality from quarter-to-quarter, as client demand is impacted by the market environment, where spreads and inflation are expected to moderate. Transaction Banking contributed over \u00a3300 million of growth, mainly net interest income from higher margins, including the structural hedge, plus some year-on-year growth in deposit balances. Transactional activity drove some fee income growth across both the Consumer and Corporate businesses. We've illustrated on Slide 10 why we remain confident about the momentum in net interest income from the roll of the structural hedge. You can see the quarterly build in gross income from the hedge, to \u00a3773 million in Q1. Although swap rates have moderated from Q4, reinvestment rates are still well above the yield of about 1% on hedges, which mature this year. So the build in gross hedge income is expected to continue, and two-thirds of this accrues to BUK. We reduced the size of the hedge marginally again in Q1, reflecting the deposit migration to interest-bearing accounts, particularly in corporate, as expected. In total we have over \u00a350 billion maturing in 2023 and expect to reinvest the majority of that. Turning now to costs on Slide 11. Total costs were broadly flat year-on-year at \u00a34.1 billion, and our Group cost income ratio was 57%. Operating costs, excluding litigation and conduct, which was immaterial this quarter, increased by \u00a30.5 billion. \u00a30.1 billion of this came from FX moves, with around 30% of Group costs in U.S. dollars. Efficiencies generated by previous cost actions broadly offset the effect of inflation to date. The increase also reflected disciplined investment to drive returns, and generate further efficiency savings. The 30% U.S. Cards balance growth, including the Gap acquisition, along with further marketing and partner spend and FX moves, drove the \u00a3170 million increase in Consumer Cards & Payments. The CIB increase of around \u00a3280 million included a \u00a340 million increase in European levies, which are a Q1 event, and FX impacts of c.\u00a360 million. We have also invested selectively in a number of CIB initiatives to support both the income momentum you see in our current performance and to improve resilience and controls. These include technology platform enhancements, to generate income and to deliver better client experience. For example, we have improved our financing platforms, supporting the growth in that area, and e-trading systems, and developed a unified interface for corporate clients. We have also invested selectively in front office talent. In Barclays U.K., our focus is on transformation, as we automate and digitize our customer service models. The efficiency savings we've referenced previously are more than offsetting inflation and helping to fund the continued investment in digitization and product simplification, to improve our service for customers. Turning to the cost outlook. Our cost guidance for the year is unchanged and we continue to target a Group cost income ratio in the low 60s. Litigation and conduct is expected to be lower year-on-year, resulting in some reduction in total costs. To give some color on the expected phasing of costs through the year, we currently expect Q1 to be the high point for Group operating costs in 2023, based on current FX rates, but with different dynamics by business. We expect CIB quarterly operating costs also to be lower than the Q1 level. Moving on to impairment on Slide 12. We haven't changed the baseline macroeconomic variables for modelled impairment from the full-year, but they are more severe than for Q1 last year. Our total impairment allowance at the quarter-end was \u00a36.3 billion, a slight increase from \u00a36.2 billion at full-year, driven by a normalization in customer behavior. At the end of the quarter we retained post model adjustments for economic uncertainty of \u00a30.3 billion. On Slide 13, we've shown key coverage and delinquency metrics for our two largest unsecured books, U.K. and U.S. Cards. U.K. Cards balances have reduced by around 40% since 2019. We continue to see high repayment rates in U.K. cards across the credit spectrum, and arrears rates remain stable and low. The coverage ratio is 7.7% in U.K. cards, slightly up on the year-end, with 21.6% coverage of Stage 2 balances. By contrast we've continued to grow U.S. cards. Delinquency rates have picked up a little, as we continue to see normalization of credit behaviors. However, they remain below pre-pandemic level. As we grow, we are maintaining strong coverage levels, with an increase from 8.1% at year end to 8.9% overall, and higher coverage ratios at Stage 2 and Stage 3. The resulting impairment charge for the quarter was \u00a3524 million, compared to the very low charge of \u00a3141 million last year. This charge translated into a loan loss ratio of 52 basis points, and we are reiterating our guidance of 50 basis points to 60 basis points for 2023, reflecting the expected normalization in credit. The Barclays U.K. charge of \u00a3113 million reflects both the lower level of unsecured lending compared to pre-pandemic and benign credit performance. The bulk of the charge is in Consumer Cards & Payments, and U.S. Cards in particular. This reflects the continuing normalization of delinquencies, plus some seasonality following holiday expenditure. Continuing balance growth with a seasoning effect as balances grow post-pandemic, is also contributing to the increase. This was particularly the case for Gap, where balances were Stage 1 at the point of acquisition; as some balances have migrated to Stage 2, we have seen impairment increase as expected. Turning now to the performance of each business, beginning with Barclays U.K. on Slide 15. Profit before tax increased 27% and return on tangible equity was 20%. Income grew 19% to \u00a32 billion, with costs up 9%, reducing the cost income ratio by a further five percentage points to 56%. Net interest margin was 318 basis points, up 8 basis points on Q4, as we benefitted further from the roll of the structural hedge and the lagged effect from recent base rate rises. These impacts continued to be moderated, as we expected by product margin impacts, notably in mortgages, and also from migration of deposits into higher rate products during the quarter. As we indicated at full-year results, overall we still expect the NIM to build over the year, though more gradually than we saw from Q4 to Q1 and we continue to guide to a Barclays U.K. NIM above 320 basis points for the year as a whole. There were no incremental headwinds from the treasury effects we highlighted in Q4, and we expect a modest reversal of these over the rest of the year, supporting the margin progression. Looking next at Consumer Cards & Payments on slide 16. The return on tangible equity was 10.5%. Income increased 47%, reflecting growth across International Cards, Payments and the Private Bank. U.S. Cards balances grew 30% to $28.5 billion, including $3.3 billion from the acquisition of the Gap book plus organic growth. Total costs were down 3%, reflecting the non-recurrence of the significant litigation and conduct charge last year. Excluding this, operating costs were up 29% reflecting continuing growth across the businesses, and still delivering positive jaws. Overall the cost income ratio improved to 58%. As I discussed earlier, the increase in impairment was in line with our expectations and overall loan loss rate guidance. Looking next at the CIB on Slide 17. Return on tangible equity was 15.2%, while CIB income was broadly flat, against a very strong comparator. Markets had a stand out first quarter in 2022, so income down 8% is a creditable performance, with FICC continuing to perform strongly up 9%. This was offset by equities, reflecting lower volatility compared to prior years, which impacted intermediation income, and derivatives in particular. As I mentioned we continued to see good growth in financing. Investment Banking fees were down 7%, reflecting the lower industry fee pool, although within this advisory fees were up 15%. Our deal pipeline remains strong, and we would expect that to drive improved fee income as rates and market conditions stabilize. As I mentioned earlier, Transaction Banking was another strong performance, up 68% year-on-year to \u00a3786 million. Total costs decreased 2%, reflecting non-recurrence of the significant litigation and conduct charge last Q1. Excluding this, operating costs increased 15%. Overall we're pleased with the continuing development of this franchise. There's a slide in the appendix on the Head Office result, which was a loss before tax of \u00a384 million. Turning now to capital and liquidity on Slide 18. We have consistently maintained strong capital and liquidity levels, as illustrated on this slide. We ended this quarter with a CET1 ratio at 13.6%, which is in the middle of our target range of 13%, 14%. Our liquidity pool ended the quarter at \u00a3333 billion, with a liquidity coverage ratio of 163%, and a net stable funding ratio of 139%, both substantially ahead of the regulatory requirements of 100%. Looking in more detail at capital, as we flagged at the year end, three items reduced the CET1 ratio by around 40 basis points. The reduction in IFRS9 transitional relief, the completion of the Kensington acquisition, and the recently completed \u00a3500 million buyback announced in February. Our capital generation from profits was strong, contributing 53 basis points in the quarter, of which 10 basis points was applied to the dividend accrual. The expected increase in RWAs amounted to 21 basis points, as we invested in opportunities in the Markets businesses, supporting our strong income performance. We ended the quarter at 13.6% and our MDA is now 11.4%; so our target range of 13%, 14% gives comfortable headroom. Looking forward, we expect strong organic capital generation to support increased returns to shareholders and further business growth in line with our three strategic priorities. Recent events in the sector have increased the market's focus on deposit funding. At Barclays, we have grown deposit balances substantially ahead of loan volumes for many years. As shown on Slide 20, we have seen an overall increase in deposits of \u00a310 billion, or 2% this quarter to \u00a3556 billion. This increase has been driven by international term-deposits in treasury. These are mainly from corporates, and reflect the flight to quality in the market. Excluding these, underlying customer deposits across the businesses are down just 1% in the quarter. This is consistent with previous Q1 experience, and is largely as a result of expected seasonal effects, including payment of tax bills in January, and some FX moves. Of total group deposits 41% are insured, with over 70% of U.K. retail, and over 90% of U.S. consumer deposits covered. Our franchise deposit strategy means we have remained highly liquid through the quarter and have a liquidity coverage ratio of 163%, well ahead of the regulatory requirements, and equivalent to a surplus of \u00a3122 billion. The liquidity pool of \u00a3333 billion is held 82% in cash, with the risk in the residual debt securities tightly managed. We have invested in liquidity management over many years and our approach focuses not just on the LCR, but also on a set of internal stress metrics that apply conservative stresses to our balance sheet in multiple scenarios, across various time horizons. So, to recap and summarize the outlook on slide 22. We delivered earnings of 11.3 pence per share in Q1, and generated a 15% return on tangible equity. Whilst Q1 tends to be a seasonally strong quarter for returns, we are confident of achieving our target of above 10% for the year. We have broad-based and high-quality income momentum from the investments we have made in CIB and in growing CCP, while the rate environment and structural hedge also continue to drive income. We will balance this investment with cost efficiency, given inflationary pressures, and we expect the litigation and conduct charges to be lower than in 2022. Whilst we expect operating costs, which exclude litigation and conduct, to be higher year-on-year, we currently expect Q1 to be the high point for quarterly operating costs in 2023, based on current FX rates. The cost income ratio for the quarter was 57%, and we expect to deliver a statutory cost income ratio in the low 60s this year, as we progress towards our target of below 60%. We remain focused on risk management in readiness for potential deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. We expect an increase in the impairment charge this year, as we grow U.S. Cards in particular, and have seen an increase in the charge there in Q1, as expected. We continue to guide to a loan loss ratio in the range of 50 basis points to 60 basis points for the full-year. Our capital ratio remains strong at 13.6%, and we expect to deliver attractive capital returns to shareholders balanced with disciplined investments to drive returns. Thank you. And we will now take your questions, and as usual I would ask that you limit yourself to two per person, so we get a chance to get around to everyone.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Omar Keenan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, Omar. Your line is now open.\nOmar Keenan: Good morning everybody. Congratulations on a great set of numbers. I've got two questions. If we look at Barclays' businesses, clearly, there's been a tailwind from higher interest rates. But also, as you mentioned, there has been a market share and investment story over some time, which does imply that structurally, the RoTE potential has improved. However, the RoTE hurdle is unchanged. So I just wanted an updated thinking from you on that RoTE hurdle. Do you think greater than 10% adequately reflects Barclays' cost of equity? And if not, I was just hoping to explore your thinking on what you think the barriers are to giving a more challenging hurdle? And if you think it does need to be fine-tuned, whether you're considering any Investor Days in the future to do that. And my next question is just on capital generation. So historically, Q1 has been the trough for capital generation. Can I just check, it sounds like that's expected to be the case this year. And are there any specific headwinds on capital that you called out? And conceptually, it does seem that the interim buyback has not been larger than the full-year buyback. Is that something that is applied as a rule? Or is there no particular constraints on what interim buyback can be relative to the full-year? Thank you.\nVenkatakrishnan: Thanks, Omar. It's Venkat. So let me answer the first question and Anna will take the second one. Look, you're absolutely right that our businesses have delivered strong double-digit returns across the spectrum. And this reflects quality and breadth of performance across the group, which reflects the investments we've made over a number of years. And the 15% RoTE for this first quarter, in my opinion, is a very serious down payment on the target, which is above 10%. So that -- it's above 10% means 10% is a floor. It is not a ceiling. It is not reflecting the extent of our ambition. We -- our view is with this strong start, we are very comfortable and we expect to meet that target of above 10%.\nAnna Cross: Yes, sure. Omar, you're right. We said that in the past. Typically, it is what we expect that Q1 is a lower point in our capital generation and trajectory for the year just because of seasonality. Obviously, all of that is prior to any distribution or buyback. Equally, we'll come back and consider that buyback when we come back to the half year. That's the cadence that we've established. We don't have hard and fast rules. And we'll look both at our expected capital print at that point in time, but also our expectations of capital generation in the second half when we do so. Thank you. Can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Napier from UBS. Please go ahead, Jason. Your line is now open.\nJason Napier: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, Anna, it's not enormous within the Group context. But I wondered whether we could explore the loan loss charge in Barclays U.K. for Cards. Stage 1 -- sorry, Stage 2 and 3 balances are down. You talked of the higher degree of transactors in the book. Unemployment hasn't risen. So I just wonder whether there was a preemptive component to that charge? Or is this the sort of run rate before the economy starts to sort of noticeably slow at a headline level? And then secondly, perhaps Venkat, for you. I mean, the Barclays implied cost of equity is above 20%. Some firms in that position have decided to not grow the balance sheet at all, the likes of Unicredit and StanChart, for example, and drive perhaps bigger buybacks. I appreciate it's easier to run a bank where revenues are going up and banking is a fixed cost per volume gain. But I just wonder whether you could sort of simply talk about whether the valuation of the bank affect your attitude to growth. Sort of how much would you expect RWAs to expand given the share price and the market environment that we find themselves in? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thanks, Jason. Our impairment charge in the first quarter, both for the Group and for the individual businesses, is as we expected it to be. And what's really driving that charge, Jason, is two things. The first is that the cards book is 40% lower than it was pre-pandemic. So you need to take that into account when you're comparing this to what I would describe as the historic growth rate for BUK. The second thing is that the credit environment and credit behavior is actually benign. So we're seeing very conservative behavior from our customers. They're repaying at extremely high levels. They're managing their volumes very carefully, and you're seeing that come through in a low impairment print. Clearly, as the economy recovers, we might see that rise. But we would also expect to see credit card income rise at the same time because, obviously, those two things are strongly linked, but not a surprise to us. Venkat?\nVenkatakrishnan: Yes. So Jason, thank you. It's a good question. What I would say when you look at this quarter's results if you see the benefit of the investments, which we've made not just in terms of the profits of the revenues we've produced, but the stability in our metrics of capital. And what you see is that we are running our business for the long-term. And when you run that business for the long-term, you obviously hope that the stock price will ultimately recognize the value of those businesses. And so what we are aiming to do is to create a series of a set of businesses, operate them well, run them efficiently, manage our risks well and produce numbers. Some quarters will be better than others, but we hope we could do this kind of thing very steadily. And then that will be recognized and reflected in the stock price. Capital return is an important part of that strategy, just as investment is an important part of our strategy. And we take our capital return very, very seriously, and we will balance it with the investment needs of an ongoing business that we expect to be successful.\nJason Napier: Thank you, Venkat. If I could just sort of follow-up on that. What sort of RWA growth do you think the sort of environment. And there's potential market share gains given some of the volatility in the industry that we're seeing. What sort of balance sheet expansion would you have in mind for this year, do you think?\nAnna Cross: Jason, why don't I take that? I mean, really it depends on the opportunities that that we have in front of us. But you can see that we're doing it in a very disciplined way. We expected to deploy RWAs into markets in the first quarter, and that's what we've done. So where we see opportunities, we will obviously pursue them, but only in a very disciplined way, very focused on returns to shareholders. Both returns are in RoTE terms, but our ability to distribute capital.\nJason Napier: Thanks very much. Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Dickerson from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Joseph. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Dickerson: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick one. Your Slide 10 on the hedge income is rather interesting because effectively, if you just assume your 375 average Q1 level of swap rates versus the yield, you're looking at somewhere south of about a \u00a37 billion gap. So it's a very big number, considering that the market only expects you to grow your revenues in the U.K. bank by about \u00a3300 million, \u00a325 million on 2023. And I wouldn't have thought that assuming rates -- assuming that number stays flat, right, so theoretical, I wouldn't have thought that mortgage pricing and deposit mix shift would have eaten up the bulk of that. So I just wonder your thoughts there because it seems like there's still an incredible amount of momentum behind the hedge repricing, the obvious caveat of where swap rates go, but we're actually sitting here higher today than 375.\nAnna Cross: Thanks, Joe. Why don't I take that question? We've shown this slide for some time on what it's useful. And I think what it highlights is that we have got structural hedge momentum, and we've seen that actually fairly repeatedly over the last few quarters. And you've seen that, particularly in our BUK NIM bridge. And it's one of the reasons that we are calling out that we still expect our BUK NIM to continue to rise in the current environment despite the product dynamics that you call out. And it really underpins the guidance that we've given you already of a greater than 320 NIM. So it's as we expected it to be Joe and fairly consistent over the last few quarters.\nJoseph Dickerson: Yes, thanks. It's just very impressive when you look at, I think it's Page 21 or so of the release, where you look at the net number being \u00a31.7 billion. I mean it's a rather extraordinary gap. So it just seems to me like the market is missing something on that, normal caveats notwithstanding.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thank you. Do you have another question? Or shall we?\nJoseph Dickerson: Just one. That was all.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRohith Chandra-Rajan: Hi, thank you very much. And good morning. I had a couple on CIB revenues and costs, please. Firstly, on CIB revenues. I mean congratulations here on a particularly strong performance. I think that's very commendable given the tough prior-year comps that you had. And I was wondering if I could just ask in terms of the trends on the corporate side in particular. So lending was better quarter-on-quarter, which I presume is just primarily fewer marks. And then Transaction Banking was a little bit weaker quarter-on-quarter. So I was just wondering if you could help us understand firstly, what's happened in the first quarter? And then secondly, how we should think about that -- those two revenue lines for the remainder of the year? And then the second was on costs. You mentioned Q1 is the high point for both CIB and group costs. I think particularly about the CIB. Is that particularly relating to the compensation accrual and maybe the SRF contribution in the first quarter? Or is there something around the phasing of either investment spend or cost savings that we should think about as well as the year progresses? And then I guess the conclusion from sort of both of those is strong revenue performance, but jaws in the CIB was still minus 14% in Q1. How should we think about that for the year as a whole? And more broadly, how are you managing that business in terms of costs and revenues?\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thanks, Rohith. It felt like there were about 10 questions in there, but I'll try and remember them all. So just on the first one on corporate lending. Remember, there are a few things in there. There's corporate lending itself, then there's the cost of our first loss protection, there's a leverage loan mark, and there's also the cost of the hedges against our leverage pipeline. So the quarter-on-quarter movement that you see is really caused by two of those. You're right, it's the marks. So we've taken no material marks this quarter. The second point, though, is if you recall from the full-year, we said that we managed down our leverage loan pipeline. We've continued to do that again in Q1. And therefore, the scale of those hedges, it's smaller and therefore, the costs are smaller. And that's really what's moving that line. On the Transaction Banking side, the reduction in income is coming from a couple of things largely you'll see that the balances are broadly stable. But remember, during the quarter, actually what happens in Transaction Banking typically as we see corporate dividends being paid in the first quarter. So the average balance tends to dip down and then grow towards the back end of the quarter. And also remember, you've got fewer business days within Q1. So you've got 90 business days versus 92, I think. So that has an impact on any kind of banking income. Taking all of that together and going forward, I think we expect our CIB NIM, which we very rarely talk about, to be broadly flat for the year. And the reason I say that is you've obviously got deposit migration going on within Transaction Banking. But we feel like that's very well progressed. And on the other side, you've got actually quite helpful asset mix going on within corporate because in the current environment, there's slightly higher levels of both trade and sales finance, which are slightly higher margins. So overall, that NIM is pretty stable. And with an expanding franchise, we think that's useful for the future. On the CIB cost point, this is largely a seasonality point. So you're right, we accrued compensation costs in line with revenue and returns on the CIB. So you're seeing a higher level there. You're also seeing the SRS, so the European levy, which is a Q1 event, but is higher year-on-year. And in scale terms is about \u00a390 million. And you're seeing a fairly consistent run rate in terms of investment that's underpinning the growth that Venkat said. So that's why we're saying we expect it to sort of tick down from here. We're very focused on returns in that business. You can see that the cost income ratio at 55% is actually better, I think, than the market expected despite that increase in cost. So it's very deliberate on our part. And of course, we start to deliver positive in this business. But at this point in the cycle, we're in an investment phase. But hopefully, that gives you a bit more color.\nRohith Chandra-Rajan: Yes, very helpful. Thank you very much.\nAnna Cross: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Pierce from Numis. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Pierce: Hello, two questions, please. The first, just on the AT1. You've issued quite a lot of it over the last eight to nine months. And I guess, there's an argument that you prefunded the instrument that's callable in September in the overall stat at nearly \u00a314 billion, I think is higher than you would ordinarily look to run with. So can you talk a little bit about how you feel with regard to AT1 issuance over the rest of the year and whether specifically you can still call that September instrument without refinancing it? The second question is just on this Barclays U.K. NIM. The 21 basis points drop in the quarter due to product margins. I mean, obviously, the hedge keeps on giving something like 13 basis points every quarter. For the next few quarters, sooner or later, the bank rate elements tend to drop away. So thinking about the balance between these two, it would be helpful if you could give me a sense of how much of that 21 basis points is coming from the component part of mortgage refinancings, deposit migration. And I guess in Q1, whereas an element related to the actual losses deposits as well, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. I'll take both of those. Yes, you're right. We issued AT1 in the first quarter, two very successful AT1s in the U.K. and actually in Singapore. We typically operate with a surplus of AT1 in our capital stack. We do that deliberately in part to give us flexibility -- in part to give us flexibility around, for example, FX volatility that we might encounter, but also because we deploy it flexibly into our markets business, where despite the fact that the cost of that AT1 is higher than the Tier 2. Obviously, the returns in the markets business are sufficiently high to make that a good economic trade for us. So that's why we typically run with a surplus. We have got a call opportunity later in the year. We assess every call in line with the economic circumstances at that point in time. So we'll be looking at that very carefully as we ordinarily would. So no change there. On the Barclays U.K. NIM, 318 in the quarter, up eight basis points. That is as we expected. And the product migration again is as we expected. And as we were talking about at the full-year, we haven't given a split of that by business, Jonathan. But the larger part of it in mortgages. What's happening there is it's just a portfolio effect of the fact that most mortgages that are maturing this year were written in 2021, where asset margins were wider than they are now. We have seen some deposit migration. That's within our expectations. As you can see, we haven't moved our product hedge on the retail side. So that 21 basis points is not a surprise to us. I'll just remind you that as the year progresses, we expect to see continued hedge momentum. We expect that migration to continue, but we also expect to see some modest treasury tailwinds as we called out at the full-year, and it's really taking all of those pieces together. That means that we are confident in our guidance of greater than 320 for the year.\nJonathan Pierce: I'm sorry, just a quick follow-on that. Do you think without the treasury movements turning into tailwinds, the U.K. NIM would still manage to creep up. In other words, will this 21 basis points ease, do you think, over the course of the year to a level more consistent with or even below the structural hedge tailwind?\nAnna Cross: So I would say, yes, because they are modest treasury tailwinds. We did talked before about expecting more product compression earlier in the year than later. And that's part of the seasonal movement that we see in deposits around Q1. And I'd also encourage you just have a look at the asset margins and how they played out in 2021. That might help you.\nJonathan Pierce: Yes, that's very helpful. Thanks a lot.\nAnna Cross: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Guy Stebbings from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nGuy Stebbings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one was just on your comment on the Gap portfolio and Stage migration. Could you perhaps elaborate on the dynamics on that book. I would presume the quality of that book is not quite as strong as the rest of your very good quality card portfolio. So can you maybe give us kind of the coverage ratio on that portfolio and how it compares to the rest of the book to help us gauge what stage migration or normalization of these sales might mean for impairments in the coming quarter? And then on costs, thanks for the helpful guidance on Q1 being a high point for the group and for CIB. I presume that struck off a certain revenue assumption. And if you had a really strong revenue performance, you might very understandably not hold yourself to that guidance. So could you share any more details on what those assumptions are that go into the guidance, in particular, anything on revenue or what sort of market backdrop you're assuming on the CIB? And then just one very small point of clarification. On the ESRS, I think you said it was \u00a390 million. Is that the absolute number? So how does that compare to a normal year, if you like? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Guy, why don't I have a go at those. So when you purchase a portfolio, you purchase it at Stage 1. So when we acquired Gap, it was all Stage 1. As Gap has started to season and started to mature and grow, we see some natural migration into Stage 2. That means that customers are starting to borrow more. We've got new customers coming on to the box exactly as we expected. If you use your credit card more than you did previously, you might progress to Stage 2 even though you're showing no signs of delinquency. That's just the way IFRS 9 works. So it's within our expectations. And in terms of sort of coverage of NIM, we don't disclose individual partner ratios, whether that be delinquency or NIM. But what I will tell you is that we manage each partner individually. We manage them on a risk-adjusted return. The Gap is a very good quality portfolio. But it is a retail portfolio, and we typically expect the risk -- the cost of risk to be higher in that type of portfolio than we would in an airline one, but we would also expect the NIM to be higher. So overall, think of this as us managing a risk-adjusted return. So even though impairment might be higher, we'd also expect NIM to be higher. So that hopefully deals with the first question. On the second one, the easy bit is, yes, around \u00a390 million in absolute terms on the IFRS. It doesn't move around a little bit, not quite as mechanistic as the bank levy in the U.K. But that is up year-on-year, which I think we've talked about in the slides. From here on in, we have -- we obviously have an expectation of performance. Let me try and help you with that. We've given you, I think, clear guidance in terms of how we expect costs to move from here. We've also, by inference, given you some income guidance because we've given you a cost-income ratio expectations for the year. So hopefully, that will be somewhat helpful in getting you to the range of income that we expect, albeit at group level. The only other thing I would say is that the guidance we've given is based on the FX rate. It's also based on our current expectations of a normal seasonal profile in CIB revenues and driven very much by the performance costs underpinning that. So hopefully, that's helpful. And next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAlvaro Serrano: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions from me. One on, just more a follow-up. On the deposits, it's great to see that you saw sort of deposits up actually, and we've seen quite different reports from some of your peers and overall. Can I just maybe sort of press you to -- you mentioned the flight to quality, but I don't know if you can size that flight to quality like some of the U.S. players have done. And more importantly, going forward, and I'm thinking here in particular in BUK, what would you expect the deposits to do from here? Do you continue to expand to slip or more stability? And the second question is more of a follow-up on the previous question on markets. You mentioned, Anna, that you're kind of expecting a normal seasonality that FICC was very, very strong on a very strong comp. So maybe to give us some comfort or some more color, could you maybe talk us through Q1 if a lot of that was March volatility? Is it more consistent that gives you the confidence for that normal seasonality? Thank you.\nVenkatakrishnan: Hi, Alvaro, I'll take the questions. So the first one on deposits. You're right. I mean, we've gone up a little over the quarter, \u00a310 billion. We saw a normal seasonality within the BUK deposit base, which has a very slight shrinkage. And that was due to basically people paying their taxes. The broad point within the U.K. context is that it has not seen the movement across banks that you've seen in the U.S. because there's not been the kind of deposit pressure you've got in the U.S. from some of the very large regional banks having problems. So in the U.S., it's very much a function of that regional bank issue and the movement from regionals to the big money center banks. You don't have that in the U.K. So it's been behaving the way we would expect it to in the first quarter, and we'd expect that same seasonal trend in the second quarter. Where we have seen a bit of inflow is in what we would call our treasury deposits, we've called it out, which are basically corporates around the world placing deposits, stand deposits with us, which is -- it's a nice thing to have. It's a show of confidence. And so that is what's been driving it. And I would say, otherwise, in the U.K. context, think of it as just the normal seasonal slow. Coming back to markets, I'll say two things. As far as the first quarter goes, it was a case of great volatility in fixed income markets both before March and in March, right? So if you remember, in the early part of the year, interest rates started rising. And then there was a big view that actually that things were going to -- that the Fed was going to stop making having interest rate rises after a certain point. And there's a bunch of sort of shall we say, bearish trade on rates and bullish trades on spreads in January. That reversed in March. So you see volatility. But I think the important thing what I would like to say about our FICC franchise is that our market share has continued to grow in that franchise. And as it has in equities over a number of quarters and years based on deepening client relationships, investment in technology, investment in people, right? So I expect as we go forward in the next quarter and the one after that for that market share to be sustained, if not to grow. And we did well in the first quarter of this year. We did -- in the second quarter, I'll also remind you that Q2 of '22 was a very strong point of comparison with the volatility that you had post structure in Europe. I mean, so far, you've not seen that in this quarter.\nAlvaro Serrano: Thank you very much.\nAnnaCross: Okay, thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Cant from Autonomous. Please go ahead. Your line is now open, Chris.\nChristopher Cant: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If I could ask two, please. On the structural hedge, you said in the slide that about two-thirds of the hedge income is coming through in the U.K. But where does the other one-third get booked by business, please? And how much of that will be coming through the Transaction Banking line? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much growth we should expect there. Are you able to guide this all, please, on your expectations for revenues for the corporate lending and Transaction Banking line? I know you don't generally talk about the revenue outlook, but I would hope that those lines might be a little bit forecastable. And I think that was a source of the beat in the quarter versus consensus. So perhaps we're missing something there. And then on the BUK side of things, in terms of the mortgage book, could you give us a sense, please, of where you're writing new business today versus where the average spread on the back book is in terms of what's rolling? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Let me take those, Chris. So the majority of the rest of the structural hedge does appear in Transaction Banking. There's a little bit in the private bank. But as you can imagine, much less given its scale and also given that those are much more interest-sensitive balances. So that's where you see it going. That's in part driving the NIM in the CIB up year-on-year. And then there's another smaller part from assets, which I called out before, from the sales and trade finance side on that. In terms of corporate lending, I called out before, we've seen some movement quarter-on-quarter because we haven't taken marks because the pipeline is much lower., From here, let's see where that goes, but it's certainly much recovered on the prior-quarter. We've given some guidance on this line before, but just remember the other thing that's in there is our SRT costs, so our first loss protection costs. If I take all of that together, actually our corporate income is pretty stable. And the reason I say that is you're seeing a NIM that's stable for reasons that I said before. You're seeing good balance growth coming through. Actually, we've seen some year-on-year corporate lending growth as well. So as an outlook, it's performed. And as you say, a lot more stable than some of the other parts of the CIB. So we're pretty confident in its outlook. I think the other thing I'd just call out is we've obviously seen quite a lot of deposit migration there already. If I contrast the sort of three different deposit franchises we have, we've seen most migration in private banking, as you'd expect, a lot in corporate and probably less in personal. So hopefully, that gives you some guidance there. And in terms of BUK mortgages, we don't talk about specific margins. That's not something we ever disclosed. But if you're looking for the effects of the compression, I would say mortgage margins have been relatively stable, and they're pretty consistent across the market given the very competitive nature of it. And if you were to look back at the spread over swap in '21, then you're going to see that compression effect quite clearly, I think. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nChristopher Cant: Just if I could come back on the sort of CIB revenue line items. So we should be interpreting kind of corporate lending \u00a3100 million a quarter from here and Transaction Banking growing from \u00a3750 million to \u00a3800 million as the hedge benefits come through. I think as alluded to in an earlier question, the structural hedge benefits prospectively are quite medium. And if a lot is coming through that Transaction Banking line, presumably should be expecting that to grow sequentially from here. Is that fair?\nAnna Cross: So let me just correct you slightly. I'm not going to give you a quarterly income number for corporate lending simply because the number of factors in there. But given that we've hopefully seen the stress of leverage lending behind us, then hopefully, it will stabilize from here at least. On the transactional banking side, you've got two things going on there. You've got hopefully potential further growth coming from the expansion in Europe, but also the U.K. franchise. But there is some NIM effect in there. Because although we're well through the deposit migration and Transaction Banking, I'd still expect more to come in corporate. So very sophisticated, actively managing their balance sheet, which is what we've seen and we'd expect it to continue.\nChristopher Cant: Okay, thanks.\nAnna Cross: Okay, thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Edward Firth from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nEdward Firth: Yes, thank you very much. Good morning everybody. Just a question for Venkat, actually. If you think of a question on the profitability of your businesses. BUK is now making around a 20% return. And I guess, if I look at your forecast or your guidance, you're going to expect that to go up from here, so probably mid-20s or even higher. That's I guess double what you're targeting for the group as a whole. And just like that business in recent years, you've been ceding market share in some of your key areas. And I wonder, at what point do you start to think that, actually, that is an area now where we should be putting more capital in and start trying to gain share, particularly in things like credit cards, deposits, that type of stuff. And actually, because it would seem that, that would make logical sense, given you look at the sort of the profitability mix of the business as a whole. So that was the key question. And I guess related to that. I see that, and it maybe be part of the answer. BUK costs were up 9% year-on-year. Is that the sort of cost growth? It's quite punchy. Is there sort of one-off in there? Or should we be expecting that sort of cost growth for the year as a whole? Thanks very much.\nVenkatakrishnan: Thank you very much. So let me begin with the first part of it, and I'll ask Anna to talk a little about cost growth, about costs. So you're right, the profitability of the RoTE of BUK is 20%. We are not making any statement about how that would grow quarter-on-quarter. I think what you're seeing is the impact of, on the one hand, rising interest rates. On the other hand, especially when you look at the mortgage business and the NIM, we've spoken about those dynamics. So you see that all coming together and producing good numbers. I'll make two statements about just our market positioning in BUK. We aim and continue to be a sort of a full-service bank across small businesses, retail, mortgages, credit cards, everything. What you've seen is risk positioning on our side, particularly in credit cards since around Brexit, a little after that, where we have backed off from some of the longer-term balance transfer offers and sort of the two aspects of them. And you're seeing a prudent risk positioning. We will assess that as we assess all risk positioning over time depending on facts and circumstances, how the economy grows, and we will make those changes. So it's not a question of ceding or gaining market share. It's a question of just managing the risk profile of the book. And that's what you should see it as. At the same time, if you look at our Kensington mortgage acquisition from last year, what that is, is about building a capability for issuing mortgages or offering mortgages to people with complex incomes. It's something we felt we needed. And we will build that capability, and that will be part of the [indiscernible] items. I'll turn it to Anna for cost.\nEdward Firth: Sorry, Venkat, could I just come back?\nVenkatakrishnan: Yes, go ahead.\nEdward Firth: Thanks, I mean the credit environment does look very benign. All your forward-looking indicators show no deterioration. And so I'm just wondering at what point do you start thinking, well, this is by far and away my most profitable business? It's time to start competing a little bit and taking some share and seeing if I can grow it. Is it something like -- is this something you review annually? Or is it something you -- I mean, at what point could we start seeing that change, I guess, is what I'm trying to get to grips with?\nVenkatakrishnan: Yes. So we look at a fairly frequently -- frequent basis about our positioning and how much we want to take risk in certain -- in all parts of the U.K. market. So it's not something that happens annually. It happens, frankly, monthly, quarterly through risk committees. And we've been doing it since the start of this year. As I said, you're right that if you look at the trailing credit behavior, it has been fairly benign. And we continue to see what you continue to see in the U.K. consumer is a resilience to the shock of higher energy costs, resilience to the shock of higher mortgage rates and managing the overall inflation. Now we will watch it month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter and we will make our decision. So it's not something that we sort of decide annually and it's put cost in stone at that point. No, we're watching it carefully.\nEdward Firth: Okay, thanks very much.\nAnna Cross: Thanks, Venkat. Let me add one thing, actually, and then I'll go on to cost. The other thing is that as we step back into a market, you don't always see the results immediately. And the example I'd give you is actually our card book. So we stepped back into promotional balances. We're very thoughtful about where we position ourselves. But that sort of balanced transport -- transfer business takes a while to season through and get interest earning lending. So there's a little factor from there. And also the way that we are rebuilding our cards portfolio, we're obviously investing a lot in new products like the product, which is more fee-based and probably a slightly different demographic sector. So there's a lot of activity in there, I would say, for new growth forward as well. Just moving to costs. BUK is in the midst of a transformation. We talked about that a few times. And essentially, what we're doing is we're generating efficiencies, which are absorbing inflation, and then we are also reinvesting them into future transformation. So the kind of thing we're doing is we are obviously changing our physical footprint to your branches but more flex locations with simplifying our product stack with digitizing all of the journeys. So there is some quite heavy investment phases happening in there. That means the cost profile can be a bit lumpy. I wouldn't call out anything specific in Q1, but it's not a steady state is what I'd say. To help you from here, Venkat mentioned Kensington. So you should expect some integration costs from Kensington in Q2. But thereafter, you're going to start to see a cost profile that reflects the transformation starting to come through. So hopefully, that gives you a view of how we expect things to pan out this year and maybe a bit of background on the nature of the cost.\nEdward Firth: Yes, it's great. Thanks very much.\nAnna Cross: Okay. So thank you. So we'll go to our last question, which I think is Andy Coombs from Citi.\nOperator: Yes. Please go ahead, Andrew. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Coombs: Good, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll keep it to one, actually, given I'm the last one. But just on Slide 17, I wanted to focus on the footnote around the financing revenues. So there, you talked about the 25% growth year-on-year was in part due to inflation. In a more normalized environment, you'd expect it to be around 10% growth. Can you just elaborate a bit more on that comment? You previously last quarter talked about the financing revenues being more stable and an example of where you gained market share that you think you can keep, but I was just interested in that comment specifically in the footnote, it sounds like there's an element of one-off nature in Q1 '23. So can you elaborate, please? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thanks, Andy. Okay. Let me help a bit here because this is obviously quite a new disclosure for us. We've done it a couple of times now. But financing right, any of the business is really has impact from balances, from spreads and from seasonality. What we're seeing in Q1 is continued good growth in client balances that reflects the investments that we put down that we talked about today. The spreads do reflect the macroeconomic environment. So for example, in Q1, we saw very conducive spreads in our fixed income financing business, given the rate of volatility. But we actually saw a bit of compression in prime because of the reduction on the equity side. The reason that we called out inflation in particular is that there are some positions within our fixed income financing business that are linked to inflation. And we're calling it out just to be helpful. They're not one-off. But the reason that I'm calling them out is that in a lower inflationary environment, we might expect them to generate less income. So -- and then the final thing I would say, Andy, is just this business is quite seasonal. So it tends to be heavier in the first couple of quarters just because of dividend season and then also tends to sort of be a little bit lower in the second half. Actually, you can see that in the disclosures from some of our peers is given the disclosures for quite a lot loan growth. So hopefully that will help you shape it but it's not a one-off but we are just calling out simply because of its scale in that particular quarter. But underlying that, we're seeing 10% growth, which we think reflects the investment that we've made. And you can see actually even at 10% growth, the real stability in this business, but it's afforded to the markets business in Q1.\nAndrew Coombs: It's helpful, thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thank you. And with that, we will conclude today's call. Thank you very much for joining us for your questions. And I will see some of you the week after next. So thanks very much, and have a great day.\nVenkatakrishnan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. That concludes today's conference call.",

        "speaker": "Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Let me start by saying how pleased I'm with our first quarter's performance for 2023. This was a record quarter of profitability for the bank. We generated 11.3 pence of earnings per share, which is well above the 8.4 pence of EPS in the first quarter of 2022, and our profit before tax of \u00a32.6 billion for this quarter, is up 16% year-on-year. We grew income by 11% or \u00a3741 million year-on-year, to \u00a37.2 billion. This has demonstrated the broad-based and high quality sources of income, which we have across the Group's businesses. Supporting this income momentum, we maintained our focus on costs and our disciplined approach to investment, resulting in a cost to income ratio of 57%. We have delivered a 15% return on tangible equity, with all three of our operating businesses generating a double-digit return. And what this means is that we are very confident of being above 10% for the full-year RoTE, in line with our group target. I'm especially proud that we delivered this strong performance while supporting our customers and clients through what has been a challenging environment for the banking sector globally. As you think about these results, I would like to emphasize three factors, which I think have driven it. The first factor is our risk management approach, developed over a number of quarters and years, which has helped to underpin this performance. The second is a series of disciplined investments over recent years, which have helped to drive top-line growth. And third, our approach to capital management which continues to support attractive shareholder returns. Let me begin first with the risk management. We have highlighted before that we have intentionally positioned the Group's balance sheet to protect against downside risk in a volatile macro-economic and market environment. This risk management has shown itself in different ways. In our Markets business to begin with, we have maintained a defensive risk profile since the start of 2022 and managed our risk well and adroitly throughout. In interest rate risk in our banking book, we have successfully positioned ourselves for rising rates and minimized the capital impacts from the large moves in interest rates which we have experienced. In our credit portfolios, we have maintained robust coverage ratios and limited our risk appetite in specific products and sectors, and added first loss protection to our portfolios where appropriate. Now the U.K., coming to liquidity, has not experienced liquidity concerns that we've witnessed elsewhere in the world. At Barclays, our customer-led liquidity deposit strategy over many, many years has laid the foundation for the highly liquid diverse and stable funding base which we have today. All of these deliberate actions over a long period of time have proven their value in a quarter like this one. We were able to operate normally in a volatile environment, and deliver strong returns to our shareholders. The second big factor is investments. As we turn to investments, you will see that they are behind the income growth that we see in today's results. In our Markets business, our consistent investment in our platform has driven significant growth year-on-year in financing income, including prime, and market share gains over several years. This has contributed to the Corporate & Investment Bank delivering its second highest quarterly income on record, just shy of \u00a34 billion, and a 15.2% return on tangible equity. In our U.S. Cards business, our Gap partnership is performing well and we also grew cards balances organically across our other partner portfolios, while credit continued to normalize in line with our expectations. This growth in U.S. Cards, along with 15% year-on-year AUM growth in our Private Bank, have helped to drive 47% higher income in our Consumer Cards and Payments business with a 10.5% return on tangible equity. Now as we've have mentioned previously, we plan to consolidate our U.K. Wealth business with our Private Bank in this the second quarter of 2023. This will enable us to operate a more efficient, competitive and customer-focused Private Banking and Wealth business from a unified platform. We will update you on this important step in due course. And lastly, turning to our U.K. Consumer business, Barclays U.K. Investment in our transformation program is generating efficiencies, and allowing rates tailwinds to drive strong profitability, while maintaining a cost to income ratio of 56% and generating an RoTE of 20%. Our positive momentum in Barclays U.K. is reflected in the increase in active Barclays app customers, its growing up to 10.7 million users by the end of first quarter of 2023, which is up 8% year-on-year.  In other areas, we are laying the foundation for our future, such as our investments in support of our strategic priority to capture opportunities from the transition to a low carbon economy. In fact this quarter, Barclays helped Nextracker, the leading provider of intelligent, integrated solar tracking and software solutions, raise $730 million through an initial public offering. This was the first major renewable energy IPO since 2021. And the third point is Capital. On Capital, the \u00a3500 million share buyback, which we announced earlier this year, along with other capital items that we have highlighted, have brought our CET1 ratio to 13.6% as expected, around the mid-point of our target range. Our profits delivered 53 basis points of CET1 ratio in the quarter, supporting further capital distributions for our shareholders over the coming year. This remains a key focus for the bank. When we consider our capital allocation, we are carefully balancing capital returns with the disciplined investments about which I just spoke to you, and which are driving improved returns for shareholders. So in summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter for the first quarter of 2023 it's a very strong performance. We generated a 15% RoTE, with double-digit returns across all of our operating businesses. Our risk management and robust liquidity, have helped insulate Barclays from recent events in the industry, and enabled us to continue to support our customers and clients. Our investments are delivering growth and improved returns, and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. With that, thank you for listening, and I'll hand over to Anna to take you through the financials in more detail"

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat, and good morning everyone. Q1 was another quarter of consistent delivery, with a statutory return on tangible equity of 15%. Whilst Q1 is usually strong for returns, as Venkat mentioned, we are confident of achieving our RoTE target of above 10% for the year. The cost income ratio was 57%, better than our guidance of low 60s for the year, reflecting Q1 income seasonality. The loan loss ratio was 52 basis points within our 50 basis points to 60 basis points guidance for 2023. Our highly liquid and stable balance sheet positions us well to pursue our returns objectives, with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%, a conservative loan to deposit ratio, and a liquidity coverage ratio of 163%. Our 15% return reflects income growth of \u00a3741 million year-on-year to \u00a37.2 billion, while total costs were flat at \u00a34.1 billion. Within that, operating costs increased \u00a3523 million, offsetting the decrease in Litigation and Conduct. Profit before impairment was up 31%. As we expected, impairment increased \u00a3383 million, against a low comparator, resulting in a 16% increase in profit before tax overall to \u00a32.6 billion. Earnings per share were 11.3 pence, partially offset by the 5 pence full-year dividend, driving the increase of 6 pence intangible net asset value in the quarter to 301 pence per share. I'm now going to emphasize key drivers of our returns; income, costs and risk management. First, Q1 again demonstrated our broad-based income momentum. We are benefiting from the rate environment, and also seeing the results of our targeted investment initiatives. Second, as we invest, we are maintaining cost discipline, driving cost efficiency to mitigate inflation, whilst directing investment into areas which we expect to generate attractive returns for shareholders. And third, we continue to manage risk tightly, which along with our prudent balance sheet positioning and liquidity management, underpin our delivery against targets in this environment. Starting with income on slide 8. Income increased a 11% year-on-year with growth across the Group, partly from margin expansion, but also from client activity and selective growth in the balance sheet. Barclays U.K. grew 19%, mainly from net interest income. Consumer, Cards & Payments increased 47%, including the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, driven mainly by U.S. cards, and also growth in both Payments and the Private Bank. CIB reported its second best quarter on record with income up \u00a338 million at just under \u00a34 billion, including some benefit from the U.S. dollar strength. We are particularly pleased with the quality and diverse sources of strong income growth, which we'll look at on slide 9. The \u00a3741 million increase mainly reflected growth in net interest income from several businesses across the Group. In Barclays U.K., NII grew \u00a3279 million, reflecting broadly stable balances and a stronger margin. In Consumer Cards & Payments, income growth of \u00a3420 million reflected the significant U.S. Cards balance growth, up 30% and improvement in margin. CIB income was broadly flat despite a reduction of around \u00a3370 million in intermediation income in markets. The financing income in markets increased by around \u00a3160 million to just over \u00a3800 million. This reflects the investment we have made in that area over the last few years, as we mentioned at full-year, and also benefit from inflation. Whilst this revenue stream is relatively more stable, it will be subject to fluctuations and seasonality from quarter-to-quarter, as client demand is impacted by the market environment, where spreads and inflation are expected to moderate. Transaction Banking contributed over \u00a3300 million of growth, mainly net interest income from higher margins, including the structural hedge, plus some year-on-year growth in deposit balances. Transactional activity drove some fee income growth across both the Consumer and Corporate businesses. We've illustrated on Slide 10 why we remain confident about the momentum in net interest income from the roll of the structural hedge. You can see the quarterly build in gross income from the hedge, to \u00a3773 million in Q1. Although swap rates have moderated from Q4, reinvestment rates are still well above the yield of about 1% on hedges, which mature this year. So the build in gross hedge income is expected to continue, and two-thirds of this accrues to BUK. We reduced the size of the hedge marginally again in Q1, reflecting the deposit migration to interest-bearing accounts, particularly in corporate, as expected. In total we have over \u00a350 billion maturing in 2023 and expect to reinvest the majority of that. Turning now to costs on Slide 11. Total costs were broadly flat year-on-year at \u00a34.1 billion, and our Group cost income ratio was 57%. Operating costs, excluding litigation and conduct, which was immaterial this quarter, increased by \u00a30.5 billion. \u00a30.1 billion of this came from FX moves, with around 30% of Group costs in U.S. dollars. Efficiencies generated by previous cost actions broadly offset the effect of inflation to date. The increase also reflected disciplined investment to drive returns, and generate further efficiency savings. The 30% U.S. Cards balance growth, including the Gap acquisition, along with further marketing and partner spend and FX moves, drove the \u00a3170 million increase in Consumer Cards & Payments. The CIB increase of around \u00a3280 million included a \u00a340 million increase in European levies, which are a Q1 event, and FX impacts of c.\u00a360 million. We have also invested selectively in a number of CIB initiatives to support both the income momentum you see in our current performance and to improve resilience and controls. These include technology platform enhancements, to generate income and to deliver better client experience. For example, we have improved our financing platforms, supporting the growth in that area, and e-trading systems, and developed a unified interface for corporate clients. We have also invested selectively in front office talent. In Barclays U.K., our focus is on transformation, as we automate and digitize our customer service models. The efficiency savings we've referenced previously are more than offsetting inflation and helping to fund the continued investment in digitization and product simplification, to improve our service for customers. Turning to the cost outlook. Our cost guidance for the year is unchanged and we continue to target a Group cost income ratio in the low 60s. Litigation and conduct is expected to be lower year-on-year, resulting in some reduction in total costs. To give some color on the expected phasing of costs through the year, we currently expect Q1 to be the high point for Group operating costs in 2023, based on current FX rates, but with different dynamics by business. We expect CIB quarterly operating costs also to be lower than the Q1 level. Moving on to impairment on Slide 12. We haven't changed the baseline macroeconomic variables for modelled impairment from the full-year, but they are more severe than for Q1 last year. Our total impairment allowance at the quarter-end was \u00a36.3 billion, a slight increase from \u00a36.2 billion at full-year, driven by a normalization in customer behavior. At the end of the quarter we retained post model adjustments for economic uncertainty of \u00a30.3 billion. On Slide 13, we've shown key coverage and delinquency metrics for our two largest unsecured books, U.K. and U.S. Cards. U.K. Cards balances have reduced by around 40% since 2019. We continue to see high repayment rates in U.K. cards across the credit spectrum, and arrears rates remain stable and low. The coverage ratio is 7.7% in U.K. cards, slightly up on the year-end, with 21.6% coverage of Stage 2 balances. By contrast we've continued to grow U.S. cards. Delinquency rates have picked up a little, as we continue to see normalization of credit behaviors. However, they remain below pre-pandemic level. As we grow, we are maintaining strong coverage levels, with an increase from 8.1% at year end to 8.9% overall, and higher coverage ratios at Stage 2 and Stage 3. The resulting impairment charge for the quarter was \u00a3524 million, compared to the very low charge of \u00a3141 million last year. This charge translated into a loan loss ratio of 52 basis points, and we are reiterating our guidance of 50 basis points to 60 basis points for 2023, reflecting the expected normalization in credit. The Barclays U.K. charge of \u00a3113 million reflects both the lower level of unsecured lending compared to pre-pandemic and benign credit performance. The bulk of the charge is in Consumer Cards & Payments, and U.S. Cards in particular. This reflects the continuing normalization of delinquencies, plus some seasonality following holiday expenditure. Continuing balance growth with a seasoning effect as balances grow post-pandemic, is also contributing to the increase. This was particularly the case for Gap, where balances were Stage 1 at the point of acquisition; as some balances have migrated to Stage 2, we have seen impairment increase as expected. Turning now to the performance of each business, beginning with Barclays U.K. on Slide 15. Profit before tax increased 27% and return on tangible equity was 20%. Income grew 19% to \u00a32 billion, with costs up 9%, reducing the cost income ratio by a further five percentage points to 56%. Net interest margin was 318 basis points, up 8 basis points on Q4, as we benefitted further from the roll of the structural hedge and the lagged effect from recent base rate rises. These impacts continued to be moderated, as we expected by product margin impacts, notably in mortgages, and also from migration of deposits into higher rate products during the quarter. As we indicated at full-year results, overall we still expect the NIM to build over the year, though more gradually than we saw from Q4 to Q1 and we continue to guide to a Barclays U.K. NIM above 320 basis points for the year as a whole. There were no incremental headwinds from the treasury effects we highlighted in Q4, and we expect a modest reversal of these over the rest of the year, supporting the margin progression. Looking next at Consumer Cards & Payments on slide 16. The return on tangible equity was 10.5%. Income increased 47%, reflecting growth across International Cards, Payments and the Private Bank. U.S. Cards balances grew 30% to $28.5 billion, including $3.3 billion from the acquisition of the Gap book plus organic growth. Total costs were down 3%, reflecting the non-recurrence of the significant litigation and conduct charge last year. Excluding this, operating costs were up 29% reflecting continuing growth across the businesses, and still delivering positive jaws. Overall the cost income ratio improved to 58%. As I discussed earlier, the increase in impairment was in line with our expectations and overall loan loss rate guidance. Looking next at the CIB on Slide 17. Return on tangible equity was 15.2%, while CIB income was broadly flat, against a very strong comparator. Markets had a stand out first quarter in 2022, so income down 8% is a creditable performance, with FICC continuing to perform strongly up 9%. This was offset by equities, reflecting lower volatility compared to prior years, which impacted intermediation income, and derivatives in particular. As I mentioned we continued to see good growth in financing. Investment Banking fees were down 7%, reflecting the lower industry fee pool, although within this advisory fees were up 15%. Our deal pipeline remains strong, and we would expect that to drive improved fee income as rates and market conditions stabilize. As I mentioned earlier, Transaction Banking was another strong performance, up 68% year-on-year to \u00a3786 million. Total costs decreased 2%, reflecting non-recurrence of the significant litigation and conduct charge last Q1. Excluding this, operating costs increased 15%. Overall we're pleased with the continuing development of this franchise. There's a slide in the appendix on the Head Office result, which was a loss before tax of \u00a384 million. Turning now to capital and liquidity on Slide 18. We have consistently maintained strong capital and liquidity levels, as illustrated on this slide. We ended this quarter with a CET1 ratio at 13.6%, which is in the middle of our target range of 13%, 14%. Our liquidity pool ended the quarter at \u00a3333 billion, with a liquidity coverage ratio of 163%, and a net stable funding ratio of 139%, both substantially ahead of the regulatory requirements of 100%. Looking in more detail at capital, as we flagged at the year end, three items reduced the CET1 ratio by around 40 basis points. The reduction in IFRS9 transitional relief, the completion of the Kensington acquisition, and the recently completed \u00a3500 million buyback announced in February. Our capital generation from profits was strong, contributing 53 basis points in the quarter, of which 10 basis points was applied to the dividend accrual. The expected increase in RWAs amounted to 21 basis points, as we invested in opportunities in the Markets businesses, supporting our strong income performance. We ended the quarter at 13.6% and our MDA is now 11.4%; so our target range of 13%, 14% gives comfortable headroom. Looking forward, we expect strong organic capital generation to support increased returns to shareholders and further business growth in line with our three strategic priorities. Recent events in the sector have increased the market's focus on deposit funding. At Barclays, we have grown deposit balances substantially ahead of loan volumes for many years. As shown on Slide 20, we have seen an overall increase in deposits of \u00a310 billion, or 2% this quarter to \u00a3556 billion. This increase has been driven by international term-deposits in treasury. These are mainly from corporates, and reflect the flight to quality in the market. Excluding these, underlying customer deposits across the businesses are down just 1% in the quarter. This is consistent with previous Q1 experience, and is largely as a result of expected seasonal effects, including payment of tax bills in January, and some FX moves. Of total group deposits 41% are insured, with over 70% of U.K. retail, and over 90% of U.S. consumer deposits covered. Our franchise deposit strategy means we have remained highly liquid through the quarter and have a liquidity coverage ratio of 163%, well ahead of the regulatory requirements, and equivalent to a surplus of \u00a3122 billion. The liquidity pool of \u00a3333 billion is held 82% in cash, with the risk in the residual debt securities tightly managed. We have invested in liquidity management over many years and our approach focuses not just on the LCR, but also on a set of internal stress metrics that apply conservative stresses to our balance sheet in multiple scenarios, across various time horizons. So, to recap and summarize the outlook on slide 22. We delivered earnings of 11.3 pence per share in Q1, and generated a 15% return on tangible equity. Whilst Q1 tends to be a seasonally strong quarter for returns, we are confident of achieving our target of above 10% for the year. We have broad-based and high-quality income momentum from the investments we have made in CIB and in growing CCP, while the rate environment and structural hedge also continue to drive income. We will balance this investment with cost efficiency, given inflationary pressures, and we expect the litigation and conduct charges to be lower than in 2022. Whilst we expect operating costs, which exclude litigation and conduct, to be higher year-on-year, we currently expect Q1 to be the high point for quarterly operating costs in 2023, based on current FX rates. The cost income ratio for the quarter was 57%, and we expect to deliver a statutory cost income ratio in the low 60s this year, as we progress towards our target of below 60%. We remain focused on risk management in readiness for potential deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. We expect an increase in the impairment charge this year, as we grow U.S. Cards in particular, and have seen an increase in the charge there in Q1, as expected. We continue to guide to a loan loss ratio in the range of 50 basis points to 60 basis points for the full-year. Our capital ratio remains strong at 13.6%, and we expect to deliver attractive capital returns to shareholders balanced with disciplined investments to drive returns. Thank you. And we will now take your questions, and as usual I would ask that you limit yourself to two per person, so we get a chance to get around to everyone."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Omar Keenan",
        "text": "Good morning everybody. Congratulations on a great set of numbers. I've got two questions. If we look at Barclays' businesses, clearly, there's been a tailwind from higher interest rates. But also, as you mentioned, there has been a market share and investment story over some time, which does imply that structurally, the RoTE potential has improved. However, the RoTE hurdle is unchanged. So I just wanted an updated thinking from you on that RoTE hurdle. Do you think greater than 10% adequately reflects Barclays' cost of equity? And if not, I was just hoping to explore your thinking on what you think the barriers are to giving a more challenging hurdle? And if you think it does need to be fine-tuned, whether you're considering any Investor Days in the future to do that. And my next question is just on capital generation. So historically, Q1 has been the trough for capital generation. Can I just check, it sounds like that's expected to be the case this year. And are there any specific headwinds on capital that you called out? And conceptually, it does seem that the interim buyback has not been larger than the full-year buyback. Is that something that is applied as a rule? Or is there no particular constraints on what interim buyback can be relative to the full-year? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Thanks, Omar. It's Venkat. So let me answer the first question and Anna will take the second one. Look, you're absolutely right that our businesses have delivered strong double-digit returns across the spectrum. And this reflects quality and breadth of performance across the group, which reflects the investments we've made over a number of years. And the 15% RoTE for this first quarter, in my opinion, is a very serious down payment on the target, which is above 10%. So that -- it's above 10% means 10% is a floor. It is not a ceiling. It is not reflecting the extent of our ambition. We -- our view is with this strong start, we are very comfortable and we expect to meet that target of above 10%."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Yes, sure. Omar, you're right. We said that in the past. Typically, it is what we expect that Q1 is a lower point in our capital generation and trajectory for the year just because of seasonality. Obviously, all of that is prior to any distribution or buyback. Equally, we'll come back and consider that buyback when we come back to the half year. That's the cadence that we've established. We don't have hard and fast rules. And we'll look both at our expected capital print at that point in time, but also our expectations of capital generation in the second half when we do so. Thank you. Can we go to the next question, please?"

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, Anna, it's not enormous within the Group context. But I wondered whether we could explore the loan loss charge in Barclays U.K. for Cards. Stage 1 -- sorry, Stage 2 and 3 balances are down. You talked of the higher degree of transactors in the book. Unemployment hasn't risen. So I just wonder whether there was a preemptive component to that charge? Or is this the sort of run rate before the economy starts to sort of noticeably slow at a headline level? And then secondly, perhaps Venkat, for you. I mean, the Barclays implied cost of equity is above 20%. Some firms in that position have decided to not grow the balance sheet at all, the likes of Unicredit and StanChart, for example, and drive perhaps bigger buybacks. I appreciate it's easier to run a bank where revenues are going up and banking is a fixed cost per volume gain. But I just wonder whether you could sort of simply talk about whether the valuation of the bank affect your attitude to growth. Sort of how much would you expect RWAs to expand given the share price and the market environment that we find themselves in? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thanks, Jason. Our impairment charge in the first quarter, both for the Group and for the individual businesses, is as we expected it to be. And what's really driving that charge, Jason, is two things. The first is that the cards book is 40% lower than it was pre-pandemic. So you need to take that into account when you're comparing this to what I would describe as the historic growth rate for BUK. The second thing is that the credit environment and credit behavior is actually benign. So we're seeing very conservative behavior from our customers. They're repaying at extremely high levels. They're managing their volumes very carefully, and you're seeing that come through in a low impairment print. Clearly, as the economy recovers, we might see that rise. But we would also expect to see credit card income rise at the same time because, obviously, those two things are strongly linked, but not a surprise to us. Venkat?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Yes. So Jason, thank you. It's a good question. What I would say when you look at this quarter's results if you see the benefit of the investments, which we've made not just in terms of the profits of the revenues we've produced, but the stability in our metrics of capital. And what you see is that we are running our business for the long-term. And when you run that business for the long-term, you obviously hope that the stock price will ultimately recognize the value of those businesses. And so what we are aiming to do is to create a series of a set of businesses, operate them well, run them efficiently, manage our risks well and produce numbers. Some quarters will be better than others, but we hope we could do this kind of thing very steadily. And then that will be recognized and reflected in the stock price. Capital return is an important part of that strategy, just as investment is an important part of our strategy. And we take our capital return very, very seriously, and we will balance it with the investment needs of an ongoing business that we expect to be successful."

We expected to deploy RWAs into markets in the first quarter, and that's what we've done. So where we see opportunities, we will obviously pursue them, but only in a very disciplined way, very focused on returns to shareholders. Both returns are in RoTE terms, but our ability to distribute capital."

        "text": "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick one. Your Slide 10 on the hedge income is rather interesting because effectively, if you just assume your 375 average Q1 level of swap rates versus the yield, you're looking at somewhere south of about a \u00a37 billion gap. So it's a very big number, considering that the market only expects you to grow your revenues in the U.K. bank by about \u00a3300 million, \u00a325 million on 2023. And I wouldn't have thought that assuming rates -- assuming that number stays flat, right, so theoretical, I wouldn't have thought that mortgage pricing and deposit mix shift would have eaten up the bulk of that. So I just wonder your thoughts there because it seems like there's still an incredible amount of momentum behind the hedge repricing, the obvious caveat of where swap rates go, but we're actually sitting here higher today than 375."

And I think what it highlights is that we have got structural hedge momentum, and we've seen that actually fairly repeatedly over the last few quarters. And you've seen that, particularly in our BUK NIM bridge. And it's one of the reasons that we are calling out that we still expect our BUK NIM to continue to rise in the current environment despite the product dynamics that you call out. And it really underpins the guidance that we've given you already of a greater than 320 NIM. So it's as we expected it to be Joe and fairly consistent over the last few quarters."

I mean congratulations here on a particularly strong performance. I think that's very commendable given the tough prior-year comps that you had. And I was wondering if I could just ask in terms of the trends on the corporate side in particular. So lending was better quarter-on-quarter, which I presume is just primarily fewer marks. And then Transaction Banking was a little bit weaker quarter-on-quarter. So I was just wondering if you could help us understand firstly, what's happened in the first quarter? And then secondly, how we should think about that -- those two revenue lines for the remainder of the year? And then the second was on costs. You mentioned Q1 is the high point for both CIB and group costs. I think particularly about the CIB. Is that particularly relating to the compensation accrual and maybe the SRF contribution in the first quarter? Or is there something around the phasing of either investment spend or cost savings that we should think about as well as the year progresses? And then I guess the conclusion from sort of both of those is strong revenue performance, but jaws in the CIB was still minus 14% in Q1. How should we think about that for the year as a whole? And more broadly, how are you managing that business in terms of costs and revenues?"

        "text": "Okay. Thanks, Rohith. It felt like there were about 10 questions in there, but I'll try and remember them all. So just on the first one on corporate lending. Remember, there are a few things in there. There's corporate lending itself, then there's the cost of our first loss protection, there's a leverage loan mark, and there's also the cost of the hedges against our leverage pipeline. So the quarter-on-quarter movement that you see is really caused by two of those. You're right, it's the marks. So we've taken no material marks this quarter. The second point, though, is if you recall from the full-year, we said that we managed down our leverage loan pipeline. We've continued to do that again in Q1. And therefore, the scale of those hedges, it's smaller and therefore, the costs are smaller. And that's really what's moving that line. On the Transaction Banking side, the reduction in income is coming from a couple of things largely you'll see that the balances are broadly stable. But remember, during the quarter, actually what happens in Transaction Banking typically as we see corporate dividends being paid in the first quarter. So the average balance tends to dip down and then grow towards the back end of the quarter. And also remember, you've got fewer business days within Q1. So you've got 90 business days versus 92, I think. So that has an impact on any kind of banking income. Taking all of that together and going forward, I think we expect our CIB NIM, which we very rarely talk about, to be broadly flat for the year. And the reason I say that is you've obviously got deposit migration going on within Transaction Banking. But we feel like that's very well progressed. And on the other side, you've got actually quite helpful asset mix going on within corporate because in the current environment, there's slightly higher levels of both trade and sales finance, which are slightly higher margins. So overall, that NIM is pretty stable. And with an expanding franchise, we think that's useful for the future. On the CIB cost point, this is largely a seasonality point. So you're right, we accrued compensation costs in line with revenue and returns on the CIB. So you're seeing a higher level there. You're also seeing the SRS, so the European levy, which is a Q1 event, but is higher year-on-year. And in scale terms is about \u00a390 million. And you're seeing a fairly consistent run rate in terms of investment that's underpinning the growth that Venkat said. So that's why we're saying we expect it to sort of tick down from here. We're very focused on returns in that business. You can see that the cost income ratio at 55% is actually better, I think, than the market expected despite that increase in cost. So it's very deliberate on our part. And of course, we start to deliver positive in this business. But at this point in the cycle, we're in an investment phase. But hopefully, that gives you a bit more color."

        "speaker": "Jonathan Pierce",
        "text": "Hello, two questions, please. The first, just on the AT1. You've issued quite a lot of it over the last eight to nine months. And I guess, there's an argument that you prefunded the instrument that's callable in September in the overall stat at nearly \u00a314 billion, I think is higher than you would ordinarily look to run with. So can you talk a little bit about how you feel with regard to AT1 issuance over the rest of the year and whether specifically you can still call that September instrument without refinancing it? The second question is just on this Barclays U.K. NIM. The 21 basis points drop in the quarter due to product margins. I mean, obviously, the hedge keeps on giving something like 13 basis points every quarter. For the next few quarters, sooner or later, the bank rate elements tend to drop away. So thinking about the balance between these two, it would be helpful if you could give me a sense of how much of that 21 basis points is coming from the component part of mortgage refinancings, deposit migration. And I guess in Q1, whereas an element related to the actual losses deposits as well, that would be helpful. Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. I'll take both of those. Yes, you're right. We issued AT1 in the first quarter, two very successful AT1s in the U.K. and actually in Singapore. We typically operate with a surplus of AT1 in our capital stack. We do that deliberately in part to give us flexibility -- in part to give us flexibility around, for example, FX volatility that we might encounter, but also because we deploy it flexibly into our markets business, where despite the fact that the cost of that AT1 is higher than the Tier 2. Obviously, the returns in the markets business are sufficiently high to make that a good economic trade for us. So that's why we typically run with a surplus. We have got a call opportunity later in the year. We assess every call in line with the economic circumstances at that point in time. So we'll be looking at that very carefully as we ordinarily would. So no change there. On the Barclays U.K. NIM, 318 in the quarter, up eight basis points. That is as we expected. And the product migration again is as we expected. And as we were talking about at the full-year, we haven't given a split of that by business, Jonathan. But the larger part of it in mortgages. What's happening there is it's just a portfolio effect of the fact that most mortgages that are maturing this year were written in 2021, where asset margins were wider than they are now. We have seen some deposit migration. That's within our expectations. As you can see, we haven't moved our product hedge on the retail side. So that 21 basis points is not a surprise to us. I'll just remind you that as the year progresses, we expect to see continued hedge momentum. We expect that migration to continue, but we also expect to see some modest treasury tailwinds as we called out at the full-year, and it's really taking all of those pieces together. That means that we are confident in our guidance of greater than 320 for the year."

        "speaker": "Jonathan Pierce",
        "text": "I'm sorry, just a quick follow-on that. Do you think without the treasury movements turning into tailwinds, the U.K. NIM would still manage to creep up. In other words, will this 21 basis points ease, do you think, over the course of the year to a level more consistent with or even below the structural hedge tailwind?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "So I would say, yes, because they are modest treasury tailwinds. We did talked before about expecting more product compression earlier in the year than later. And that's part of the seasonal movement that we see in deposits around Q1. And I'd also encourage you just have a look at the asset margins and how they played out in 2021. That might help you."

        "text": "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one was just on your comment on the Gap portfolio and Stage migration. Could you perhaps elaborate on the dynamics on that book. I would presume the quality of that book is not quite as strong as the rest of your very good quality card portfolio. So can you maybe give us kind of the coverage ratio on that portfolio and how it compares to the rest of the book to help us gauge what stage migration or normalization of these sales might mean for impairments in the coming quarter? And then on costs, thanks for the helpful guidance on Q1 being a high point for the group and for CIB. I presume that struck off a certain revenue assumption. And if you had a really strong revenue performance, you might very understandably not hold yourself to that guidance. So could you share any more details on what those assumptions are that go into the guidance, in particular, anything on revenue or what sort of market backdrop you're assuming on the CIB? And then just one very small point of clarification. On the ESRS, I think you said it was \u00a390 million. Is that the absolute number? So how does that compare to a normal year, if you like? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Guy, why don't I have a go at those. So when you purchase a portfolio, you purchase it at Stage 1. So when we acquired Gap, it was all Stage 1. As Gap has started to season and started to mature and grow, we see some natural migration into Stage 2. That means that customers are starting to borrow more. We've got new customers coming on to the box exactly as we expected. If you use your credit card more than you did previously, you might progress to Stage 2 even though you're showing no signs of delinquency. That's just the way IFRS 9 works. So it's within our expectations. And in terms of sort of coverage of NIM, we don't disclose individual partner ratios, whether that be delinquency or NIM. But what I will tell you is that we manage each partner individually. We manage them on a risk-adjusted return. The Gap is a very good quality portfolio. But it is a retail portfolio, and we typically expect the risk -- the cost of risk to be higher in that type of portfolio than we would in an airline one, but we would also expect the NIM to be higher. So overall, think of this as us managing a risk-adjusted return. So even though impairment might be higher, we'd also expect NIM to be higher. So that hopefully deals with the first question. On the second one, the easy bit is, yes, around \u00a390 million in absolute terms on the IFRS. It doesn't move around a little bit, not quite as mechanistic as the bank levy in the U.K. But that is up year-on-year, which I think we've talked about in the slides. From here on in, we have -- we obviously have an expectation of performance. Let me try and help you with that. We've given you, I think, clear guidance in terms of how we expect costs to move from here. We've also, by inference, given you some income guidance because we've given you a cost-income ratio expectations for the year. So hopefully, that will be somewhat helpful in getting you to the range of income that we expect, albeit at group level. The only other thing I would say is that the guidance we've given is based on the FX rate. It's also based on our current expectations of a normal seasonal profile in CIB revenues and driven very much by the performance costs underpinning that. So hopefully, that's helpful. And next question, please."

        "text": "Hi, good morning. A couple of questions from me. One on, just more a follow-up. On the deposits, it's great to see that you saw sort of deposits up actually, and we've seen quite different reports from some of your peers and overall. Can I just maybe sort of press you to -- you mentioned the flight to quality, but I don't know if you can size that flight to quality like some of the U.S. players have done. And more importantly, going forward, and I'm thinking here in particular in BUK, what would you expect the deposits to do from here? Do you continue to expand to slip or more stability? And the second question is more of a follow-up on the previous question on markets. You mentioned, Anna, that you're kind of expecting a normal seasonality that FICC was very, very strong on a very strong comp. So maybe to give us some comfort or some more color, could you maybe talk us through Q1 if a lot of that was March volatility? Is it more consistent that gives you the confidence for that normal seasonality? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Hi, Alvaro, I'll take the questions. So the first one on deposits. You're right. I mean, we've gone up a little over the quarter, \u00a310 billion. We saw a normal seasonality within the BUK deposit base, which has a very slight shrinkage. And that was due to basically people paying their taxes. The broad point within the U.K. context is that it has not seen the movement across banks that you've seen in the U.S. because there's not been the kind of deposit pressure you've got in the U.S. from some of the very large regional banks having problems. So in the U.S., it's very much a function of that regional bank issue and the movement from regionals to the big money center banks. You don't have that in the U.K. So it's been behaving the way we would expect it to in the first quarter, and we'd expect that same seasonal trend in the second quarter. Where we have seen a bit of inflow is in what we would call our treasury deposits, we've called it out, which are basically corporates around the world placing deposits, stand deposits with us, which is -- it's a nice thing to have. It's a show of confidence. And so that is what's been driving it. And I would say, otherwise, in the U.K. context, think of it as just the normal seasonal slow. Coming back to markets, I'll say two things. As far as the first quarter goes, it was a case of great volatility in fixed income markets both before March and in March, right? So if you remember, in the early part of the year, interest rates started rising. And then there was a big view that actually that things were going to -- that the Fed was going to stop making having interest rate rises after a certain point. And there's a bunch of sort of shall we say, bearish trade on rates and bullish trades on spreads in January. That reversed in March. So you see volatility. But I think the important thing what I would like to say about our FICC franchise is that our market share has continued to grow in that franchise. And as it has in equities over a number of quarters and years based on deepening client relationships, investment in technology, investment in people, right? So I expect as we go forward in the next quarter and the one after that for that market share to be sustained, if not to grow. And we did well in the first quarter of this year. We did -- in the second quarter, I'll also remind you that Q2 of '22 was a very strong point of comparison with the volatility that you had post structure in Europe. I mean, so far, you've not seen that in this quarter."

        "text": "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If I could ask two, please. On the structural hedge, you said in the slide that about two-thirds of the hedge income is coming through in the U.K. But where does the other one-third get booked by business, please? And how much of that will be coming through the Transaction Banking line? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much growth we should expect there. Are you able to guide this all, please, on your expectations for revenues for the corporate lending and Transaction Banking line? I know you don't generally talk about the revenue outlook, but I would hope that those lines might be a little bit forecastable. And I think that was a source of the beat in the quarter versus consensus. So perhaps we're missing something there. And then on the BUK side of things, in terms of the mortgage book, could you give us a sense, please, of where you're writing new business today versus where the average spread on the back book is in terms of what's rolling? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Let me take those, Chris. So the majority of the rest of the structural hedge does appear in Transaction Banking. There's a little bit in the private bank. But as you can imagine, much less given its scale and also given that those are much more interest-sensitive balances. So that's where you see it going. That's in part driving the NIM in the CIB up year-on-year. And then there's another smaller part from assets, which I called out before, from the sales and trade finance side on that. In terms of corporate lending, I called out before, we've seen some movement quarter-on-quarter because we haven't taken marks because the pipeline is much lower., From here, let's see where that goes, but it's certainly much recovered on the prior-quarter. We've given some guidance on this line before, but just remember the other thing that's in there is our SRT costs, so our first loss protection costs. If I take all of that together, actually our corporate income is pretty stable. And the reason I say that is you're seeing a NIM that's stable for reasons that I said before. You're seeing good balance growth coming through. Actually, we've seen some year-on-year corporate lending growth as well. So as an outlook, it's performed. And as you say, a lot more stable than some of the other parts of the CIB. So we're pretty confident in its outlook. I think the other thing I'd just call out is we've obviously seen quite a lot of deposit migration there already. If I contrast the sort of three different deposit franchises we have, we've seen most migration in private banking, as you'd expect, a lot in corporate and probably less in personal. So hopefully, that gives you some guidance there. And in terms of BUK mortgages, we don't talk about specific margins. That's not something we ever disclosed. But if you're looking for the effects of the compression, I would say mortgage margins have been relatively stable, and they're pretty consistent across the market given the very competitive nature of it. And if you were to look back at the spread over swap in '21, then you're going to see that compression effect quite clearly, I think. Hopefully, that's helpful."

        "speaker": "Christopher Cant",

So we should be interpreting kind of corporate lending \u00a3100 million a quarter from here and Transaction Banking growing from \u00a3750 million to \u00a3800 million as the hedge benefits come through. I think as alluded to in an earlier question, the structural hedge benefits prospectively are quite medium. And if a lot is coming through that Transaction Banking line, presumably should be expecting that to grow sequentially from here. Is that fair?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "So let me just correct you slightly. I'm not going to give you a quarterly income number for corporate lending simply because the number of factors in there. But given that we've hopefully seen the stress of leverage lending behind us, then hopefully, it will stabilize from here at least. On the transactional banking side, you've got two things going on there. You've got hopefully potential further growth coming from the expansion in Europe, but also the U.K. franchise. But there is some NIM effect in there. Because although we're well through the deposit migration and Transaction Banking, I'd still expect more to come in corporate. So very sophisticated, actively managing their balance sheet, which is what we've seen and we'd expect it to continue."

        "text": "Yes, thank you very much. Good morning everybody. Just a question for Venkat, actually. If you think of a question on the profitability of your businesses. BUK is now making around a 20% return. And I guess, if I look at your forecast or your guidance, you're going to expect that to go up from here, so probably mid-20s or even higher. That's I guess double what you're targeting for the group as a whole. And just like that business in recent years, you've been ceding market share in some of your key areas. And I wonder, at what point do you start to think that, actually, that is an area now where we should be putting more capital in and start trying to gain share, particularly in things like credit cards, deposits, that type of stuff. And actually, because it would seem that, that would make logical sense, given you look at the sort of the profitability mix of the business as a whole. So that was the key question. And I guess related to that. I see that, and it maybe be part of the answer. BUK costs were up 9% year-on-year. Is that the sort of cost growth? It's quite punchy. Is there sort of one-off in there? Or should we be expecting that sort of cost growth for the year as a whole? Thanks very much."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Thank you very much. So let me begin with the first part of it, and I'll ask Anna to talk a little about cost growth, about costs. So you're right, the profitability of the RoTE of BUK is 20%. We are not making any statement about how that would grow quarter-on-quarter. I think what you're seeing is the impact of, on the one hand, rising interest rates. On the other hand, especially when you look at the mortgage business and the NIM, we've spoken about those dynamics. So you see that all coming together and producing good numbers. I'll make two statements about just our market positioning in BUK. We aim and continue to be a sort of a full-service bank across small businesses, retail, mortgages, credit cards, everything. What you've seen is risk positioning on our side, particularly in credit cards since around Brexit, a little after that, where we have backed off from some of the longer-term balance transfer offers and sort of the two aspects of them. And you're seeing a prudent risk positioning. We will assess that as we assess all risk positioning over time depending on facts and circumstances, how the economy grows, and we will make those changes. So it's not a question of ceding or gaining market share. It's a question of just managing the risk profile of the book. And that's what you should see it as. At the same time, if you look at our Kensington mortgage acquisition from last year, what that is, is about building a capability for issuing mortgages or offering mortgages to people with complex incomes. It's something we felt we needed. And we will build that capability, and that will be part of the [indiscernible] items. I'll turn it to Anna for cost."

So it's not something that happens annually. It happens, frankly, monthly, quarterly through risk committees. And we've been doing it since the start of this year. As I said, you're right that if you look at the trailing credit behavior, it has been fairly benign. And we continue to see what you continue to see in the U.K. consumer is a resilience to the shock of higher energy costs, resilience to the shock of higher mortgage rates and managing the overall inflation. Now we will watch it month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter and we will make our decision. So it's not something that we sort of decide annually and it's put cost in stone at that point. No, we're watching it carefully."

And the example I'd give you is actually our card book. So we stepped back into promotional balances. We're very thoughtful about where we position ourselves. But that sort of balanced transport -- transfer business takes a while to season through and get interest earning lending. So there's a little factor from there. And also the way that we are rebuilding our cards portfolio, we're obviously investing a lot in new products like the product, which is more fee-based and probably a slightly different demographic sector. So there's a lot of activity in there, I would say, for new growth forward as well. Just moving to costs. BUK is in the midst of a transformation. We talked about that a few times. And essentially, what we're doing is we're generating efficiencies, which are absorbing inflation, and then we are also reinvesting them into future transformation. So the kind of thing we're doing is we are obviously changing our physical footprint to your branches but more flex locations with simplifying our product stack with digitizing all of the journeys. So there is some quite heavy investment phases happening in there. That means the cost profile can be a bit lumpy. I wouldn't call out anything specific in Q1, but it's not a steady state is what I'd say. To help you from here, Venkat mentioned Kensington. So you should expect some integration costs from Kensington in Q2. But thereafter, you're going to start to see a cost profile that reflects the transformation starting to come through. So hopefully, that gives you a view of how we expect things to pan out this year and maybe a bit of background on the nature of the cost."

But financing right, any of the business is really has impact from balances, from spreads and from seasonality. What we're seeing in Q1 is continued good growth in client balances that reflects the investments that we put down that we talked about today. The spreads do reflect the macroeconomic environment. So for example, in Q1, we saw very conducive spreads in our fixed income financing business, given the rate of volatility. But we actually saw a bit of compression in prime because of the reduction on the equity side. The reason that we called out inflation in particular is that there are some positions within our fixed income financing business that are linked to inflation. And we're calling it out just to be helpful. They're not one-off. But the reason that I'm calling them out is that in a lower inflationary environment, we might expect them to generate less income. So -- and then the final thing I would say, Andy, is just this business is quite seasonal. So it tends to be heavier in the first couple of quarters just because of dividend season and then also tends to sort of be a little bit lower in the second half. Actually, you can see that in the disclosures from some of our peers is given the disclosures for quite a lot loan growth. So hopefully that will help you shape it but it's not a one-off but we are just calling out simply because of its scale in that particular quarter. But underlying that, we're seeing 10% growth, which we think reflects the investment that we've made. And you can see actually even at 10% growth, the real stability in this business, but it's afforded to the markets business in Q1."

    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome to Barclays Half Year 2023 Results Analyst and Investor Conference Call. I will now hand over to C.S. Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive; and Anna Cross Chief Finance Director.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Good morning. Thank you for joining Anna and me on today's call. Let me start by saying we continue to deliver a consistent strong performance quarter-on-quarter. In particular, our second quarter results show resilience against a mixed macroeconomic backdrop and against the viewed market activity. This performance again demonstrates the stability and strength of the franchise, which we have built over many years. We generated GBP 6.3 billion in income in the second quarter of up '23, up 6% year-on-year, excluding last year's impact from the Over-issuance of securities. This growth reflects the diverse sources of income, which we have built across the group. Our focus on cost discipline delivered a cost-to-income ratio of 63% for this quarter, putting us on track to meet our guidance of low 60s in 2023. Our deliberate and prudent approach to risk management over many years it's providing protection against macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, our credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations. Together, these foundations have generated a profit before tax for the bank of GBP 2 billion in the second quarter, earnings per share of 8.6p and a return on tangible equity of 11.4%. This second quarter performance means that we have delivered for the first half of 2023. And income, which is up 9% year-on-year, again, excluding the over-issuance. And a return on tangible equity for the first half of 13.2%, again, in line with our target of above 10% for the year. Despite the mixed macroeconomic backdrop, we continue to invest thoughtfully where we see opportunities to build competitive advantage and to service our customers and clients more effectively. In Investment Banking, building on our strength in the U.S., we are growing our market share in the U.K. and in Europe, and we have risen to #1 ranking in fee share in the U.K and a #2 position in Germany for the second quarter of 2023 as well as our sixth position globally. While announced volumes have been muted, client consideration of M&A alternatives remains active in anticipation of improved market conditions, and we have been deeply engaged in a full range of risk transfer activity. For example, Barclays was exclusive provider of financing for Ares\u2019's $3.6 billion deal with PacWest Bancorp in the last quarter. We're also seeing continued momentum in financing income within our Markets business and maintain our top tier rankings in businesses such as credit trading. Despite lower client activity in markets and banking across the street, I'm particularly pleased with the growing strength of our client franchise. Over several years, our client-centric markets business has targeted a greater share of flow revenue from our top 100 clients. As a result, our income from these clients is up over 10% for the first half of 2023. In the consumer bank in the U.S., we have built upon the succession of our partnership with GAP and announced a new long-term collaboration with Breeze Airways, an airline startup from a co-founder of JetBlue. We also continued to make good progress in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy. We recently provided approximately GBP 100 million in loans to support Moray West offshore wind farm, a development that is expected to supply up to half of the electricity for Scotland.  And recently, we extended our popular Greener Home Rewards Scheme in the U.K. to help support more of our mortgage customers with financing energy efficiency improvements to their houses. As I have said in the past, shareholder distributions are a key focus for the bank. Our reported CET1 ratio at 30th of June was 13.8%, up 20 basis points from the first quarter and solidly within our target of 13% to 14% and for the bank. Core to this is our consistently strong balance sheet and the capital generation capacity of our franchise. We are therefore announcing an increased capital return to shareholders with a 20% growth in our half year dividend to 2.7p per share. We are also pleased to announce a share buyback of; GBP 750 million which is an increase on the GBP 500 million we announced at year-end and completed in the first half. Over the past 12 months, our combined dividends and buybacks, including those announced today represent a yield of about 10% at current share price levels. And our buyback programs have in aggregate reduced our share count of shares in issue by over 10% since 2020. And so to reiterate, capital and shareholder distributions are a key focus for us going forward.  As we have described for more than 18 months now, inflation and higher interest rates in developed economies, have changed both client and customer behavior. We have continued to position Barclays accordingly, and that is driving the consistency and stability in our results. I will briefly describe our approach and Anna will elaborate on these points shortly. First, we have taken a prudent approach to credit risk management and to our balance sheet, maintaining strong capital and liquidity metrics over the long term. In particular, we continue to balance carefully our credit exposure with the provision of lending and liquidity. Our customers are cautious, but they remain resilient. We have provided incremental and tailored support while also ensuring that it is simple and convenient for them to access the right product to meet their needs. We understand the impact of inflation and high interest rates on our customers, and we want to help them. For our U.K. mortgage customers, we are providing options to switch to interest-only mortgages for 6 months or extensions of their mortgage term where appropriate. We are also enabling customers approaching the end of a fixed rate mortgage deal to lock in a new rate up to 6 months in advance. Of those customers who have made their mortgage rate switch application directly to us, over 1/3 have done so using the Barclays app. On the savings side, we provide a range of instant access and fixed savings products, which allow our customers to select the right rates for their savings goals. For those customers who rely on instant access to savings, we recently increased the rate on our everyday saver by 50 basis points. In addition, since its launched in September last year, our Rainy-Day Saver account, which pays 5% up to GBP 5,000 has proven popular with customers. Over 435,000 accounts have been opened as of the end of June this year, of which 95% were opened digitally. We also regularly conduct outreach to highlight where a better savings product might be available to customers, and we have seen some significant shifts in behavior as a consequence. As interest rates rise, our customers become increasingly sensitive to their impact. And as a result, we have issued further guidance on our Barclays U.K. net interest margin, which Anna will address shortly. Finally, we have also continued to exercise cost discipline against this backdrop by capturing efficiency savings to manage inflation and by being thoughtful and careful about how we invest in our businesses. Anna will cover costs in more detail, but suffice to say that we have delivered on our cost guidance this quarter and remain committed to driving a lower cost-to-income ratio over time. So in summary, we remain very confident of meeting our targets for the full year. Our targets are anchored on a greater than 10% return on tangible equity. I reiterate that this remains a floor and not the extent of our ambition. We are managing the bank well and generating a consistently strong statutory performance across the range of different economic scenarios and market scenarios which we have been experiencing. This quarter represents another important step towards demonstrating value for our shareholders. We have increased shareholder distributions and remain committed to doing so going forward. And we do this while continuing to support our customers and our clients. With that, thank you for listening. I'll hand over now to Anna to take you through the financials in more detail.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. Starting with performance highlights on Slide 7. Our return on tangible equity for the quarter was 11.4%, broadly in line with Q2 last year, resulting in a 13.2% return for the first half. This is in line with our expectations, and we are very confident of achieving our RoTE target of above 10% for the year. This takes into account business trends and income and our latest view on impairment, I'll come back to each of these. We guided to cost in Q2 being lower than Q1 and have delivered. The cost/income ratio was 63% for the quarter and 60% for the half, and we continue to guide to low 60s for the full year. Although we are still guiding to a loan loss rate of 50 to 60 bps for the full year, we continue to see limited signs of stress across our portfolios. And this quarter, the loan loss rate was 37 bps. This reflects the prudent positioning of our balance sheet, as Venkat mentioned, and we believe our risk management discipline will limit credit risk downside for us if the global economy slows. Our liquid and stable balance sheet positions us well to pursue our returns objectives and return capital to shareholders. Accordingly, we are paying a half year dividend of 2.7p and have announced a further buyback of GBP 750 million to start immediately, which is a total return of 7.5p per share for the first half. There was no effect this quarter from the over-issuance of securities, which did impact litigation and conduct costs and income for Q2 last year. To provide a more meaningful comparison, we have excluded these impacts from the comparators in this presentation. On this base, income was up 6% on a strong Q2 last year, whilst operating costs, which exclude litigation and conduct, were also up 6%. Litigation and conduct was GBP 33 million this quarter, and profit before impairment was up 12%. The impairment charge increased to GBP 372 million against a low comparator and in line with our expectations, resulting in profit before tax increasing to GBP 2 billion and earnings per share to 8.6p. The tangible net asset value accretion from earnings was more than offset by negative reserve movements, mainly reflecting further rate rises, reducing TNAV by 10 in the quarter to 291 per share. I'm now going to cover the key drivers of our returns, income, costs and risk management, starting with income on Slide 9. Total income increased 6% or around GBP 335 million year-on-year, reflecting our diverse sources of income. Barclays U.K. income grew 14% with tailwinds from higher rates year-on-year and from the structural hedge, partially offset by lower product margins. Consumer, cards and payments increased 18%, driven mainly by U.S. card balances. CIB was down 3% year-on-year at GBP 3.2 billion. The strength in corporate lending and transaction banking income and stability in financing income in markets partially offset the impact of market conditions, which were less favorable for intermediation income and for deal flow in banking. So we benefited, again, from our diverse business model within the CIB. Looking at the group as a whole, if you compare our revenue in this quarter with 4 years ago, you can see that we have grown income by around GBP 400 million in both the CIB and across our consumer businesses. Turning now to costs on Slide 10. Total costs were GBP 4 billion, up 2% year-on-year. Our cost/income ratio improved from 65% in Q2 last year to 63%, an increase of 57% at Q1 as we expected, and this is factored into our unchanged low 60s guidance for the full year. We delivered lower operating costs in Q2 versus Q1 at both the Group level and in CIB, in line with our guidance, and we continue to expect Q1 to be the high point for quarterly operating costs this year, again for Group and CIB. We are focused on capturing cost efficiencies across the group. For example, in Barclays U.K., we are investing in transformation to improve service for our customers by automating, digitizing and simplifying our offering, whilst also driving a lower cost income ratio over time. CC&P operating costs were up GBP 96 million year-on-year, reflecting growth in our U.S. Card portfolio, including the acquisition of Gap towards the end of Q2 last year and the U.K. wealth transfer from BUK during the quarter. And CIB operating costs were up GBP 114 million year-on-year as we continue to invest selectively in our clients' franchise through technology enhancements in talent and in improved resilience and controls. Moving on to credit on Slide 11. We have maintained our long-standing prudent approach to provisioning and continue to hold strong coverage levels. Our impairment allowance at the quarter end was GBP 6.1 billion, a slight decrease from GBP 6.3 billion at Q1. We updated the baseline macroeconomic variables for modeled impairment from the full year, notably with some reduction in forecast unemployment in the U.K. and U.S. However, these remain more severe than the forecast used at Q2 last year. And at the end of the quarter, we retained post-model adjustments for economic uncertainty of GBP 0.3 billion. Our guidance for a loan loss rate in the 50 bps to 60 bps range allows for some potential credit deterioration and seasonal effects. The GBP 372 million charge translated into a loan loss rate of 37 bps. Looking in more detail by business on Slide 12, the Barclays U.K. charge of GBP 95 million reflects the lower balances and a lower risk book of unsecured lending compared to before the pandemic as well as our prudent positioning in mortgage lending. There is some increase in the provision against mortgages, and I'll come back to why we remain comfortable with our credit risk here despite the significant rise in interest rates. As expected, the majority of the charge is again in Consumer Cards and Payments and U.S. Cards in particular. It reflects the normalization of delinquencies with a seasoning effect as balances grow, and this includes the Gap acquisition, which is performing as we expected. The next three slides illustrate why we are confident in our provisioning and our prudent approach to risk. On Slide 13, we've shown key coverage and delinquency metrics for our two largest unsecured books, U.K. and U.S. Cards. Repayment rates in U.K. cards remain high across the credit spectrum and arrears rates remained stable and very low by historical standards. Overall, we are confident that the credit quality of our U.K. card book has improved since 2019. We've continued to grow U.S. cards in an appropriate and controlled way that is consistent with the opportunities we see there. As we expected, delinquencies at all FICO levels have been increasing, but our risk mix has improved with our average FICO for the book strengthening slightly since the end of 2019 to over 750, and this includes Gap. In addition, the proportion of the book better than a FICO of 660 is now 89% compared to 86% at the end of 2019. As we grow, we maintained strong coverage levels across both U.K. and U.S. cards, notably, Stage 2 coverage of around 18% and 33%, respectively. Moving on to the mortgage book on Slide 14. There are a number of factors that contribute to our comfort in the higher rate environment. First, we have applied strict affordability tests since 2013, using rates above current levels. Second, looking at the profile for refinancing, the proportion of the book on 5-year and over initial fixed rates has increased materially since 2019 from 33% to 51%. This shift delays a potential increase in rates for many borrowers, allowing them more time to mitigate the impact. Fixed rate maturities in half 2 totaled GBP 17 billion. And as you can see from the chart, a significant proportion of these borrowers have locked in rates ahead of the end of their fixed rate terms. So our mortgage customers are taking thoughtful and appropriate actions. Third, and as a credit backstop, the book is conservatively positioned from a collateral point of view with balanced weighted loan-to-value of 52.8%. Only 2% of mortgages, which are refinancing over the next 2 years have LTVs in excess of 85%. Given the market-wide focus on commercial real estate, we also wanted to share more detail on the portfolio to highlight our position. As we have followed a prudent lending policy here for over 30 years, this is not an area of concern for Barclays. As you can see on Slide 15, commercial real estate as a proportion of our customer loan book is around GBP 17 billion or just under 5%, which is below the industry average. It is diversified across segments and the weighted loan-to-value of 49% provides significant headroom for a potential stress in prices. No individual segment has an LTV of higher than 58%. We know the office component has received particular attention and this is just GBP 1.9 billion. Turning now to the performance of each business in the quarter, beginning with Barclays U.K. on Slide 16. Profit before tax increased 25% and the return on tangible equity was just over 20%. Income grew 14% to GBP 2 billion, with costs down 1%, improving the cost/income ratio by 9 percentage points year-on-year to 55%. We expect to improve this further as the benefits from our transformation program feeds through. The net interest margin was 322 bps, up 4 bps on Q1, in line with our expectations, and this would have been 2 bps higher without the transfer of U.K. wealth to consumer cards and payments. The moving parts are set out in the bridge on the slide. We benefited from the steady roll of the structural hedge, which again added 13 bps as in each of the last few quarters and from some lagged effect from previous bank rate rises. There was also a 6 bps increase from the reversal of some of the treasury headwinds, which we called out at full year. These positive impacts were moderated by both mortgages margins and the developing deposit dynamics. On the next slide, I'll cover how we see NIM evolving from here. Our customers are cautious and resilient, and we see benefits in our credit performance, but this also affects our income outlook. Three recent macroeconomic developments, have prompted customers to change their behavior and us to revise product pricing. First, inflation is expected to be more persistent; second, base rates are forecast to peak at higher levels; and third, swap rates increased further during Q2, increasing mortgage pricing. In this environment, our customers are behaving rationally and have started to use surplus deposit balances to manage their finances more actively. For instance, business banking customers are drawing down on deposit balances for use in their businesses and to pay down debt. In Personal Banking, over 1/4 of our customers with mortgages have been making excess repayments, reducing their loans ahead of potential remortgaging. And throughout the book, customers are seeking higher yields for their savings and we have changed our pricing in response. Accordingly, we now expect the BUK NIM to be below 320 bps for full year 2023. Our current view is around 315 bps, which reflects our expectation for customers to hold lower deposit balances, changes in deposit pricing, and the 2 basis points impact from the transfer of U.K. wealth. Of course, the precise outcome will be sensitive to a number of inputs notably the level and mix of deposits and other macroeconomic factors, including inflation and rates. At the same time, the high swap rates are providing a tailwind to future years from the structural hedge as we lock in fixed receipts at meaningfully higher rates, which I'll cover on the next slide. Slide 18 illustrates the importance of the hedge to the level and visibility of our future net interest income. Swap rates increased sharply during Q2 to around 5%, and reinvestment rates are materially above the yield of 1% on hedges maturing this year. As a result, gross hedge income is increasing and over 90% of the GBP 3.6 billion expected for this year was already locked in by the half year. We have a further GBP 50 billion to GBP 60 billion, maturing in each of 2024 and '25, at yields between 1% and 2%. The precise level of reinvestment will depend to an extent on customer behavior, but the building effect of the hedge roll gives us confidence that gross income from the hedge will grow strongly in 2024 and 2025. I would remind you that around 2/3 of the benefit is in BUK, where the hedge has contributed 13 bps of incremental NIM in each of the last few quarters. Looking next at Consumer Cards and Payments on Slide 19. The return on tangible equity was 11.8%. Income increased GBP 195 million or 18%, reflecting growth mainly in international cards and the transfer of U.K. Wealth. Period-end U.S. card balances grew organically by 12% to $29.5 billion and average balances were up 27% year-on-year as the GAP acquisition was completed late in Q2 last year. We delivered positive operating jaws despite operating costs, which exclude L&C being up 14%, reflecting continuing growth across the businesses. Both income and costs included around GBP 35 million from the transfer of U.K. Wealth. As I discussed earlier, the increase in impairment was in line with our expectations. We've included a summary in the appendix on the wealth transfer. The combination with the private bank creates the top 5 U.K. wealth management business, and we believe we can develop the business more effectively as a single entity. Looking next at the CIB on Slide 20. Return on tangible equity was 10%, while income was down 3%, a resilient performance against a very strong prior year comparator reflecting our diversification within the CIB. Corporate lending and transaction banking increased strongly year-on-year to over GBP 900 million. Markets, which was down 20%, reflected lower market volatility impacting intermediation income, but there was some offset from financing income, which grew 9%. As I mentioned last quarter, we are benefiting from the effects of higher inflation and financing. Investment banking fees were down 15%, reflecting a lower industry fee pool. Cost decreased 2%, but operating costs, which exclude all litigation and conduct, increased 6%. As I mentioned earlier, this reflected selective investment in our client franchise. Turning now to capital and liquidity. As you can see on Slide 21, we continue to maintain strong capital funding and liquidity. Looking in more detail, beginning with capital. Our capital generation profits was again strong, contributing 39 bps in the quarter, of which 8 bps was applied to the increased dividend accrual. Taking into account the GBP 750 million buyback we have announced our CET1 ratio would be 13.6% and in our target range of 13% to 14%. Our MDA has increased in July from 11.4% to 11.8%, and we remain comfortable with our target range. Looking forward, we expect strong organic capital generation supporting attractive returns to shareholders. We have grown deposits substantially ahead of loan volumes for many years and have a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 72%. As shown on Slide 23, we have seen a stable level of deposits overall this quarter at GBP 555 billion. This reflects an increase in international deposits and treasury offset by some decline in retail and business banking deposits, in line with the market trends we discussed earlier. We are comfortable with the stability of the group's overall deposit funding base and our diversified sources of deposit funding. Our franchise deposit strategy means we remain highly liquid, based on both our internal stress framework and our liquidity coverage ratio well ahead of the regulatory requirements. The liquidity pool of GBP 331 billion is held 80% in cash with the risk in the residual debt securities tightly managed. So to recap and summarize the outlook on Slide 25. We delivered earnings of 8.6p per share in Q2 and generated an 11.4% return on tangible equity and are very confident of achieving our target of above 10% for the year, underpinned by our diversified sources of earnings. The cost/income ratio for the quarter was 63%, and we expect to deliver a statutory ratio in the low 60s this year. We remain focused on risk management. And while we expect an increase in impairment year-on-year as we grow U.S. cards in particular, we are confident of delivering a loan loss rates within our guidance range of 50 bps to 60 bps for the full year. Our capital ratio remained strong at 13.8%, and we expect to deliver attractive capital returns to shareholders followed with selective investments to drive profitability. Thank you, and we will now take your questions. And as usual, I would ask that you limit yourself to two per person so we get a chance to get around to everyone.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Joseph Dickerson from Jefferies.\nJoseph Dickerson: I just had a question, firstly, on rate sensitivity because I can't find any tables or disclosure in today's releases. I guess are you now approaching as regards base rates, a position whereby the bank is liability sensitive? Or how should we think about rate sensitivity going forward? And then secondly, can you discuss your strategy with some of the European consumer businesses, such as the German consumer business, I think there have been some press headlines about the disposal of that business. That would actually have a relatively significant contribution to capital present really gain on it, not game changing, but certainly would free up another, call it, GBP 750 million or GBP 1 billion of capital, if you were disposed of it. So I guess how are you thinking about those peripheral consumer businesses that you still have?\nAnna Cross: Thanks for your questions. so I'll cover the first one and then hand across to Venkat. So you're exactly right. What we are saying is that given where base rates have now got to, we expect further rate rises from here would have no impact on our net interest margin if that might be even slightly negative. And that's simply because, as we've said for some time, the higher rates go, the higher the pass-through will be. Don't forget though that this higher rate environment also impacts the yield curve, and we are seeing that benefit come through and get locked into on our structural hedge. Venkat, do you want to take the second question?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes. Thank you, Anna. So Joe, yes, we are looking to sell the German credit card business. It's a nice business, but it's not really been -- it's not really core to our overall consumer footprint. There will be a modest RWA release when that happens. But it is small in the context of the bank. I mean, it's something, but it's small. Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Napier from UBS.\nJason Napier: Just to start off with, I guess, first one, a lot of the investors that I talked to would like to see Barclays we care about the sort of risk-weighted asset growth that it envisages for the CIB, like many of them would like to see no growth in that division at all or perhaps some kind of constraint around the share it represents in the group. I just wanted your views on that desire. And then secondly, just looking at Barclays U.K., the division has a better income to loan tally than almost anyone else in the sector, but it's cost-to-income ratio is 10% above Lloyd's and 13% above NatWest. You must have done loads of sort of internal work in the past. Can you talk about what it is about the cost structure of that business that makes it so much less efficient than the major peers that we look at?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Jason, I'll take the first one, and I'll talk a second one Barclays U.K. to Anna. So on the first one, I think I have been pretty clear that when we look strategically at the investment bank, it's been a great success. It has been 5 years ago, the question that was asked of us was should you have one. And If you had one, would it be any good? And I think we've shown that it's important for us to have one. It's a great diversifying business, and we're pretty good at it. We are the top-ranked European investment bank, so in markets penetrating. However, I also recognized that at approximately 60% to 70% of the bank, it is much more important now to grow the bank that's outside of the investment bank and to get a better balance overall in due course. Now having said that, within the investment bank, there are some relatively attractive RoTE businesses, such as financing and prime. And we have been within the investment bank investing a lot in those. So the real -- when you get to the heart of your question, it's something, of course, we would agree with, which is to increase our RoTE and to increase the proportion that fee-based and relatively capital-light businesses play in our entire product mix.\nAnna Cross: Yes, we've thought a lot about this. And I'd put it down to a couple of factors. The first risk appetite does play a role here. So -- and that is both around liquidity and credit risk appetite. So you'll know that Barclays U.K. has a lower loan-to-deposit ratio than some of its peers. And we've managed our credit extremely carefully within Barclays U.K. as we do obviously, across the group. And it's part of the group risk appetite that we focus on, obviously, we've got global opportunities to place risk and many varieties of it. So I think risk is a large part in the way we manage that risk. But of course, it's also about the cost base, which is what the transformation in Barclays U.K. is about. So we're extremely focused on cost and efficiency, and we are working extremely hard on our physical and digital footprint and the benefits that, that gives to our customers. So what you see at the moment is us reinvesting the benefits of that transformation to make it go faster. But over time, we would expect to see the cost-income ratio of the business to trend diverse. Hopefully, that gives you some clarity about how we think about it. So next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Pierce from Numis.\nJonathan Pierce: I've got two. The first is on the hedge. Thanks for the extra disclosure on the hedge maturities in 2024, 2025, particularly the scale of them. But I wondered if you could be a bit more precise on the yields that these things are coming off because you've got GBP 100 billion to GBP 120 billion in maturities over those 2 years makes a big difference if the average yield on the maturities of 1% versus 2%. The range could be as wide a GBP 1 billion or so. I'm also just a supplementary to that, wondering where all the hedges that were written in 2020 when the 5-year swap rate was close to 0. Where are those -- when are those coming off? And I thought there'd be a bunch of those in 2025. The second question is a more broader one on distributions. In particular, going forward, the sort of split of the free capital generation that goes towards dividends versus buybacks. I mean we can all understand you want to do a lot of buybacks over the next few years at this rating. The consensus dividend payout ratio is about 27%, I think, over the next 2 or 3 years. And as an argument, I suppose, the payout ratio could be a bit higher than that. I mean ultimately, cash in pocket today is just as important as enhanced cash and pocket in a few years' time. So thoughts around the distribution split between dividends and buybacks moving forward would be great so...\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. Just picking up the first one, I'm glad you like the slide. So we're talking about Slide 18 here. What that shows is that we've seen a strong pickup in yield from FY'22 to '23. So our income has gone from GBP 2.2 billion to an expected GBP 3.6 billion this year. And your question is really, how that flows from here? Difficult to be completely precise about the maturing yield because it does impact on how much we roll into your calculation. But what I would say is that it's probably at the lower end of the range for 2024 and in the range for 2025. Typically, these are about 5 year swaps. So you're going to see the benefits coming through of 2020 vintage sort of from '25. On your broader question, the way we think about it is we want a progressive dividend, which is why you've seen us grow the dividend at the half year, year-on-year. So that's up by 20% year-on-year. And that's really -- that should demonstrate to you our confident in our ability to distribute capital consistently from here, but we want to be able to supplement that from time to time with a buyback, as you said, particularly given where the valuation of the bank is right now. And so at this point in time, we together these to around GBP 1.2 billion of distribution at the half year, which is 5% of our current market cap. So hopefully, that will underline to you our commitment to return capital to shareholders in dividend and in buyback.\nJonathan Pierce: Okay. That's helpful. So just quickly come back on the hedge point. In 2025, it sounds like you're saying the average yield to maybe around the midpoint, about 1% to 2% range. If you've been bar the stuff that was put on during the pandemic, which was obviously fair that if you've been putting a hedge on typically at 5 years rolling, why is the yield on the stuff coming off in 2025 at that level when the 5-year swap rate was pretty close to 0 in 2025...\nAnna Cross: There is a blend in, Jonathan. We can take you through it in a bit more detail. So there will be a large part of the 2020 vintage, but they're not all 5 years. So we can take it through to it with you in a bit more detail at the start of year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Guy Stebbings from BNP Paribas.\nGuy Stebbings: The first one is just on deposits. In BUK, I think they felt about GBP 4 billion or GBP 5 billion in the quarter, presumably that includes some outflows in current accounts and interest-bearing site accounts and the inflows into time so perhaps you could help us understand those moves in terms of the mix of deposits, either at Box U.K. or at group level. And then as we look forward, it sounds like you expect that had been to persist at maybe current levels, whereas one of your peers noted the experience thus far in Q3 was maybe a little bit better than May or June and thought that less base rate movement less prompts for customers to move money. So I just wonder if you share those sort of news or not, it sounds like maybe you're embedding slightly more conservative there. And then on the CIB, I guess we've become quite accustomed to top line beats and market share gains, the market for quite a while. This quarter was a little bit soft. I just wondered if you had anything into that, and you need to change or pivot mindful you've got a strategy review in the background? Or do you just largely for down to 1 quarter, and there will always be a degree of [indiscernible] and perhaps you've been seeing some green shoots from here.\nAnna Cross: So we don't disclose the split of our deposits. But when we look at our peers who've reported thus far, the trends that we've experienced don't look markedly different. And actually, what we're saying at this point in time is the migration behavior is broadly as we expected it to be. What we're seeing is that customers are holding a lower level of deposits and they're doing that for very positive and proactive reasons.  We think that the approach for that behavior is 3 things: Firstly, rates have risen beyond the level that any of us expected. Secondly, inflation is much higher and more persistent than we expected; and thirdly, mortgage rates are obviously higher than they have been at any point other than a brief period in the third quarter of last year. So our customers are sensitive to these higher levels of interest rates, but not actually in the way that consensus is assuming, it's manifesting itself and then using their deposits proactively to manage their financial position, and we're seeing the benefit of that in our impairment. So we said in the scripted comments that over 1/4 of our customers are using that excess deposits to pay down their mortgages in advance of a fixed rate change. We think that's the right thing for them to do. And whilst it will impact on income, it's also going to impact our impairment. Because those 3 factors of rates, inflation and indeed mortgage rates we expect to persist, we also expect this deposit behavior to persist into the third quarter. And really, that underpins much of the guidance that we've given you around the forward path for BUK [indiscernible] from here. Hopefully, that gives you some clarity on how we are thinking about it. Venkat, do you want to pick up the second?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: On the CIB, I would very much view this as -- and I'll explain to you how since the quarter, where in the quarter, both in fixed income, equities and in banking, we've been in the middle of [indiscernible], right? So our performance is consistent with that of the U.S. peers. We are very much in the middle of the [indiscernible]. And there's a little bit of a stylistic story in it. If you look at fixed income, where we're off just a little more. We had an excellent quarter in the second quarter of 2022. We also -- this was a quarter in which securitized products, which is an area of growth for us has done very well. So banks with big securitized products businesses did better than those without. And equities volatility was a little bit more muted, and we have a very derivatives heavy business. And banking has been fine. As I said in my remarks a few minutes ago, ranking share increase in the U.K. and Germany continue to maintain our global ranking. So I think if I take a slightly longer-term view, we continue to aim to gain market share with our biggest client, which is a specific objective of ours. We continue to do well within markets and in banking. And then the last thing I want to point out in terms of the diversification of the business and referring to the question that was asked earlier, I think from Jason about the CIB. If you look our transaction banking numbers and our corporate banking overall has been doing extremely well. So that part of the business, which is in part related to transaction volume, in part related to interest rates, but it's also in part related to just play good old fee income has been doing very well. So net-net, you put it all together, that's what leads to a CIB with double-digit ROTE and a continued accumulation and holding of market share.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley.\nAlvaro Serrano: I guess I've got a couple of really follow-up questions. Anna, you mentioned, I think, just now around the -- it's really the deposit balances that are driving the structural heads down and the margin guidance down in the U.K., you've reduced around GBP 4 billion. And is that the run rate of reduction in deposits we -- that you might expect for the next few quarters that we should expect for the next few quarters? And I guess, more than related to the level of rates is obviously a level rates, but I guess clients are focusing on their rollover of mortgages, so it could last a bit longer than just with rate movements when base rate moves. Is that a fair observation, the GBP 4 billion run rate and it's more to do with the level of rates and then the movement of rates? And then the second question, also a follow-up on the strategic review and Venkat, some of the points you've made during the call of growing sort of balancing the business a bit more outside the investment bank. Obviously, the obvious part of the business to grow is U.S. cards, given I'm not sure there's a lot of room in the U.K. When I think about it, that's quite a capital-intensive business and there are some global peers that are pulling back actually from growing cards and payments. Is that the idea to deploy more capital become bigger in the U.S.? Or is it also an option of taking capital outside the investment bank to distribute? Is that another way of balancing the business?\nAnna Cross: So the disclosure that we've given you on the structural hedge is actually for the group as a whole. We've included it in that Barclays U.K. section just because of the impact and the link it has to Barclays U.K. NIM. But that reduction in the hedge that you're seeing quarter-on-quarter actually relates to our corporate business as it has done in prior quarters. And really, what we're doing there is I think we've described before the way we build the hedge we identify the rate insensitive balances and then we maintain a buffer and it's -- we maintain a buffer when we put the hedge together. What we're doing in corporate is we are very conservatively maintaining that platform in the current environment. Again, I think we've spoken before about the fact that our corporate businesses or our corporate clients were really very proactive in moving their deposits and really it's a continuation of that previous story. Today, we haven't actually changed the role of our hedge within the retail book. Of course, we are very focused on that every single month. But I'd just remind you that because of the way that we roll this hedge very mechanically, we have the opportunity every month to reassess it and pause or reduce the size of the roll. So we've got plenty of room and plenty of time to adjust it. But to date, in retail, we have not had the need to do that. And secondly, the pickup in this hedge in '24 and '25, we would expect to be pretty strong, simply given the amount that we got maturing indeed the yield on that maturing level. So that will impact the U.K. will also impact the broader bank, but that's what you should read from Page 18 as opposed to any specific concern about the level of BUK deposits. Venkat, do you want to pick up the second point?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes, Alvaro, thanks for the question. So I think 1 way to look at is CIB, non-CIB the way I prefer to look at it is to continue to improve -- to increase the amount we have of fee-paying relatively capital light businesses. There are a couple that exist within the CIB. As I've mentioned to you, transaction banking is one of them. Our financing business is one of them, but there are many outside the CIB. And as far as -- and you should therefore look for us to continue to put an emphasis on fee-paying relatively capital light businesses. I think we would like to grow cards, but I would actually also like to increase the capital efficiency in our cards business and that's something we're spending some time on. So it's not just growing at current RWA density, but growing in a more efficient way. And that's an important feature. So net-net-net, look for us to be increasing more fee-paying businesses and relatively capital light.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Cant from Autonomous.\nChristopher Cant: You talked quite a lot about investment J curves in the CC&P segment over the last couple of years, but it feels like the revenue engine stalled a little bit there in the second quarter. Could you talk a bit more about what's going on? Why the revenues came under some pressure there? And I guess, echoing an earlier question in terms of some of the investor sentiments around some of the strategic headlines we've seen in the last couple of months. If you are wanting to invest outside of the CIB in [indiscernible] some of those CC&P segments, would you consider providing a bit more visibility? It's a slightly odd division. There's quite a lot in there. And we don't really see the economics of the different bits of that business. I know you gave us the revenues, but obviously, we don't see the rest of the P&L. If that's something you would consider to make investors a bit more comfortable with some of the growth aspirations? I had one follow-up, please, to Guy's question. In terms of deposit trends, obviously, you've given us this revised NIM guidance. Have you seen an acceleration in turning out behavior in June, July, please, specifically just in response to the large hiring swap rates. You've referenced various drivers of the change in the NIM guide, but I'm particularly keen to understand what you're seeing with respect to turning out? And I guess that feeds then into the quantum of hedge maturities, you will be able to reinvest looking into '24, '25.\nAnna Cross: So let me start your first question, which was about the quarter-on-quarter movement in CCP. This is largely about U.S. card. I wouldn't link it directly to J curves or anything specific around the momentum in that business. There are some small FX impacts. There's also a little bit of seasonality in there. We typically expect slightly higher income in Q1 and Q4 just because of the patterns of holiday spending in the U.S. I think the other point, though, just to note is that we have seen an improvement in risk performance I would say, real risk performance quarter-on-quarter. And that's coming from a couple of things. It's from the stabilization of the delinquency trends. It's also from the fact that Gap is now fully embedded and is seasoning out and performing well in line with our expectations. So we're seeing that in the impairment line, as you can see that we also see it in the income line because it impacts these. So overall, very happy with it. It's going in the right long-term direction. This is a business that we want to grow as Venkat said. So I wouldn't read too much into the quarter-on-quarter movement. On your particular point around presentation, we hear you. Actually, there are two important businesses within CC&P and we are quite reflective about how we might think about and present those in the future. U.S. cards is obviously 1 of them. We'd also call out Wealth and Private Banking, which we've now brought together into a single division. So we'll reflect on that and update you in prior in subsequent quarters, but we are very thoughtful about it. And then to your second question, we're not seeing any real difference in deposit trends following the exit of Q2. It's been fairly consistent actually through Q2 and into Q3 so far. As I said, the trends that we're observing, we don't believe are different to those of the industry. The one that's a bit different from our expectations, does this use to sort of more current account deposits, I would say, simply customers proactively managing their financial situation. So I wouldn't call out any specific impact on the hedge.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: And finally, just step in for a second, Chris. And you and some of the previous questions have focused rightly on sort of where we want to grow, what the balance is with the investment? Equally, I hope it's clear that not just how we're thinking about avenues of growth, but we really value doing it in such a way that creates returns for our shareholders. And we want to prioritize that. And so that's a big part behind continuing with the dividend program and the buyback program at GBP 750 million. So it is a balancing act, and I just didn't want you to miss the other side of the balance, which is what we've been returning to shareholders.\nOperator: The next question comes from Benjamin Toms from RBC.\nBenjamin Toms: Firstly, on mortgage spread compression, it's fairly significant headwinds in NIM this quarter. But if you look at [indiscernible] data, it looks like the headwind fades as we go through half 2 as the spread of mortgage rolling off the book comes down and the pressure looks like it comes back again in 2024, albeit to a lesser extent than we're seeing currently. Is that the right way to think about the shape of the headwinds is the first question? And then secondly, back on the structural hedge phase. But in terms of the extra exposure given that's really helpful. I guess the key question is the quantum of the total gross income in '24 and '25. That's not disclosed, but you described as being strong. If we look at latest market pricing, it looks like the tailwinds could be something like an additional GBP 1 billion of revenues in '24 and another GBP 1 billion of revenues on top of that in 2025. Can you give some kind of sense about whether that's the right kind of ballpark way to think about it?\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Ben. So you're right about mortgage margins at the moment. The mortgage market is very competitive, very focused on refinancing. That means that spreads remain attractive relatively thin. We don't see that changing much through 2023. Remember, we know exactly who is maturing this year and what rate they're on. And in fact, in the disclosure that we've given you is that many of them have already refixed already. So we've got a very good view about what the forward impact of that is. We would expect it to be much less, probably largely neutral actually in 2024 because what we're really seeing at the moment is the vintage written in 2021, which was on much wider margins and on 2-year fixes, it's that's rolling off, really. So by the time we get into 2024, we'd expect the impact of mortgage compression to be much more neutral. And in many respects, the margin story for 2024 is much simpler, which leads me to your second question. It's a bit early to give very precise guidance around 2024. What I would say though is the following: Given the scale of maturities that we have and the yield on those maturities, we would expect a strong pickup. And clearly, we would expect that to mitigate any continued depositor behavior that we see through 2024. So I would expect it to provide a stabilizing effect as we go into 2024, noting again that mortgages will be broadly neutral and actually base rates, we would expect to be broadly neutral. So it's really a much simpler picture in margin terms in '24.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Terelak from Mediobanca.\nAdam Terelak: I want to dig into NIM into 2024. I know you just mentioned the hedge. Can you give us a sense of the deposit assumptions in this year's guide? And then how much the deposits might be able to move further beyond '23 and into '24. So I'm just trying to think about what the kind of the volume of deposit repricing opposite, that hedge benefit you're talking about could be the kind of scale of the 2024 NIM from the 3.15% you're expecting this year? And then a question on completely different topic. U.S. regulation, they got a new look on that Basel III finalization might look like. How does that impact your U.S. IHC, how does impact your card growth plans there? Because I know the minute capital ratios between your U.K. business and international franchises are fairly well balanced. Does that change if you're going to see material risk-weighted inflation on the U.S. regulations? And does that change your greater plans?\nAnna Cross: So let me talk about our deposit assumptions for 2023 first. So as I said, in Q2, we've seen that sort of increased proactivity from our customers. We expect that to continue into Q4 into Q3 rather. And by the time we get to Q4, normally what happens is we actually see a build of deposits in Q4 because people stand up on their way into the holiday period. We're not assuming that this year, but we are assuming the movement in deposits will somewhat stabilize in the fourth quarter. So that's our version of that seasonal effect in this forecast. So what we're expecting in NIM term is that for the NIM to step down in Q3 and then be a bit more stable into Q4. And remember, we've got really good visibility on the hedge. So of the GBP 3.6 billion in gross income this year, we've already locked in GBP 3.3 billion of it. We know who our mortgage customers are and when they're going to refinance. So really, what we're doing here is answering 3 questions. The first is, what happens if and when base rates go up again. And we are clearly saying that we expect that to not have a positive impact on NIM, it might actually be slightly negative. And that's because at these rates and beyond, we'd expect pass-through to be high. The second question we have is around deposits, and I'll just told you what we think. Sets down again in Q3, somewhat stable thereafter into Q4. The third and really important question is, what do we expect to happen to unsecured lending? In the current environment and given the proactivity that we see from our customers, we are not assuming that, that is going to grow. You're seeing some headline growth, but that's not interest earning growth. Now as I say, this is having some downward pressure on our BUK NIM, but it is also impacting the impairment, and we are seeing very strong low levels of impairments coming through in BUK. Hopefully, that gives you a bit more clarity I think...\nAdam Terelak: Can you say anything on deposit migration in '24 and changes in mix beyond 4Q? Or is it two crystal balls?\nAnna Cross: So too early to tell, as I noted before. All I would say is that given the strong pickup in the structural hedge, we would expect those two things to be offsetting.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: So I just want to emphasize the point Anna made at the end about the relationship between them and impairment. Having spent a lifetime in credit markets, what I will say to you is the NIM you want is not the highest NIM but the best kind of NIM. The one that balances your return with risks of credit impairment. We think we increasingly see the evidence that we've got a very good kind of NIM because what you are seeing is a reduction in it, but reduction for the right reasons. And the reasons are that people are using extra balances to pay off mortgages and reducing the impairment risk on the portfolio. So as you think through these numbers and as you think through our credit portfolio, I would urge you to keep it in mind because that's the way Anna and I think about it. And that's the way we've been targeting and developing and shaping the credit profile of this bank.\nAnna Cross: Absolutely. On your second question, Adam, which is about Basel 3.1 in the U.S., again, it's a bit early. We're expecting that guidance today. So it will take us a while to work our way through that. We've guided to the overall expected impact from Basel 3.1. And of course, we'll update you on that as these rules become clearer and more final.\nOperator: Next question comes from Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Bank of America.\nRohith Chandra-Rajan: I had a couple on CIB, please, if that's all right. The first one was just on transaction banking, where there was clearly a very strong revenue trend last year as rates were all rising. And that's come down slightly over the past couple of quarters. So is transaction banking now, is that margin piece done and this is now a kind of volume-driven revenue line? That would be the first one. And then just on cost management in CIB. So costs have been coming down, but they've not kept pace with the revenue trends. I was just wondering how we should think about the cost trajectory there going forward. Is this -- should we expect the investment spend to drop out at some point or efficiency improvements to kick in? Or is this more about market share gains and revenue growth and market recovery going forward, so the revenue line more than the cost line?\nAnna Cross: And thank you for the question, which, of course, is on another very strong NIM story for Barclays. So the one we talk about a lot is Barclays U.K., which is half of our net interest income, corporate is a quarter of it and CC&P is the other quarter. So thanks for the question. What's happening in transaction banking is continued stability in deposits. These are very long sticky relationships with our corporate clients. We've seen earlier migration there as we would expect, that's a bit more stable now. And really, what you're seeing over the last couple of quarters is, they're both slightly odd in the data. So Q1 is relatively small in business days. Q2 has got more calendar days, but fewer business days because of the bad holidays that we have through May. So it's actually a slightly odd quarter. So we saw probably fewer fees coming through there because of the fewer business days, but higher deposit income because of the more calendar days, if you can decode all of that. But just stepping back from all of it, given that it's based on corporate relationships and given that our structural hedge also impacts this business, we see it as being pretty stable actually as an income line. And corporate lending is a much cleaner picture this quarter as well because it doesn't have any leverage loan marks in it. So that's a much closer picture to what I would expect that to be a clean quarter. On CIB costs, we've clearly been investing in our CIB for the reasons that then cuts gone through. What you're seeing at the moment is that, that cost trajectory around investments is reaching maturity really. And what you're seeing over time is the income growth whilst there might be difference this quarter to quarter, that income growth is coming through behind it. So you're seeing what were quite strict negative jaws now alleviating somewhat. I won't talk about specific quarters, Rohith, but clearly, our objective here is for this business to have strong returns and cost income ratio is a key part of that. So we are focused on it. And you'll see that it's part of our overall story, but we don't think that our CIR is outlined with our peers. And clearly, we're seeing the benefits of the growth coming through, but very ROTE focused. Just noting we've had double-digit ROTE in this division now for 10 or 14 quarters. So we feel like we're investing in the right things. Hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Firth from KBW.\nEdward Firth: Venkat, I just wondered if I could bring you back to the strategy question because I think that probably is the key one at the moment. I mean, I heard what you said about the success of the CIB over the last 5 years. And what it's worth, I agree with you. But if I let you share price over that time, it's down between 10% and 20%. So I guess, although we agree, the wider market clearly disagrees or clearly doesn't see the value in what you've created. And so I guess in that context, I also heard your comments about strategic review and perhaps fee income being a focus. But how sure are you that is enough to start closing the valuation gap on the peers? And at what point -- are we not approaching the point now after perhaps 5 or 10 years of this strategy where we start to think doesn't something more radical need to happen to actually start closing gap because you're now at a huge discount. I mean, Lloyd's is on [indiscernible], Natwest is on 0.8, 0.9. You're down 0.5 or less. And I'm just -- is there sort of a sense of how we can do something to close that. Does that make sense?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes. So what I want to say to you is obviously First of all, thank you for your comments on the CIB. I'm glad you agree that we've been making progress on it. It's clearly insufficient, right? That's what the price to book was steady. And I think there are 3 or 4 aspects of that. One aspect is the proportion of the bank's revenue, profits, risk-weighted assets that are sitting in the CIB. It does feel that, that is a drag on the overall valuation where it's at 60% to 70%, right? So in other words, the success of the CIB has been great, but it's now -- the rest of the bank has to pull its own weight. That's the part, again, where I'd say both within CIB and the rest of the bank that we've got to increase the proportion of relatively capital-light, relatively making revenue. And we are putting in place the pieces that allow us to think about this in and operate this in a good way.  So the merger of the private bank and the wealth business from the U.K. is one such piece. The investments we continue to make in our cards portfolio in the U.S. although I repeat the point I made earlier, not just to make investments in the card portfolio to make it more capital efficient or another part of that piece. And I think it's important also that we have -- we don't surprise the market in the way we did last year with that securities issuance problem. So we're spending a lot of time improving internal end-to-end management and efficiencies for that, we don't have negative surprises. But then ultimately, you come to the last part, which is to run the businesses at a very high level of operational efficiency, which includes in some part, scale, so that people believe that you can produce these higher returns sustainably over long periods of time and guide you to how we might do that. And I think we're spending time thinking about that. And at the right time, we'll share...\nAnna Cross: Did you have another question?\nEdward Firth: One, I guess just to sort of follow-up to that. I mean I get what you say about the sort of balance of the business, but so growing organically, changing organically is not really going to change that materially in the next 5 years, I don't imagine. So unless you're going to do something really material in terms of buying some retail banking or buying a big stable banking part to rebalance it and/or sell or close down a significant part of CIB. So the balance is not going to change materially. I mean it's been pretty much 60-40 for 7, 8 years I would imagine.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Look, I think you've got to a process in a very thoughtful, carefully deliberate way. That's what we are doing.\nAnna Cross: Can we go to the next question, please, which will be our last question for this call?\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Robin Down from HSBC.\nRobin Down: Just a couple of quick ones for me. Firstly, apologies if I missed this earlier, but the webcast kept crashing it out. But can you give us any sense as to where mortgage completion margins were you in Q2? And the second question, perhaps a little bit more kind of slightly philosophical question about the structural hedge. Why are you reinvesting at the moment? Because if you reinvest in the structural hedge today, 5-year swap at kind of 4.8 on our probably after next week's base rate rise is going to be around 5.5. There's a negative spread there. And it feels like you've gone beyond hedging your current accounts and equity, and you're partially hedging now sort of deposits where you have effectively 100% deposit beta. So just philosophically, why are you reinvesting a structural hedge now? Why are you not actively looking to kind of run it down, whether it's a kind of negative to sort of near-term income.\nAnna Cross: On your first point on mortgage completions. I think we've been pretty consistent in not quoting spread. All I would say to you is that the mortgage market is extremely competitive, largely intermediated, and you wouldn't expect our spreads to be markedly different from the market as a whole. What really matters, though, in mortgages is the current churn impact that we're getting, which, as I said, we'd expect to lessen into 2024. As to your second question, on the structural hedge and the philosophy around that. So the reason that we have the structural hedges to smooth the income of our banking book businesses over time. It is not there to be an expression of where we think rates will go, either up or down. It's there to protect and smooth the income pathways on those really important banking businesses for us, whether they be in corporate or in retail. And what it's done is it led to a slower income pathway on the way up. And to the extent that we keep reinvesting in it, it will stabilize our long return income. And at any point when rates start going back then, again, it will protect income on the down side. So for us, it's not an expression about how we feel on rates, it's actually an expression about how we manage our income and how we think about our risk actually in these critical franchise businesses. But thank you for the question. With that, I'd like to thank you all for your questions this morning and your continued interest on and focus on Barclays, not only for Q2, but the great questions on our longer-term strategy. If you've got further questions, please follow-up with the IR team or I will see many of you the week after next or analyst breakfast. But to everyone, I really hope you have a great summer break, and we will see you soon.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for joining Anna and me on today's call. Let me start by saying we continue to deliver a consistent strong performance quarter-on-quarter. In particular, our second quarter results show resilience against a mixed macroeconomic backdrop and against the viewed market activity. This performance again demonstrates the stability and strength of the franchise, which we have built over many years. We generated GBP 6.3 billion in income in the second quarter of up '23, up 6% year-on-year, excluding last year's impact from the Over-issuance of securities. This growth reflects the diverse sources of income, which we have built across the group. Our focus on cost discipline delivered a cost-to-income ratio of 63% for this quarter, putting us on track to meet our guidance of low 60s in 2023. Our deliberate and prudent approach to risk management over many years it's providing protection against macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, our credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations. Together, these foundations have generated a profit before tax for the bank of GBP 2 billion in the second quarter, earnings per share of 8.6p and a return on tangible equity of 11.4%. This second quarter performance means that we have delivered for the first half of 2023. And income, which is up 9% year-on-year, again, excluding the over-issuance. And a return on tangible equity for the first half of 13.2%, again, in line with our target of above 10% for the year. Despite the mixed macroeconomic backdrop, we continue to invest thoughtfully where we see opportunities to build competitive advantage and to service our customers and clients more effectively. In Investment Banking, building on our strength in the U.S., we are growing our market share in the U.K. and in Europe, and we have risen to #1 ranking in fee share in the U.K and a #2 position in Germany for the second quarter of 2023 as well as our sixth position globally. While announced volumes have been muted, client consideration of M&A alternatives remains active in anticipation of improved market conditions, and we have been deeply engaged in a full range of risk transfer activity. For example, Barclays was exclusive provider of financing for Ares\u2019's $3.6 billion deal with PacWest Bancorp in the last quarter. We're also seeing continued momentum in financing income within our Markets business and maintain our top tier rankings in businesses such as credit trading. Despite lower client activity in markets and banking across the street, I'm particularly pleased with the growing strength of our client franchise. Over several years, our client-centric markets business has targeted a greater share of flow revenue from our top 100 clients. As a result, our income from these clients is up over 10% for the first half of 2023. In the consumer bank in the U.S., we have built upon the succession of our partnership with GAP and announced a new long-term collaboration with Breeze Airways, an airline startup from a co-founder of JetBlue. We also continued to make good progress in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy. We recently provided approximately GBP 100 million in loans to support Moray West offshore wind farm, a development that is expected to supply up to half of the electricity for Scotland.  And recently, we extended our popular Greener Home Rewards Scheme in the U.K. to help support more of our mortgage customers with financing energy efficiency improvements to their houses. As I have said in the past, shareholder distributions are a key focus for the bank. Our reported CET1 ratio at 30th of June was 13.8%, up 20 basis points from the first quarter and solidly within our target of 13% to 14% and for the bank. Core to this is our consistently strong balance sheet and the capital generation capacity of our franchise. We are therefore announcing an increased capital return to shareholders with a 20% growth in our half year dividend to 2.7p per share. We are also pleased to announce a share buyback of; GBP 750 million which is an increase on the GBP 500 million we announced at year-end and completed in the first half. Over the past 12 months, our combined dividends and buybacks, including those announced today represent a yield of about 10% at current share price levels. And our buyback programs have in aggregate reduced our share count of shares in issue by over 10% since 2020. And so to reiterate, capital and shareholder distributions are a key focus for us going forward.  As we have described for more than 18 months now, inflation and higher interest rates in developed economies, have changed both client and customer behavior. We have continued to position Barclays accordingly, and that is driving the consistency and stability in our results. I will briefly describe our approach and Anna will elaborate on these points shortly. First, we have taken a prudent approach to credit risk management and to our balance sheet, maintaining strong capital and liquidity metrics over the long term. In particular, we continue to balance carefully our credit exposure with the provision of lending and liquidity. Our customers are cautious, but they remain resilient. We have provided incremental and tailored support while also ensuring that it is simple and convenient for them to access the right product to meet their needs. We understand the impact of inflation and high interest rates on our customers, and we want to help them. For our U.K. mortgage customers, we are providing options to switch to interest-only mortgages for 6 months or extensions of their mortgage term where appropriate. We are also enabling customers approaching the end of a fixed rate mortgage deal to lock in a new rate up to 6 months in advance. Of those customers who have made their mortgage rate switch application directly to us, over 1/3 have done so using the Barclays app. On the savings side, we provide a range of instant access and fixed savings products, which allow our customers to select the right rates for their savings goals. For those customers who rely on instant access to savings, we recently increased the rate on our everyday saver by 50 basis points. In addition, since its launched in September last year, our Rainy-Day Saver account, which pays 5% up to GBP 5,000 has proven popular with customers. Over 435,000 accounts have been opened as of the end of June this year, of which 95% were opened digitally. We also regularly conduct outreach to highlight where a better savings product might be available to customers, and we have seen some significant shifts in behavior as a consequence. As interest rates rise, our customers become increasingly sensitive to their impact. And as a result, we have issued further guidance on our Barclays U.K. net interest margin, which Anna will address shortly. Finally, we have also continued to exercise cost discipline against this backdrop by capturing efficiency savings to manage inflation and by being thoughtful and careful about how we invest in our businesses. Anna will cover costs in more detail, but suffice to say that we have delivered on our cost guidance this quarter and remain committed to driving a lower cost-to-income ratio over time. So in summary, we remain very confident of meeting our targets for the full year. Our targets are anchored on a greater than 10% return on tangible equity. I reiterate that this remains a floor and not the extent of our ambition. We are managing the bank well and generating a consistently strong statutory performance across the range of different economic scenarios and market scenarios which we have been experiencing. This quarter represents another important step towards demonstrating value for our shareholders. We have increased shareholder distributions and remain committed to doing so going forward. And we do this while continuing to support our customers and our clients. With that, thank you for listening. I'll hand over now to Anna to take you through the financials in more detail."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. Starting with performance highlights on Slide 7. Our return on tangible equity for the quarter was 11.4%, broadly in line with Q2 last year, resulting in a 13.2% return for the first half. This is in line with our expectations, and we are very confident of achieving our RoTE target of above 10% for the year. This takes into account business trends and income and our latest view on impairment, I'll come back to each of these. We guided to cost in Q2 being lower than Q1 and have delivered. The cost/income ratio was 63% for the quarter and 60% for the half, and we continue to guide to low 60s for the full year. Although we are still guiding to a loan loss rate of 50 to 60 bps for the full year, we continue to see limited signs of stress across our portfolios. And this quarter, the loan loss rate was 37 bps. This reflects the prudent positioning of our balance sheet, as Venkat mentioned, and we believe our risk management discipline will limit credit risk downside for us if the global economy slows. Our liquid and stable balance sheet positions us well to pursue our returns objectives and return capital to shareholders. Accordingly, we are paying a half year dividend of 2.7p and have announced a further buyback of GBP 750 million to start immediately, which is a total return of 7.5p per share for the first half. There was no effect this quarter from the over-issuance of securities, which did impact litigation and conduct costs and income for Q2 last year. To provide a more meaningful comparison, we have excluded these impacts from the comparators in this presentation. On this base, income was up 6% on a strong Q2 last year, whilst operating costs, which exclude litigation and conduct, were also up 6%. Litigation and conduct was GBP 33 million this quarter, and profit before impairment was up 12%. The impairment charge increased to GBP 372 million against a low comparator and in line with our expectations, resulting in profit before tax increasing to GBP 2 billion and earnings per share to 8.6p. The tangible net asset value accretion from earnings was more than offset by negative reserve movements, mainly reflecting further rate rises, reducing TNAV by 10 in the quarter to 291 per share. I'm now going to cover the key drivers of our returns, income, costs and risk management, starting with income on Slide 9. Total income increased 6% or around GBP 335 million year-on-year, reflecting our diverse sources of income. Barclays U.K. income grew 14% with tailwinds from higher rates year-on-year and from the structural hedge, partially offset by lower product margins. Consumer, cards and payments increased 18%, driven mainly by U.S. card balances. CIB was down 3% year-on-year at GBP 3.2 billion. The strength in corporate lending and transaction banking income and stability in financing income in markets partially offset the impact of market conditions, which were less favorable for intermediation income and for deal flow in banking. So we benefited, again, from our diverse business model within the CIB. Looking at the group as a whole, if you compare our revenue in this quarter with 4 years ago, you can see that we have grown income by around GBP 400 million in both the CIB and across our consumer businesses. Turning now to costs on Slide 10. Total costs were GBP 4 billion, up 2% year-on-year. Our cost/income ratio improved from 65% in Q2 last year to 63%, an increase of 57% at Q1 as we expected, and this is factored into our unchanged low 60s guidance for the full year. We delivered lower operating costs in Q2 versus Q1 at both the Group level and in CIB, in line with our guidance, and we continue to expect Q1 to be the high point for quarterly operating costs this year, again for Group and CIB. We are focused on capturing cost efficiencies across the group. For example, in Barclays U.K., we are investing in transformation to improve service for our customers by automating, digitizing and simplifying our offering, whilst also driving a lower cost income ratio over time. CC&P operating costs were up GBP 96 million year-on-year, reflecting growth in our U.S. Card portfolio, including the acquisition of Gap towards the end of Q2 last year and the U.K. wealth transfer from BUK during the quarter. And CIB operating costs were up GBP 114 million year-on-year as we continue to invest selectively in our clients' franchise through technology enhancements in talent and in improved resilience and controls. Moving on to credit on Slide 11. We have maintained our long-standing prudent approach to provisioning and continue to hold strong coverage levels. Our impairment allowance at the quarter end was GBP 6.1 billion, a slight decrease from GBP 6.3 billion at Q1. We updated the baseline macroeconomic variables for modeled impairment from the full year, notably with some reduction in forecast unemployment in the U.K. and U.S. However, these remain more severe than the forecast used at Q2 last year. And at the end of the quarter, we retained post-model adjustments for economic uncertainty of GBP 0.3 billion. Our guidance for a loan loss rate in the 50 bps to 60 bps range allows for some potential credit deterioration and seasonal effects. The GBP 372 million charge translated into a loan loss rate of 37 bps. Looking in more detail by business on Slide 12, the Barclays U.K. charge of GBP 95 million reflects the lower balances and a lower risk book of unsecured lending compared to before the pandemic as well as our prudent positioning in mortgage lending. There is some increase in the provision against mortgages, and I'll come back to why we remain comfortable with our credit risk here despite the significant rise in interest rates. As expected, the majority of the charge is again in Consumer Cards and Payments and U.S. Cards in particular. It reflects the normalization of delinquencies with a seasoning effect as balances grow, and this includes the Gap acquisition, which is performing as we expected. The next three slides illustrate why we are confident in our provisioning and our prudent approach to risk. On Slide 13, we've shown key coverage and delinquency metrics for our two largest unsecured books, U.K. and U.S. Cards. Repayment rates in U.K. cards remain high across the credit spectrum and arrears rates remained stable and very low by historical standards. Overall, we are confident that the credit quality of our U.K. card book has improved since 2019. We've continued to grow U.S. cards in an appropriate and controlled way that is consistent with the opportunities we see there. As we expected, delinquencies at all FICO levels have been increasing, but our risk mix has improved with our average FICO for the book strengthening slightly since the end of 2019 to over 750, and this includes Gap. In addition, the proportion of the book better than a FICO of 660 is now 89% compared to 86% at the end of 2019. As we grow, we maintained strong coverage levels across both U.K. and U.S. cards, notably, Stage 2 coverage of around 18% and 33%, respectively. Moving on to the mortgage book on Slide 14. There are a number of factors that contribute to our comfort in the higher rate environment. First, we have applied strict affordability tests since 2013, using rates above current levels. Second, looking at the profile for refinancing, the proportion of the book on 5-year and over initial fixed rates has increased materially since 2019 from 33% to 51%. This shift delays a potential increase in rates for many borrowers, allowing them more time to mitigate the impact. Fixed rate maturities in half 2 totaled GBP 17 billion. And as you can see from the chart, a significant proportion of these borrowers have locked in rates ahead of the end of their fixed rate terms. So our mortgage customers are taking thoughtful and appropriate actions. Third, and as a credit backstop, the book is conservatively positioned from a collateral point of view with balanced weighted loan-to-value of 52.8%. Only 2% of mortgages, which are refinancing over the next 2 years have LTVs in excess of 85%. Given the market-wide focus on commercial real estate, we also wanted to share more detail on the portfolio to highlight our position. As we have followed a prudent lending policy here for over 30 years, this is not an area of concern for Barclays. As you can see on Slide 15, commercial real estate as a proportion of our customer loan book is around GBP 17 billion or just under 5%, which is below the industry average. It is diversified across segments and the weighted loan-to-value of 49% provides significant headroom for a potential stress in prices. No individual segment has an LTV of higher than 58%. We know the office component has received particular attention and this is just GBP 1.9 billion. Turning now to the performance of each business in the quarter, beginning with Barclays U.K. on Slide 16. Profit before tax increased 25% and the return on tangible equity was just over 20%. Income grew 14% to GBP 2 billion, with costs down 1%, improving the cost/income ratio by 9 percentage points year-on-year to 55%. We expect to improve this further as the benefits from our transformation program feeds through. The net interest margin was 322 bps, up 4 bps on Q1, in line with our expectations, and this would have been 2 bps higher without the transfer of U.K. wealth to consumer cards and payments. The moving parts are set out in the bridge on the slide. We benefited from the steady roll of the structural hedge, which again added 13 bps as in each of the last few quarters and from some lagged effect from previous bank rate rises. There was also a 6 bps increase from the reversal of some of the treasury headwinds, which we called out at full year. These positive impacts were moderated by both mortgages margins and the developing deposit dynamics. On the next slide, I'll cover how we see NIM evolving from here. Our customers are cautious and resilient, and we see benefits in our credit performance, but this also affects our income outlook. Three recent macroeconomic developments, have prompted customers to change their behavior and us to revise product pricing. First, inflation is expected to be more persistent; second, base rates are forecast to peak at higher levels; and third, swap rates increased further during Q2, increasing mortgage pricing. In this environment, our customers are behaving rationally and have started to use surplus deposit balances to manage their finances more actively. For instance, business banking customers are drawing down on deposit balances for use in their businesses and to pay down debt. In Personal Banking, over 1/4 of our customers with mortgages have been making excess repayments, reducing their loans ahead of potential remortgaging. And throughout the book, customers are seeking higher yields for their savings and we have changed our pricing in response. Accordingly, we now expect the BUK NIM to be below 320 bps for full year 2023. Our current view is around 315 bps, which reflects our expectation for customers to hold lower deposit balances, changes in deposit pricing, and the 2 basis points impact from the transfer of U.K. wealth. Of course, the precise outcome will be sensitive to a number of inputs notably the level and mix of deposits and other macroeconomic factors, including inflation and rates. At the same time, the high swap rates are providing a tailwind to future years from the structural hedge as we lock in fixed receipts at meaningfully higher rates, which I'll cover on the next slide. Slide 18 illustrates the importance of the hedge to the level and visibility of our future net interest income. Swap rates increased sharply during Q2 to around 5%, and reinvestment rates are materially above the yield of 1% on hedges maturing this year. As a result, gross hedge income is increasing and over 90% of the GBP 3.6 billion expected for this year was already locked in by the half year. We have a further GBP 50 billion to GBP 60 billion, maturing in each of 2024 and '25, at yields between 1% and 2%. The precise level of reinvestment will depend to an extent on customer behavior, but the building effect of the hedge roll gives us confidence that gross income from the hedge will grow strongly in 2024 and 2025. I would remind you that around 2/3 of the benefit is in BUK, where the hedge has contributed 13 bps of incremental NIM in each of the last few quarters. Looking next at Consumer Cards and Payments on Slide 19. The return on tangible equity was 11.8%. Income increased GBP 195 million or 18%, reflecting growth mainly in international cards and the transfer of U.K. Wealth. Period-end U.S. card balances grew organically by 12% to $29.5 billion and average balances were up 27% year-on-year as the GAP acquisition was completed late in Q2 last year. We delivered positive operating jaws despite operating costs, which exclude L&C being up 14%, reflecting continuing growth across the businesses. Both income and costs included around GBP 35 million from the transfer of U.K. Wealth. As I discussed earlier, the increase in impairment was in line with our expectations. We've included a summary in the appendix on the wealth transfer. The combination with the private bank creates the top 5 U.K. wealth management business, and we believe we can develop the business more effectively as a single entity. Looking next at the CIB on Slide 20. Return on tangible equity was 10%, while income was down 3%, a resilient performance against a very strong prior year comparator reflecting our diversification within the CIB. Corporate lending and transaction banking increased strongly year-on-year to over GBP 900 million. Markets, which was down 20%, reflected lower market volatility impacting intermediation income, but there was some offset from financing income, which grew 9%. As I mentioned last quarter, we are benefiting from the effects of higher inflation and financing. Investment banking fees were down 15%, reflecting a lower industry fee pool. Cost decreased 2%, but operating costs, which exclude all litigation and conduct, increased 6%. As I mentioned earlier, this reflected selective investment in our client franchise. Turning now to capital and liquidity. As you can see on Slide 21, we continue to maintain strong capital funding and liquidity. Looking in more detail, beginning with capital. Our capital generation profits was again strong, contributing 39 bps in the quarter, of which 8 bps was applied to the increased dividend accrual. Taking into account the GBP 750 million buyback we have announced our CET1 ratio would be 13.6% and in our target range of 13% to 14%. Our MDA has increased in July from 11.4% to 11.8%, and we remain comfortable with our target range. Looking forward, we expect strong organic capital generation supporting attractive returns to shareholders. We have grown deposits substantially ahead of loan volumes for many years and have a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 72%. As shown on Slide 23, we have seen a stable level of deposits overall this quarter at GBP 555 billion. This reflects an increase in international deposits and treasury offset by some decline in retail and business banking deposits, in line with the market trends we discussed earlier. We are comfortable with the stability of the group's overall deposit funding base and our diversified sources of deposit funding. Our franchise deposit strategy means we remain highly liquid, based on both our internal stress framework and our liquidity coverage ratio well ahead of the regulatory requirements. The liquidity pool of GBP 331 billion is held 80% in cash with the risk in the residual debt securities tightly managed. So to recap and summarize the outlook on Slide 25. We delivered earnings of 8.6p per share in Q2 and generated an 11.4% return on tangible equity and are very confident of achieving our target of above 10% for the year, underpinned by our diversified sources of earnings. The cost/income ratio for the quarter was 63%, and we expect to deliver a statutory ratio in the low 60s this year. We remain focused on risk management. And while we expect an increase in impairment year-on-year as we grow U.S. cards in particular, we are confident of delivering a loan loss rates within our guidance range of 50 bps to 60 bps for the full year. Our capital ratio remained strong at 13.8%, and we expect to deliver attractive capital returns to shareholders followed with selective investments to drive profitability. Thank you, and we will now take your questions. And as usual, I would ask that you limit yourself to two per person so we get a chance to get around to everyone."

        "text": "I just had a question, firstly, on rate sensitivity because I can't find any tables or disclosure in today's releases. I guess are you now approaching as regards base rates, a position whereby the bank is liability sensitive? Or how should we think about rate sensitivity going forward? And then secondly, can you discuss your strategy with some of the European consumer businesses, such as the German consumer business, I think there have been some press headlines about the disposal of that business. That would actually have a relatively significant contribution to capital present really gain on it, not game changing, but certainly would free up another, call it, GBP 750 million or GBP 1 billion of capital, if you were disposed of it. So I guess how are you thinking about those peripheral consumer businesses that you still have?"

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thanks for your questions. so I'll cover the first one and then hand across to Venkat. So you're exactly right. What we are saying is that given where base rates have now got to, we expect further rate rises from here would have no impact on our net interest margin if that might be even slightly negative. And that's simply because, as we've said for some time, the higher rates go, the higher the pass-through will be. Don't forget though that this higher rate environment also impacts the yield curve, and we are seeing that benefit come through and get locked into on our structural hedge. Venkat, do you want to take the second question?"

        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Yes. Thank you, Anna. So Joe, yes, we are looking to sell the German credit card business. It's a nice business, but it's not really been -- it's not really core to our overall consumer footprint. There will be a modest RWA release when that happens. But it is small in the context of the bank. I mean, it's something, but it's small. Yes."

        "text": "Just to start off with, I guess, first one, a lot of the investors that I talked to would like to see Barclays we care about the sort of risk-weighted asset growth that it envisages for the CIB, like many of them would like to see no growth in that division at all or perhaps some kind of constraint around the share it represents in the group. I just wanted your views on that desire. And then secondly, just looking at Barclays U.K., the division has a better income to loan tally than almost anyone else in the sector, but it's cost-to-income ratio is 10% above Lloyd's and 13% above NatWest. You must have done loads of sort of internal work in the past. Can you talk about what it is about the cost structure of that business that makes it so much less efficient than the major peers that we look at?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Jason, I'll take the first one, and I'll talk a second one Barclays U.K. to Anna. So on the first one, I think I have been pretty clear that when we look strategically at the investment bank, it's been a great success. It has been 5 years ago, the question that was asked of us was should you have one. And If you had one, would it be any good? And I think we've shown that it's important for us to have one. It's a great diversifying business, and we're pretty good at it. We are the top-ranked European investment bank, so in markets penetrating. However, I also recognized that at approximately 60% to 70% of the bank, it is much more important now to grow the bank that's outside of the investment bank and to get a better balance overall in due course. Now having said that, within the investment bank, there are some relatively attractive RoTE businesses, such as financing and prime. And we have been within the investment bank investing a lot in those. So the real -- when you get to the heart of your question, it's something, of course, we would agree with, which is to increase our RoTE and to increase the proportion that fee-based and relatively capital-light businesses play in our entire product mix."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Yes, we've thought a lot about this. And I'd put it down to a couple of factors. The first risk appetite does play a role here. So -- and that is both around liquidity and credit risk appetite. So you'll know that Barclays U.K. has a lower loan-to-deposit ratio than some of its peers. And we've managed our credit extremely carefully within Barclays U.K. as we do obviously, across the group. And it's part of the group risk appetite that we focus on, obviously, we've got global opportunities to place risk and many varieties of it. So I think risk is a large part in the way we manage that risk. But of course, it's also about the cost base, which is what the transformation in Barclays U.K. is about. So we're extremely focused on cost and efficiency, and we are working extremely hard on our physical and digital footprint and the benefits that, that gives to our customers. So what you see at the moment is us reinvesting the benefits of that transformation to make it go faster. But over time, we would expect to see the cost-income ratio of the business to trend diverse. Hopefully, that gives you some clarity about how we think about it. So next question, please."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jonathan Pierce",
        "text": "I've got two. The first is on the hedge. Thanks for the extra disclosure on the hedge maturities in 2024, 2025, particularly the scale of them. But I wondered if you could be a bit more precise on the yields that these things are coming off because you've got GBP 100 billion to GBP 120 billion in maturities over those 2 years makes a big difference if the average yield on the maturities of 1% versus 2%. The range could be as wide a GBP 1 billion or so. I'm also just a supplementary to that, wondering where all the hedges that were written in 2020 when the 5-year swap rate was close to 0. Where are those -- when are those coming off? And I thought there'd be a bunch of those in 2025. The second question is a more broader one on distributions. In particular, going forward, the sort of split of the free capital generation that goes towards dividends versus buybacks. I mean we can all understand you want to do a lot of buybacks over the next few years at this rating. The consensus dividend payout ratio is about 27%, I think, over the next 2 or 3 years. And as an argument, I suppose, the payout ratio could be a bit higher than that. I mean ultimately, cash in pocket today is just as important as enhanced cash and pocket in a few years' time. So thoughts around the distribution split between dividends and buybacks moving forward would be great so..."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. Just picking up the first one, I'm glad you like the slide. So we're talking about Slide 18 here. What that shows is that we've seen a strong pickup in yield from FY'22 to '23. So our income has gone from GBP 2.2 billion to an expected GBP 3.6 billion this year. And your question is really, how that flows from here? Difficult to be completely precise about the maturing yield because it does impact on how much we roll into your calculation. But what I would say is that it's probably at the lower end of the range for 2024 and in the range for 2025. Typically, these are about 5 year swaps. So you're going to see the benefits coming through of 2020 vintage sort of from '25. On your broader question, the way we think about it is we want a progressive dividend, which is why you've seen us grow the dividend at the half year, year-on-year. So that's up by 20% year-on-year. And that's really -- that should demonstrate to you our confident in our ability to distribute capital consistently from here, but we want to be able to supplement that from time to time with a buyback, as you said, particularly given where the valuation of the bank is right now. And so at this point in time, we together these to around GBP 1.2 billion of distribution at the half year, which is 5% of our current market cap. So hopefully, that will underline to you our commitment to return capital to shareholders in dividend and in buyback."

        "text": "The first one is just on deposits. In BUK, I think they felt about GBP 4 billion or GBP 5 billion in the quarter, presumably that includes some outflows in current accounts and interest-bearing site accounts and the inflows into time so perhaps you could help us understand those moves in terms of the mix of deposits, either at Box U.K. or at group level. And then as we look forward, it sounds like you expect that had been to persist at maybe current levels, whereas one of your peers noted the experience thus far in Q3 was maybe a little bit better than May or June and thought that less base rate movement less prompts for customers to move money. So I just wonder if you share those sort of news or not, it sounds like maybe you're embedding slightly more conservative there. And then on the CIB, I guess we've become quite accustomed to top line beats and market share gains, the market for quite a while. This quarter was a little bit soft. I just wondered if you had anything into that, and you need to change or pivot mindful you've got a strategy review in the background? Or do you just largely for down to 1 quarter, and there will always be a degree of [indiscernible] and perhaps you've been seeing some green shoots from here."

        "text": "So we don't disclose the split of our deposits. But when we look at our peers who've reported thus far, the trends that we've experienced don't look markedly different. And actually, what we're saying at this point in time is the migration behavior is broadly as we expected it to be. What we're seeing is that customers are holding a lower level of deposits and they're doing that for very positive and proactive reasons.  We think that the approach for that behavior is 3 things: Firstly, rates have risen beyond the level that any of us expected. Secondly, inflation is much higher and more persistent than we expected; and thirdly, mortgage rates are obviously higher than they have been at any point other than a brief period in the third quarter of last year. So our customers are sensitive to these higher levels of interest rates, but not actually in the way that consensus is assuming, it's manifesting itself and then using their deposits proactively to manage their financial position, and we're seeing the benefit of that in our impairment. So we said in the scripted comments that over 1/4 of our customers are using that excess deposits to pay down their mortgages in advance of a fixed rate change. We think that's the right thing for them to do. And whilst it will impact on income, it's also going to impact our impairment. Because those 3 factors of rates, inflation and indeed mortgage rates we expect to persist, we also expect this deposit behavior to persist into the third quarter. And really, that underpins much of the guidance that we've given you around the forward path for BUK [indiscernible] from here. Hopefully, that gives you some clarity on how we are thinking about it. Venkat, do you want to pick up the second?"

So our performance is consistent with that of the U.S. peers. We are very much in the middle of the [indiscernible]. And there's a little bit of a stylistic story in it. If you look at fixed income, where we're off just a little more. We had an excellent quarter in the second quarter of 2022. We also -- this was a quarter in which securitized products, which is an area of growth for us has done very well. So banks with big securitized products businesses did better than those without. And equities volatility was a little bit more muted, and we have a very derivatives heavy business. And banking has been fine. As I said in my remarks a few minutes ago, ranking share increase in the U.K. and Germany continue to maintain our global ranking. So I think if I take a slightly longer-term view, we continue to aim to gain market share with our biggest client, which is a specific objective of ours. We continue to do well within markets and in banking. And then the last thing I want to point out in terms of the diversification of the business and referring to the question that was asked earlier, I think from Jason about the CIB. If you look our transaction banking numbers and our corporate banking overall has been doing extremely well. So that part of the business, which is in part related to transaction volume, in part related to interest rates, but it's also in part related to just play good old fee income has been doing very well. So net-net, you put it all together, that's what leads to a CIB with double-digit ROTE and a continued accumulation and holding of market share."

        "text": "I guess I've got a couple of really follow-up questions. Anna, you mentioned, I think, just now around the -- it's really the deposit balances that are driving the structural heads down and the margin guidance down in the U.K., you've reduced around GBP 4 billion. And is that the run rate of reduction in deposits we -- that you might expect for the next few quarters that we should expect for the next few quarters? And I guess, more than related to the level of rates is obviously a level rates, but I guess clients are focusing on their rollover of mortgages, so it could last a bit longer than just with rate movements when base rate moves. Is that a fair observation, the GBP 4 billion run rate and it's more to do with the level of rates and then the movement of rates? And then the second question, also a follow-up on the strategic review and Venkat, some of the points you've made during the call of growing sort of balancing the business a bit more outside the investment bank. Obviously, the obvious part of the business to grow is U.S. cards, given I'm not sure there's a lot of room in the U.K. When I think about it, that's quite a capital-intensive business and there are some global peers that are pulling back actually from growing cards and payments. Is that the idea to deploy more capital become bigger in the U.S.? Or is it also an option of taking capital outside the investment bank to distribute? Is that another way of balancing the business?"

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "So the disclosure that we've given you on the structural hedge is actually for the group as a whole. We've included it in that Barclays U.K. section just because of the impact and the link it has to Barclays U.K. NIM. But that reduction in the hedge that you're seeing quarter-on-quarter actually relates to our corporate business as it has done in prior quarters. And really, what we're doing there is I think we've described before the way we build the hedge we identify the rate insensitive balances and then we maintain a buffer and it's -- we maintain a buffer when we put the hedge together. What we're doing in corporate is we are very conservatively maintaining that platform in the current environment. Again, I think we've spoken before about the fact that our corporate businesses or our corporate clients were really very proactive in moving their deposits and really it's a continuation of that previous story. Today, we haven't actually changed the role of our hedge within the retail book. Of course, we are very focused on that every single month. But I'd just remind you that because of the way that we roll this hedge very mechanically, we have the opportunity every month to reassess it and pause or reduce the size of the roll. So we've got plenty of room and plenty of time to adjust it. But to date, in retail, we have not had the need to do that. And secondly, the pickup in this hedge in '24 and '25, we would expect to be pretty strong, simply given the amount that we got maturing indeed the yield on that maturing level. So that will impact the U.K. will also impact the broader bank, but that's what you should read from Page 18 as opposed to any specific concern about the level of BUK deposits. Venkat, do you want to pick up the second point?"

So I think 1 way to look at is CIB, non-CIB the way I prefer to look at it is to continue to improve -- to increase the amount we have of fee-paying relatively capital light businesses. There are a couple that exist within the CIB. As I've mentioned to you, transaction banking is one of them. Our financing business is one of them, but there are many outside the CIB. And as far as -- and you should therefore look for us to continue to put an emphasis on fee-paying relatively capital light businesses. I think we would like to grow cards, but I would actually also like to increase the capital efficiency in our cards business and that's something we're spending some time on. So it's not just growing at current RWA density, but growing in a more efficient way. And that's an important feature. So net-net-net, look for us to be increasing more fee-paying businesses and relatively capital light."

Could you talk a bit more about what's going on? Why the revenues came under some pressure there? And I guess, echoing an earlier question in terms of some of the investor sentiments around some of the strategic headlines we've seen in the last couple of months. If you are wanting to invest outside of the CIB in [indiscernible] some of those CC&P segments, would you consider providing a bit more visibility? It's a slightly odd division. There's quite a lot in there. And we don't really see the economics of the different bits of that business. I know you gave us the revenues, but obviously, we don't see the rest of the P&L. If that's something you would consider to make investors a bit more comfortable with some of the growth aspirations? I had one follow-up, please, to Guy's question. In terms of deposit trends, obviously, you've given us this revised NIM guidance. Have you seen an acceleration in turning out behavior in June, July, please, specifically just in response to the large hiring swap rates. You've referenced various drivers of the change in the NIM guide, but I'm particularly keen to understand what you're seeing with respect to turning out?

        "text": "So let me start your first question, which was about the quarter-on-quarter movement in CCP. This is largely about U.S. card. I wouldn't link it directly to J curves or anything specific around the momentum in that business. There are some small FX impacts. There's also a little bit of seasonality in there. We typically expect slightly higher income in Q1 and Q4 just because of the patterns of holiday spending in the U.S. I think the other point, though, just to note is that we have seen an improvement in risk performance I would say, real risk performance quarter-on-quarter. And that's coming from a couple of things. It's from the stabilization of the delinquency trends. It's also from the fact that Gap is now fully embedded and is seasoning out and performing well in line with our expectations. So we're seeing that in the impairment line, as you can see that we also see it in the income line because it impacts these. So overall, very happy with it. It's going in the right long-term direction. This is a business that we want to grow as Venkat said. So I wouldn't read too much into the quarter-on-quarter movement. On your particular point around presentation, we hear you. Actually, there are two important businesses within CC&P and we are quite reflective about how we might think about and present those in the future. U.S. cards is obviously 1 of them. We'd also call out Wealth and Private Banking, which we've now brought together into a single division. So we'll reflect on that and update you in prior in subsequent quarters, but we are very thoughtful about it. And then to your second question, we're not seeing any real difference in deposit trends following the exit of Q2. It's been fairly consistent actually through Q2 and into Q3 so far. As I said, the trends that we're observing, we don't believe are different to those of the industry. The one that's a bit different from our expectations, does this use to sort of more current account deposits, I would say, simply customers proactively managing their financial situation. So I wouldn't call out any specific impact on the hedge."

Equally, I hope it's clear that not just how we're thinking about avenues of growth, but we really value doing it in such a way that creates returns for our shareholders. And we want to prioritize that. And so that's a big part behind continuing with the dividend program and the buyback program at GBP 750 million. So it is a balancing act, and I just didn't want you to miss the other side of the balance, which is what we've been returning to shareholders."

        "text": "Firstly, on mortgage spread compression, it's fairly significant headwinds in NIM this quarter. But if you look at [indiscernible] data, it looks like the headwind fades as we go through half 2 as the spread of mortgage rolling off the book comes down and the pressure looks like it comes back again in 2024, albeit to a lesser extent than we're seeing currently. Is that the right way to think about the shape of the headwinds is the first question? And then secondly, back on the structural hedge phase. But in terms of the extra exposure given that's really helpful. I guess the key question is the quantum of the total gross income in '24 and '25. That's not disclosed, but you described as being strong. If we look at latest market pricing, it looks like the tailwinds could be something like an additional GBP 1 billion of revenues in '24 and another GBP 1 billion of revenues on top of that in 2025. Can you give some kind of sense about whether that's the right kind of ballpark way to think about it?"

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Ben. So you're right about mortgage margins at the moment. The mortgage market is very competitive, very focused on refinancing. That means that spreads remain attractive relatively thin. We don't see that changing much through 2023. Remember, we know exactly who is maturing this year and what rate they're on. And in fact, in the disclosure that we've given you is that many of them have already refixed already. So we've got a very good view about what the forward impact of that is. We would expect it to be much less, probably largely neutral actually in 2024 because what we're really seeing at the moment is the vintage written in 2021, which was on much wider margins and on 2-year fixes, it's that's rolling off, really. So by the time we get into 2024, we'd expect the impact of mortgage compression to be much more neutral. And in many respects, the margin story for 2024 is much simpler, which leads me to your second question. It's a bit early to give very precise guidance around 2024. What I would say though is the following: Given the scale of maturities that we have and the yield on those maturities, we would expect a strong pickup. And clearly, we would expect that to mitigate any continued depositor behavior that we see through 2024. So I would expect it to provide a stabilizing effect as we go into 2024, noting again that mortgages will be broadly neutral and actually base rates, we would expect to be broadly neutral. So it's really a much simpler picture in margin terms in '24."

And then how much the deposits might be able to move further beyond '23 and into '24. So I'm just trying to think about what the kind of the volume of deposit repricing opposite, that hedge benefit you're talking about could be the kind of scale of the 2024 NIM from the 3.15% you're expecting this year? And then a question on completely different topic. U.S. regulation, they got a new look on that Basel III finalization might look like. How does that impact your U.S. IHC, how does impact your card growth plans there? Because I know the minute capital ratios between your U.K. business and international franchises are fairly well balanced. Does that change if you're going to see material risk-weighted inflation on the U.S. regulations? And does that change your greater plans?"

        "text": "So let me talk about our deposit assumptions for 2023 first. So as I said, in Q2, we've seen that sort of increased proactivity from our customers. We expect that to continue into Q4 into Q3 rather. And by the time we get to Q4, normally what happens is we actually see a build of deposits in Q4 because people stand up on their way into the holiday period. We're not assuming that this year, but we are assuming the movement in deposits will somewhat stabilize in the fourth quarter. So that's our version of that seasonal effect in this forecast. So what we're expecting in NIM term is that for the NIM to step down in Q3 and then be a bit more stable into Q4. And remember, we've got really good visibility on the hedge. So of the GBP 3.6 billion in gross income this year, we've already locked in GBP 3.3 billion of it. We know who our mortgage customers are and when they're going to refinance. So really, what we're doing here is answering 3 questions. The first is, what happens if and when base rates go up again. And we are clearly saying that we expect that to not have a positive impact on NIM, it might actually be slightly negative. And that's because at these rates and beyond, we'd expect pass-through to be high. The second question we have is around deposits, and I'll just told you what we think. Sets down again in Q3, somewhat stable thereafter into Q4. The third and really important question is, what do we expect to happen to unsecured lending? In the current environment and given the proactivity that we see from our customers, we are not assuming that, that is going to grow. You're seeing some headline growth, but that's not interest earning growth. Now as I say, this is having some downward pressure on our BUK NIM, but it is also impacting the impairment, and we are seeing very strong low levels of impairments coming through in BUK. Hopefully, that gives you a bit more clarity I think..."

The one that balances your return with risks of credit impairment. We think we increasingly see the evidence that we've got a very good kind of NIM because what you are seeing is a reduction in it, but reduction for the right reasons. And the reasons are that people are using extra balances to pay off mortgages and reducing the impairment risk on the portfolio. So as you think through these numbers and as you think through our credit portfolio, I would urge you to keep it in mind because that's the way Anna and I think about it.

The first one was just on transaction banking, where there was clearly a very strong revenue trend last year as rates were all rising. And that's come down slightly over the past couple of quarters. So is transaction banking now, is that margin piece done and this is now a kind of volume-driven revenue line? That would be the first one. And then just on cost management in CIB. So costs have been coming down, but they've not kept pace with the revenue trends. I was just wondering how we should think about the cost trajectory there going forward. Is this -- should we expect the investment spend to drop out at some point or efficiency improvements to kick in? Or is this more about market share gains and revenue growth and market recovery going forward, so the revenue line more than the cost line?"

So the one we talk about a lot is Barclays U.K., which is half of our net interest income, corporate is a quarter of it and CC&P is the other quarter. So thanks for the question. What's happening in transaction banking is continued stability in deposits. These are very long sticky relationships with our corporate clients. We've seen earlier migration there as we would expect, that's a bit more stable now. And really, what you're seeing over the last couple of quarters is, they're both slightly odd in the data. So Q1 is relatively small in business days. Q2 has got more calendar days, but fewer business days because of the bad holidays that we have through May. So it's actually a slightly odd quarter. So we saw probably fewer fees coming through there because of the fewer business days, but higher deposit income because of the more calendar days, if you can decode all of that. But just stepping back from all of it, given that it's based on corporate relationships and given that our structural hedge also impacts this business, we see it as being pretty stable actually as an income line. And corporate lending is a much cleaner picture this quarter as well because it doesn't have any leverage loan marks in it. So that's a much closer picture to what I would expect that to be a clean quarter. On CIB costs, we've clearly been investing in our CIB for the reasons that then cuts gone through. What you're seeing at the moment is that, that cost trajectory around investments is reaching maturity really. And what you're seeing over time is the income growth whilst there might be difference this quarter to quarter, that income growth is coming through behind it. So you're seeing what were quite strict negative jaws now alleviating somewhat. I won't talk about specific quarters, Rohith, but clearly, our objective here is for this business to have strong returns and cost income ratio is a key part of that. So we are focused on it. And you'll see that it's part of our overall story, but we don't think that our CIR is outlined with our peers. And clearly, we're seeing the benefits of the growth coming through, but very ROTE focused. Just noting we've had double-digit ROTE in this division now for 10 or 14 quarters.

I mean, I heard what you said about the success of the CIB over the last 5 years. And what it's worth, I agree with you. But if I let you share price over that time, it's down between 10% and 20%. So I guess, although we agree, the wider market clearly disagrees or clearly doesn't see the value in what you've created. And so I guess in that context, I also heard your comments about strategic review and perhaps fee income being a focus. But how sure are you that is enough to start closing the valuation gap on the peers? And at what point -- are we not approaching the point now after perhaps 5 or 10 years of this strategy where we start to think doesn't something more radical need to happen to actually start closing gap because you're now at a huge discount. I mean, Lloyd's is on [indiscernible], Natwest is on 0.8, 0.9. You're down 0.5 or less. And I'm just -- is there sort of a sense of how we can do something to close that. Does that make sense?"

It's clearly insufficient, right? That's what the price to book was steady. And I think there are 3 or 4 aspects of that. One aspect is the proportion of the bank's revenue, profits, risk-weighted assets that are sitting in the CIB. It does feel that, that is a drag on the overall valuation where it's at 60% to 70%, right? So in other words, the success of the CIB has been great, but it's now -- the rest of the bank has to pull its own weight. That's the part, again, where I'd say both within CIB and the rest of the bank that we've got to increase the proportion of relatively capital-light, relatively making revenue. And we are putting in place the pieces that allow us to think about this in and operate this in a good way.  So the merger of the private bank and the wealth business from the U.K. is one such piece. The investments we continue to make in our cards portfolio in the U.S. although I repeat the point I made earlier, not just to make investments in the card portfolio to make it more capital efficient or another part of that piece. And I think it's important also that we have -- we don't surprise the market in the way we did last year with that securities issuance problem. So we're spending a lot of time improving internal end-to-end management and efficiencies for that, we don't have negative surprises. But then ultimately, you come to the last part, which is to run the businesses at a very high level of operational efficiency, which includes in some part, scale, so that people believe that you can produce these higher returns sustainably over long periods of time and guide you to how we might do that. And I think we're spending time thinking about that. And at the right time, we'll share..."

So unless you're going to do something really material in terms of buying some retail banking or buying a big stable banking part to rebalance it and/or sell or close down a significant part of CIB. So the balance is not going to change materially. I mean it's been pretty much 60-40 for 7, 8 years I would imagine."

        "text": "Just a couple of quick ones for me. Firstly, apologies if I missed this earlier, but the webcast kept crashing it out. But can you give us any sense as to where mortgage completion margins were you in Q2? And the second question, perhaps a little bit more kind of slightly philosophical question about the structural hedge. Why are you reinvesting at the moment? Because if you reinvest in the structural hedge today, 5-year swap at kind of 4.8 on our probably after next week's base rate rise is going to be around 5.5. There's a negative spread there. And it feels like you've gone beyond hedging your current accounts and equity, and you're partially hedging now sort of deposits where you have effectively 100% deposit beta. So just philosophically, why are you reinvesting a structural hedge now? Why are you not actively looking to kind of run it down, whether it's a kind of negative to sort of near-term income."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "On your first point on mortgage completions. I think we've been pretty consistent in not quoting spread. All I would say to you is that the mortgage market is extremely competitive, largely intermediated, and you wouldn't expect our spreads to be markedly different from the market as a whole. What really matters, though, in mortgages is the current churn impact that we're getting, which, as I said, we'd expect to lessen into 2024. As to your second question, on the structural hedge and the philosophy around that. So the reason that we have the structural hedges to smooth the income of our banking book businesses over time. It is not there to be an expression of where we think rates will go, either up or down. It's there to protect and smooth the income pathways on those really important banking businesses for us, whether they be in corporate or in retail. And what it's done is it led to a slower income pathway on the way up. And to the extent that we keep reinvesting in it, it will stabilize our long return income. And at any point when rates start going back then, again, it will protect income on the down side. So for us, it's not an expression about how we feel on rates, it's actually an expression about how we manage our income and how we think about our risk actually in these critical franchise businesses. But thank you for the question. With that, I'd like to thank you all for your questions this morning and your continued interest on and focus on Barclays, not only for Q2, but the great questions on our longer-term strategy. If you've got further questions, please follow-up with the IR team or I will see many of you the week after next or analyst breakfast. But to everyone, I really hope you have a great summer break, and we will see you soon."

    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome to Barclays Q3 2023 Results Analyst and Investor Conference Call. I will now hand over to C.S. Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive, before I hand over to Anna Cross, the Groups Finance Director.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Good morning. Thank you for joining Anna and me on today's third quarter results call. Against a background of mixed market activity and a competitive environment for UK retail deposits, the Group generated income of 6.3 billion pounds in the quarter, down modestly year on year, excluding last year's impact from the over issuance of securities. Our profit before tax was 1.9 billion pounds with earnings per share of 8.3 pence. We maintained a strong capital position with our CET One ratio at 14%, up around 20 basis points on the second quarter and at the top of our target range. In this context, we delivered a third quarter return on tangible equity of 11%, taking us to 12.5% for the year to date and we continue to target above 10% for the full year. We are managing credit well, with year to date loan loss rate of 43 basis points versus our through the cycle guidance of 50 to 60 basis points costs reduced by 4% in Q Three year on year, excluding over issuance costs last year and in Q Four. We will continue to drive further efficiencies and greater productivity for the bank. We expect this to continue to contribute to delivering enhanced returns for shareholders. We will update you on these and other actions alongside our full year results in February. Now, turning to the business highlights. We continue to grow our US cards business with End net Receivables up 11% year on year at $30 billion, and we announced a new partnership with Microsoft and Mastercard to issue Xbox's first ever co branded card in the US. The integration of our UK wealth business and our private bank is also progressing well. We grew clients assets and liabilities to nearly 180,000,000,000 pounds and invested assets to around 105,000,000,000 pounds, with this business making nearly 900 million pounds of income in the year to date and generating attractive returns in investment banking. We led some prominent transactions in this quarter, including the Arm ICO in the US. However, in the mixed market environment we've had pockets of underperformance relative to US peers. In part, this has reflected our business composition. We performed well in equity capital markets, which is a smaller business for us relative to others. We were also selective on leveraged finance deals as a risk management matter, which has affected our debt capital markets performance. We continue to be cautious about the market backdrop, but are confident in the potential of our business. And as an example, we are acting as sole financial advisor to Capri in their $8.5 billion acquisition by Tapestry, announced in the third quarter and expected to close in 2024. In market, this was our second highest Q Three income print in a decade, with income of 4% quarter on quarter better than the US. Peer average. However, income was down 13% against a record Q Three last year on a comparable basis in which we supported clients through extreme volatility and guilt in our home UK market this quarter, we did not benefit to the same extent as our US peers did from the volatility in US rates. As we have said previously, investment in our combined fixed income and equity financing business delivers stability to our overall markets. Over the past four years, our ranking in equity prime brokerage has moved up from 7th rank to joint fifth, complementing our existing strength of fixed income financing, where we rank jointly first globally for the first half of 2023. Turning now to Barclays UK, we delivered a roti in the business above 20% for the quarter. Both income and expenses were broadly stable, generating a cost income ratio of 56%, and we intend to improve this over time as we continue to transform the business digitally. There has been an impact on our deposits and margins from retail customers seeking a higher return on their savings, which Anna will cover in more detail. However, at the group level, deposits were up 7 billion pounds quarter on quarter, demonstrating the strength of our diversified deposit and funding base. Our performance over the past three years compared to the previous five, shows that we have reset and stabilized group returns, providing a solid foundation on which to build even further. Anna and I look forward to providing an investor update in February alongside our full year results, where we will talk more about our plan to deliver further value to our shareholders. This will include setting out our capital allocation priorities as well as revised financial targets for costs, returns and shareholder distributions. We have just completed the 750,000,000 pound buyback announced at the half year, taking total shareholder distributions to around 1.2 billion pounds so far this year, including dividends and buybacks. This is up over 30% on the first half of last year and reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Thank you for listening and I will pass it on to Anna.\nAnna Cross: Thank you Venkatakrishnan, and good morning everyone. Turning now to slide six. Return on tangible equity for the third quarter was 11%, which takes us to 12.5% for the year to date. The cost income ratio was 63% in Q Three and 61% for the nine months, in line with our low 60s guidance for the full year. We continue to see limited signs of credit stress, as the loan loss rate for the quarter was 42 basis points and 43 for the nine months and we have maintained strong capital and liquidity positions. As you just heard from Venkatakrishnan, we will update you with revised financial targets at an investor update alongside our full year results. As part of this update, we are evaluating actions to reduce structural costs which may result in material additional charges in Q Four impacting this year's statutory performance, excluding any such charges. We continue to target a Roti above 10% for the full year, focusing now on Q Three. Starting on slide seven. There was no impact from the over issuance of securities this quarter, but given the largely offsetting impact to income and costs in Q Three last year, I will again use the adjusted numbers for the prior period. Group profit before tax was around 50 million lower at 1.9 billion, with income down 2% and costs down 4% year on year. Within total costs, operating costs were stable and there were no litigation and conduct charges this quarter, compared to 164,000,000 in Q Three last year. Impairment charges were up 52 million to 433,000,000, with the charge and business mix as we expected, largely driven by growth in US cards. Key NAV increased 25 Pence to 316 Pence, reflecting our profits and positive cash flow hedge reserve movements broadly offsetting last quarter's downward move. As usual, I will now cover the three key drivers of our returns, namely income costs and credit risk management. Starting on slide eight, group income was down 2% at 6.3 billion. The 8% stronger sterling US dollar rate in Q Three year on year reduced our reported income, around 40% of which is in dollars. CIB income fell 6%, with lower activity in the investment bank partially offset by corporate income growth year on year. Consumer cards and payments income was up 9%, driven by growth in US cards receivables and the UK wealth business transfer from Barclays UK in Q two, excluding the transfer, CCNP income was up 5% and Barclays UK income was up 1%. Net interest income across the bank grew by 179,000,000 or 6% year on year, driving a 13 basis point increase in group NIM to 3.98%. Barclays UK contributed around half of Group Nii this quarter, with approximately 20% from CIB and 30% from CCNP, mostly US cards, and the private bank Buk Nii was 17 million higher year on year with NIM of 304 basis points below where we anticipated at Q Two, which I will come back to when I cover Barclays UK. CCNP Nii increased by 64 million, mainly from US cards balance growth partially offset by private client deposit migration to our higher yielding products. This generated NIM of circa 8.9% in Q Three, which was up from circa 8.3% at Q Two and included a small one off increase in private bank, so we would expect NIM to step back a little in Q Four. CIB Nii increased 94 million year on year, which included an improvement of nine basis points to 3.65% in NIM, driven by the benefit of rate rises in transaction banking. Moving on to costs on slide ten, we are delivering our operating cost guidance with costs in Q Two and Q Three of around 4 billion below the Q One high point. The cost income ratio improved year on year to 63%, consistent with Q Two. Barclays UK cost income ratio was 56%, with total costs flat year on year. As we progressed our digital transformation and rationalization of the physical footprint and headcount consumer cards and payments operating costs increased by 9%, broadly in line with income. As we invested to grow US cards and our private bank CIB operating costs were stable year on year below the Q One level as guided as we said, we are evaluating actions to reduce structural costs across the group, and we'll give more detail at our investor update. Moving on to credit on slide eleven, we are seeing the benefit of our long standing, prudent approach to provisioning, both in terms of credit decisions we have taken in the past, reflected in our balance sheet provision and coverage ratios, as well as the credit protection we have in the CIB. The impairment allowance increased by 0.3 billion to 6.4 billion. This was primarily driven by our US. Cards portfolio. In line with our expectations, we updated the macroeconomic variables from Q Two, resulting in a modest impact on expected credit losses. We maintained robust coverage ratios of 1.4% for the group and 8.6% for our card portfolios in aggregate, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide. Starting with UK cards, we continue to see conservative customer behavior across our UK portfolios and credit performance remains benign. Customers are being disciplined about building unsecured balances with UK card repayment rates high across the credit spectrum. Although we have grown balances modestly over the past year, interest earning lending balances have decreased impacting NIM but benefiting credit performance. We do expect IELS to grow in 2024 as our more recent customer acquisition activity begins to mature. 30 days arrears rates remain stable and low relative to historic levels. The nature of our us. Cards proposition is different. As a reminder, we are the partner card issuer for around 20 client rewards programs, including some of the biggest brands in the US. Given our historic skew to travel and airlines, this is a high credit quality portfolio. Our risk mix has improved since the end of 2019, with 88% of the book above a 660 FICO, compared to 86% at the end of 2019, including the addition of the Gap portfolio in 2022. On the chart you can see that 30 day arrears rates are now in line with our pre pandemic experience at 2.7% as we expected. Our impairment coverage also increased to 9.7%, with stage two now at 35%, reflecting our expectation of higher unemployment from September's low level of 3.8% to a peak of 4.4% by Q three 2024. This would of course result in increased arrears, which are reflected in our balance sheet provisioning. Moving on to the impairment charge on slide 13. The impairment charge of 433,000,000 was up around 50 million year on year, giving a loan loss rate of 42 basis points. Most of the Q Three charge was driven by growth in US. Card balances. Continued seasoning of the Gap book in line with expectations and the increase in arrears that I mentioned. Our guidance of 50 to 60 basis points through the cycle is higher than the year to date experience. We are mindful that Q Four usually sees a higher charge, in part reflecting seasonality and our expectations of US cards growth over the holiday season. This generally leads to higher balances and some build an impairment under IFRS nine, where increased utilization, even by customers who are making timely payments, can trigger stage two migration. The Barclays UK charge was 59 million with a loan loss rate of ten basis points, and this has been below 30 now for nearly three years. Even though our customers are experiencing affordability pressures, this is not translating into credit stress as they manage their finances proactively. The CIB had a small release and we are seeing no real observed credit deterioration, with our synthetic credit protection also working well. Moving now to the business performance, starting with Bartheon's UK on slide 14, profits were stable year on year, with roti of 21% for the quarter. Excluding the UK, wealth transfer income was up 1%. Costs were broadly stable as our transformation plan progressed, resulting in a cost to income ratio of 56% for the quarter. Loan growth remained muted, reflecting customer caution in the current macroeconomic environment and our prudent risk positioning. The reduction in business banking assets was driven primarily by repayment of government backed loan schemes of 2.7 billion. Mortgage balances were stable in the quarter at 166,000,000,000, with Remortgaging still contributing most of the activity. Now looking at Buk NIM, which was 304 basis points. As a reminder, Buk Nii is around 25% of group income and one basis point of NIM equates to around 20 million of Nii annualized, or less than 0.1% of group income at Q Two. We said that we expected NIM to step down in Q Three and then to stabilize into Q Four. Most of the moving parts played out as expected in Q Three, with structural hedge tailwinds continuing and mortgage margin pressure somewhat easing. The impact of base rates was also in line given pass through rates have increased. However, the step down in NIM in Q Three was larger than expected, with deposit balance and mix trends more pronounced. Average balances quarter on quarter actually contributed a larger deposit effect than period end balances we have shown on the slide. When combined with pricing effects, this reduced NIM by a net 21 basis points compared to a net six basis points in Q Two. You can see that we grew deposits during the pandemic by 53 billion to 258,000,000,000 by the end of 2022. As customers built up cash with us in their current and Instant access accounts. We anticipated that these balances would fall as customers manage their finances proactively, paying down debt and locking in higher yields on their residual savings. Our current account moves appear in line with the latest bank of England industry data, but intense competitive pricing meant we did not capture as much of the flow into higher rate products. We emphasized at Q Two how sensitive guidance is to the level and mix of deposits, and this remains the case we now guide to a range of 305 to 310 basis points for the full year to help frame this. If we see similar trends in Q Four as we did in Q Three, both in terms of mix and volume, full year NIM would be towards the top end of this range. Turning now to structural hedge income, two thirds of which accrues to Barclays UK. Slide 16 illustrates the importance of the hedge to the level and visibility of our future net interest income. The hedge is designed to reduce volatility in nii, so in an environment where rates are peaking and eventually start to fall, it will help to stabilize NIM. It also provides a high degree of certainty to future nii. The chart shows that 95% of 2023 gross hedge income is already locked in, and the next two years portions of locked in nii have increased by three to 400 million per year since H one. As we rolled a further quarter of hedge maturities, notional hedge balances reduced by 4 billion in Q Three to 252,000,000,000. Given the trends we are seeing in retail deposits, we expect the notional balance to continue to reduce more or less in line with lower hedgeable deposits. Swap rates currently at around 4.5% means reinvestment rates remain well above maturing yields of around one to one and a half percent for the next two years, and with 50 to 60 billion of hedges maturing annually over this period, we expect the reinvestment effect to outweigh notional hedge declines. Turning now to consumer cards and payments on slide 17, growth in our US cards balances and the UK wealth transfer drove a 9% increase in CC and P income, partially offset by FX. We grew US cards balances by 11% year on year to $30 billion. In the private bank. Total invested assets were 105,000,000,000, up 27%, excluding UK wealth, as clients moved deposits to money market funds and other investments. With US payments income was modestly down year and year as customers adjusted their spending to lower value essential items which have lower margins, offsetting the 9% increase in payments. Processed roti was 9.6%, reflecting both higher income and operating costs year on year as we grow these businesses moving on to the CIB. CIB income fell 6% year on year in sterling terms, in part reflecting the stronger sterling US dollar rate. The more stable elements of our CIB income performed as we expected in markets. The relative stability from our combined fixed income and equity financing businesses was visible again compared to the downward move in intermediation and corporate delivered strong year on year income growth reflecting higher rates in transaction banking and the nonrepeat of leveraged finance marks this time last year in corporate lending. As you heard from ######, markets was down 13% in dollars versus a record third quarter in 2022. FIC fell 19% in dollars as we benefited less from US rates volatility compared to guilt volatility in the UK. This time last year, fixed income financing income reduced due to a normalization of inflation linked benefits, as we have mentioned previously, and we are smaller and securitized products, which was an area of strength for some of our peers. Equities was up 3% in dollars as derivatives and cash performance was partially offset by equity financing as client balances continued to grow, albeit as spreads tightened. Banking fees were down 24% year on year, with a better performance in ECM not sufficient to offset weaker DCM. And advisory, given the relative scale of those businesses for us, combined with stable costs and a small impairment release, roti was 9.2%, which, even in a mixed quarter like this one, does not reflect the potential of our franchise. CIB RWAs were relatively stable with the increase to 219,000,000,000 on Q Two, largely driven by FX. Turning now to capital funding and liquidity. Starting on slide 19, we continue to maintain a well capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. Looking at these metrics in more detail, starting with capital and slide 20, our CET One ratio increased around 20 basis points to 14% attributable profit generated 37 basis points, totaling 128 basis points over the last three quarters. As we indicated previously, our MDA hurdle increased to 11.8% from the increase in the UK countercyclical buffer, and we continue to operate with ample headroom whilst Basel 3.1 remains at proposal stage. We continue to guide to the day one RWA impact to be at the lower end of the five to 10% range. This reflects what we see from all the proposals across the jurisdictions we operate in, including the US. As a reminder, the PRA's rules remain the most relevant. On a group consolidated basis, our total deposit position remains stable as we have a diverse deposit franchise across consumer UK and international corporate customers. Within that, the decline in the UK deposits that we discussed earlier was more than offset this quarter by inflows from global corporates, and this places us in a strong position to manage seasonal fluctuations that we often see around yearend from balances held for financial sector clients. Our LCR of 159% represents a surplus of 116,000,000,000 above our minimum regulatory requirements. We continue to be comfortable with our liquidity position, and we have demonstrated its robustness throughout the market disruption earlier this year. So, concluding with our outlook, we are evaluating actions to reduce structural costs to help drive future returns, which may result in material additional charges in Q four impacting this year's statutory performance. Excluding any such structural cost actions, we continue to target roti above 10% in 2023 and a cost income ratio in the low 60s. Our loan loss rate guidance remains 50 to 60 basis points. This is higher than the year to date experience, allowing for some potential seasonality in US cards in Q Four. As of now, we are not seeing anything that concerns us and we would view the guidance as a through the cycle range. Our CET One ratio was at the top end of our target range, and strong capital generation in the year to date supports our commitment to return capital to shareholders. We will provide more details at an investor update at our full year results in February, including our capital allocation priorities and revised financial targets. Thank you for listening. We will now take your questions and as usual, please limit yourself to two per person so we get around to everybody.\nOperator: [Operator Insertions] Our first question today comes from [indiscernible ]from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions please. On first one on UK NIM, your guidance I think I understood the top end of the guidance, the 310, assumes a similar sort of deposit trend as in Q Three, I guess. Your guidance implicitly says that things could get worse in Q Four in terms of mix and volumes. Can you maybe sort of explain what happened during Q Three? And why have you given yourself some room for deteriorating trends? I think most of the guidance from your peers and maybe even yourselves was that once the rate sort of hikes were over, you would see much more stable deposits. So interested to see why you've left yourself some room for deterioration. And second question is on the restructuring charge in Q Four. Obviously your 10% Rot guidance is now x this restructuring charge. Question is, how much is that going to interfere with the payout and with buybacks that you may announce at the end of the year? Because I would have thought, given the provisions are going much better than expected, you would have had plenty of room to cover potential restructuring without going into your Rot guidance. But that doesn't seem to be the case. So maybe how should we think about year end distribution? Obviously capital going better, but more restructuring costs. Maybe sizing that restructuring costs will be helpful. Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you. Good morning and thanks for starting off the questioning. I'll take the first one and then I'll pass to Venkatakrishnan for the second half of that. So let me just talk through UK NIM in the third quarter and just to level set and reiterate what I said on the call. A basis point of NIM is 20 million annualized, less than 0.1% of groups income. What we said at Q Two was that we expected NIM to step down in the third quarter and somewhat stabilized into the fourth. There were a few moving parts within that and much of it has played out as we expected. So we've seen a lessening of the impact of mortgage churn, we've seen a continued tailwind from the structural hedges. Actually, deposit pricing played out roughly as we expected. And you can see that that's negative in the quarter for the first time, as we indicated it might be. What's really different is the movement in deposits. And what I said on the call earlier was that actually the movement in average deposits is a bit more significant than the quarter end might indicate. And whilst we saw very similar trends to the overall bank of England movement in current accounts through the quarter, we captured less of that into fixed term deposits than we might have expected to. And that related purely to the intensity of competition that we saw during the quarter and very intense at particular points. And it's really that that's made the difference. So I would say it's depositor behavior that has somewhat intensified in response to pricing. So previously we said that we expected that to be more stable in Q Four and that's simply because in Q Four you typically see a deposit stabilization pre Christmas. We now no longer anticipate that just because of these competitive dynamics and that's really what's causing us to change that outlook. We're not saying that it will be better or worse in the fourth quarter. I think what we are saying is that this customer deposit behavior has been relatively difficult to predict and that's why we're giving you a range indicating to you that if we saw something similar, that would be towards the top of that range. So that's the reason for the changing guidance. ######.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yeah. Thanks I'm sure you sort of caught this through the presentation, but just to add on the NIM point, for 1 minute overall group deposits, as #### said, buk NIM is part of our overall NIM. Our overall deposits grew about 7 billion quarter on quarter and our Nii is up about 6% year on year at 3.2 billion and NIM itself at 3.98%. At the group level, again 13 bips higher. So think about in the larger context and also coming back to the restructuring charge, two things I would say. One is you should think of this structural cost action as in part of the investor update which we will provide in February. So what this is, is we have to announce it now because as we work through it, we will likely take a charge in Q Four. That's why we announce it now. But you should think of it as not something related to a quarter or the last two quarters, but part of the larger structural improvement of efficiency and productivity for the bank. As for your specific question, what I would say is a few things. Number one is that we very deliberately start this quarter at a strong capital position of 14% and we've got a capital generation of about 130 basis points of CET One ratio year to date. This underpins our ability to return capital to shareholders. As far as our desire, you know, we completed a 750,000,000 buyback in the first half. And so total distributions so far this year are 1.2 billion, which is about 30% higher versus the first half of last year. And this really reflects our commitment to return capital to shareholders. We spoke about the efficiencies we are driving across the group equally. You should know that we are comfortable to operate in the full range of 13% to 14% and we have been there in the past. Obviously, any capital action ultimately is approved by the board and approved by regulators. But from our point of view and we'll come back with the details in February from our point of view, good initial starting position, good capital generation across the bank. Understand the importance and the priority to our shareholders of returning capital, willingness to operate through the range.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Napier from UBS. Please. Go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJason Napier: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two for me. The first is coming back to the issue of the flagged restructuring charges. as you mentioned, capital really strong and in fact, the Q Three beat alone is a billion pounds relative to consensus. And so I guess anything that you could say to provide a rough sense of how much you're looking at spending here. I appreciate this is not the venue at which you wanted to give it, but today conversations with the investors are that there seem to be risks on the payout front, with no sense of how much cost savings we might be talking about or where in the group you might be looking to be more efficient. Clearly, we think it's the right thing to be doing, but the billion beat on CT One is 7% of annual group costs. You could do a lot with that. So anything you can do to be helpful on what the payback would be for the charges that are already in mind and which are triggering these provisions, that'd be the first and then secondly linked to that at your conference in New York last September. Last month, before, you said you were happy with the mix of business for the group. And so I wonder whether you'd give us a sense as to when you talk about updating investors on capital allocation priorities, whether you're really just talking about what grows faster in future or whether we should have in mind a sense that the present mix of capital allocation is up for debate. Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yeah. Good questions. Thank you. Let me begin on both of them and then I'll let #### add on on any details. So on the capital versus the spending, look, this is not the right place to be giving think you. Know, as I said in the answer to the previous question from ######, we started a good point on capital. We've been accretive on capital and view the spending and the restructuring in the larger term context. I'll let #### add to that in a minute. And on the second thing, what I would say mean I view the investor update in a simple way. It's obviously complex to analyze and execute, but I view the question in a simple way. It is what do you think is the target return that this bank can generate for its shareholders? So what's the rote ambition? How is it comprised at the group level and in the individual businesses? How much can it improve in the individual businesses and therefore, what is it that you wish to fund in that improvement? I also said in New York, it's very, very clear that the market values different businesses differently and we obviously have to take that into account in the way in which we think about our capital. So, you know, you sort of put it all together and you get the picture of where we think we want to go. But obviously more details on that later. And then ultimately, once you do that, then to be targeted about saying what of that growth and return you wish to you target returning to investors? Because I do absolutely take the point that we announce the buybacks on a half yearly basis and we don't have a target out there for that. And that would be something that I think our investors would find desirable. ####?\nAnna Cross: Thanks. We're still going through the process of evaluating those actions, as we said. So we haven't come to a finalized list yet. We have called them material. Let me help you a little. You'll note that from our RA we have called out the year to date restructuring charge is around 120,000,000. So we've shown that to you and told you that it's largely in the UK. In any typical year we run at between two or 300 million. So by calling this out, we're indicating to you that it will be higher than that. But I can't comment on specific levels simply because we haven't finished the work. But as ###### said, as we take those decisions, we're extremely focused on future returns and we understand and are committed to shareholder returns. So that's very much in our mind. The other point around sort of the strength of the capital position. We've been operating with good cost and capital discipline all year. That's clearly the foundation of where we step out from in February and we'll tell you more then.\nJason Napier: Thanks very much.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Okay, thank you. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from [indescribable ]from bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Please go ahead your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much. I just wanted to sorry, come back on the Buk NIM and really the trends that you were seeing on deposits through the third quarter and then what you're seeing so far in October. So, you mentioned that the averaging effect was actually worse than the endpoint position, suggesting that actually things got better in September, perhaps. So I was wondering if that's continued in October. So really how we should think about sort of the trajectory of those deposit flows through the quarter and then into Q Four. And then, just to clarify that when you say if Q Three trends continue, then expect to be at the top of the guided range, is that essentially taking the margin bridge on slide 15 and excluding the five basis points impact from pricing is how to think about that. Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thanks, Why don't I take those? So what we really mean by the averaging point is that the outflows were probably a bit more evenly spread through the quarter than they were in the second quarter, where we saw somewhat of an increase in intensity towards the second half. I don't think it was lessened in September at all. There were certainly quite a few headline rates out there that were extremely competitive in terms of October. I just call out the fact that we haven't yet seen the first month's end, so we're still midway through the first month. There's nothing in what we can see so far that's really sort of beyond our expectations. All right. With our own forecast, that's all I can really say at this point in time. But I would just sort of highlight that what we're seeing is the impact of the pricing in terms of the sort of range of guidance. What we're really saying, rather than any particular point on the bridge, is that depending on where those deposit flows go, you could end up with a very different exit rate. So that's what we're really calling out to you. And clearly, if we saw trends similar to what we saw I e. The deposit trends continue similar to what we saw in Q Three, we would be towards the top end of that range. And that would give you a particular jumping off point for 2024. What I would highlight, though, is that the structural hedge continues to protect the NIM overall. And what you have seen over the last quarter is that we've been able to lock in another large chunk, both of 2023 income, but another three to 400 million of 24 and 25 income just because of the way that hedge is rolling month on month. Thank you.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you. Just a quick follow up, if I could then. So given that you talked about the hedge into the coming years and you were expecting this deposit stabilization in Q Four, do you have a view going into next year in terms of deposit trajectory, given what you're seeing in terms of competition in the market? What this year has taught us is that customer deposit behavior is quite difficult to call. So what I'm not going to do is give you a 2024 NIM outlook. What I can tell you is that there are three factors that we're looking at. One is positive, one is neutral, and one is more negative. So the positive impact is clearly the impact of the structural hedge. And remember that two thirds of that goes into buk. The more neutral impact is that we do expect and we are seeing that the impacts, quarter on quarter of mortgage churn are starting to dissipate called that out for some time. What is more difficult to call is the impact of this ongoing deposit behavior, both the reduction in deposits because customers are using them in order to manage the broader economic environment, but also then seeking higher rates, difficult to call out when that would stabilize #####. But all I can say is that there are other factors in the mix, most importantly, the structural hedge. SPEAKER A Okay, thank you very much for that. Okay, thank you. Next question, please. Our next question comes from ##### #### from Autonomous. Please. Go ahead, #####. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two please. One on NIM and one on #####. So appreciate everything you've said about the difficulty in predicting deposit behavior and the fact that the UK NIM is not the be all, end all for your group revenue dynamic. But obviously we've had some pretty dramatic shifts in your NIM guidance over a few quarters. And there's a huge range of possible four Q exit levels implied by the range you're now giving us. So a very simple question. Please help us own views on what might happen. What's the average cost of your deposit balances in the UK and what proportion? And then on Roti in terms of the risk to the 10% Roti target, inclusive of restructuring charges, if I just kind of run the numbers on your equity for the year to date and Wave are out of four. Q to get to, say, a 9% Roti, including restructuring charges that would imply sort of a negative bottom line number for the fourth quarter. You've obviously delivered pretty strong Roti year to date. The fact that you're flagging potentially not being able to hit the greater than 10% Roti inclusive of restructuring charges implies fourth quarter could be a net loss. Is that the right way for us to be thinking about this? And within that, when you're flagging the 120,000,000 of restructuring charges year to date, is it the case that when we get to the fourth quarter, the catch up to the normal 200 to 300 is going to be excluded from your Roti calculation as well? How are you thinking about that? Is two to 300 in the Roti calculation and then the exceptional charge on top of that excluded? Or is the whole amount potentially going to be excluded when you calculate your rotate end of the year to assess delivery on that target. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much, #####. Why don't I take those two and I'm sure ###### will add it if he wants to. So you're right, there has been some considerable movement on the UK NIM, particularly over the last quarter. As I said, clearly that's driven by customer deposit behaviour. I would highlight for you that as we look at UK NIM, we are actually looking at quite a narrow measure. So in comparison to our peers, remember, they would be including all of the corporate income and asset base within there. And so really you should be looking, as you make comparisons to the rest of the UK, you should be looking across both the UK and the corporate NIM position. We don't disclose the average rate paid on our deposits, although what we have given you this time to be more helpful is a split of our deposit balances and indeed how that has trended over time. And it's showing very clearly that movement into term, as you would expect, and as many have commented from bank of England data on your second question. So to be clear, what we are not doing is giving any kind of PBT forecast for the fourth quarter here. It wouldn't be appropriate for us to do so. Not least, we haven't concluded our assessment of the structural actions that we may take. Merely what we're calling out is a few things. Firstly, we're clearly going into the fourth quarter with good Roti momentum. We've delivered 12.5% year to date, somewhat ahead of consensus. However, the fourth quarter does have some seasonal impacts in it. So typically we see lower CIB income, typically we see higher impairment in US cards in particular, simply because of the seasonality in spending. We also see impacts from the bank levy. And we've just given you an indication that we see a continuation of deposit trends in the UK. So not saying anything more than that in that typically you expect Roti to be lower in the fourth quarter than in the preceding three. And to the extent that we take decisions in that fourth quarter, that may impact the Roti now, as we do so, we are very focused on future returns for the business. So our overall objective here is to improve the returns of the business through time. Clearly, efficiency and effectiveness is a key part of that. So we're just calling out our intention to continue that cost focus for the business. Yeah, and I cannot emphasize that last point that #### I cannot emphasize too much that last point which #### made, which is that think about this in terms of the investor update in February and the longer term plan for productivity and efficiency in this bank. If I could just follow up on the roti point first, please. I mean, the year to date you've done 4.4 billion profit. Your average tangible is probably going to be something like 47 billion for the year. So you're pretty much all the way there to delivering a 10% royalty on the nine months to date. But to get to a point where you're flagging to us that you might not do greater than ten for the full year unless I'm missing something there, the maths implies potentially very material restructuring charges. Am I missing something there? It does seem in the context of a debate where I had some investors asking whether you might be announcing a surprise buy, this is obviously kind of top of mind for your investor base. How are you going to be balancing these things? Are we looking at potentially greater than a bit of restructuring or cost to achieve or whatever? We're going to be titling it in the fourth quarter. That's by the maths even, except the point about seasonality et. So, I understand the maths of what you're putting in front of me. I'm going to say the same thing that we have not yet concluded on those plans. To the extent that we do, we will update the market further at full year, both in terms around the costs, but also the ongoing impact that we would expect them to have, just as investors do. Distributions are top of our mind too, as ###### pointed out. So as we take these decisions, we will be extremely mindful. And as you said previously, we go into the fourth quarter very deliberately at the top end of our capital range. And on the deposit cost point. If I could on that as well, please. If I frame it slightly differently, how do you expect investors to be able to take a view on what might happen with the buk NIM unless we're armed with some basic information about what you're currently paying on deposits relative to the types of offers that are out there in the market. You'll flag competitive offers as a key driver for the fact you're re guiding them lower and seeing deposit attrition, but we don't know how much better those rates are relative to what you're currently paying or had been paying earlier in the. So it's very difficult for us to take a view on what's going to without. So, all I would say is that we price competitively, but not uncommercially. If you look at our savings, pricing is very clearly indicated both on our website and indeed in any branch. You will see that we are competitively positioned across our term deposits, across our Isas, across our instant access, for example, rainy day saver. So we don't genuinely believe that there's something mispriced in our savings franchise. We're happy with it. From quarter to quarter, you will see other competitors operating in a different way. Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Okay, next question, please. The next question comes from [Indiscernible]from BNP Paribas. Please. Go ahead, guy. Your line is now open. Hi. Morning, everyone. A couple of questions on deposits.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Firstly, the UK and then outside the UK. So first I'm trying to understand the comment that pricing played out as expected. Are you talking for Barclays or for the industry? As I would think about pricing and then movements and deposits for individual institutions as very much linked, had you priced up more in line with some peers than the balance move, wouldn't have been such a headwind. So perhaps you could clarify that point. I'm just trying to think about in the context of how you might want to react more to protect balances in the future in a competitive marketplace and then outside the UK, clearly that was much stronger. Could you just give a bit more color around what you're seeing, what the strategy is there and sort of are you having to pay up or is this very much profitable deposit growth that you're seeing outside the UK? Thank you. Okay, thanks guy. I'll take both of those. So what I meant by the pricing was, as we expected, clearly we knew at Q Two, when we reported to you the price changes we were going to make, and therefore that deposit bucket, the one that's called bank rate, is broadly as we expected it to be. Now, what subsequently happened to both the level and mix of deposits is much more driven by the external competitive environment. And that's what we are calling out very similarly to what I just said to #####. We are happy with the overall level of our savings pricing. Our strategy is to encourage our customers to develop healthy savings habits. We are pricing to, as far as possible, maintain our franchise rather than attract hot money. And we will price competitively, but not uncommercially. So to the extent that we see competitive pricing going in that direction, then obviously we would not follow it. I think the other thing just to put in the mix, as everybody is looking at the impact of buk NIM, please do not discount the impact of impairment. So all of this behaviour, this conservatism and behavior is also flowing through into the impairment line. And buk impairment has been lower than consensus for nine successive quarters. So just worth bearing that in mind. Second point that you asked about, which is around the deposit elsewhere in a high rate, persistently high inflationary environment, we would expect to see high level deposits flow from retail customers towards corporates. That's exactly what we see. And given our franchise, that is what you're observing. So UK corporate deposits are very stable. You see some migration, but very stable in totality. And what we've seen in the quarter is a continued inflow more from global corporates. That's particularly fairly long tenor term funding, competitively priced, but good for the deposit franchise overall. So, very much a continuation of what we called out actually in Q Two and indeed Q One.\nAnna Cross: If I may just step in and emphasize the point #### made about the link between deposits and impairment. I think to me it's one of the interesting things that we've seen, where we've seen people using their deposits to pay down debt, whether it's mortgages or other things. One, it showed that they had the ability to do it. So obviously it's helpful with impairments, but it also gives you an idea of the type of credit quality of customer we have, which I think is a good thing. So, as #### said, nine quarters continuously of positive surprises, meaning lower impairments than consensus in buk and people using deposits to pay down debt. It's all a good thing about credit quality. Okay, thank you. Thank you, guy. Next question, please.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: The next question comes from from RBC.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Morning both, and thank you for taking my questions. The firstly is around just some recent press speculation that you're looking to sell a stake in your UK merchant acquiring business. I know you won't want to comment on that directly, so perhaps the best way to phrase the question is to ask what do you think is the best way of Barclays generating value out of its UK merchant acquiring business going forward? And then secondly, I noted your statement around the PRA rules being the most relevant to the expected impact under Basel 3.1 in that context. The regulator gave a Mansion House speech last week. Our interpretation of that speech is that we'll likely see a softening of the rules around Basel 3.1 when they're announced later this year and in May 2024. Would you agree with that assertion? Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan : Right, let me take both of them. First of all, in the UK merchant acquiring business, I think we are fortunate that we've got a business that has both issuances and acceptance. And it is very much a business which is targeted at corporates and SMEs. And what it does is that it adds another quiver to our arrow. It's a very positive quiver to our arrow. When we deal with them, we provide them transaction services, we provide them obviously, baited banking, foreign exchange services and then payments. So merchant acquiring the business itself overall is very good. I think there's a broader strategic question for us which other banks have faced, which is it's a very technology driven business. What is your comparative advantage in this? Is your comparative advantage in developing the technology or in implementing the technology or building machines which you put with clients? Or is your comparative advantage in helping service them as part of a larger set of banking services? That's the question we are looking at. And then I think the commercial arrangement will come out of the answer to that question. So that's the way we are thinking about that business. As far as Basel 3.1 goes, I would say two things. I also read the Mansion House speech with interest. I think the UK rules are solidifying. They will probably on the market risk side resemble the US rules and it is still too soon to say how much of an impact, what kind of changes going forward there are from what we've seen. So I don't want to sort of comment one way or another. I mean, the only thing I will say on this more broadly is I think at the end of the day, I know there's some commentary from the US banks that the impacts are greater on them. But these capital regimes, and we've been under the UK capital regime, of course these capital regimes are very difficult to calculate apple for apple. And so I think at the end of it, when you look at what the Fed has done and when you look at what the bank of England has done, what you're probably going to have is roughly comparable capital regimes between the US and the UK. Roughly comparable. So let me just round that off. I think, ###, we're obviously we know these speeches with interest, but we're waiting the final rules both in the US and in the UK and elsewhere. And of course we don't yet know what the impact of any changes around Color Two might be. So until we see it in print, still some uncertainty. So we continue to guide to that 5% to 10% that we've given you before, erring, towards probably the bottom end of that range. But thank you for the question. Next question, please. The next question comes from [Indescribablefrom Numis.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Go ahead, Your line is now open. Hello there. Two from me again, please. The first, I just wondered what was in this seven basis points other drag that's coming through in the UK MIM in the quarter. I think you described it in the email as product mix, but is it just that or is there some treasury effect coming through there again like we saw earlier in the year and if so, how large? The second question is to focus on one of the bright spots of today's numbers that the TNAV very powerful move in the third quarter and the cash for hedge reserve seems to run my own by about 20%, I think, in just three months. I don't want to preempt anything you're going to say for the year on new financial targets and the like, but are you completely comfortable that in the medium term, including next year in 2025, that you can still do greater than 10% Rote target as it is today? All in, including any additional structural cost of actions, are taken through next year against this quite powerful move up in the Tnab? Because there's nothing to suggest the Tnab isn't going to keep moving up a pace from here. So they're the two questions. A - C.S. Venkatakrishnan \u2013 Okay, thanks I will take both of those. So in the seven bits other it is product, it contains pretty much everything else that isn't to the left. There's nothing significant in there individually, there's a bit of cards. There's a bit of business banking, as we see the government backed lending being paid down. There's also a little bit on barclays partner payments, barclays partner finance, rather. You might recall that we said that we were pausing new business in that space whilst we replatformed that business technology wise, because that's unsecured. Although it's small, it can have an impact on NIM. So nothing more than that. Nothing specifically in treasury to call out at all on TNAV. Clearly, that has moved significantly in the quarter. In part, that is actually a reversal of what you saw from the beginning of the year. So just to sort of unpack this a little bit, clearly what drives TNAV over time is attributable profit and us driving good returns, as we have done this quarter. So that's eight basis points. There was also three basis points that came from the fact that we'd conducted a large part of the share buyback by the end of the quarter. And this is obviously a per share measure. You're right to call out the cash flow hedge reserve, which was ten pence in this single quarter. But if you look at the disclosures at the back of the results announcement, actually, you can see that quarter to quarter, these reserve movements can be relatively material. And the third quarter just unwound the position from the beginning of the year. And what's actually going on here is that as rates fell back a little bit in the third quarter, the negative drag from that cash flow hedge reserve just lessened a little bit. But that was just unwinding. You might recall in the second quarter, there was a big move in the opposite direction that actually depressed TNAV. So really, as we think going forward from here, we try and strip out that kind of quarter to quarter volatility. What we're really focused on is the accretion of profit and driving robust returns. And that's really what we'll come back to you on in february. I want to come back to deposits and competition for deposits again. Clearly you've been surprised in the quarter by the level of competition out there, but the comments you're giving us back is very much that you're confident in your current pricing. I mean, what needs to change in terms of the level of competition out there for your view on that to change? If you look at your savings rates, they're clearly a step below your closest peers. And from what we can see in the data, then you're losing deposits that, whilst pricing up might be a threat to NIM, at least you're keeping deposits on the platform. So I just want to kind of understand your approach to competition short term, but also medium term. If these very competitive rates continue to stay out there. And second, you mentioned on the hedge that the hedge come down in relation to your hedgeable deposits. If I look at the disclosures you're giving us today, then it looks like you're hedging much, much more of your savings products than your peers. So I'd just like to get a bit more color around how you run that hedge versus your deposits, what your hedgeable deposits actually are, and how you see those developing over the next couple of quarters. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Why don't I take those and I'm sure ###### might add, particularly on pricing. So as I said on the previous answer, we are pretty comfortable with the way that we are placed on our pricing. Clearly, there is a difference in competitive pricing across the industry between what I would describe as bigger banks and challenger banks who might have a different need for liquidity, particularly over the next couple of years as Tffme runs off. So we are mindful of that and we keep our savings pricing under review. But as we are making savings decisions, we think about the franchise and we think about our liquidity and our balance sheet. Those decisions will be different bank by bank and institution by institution. And I wouldn't comment further than that. In terms of the hedge, our hedge strategy has been very consistent over the last few years. So what we do is we identify rate sensitive balances, we exclude those from the hedge, and then on top of that, we maintain a buffer and we hedge the remaining balance. We monitor that hedge on a monthly basis. And what you can see year to date is that we have trimmed our corporate hedge thus far. We do that by making the decision to pause all our part of the role month by month. And those are active decisions that we take. So we've got ample opportunities to adjust that hedge as we see deposits behavior changing as compares our hedge strategy versus competitors. I wouldn't comment on it. Just to follow up then, does that imply you see rate insensitive balances within your savings accounts? There are some balances within our deposits overall that are rate insensitive. So much of our current accounts would be rate insensitive simply because they relate to operational deposits. That will be true in Buk, as it is in the corporate bank, as it is in the private bank, although you'd expect those constituents to behave differently. So that is certainly true. There is also some rate insensitivity in savings because customers, and indeed corporates, do use some of their savings balances as sort of rainy day funds simplistically. And particularly in instant access accounts, we see customers turning over their savings within the period of about a year, for example. So we have demonstrable evidence of that insensitivity. ####, great. SPEAKER A The next question. Your line is now open. Yes. Morning everybody. Could I just ask you just trying to get the implications right for sort of 24 and 25 now, because if I look at the maths correctly, and I suppose I'm just checking my maths here, it looks like you've got an exit margin of somewhere around 290 into next year. And I guess we would imagine that that's going to continue to deteriorate because a lot of these deposit trends are long term trends. If you look back to the last time, interest rates were at 5%, the structure of a deposit franchise was completely different and the margins were much smaller than you're getting today. If that is the case, that looks to me like we're looking at maybe 500, 600 million off consensus for next year just for net interest income. And yet consensus is only looking at a 10% return on tangible even. Now, I assume you want 10% to be some sort of a base and you wouldn't want to be delivering lower than that. Is it the cost? Is it the cost program? Should we be looking at the cost program to offset that? Is that where the difference comes from? Or how else can we get ourselves back to 10%? Or should we be thinking that actually that is a risk? Now. Let me take that and I'm sure will add sure. I'm not going to comment on the exit rate from Q four. What we've done is we've given you a range, ed, we've told you what will happen if we see similar deposit trends. No, but I've just taken my math, that was all. We know what three are. Okay, so it is two nights. That's great. Thanks. Yeah. So your math, as I would expect, I'm sure, is very robust. As we've said before, it may or may not deteriorate next year. I mean, we've got a real tailwind from the hedge, so I'm going to go back to that. Secondly, we've got this neutralization of the mortgages month to month, and then you have ongoing deposit behavior. So you're right to say that we're in a different place to where we were sort of and we're going all the way back to 2006, 2007. I mean, I would remind you that at that point the liquidity positions of the very large banks was very different. So all of the large banks were running loan to deposit ratios well in excess of 100%, 100 and 5161 hundred and 70% in some instances. And therefore those fixed term deposits were essentially being used in lieu of wholesale funding to large part. So it's a different structure of market overall. So I'm not going to comment on where we end, but I would urge you to consider that we then make the jump from buk to group. So a percentage point or a bit of buk roti is 20 million. That is 0.1% of group income. So in all of these considerations, we need to consider the rest of the group. So, yes, Buk NIM is stepping back a bit, but we're also in a position where actually the market for markets, and particularly banking, is significantly depressed. So banking is coming off a decade low. We've seen pretty low levels of unsecured lending in the UK, relatively muted demand for wholesale debt, both in SMEs and in corporate. And of course, if you look across into CCNP, the US cards business continues to grow and the private bank continues to so I take the math point on Buk, but it is a relatively small part of the group. You're right to call out efficiency. We're very focused on that. We see that as a key part of driving our returns. And obviously we'll come back to you with the whole picture in February. Yeah, and I'll just add on the efficiency part of the structural cost actions. Think of it as a longer term approach to increasing the growth of this bank. That's what the efficiency is about. It's not about making ledger work. Can I just come back on that in terms of efficiency, though, are we talking CIB efficiency? Because your retail bank is making over a 20% return on equity. I mean, that feels like a really good number on most benchmarks. I don't know why you would want to take costs out of that particularly. So is it like head office and CIB or where would we be seeing that? So, look, we'll give you the details later. I applaud you for recognizing the rote of our retail bank. It has not come up yet, but you're absolutely right. It's doing 20% and it's doing well. But in every part of the bank, there are things which we can do better. Okay. And so that's not to take away from the performance of the retail bank. ####, I wouldn't have okay, thanks. Thanks. The next question comes from Jefferies. Please. Go ahead, ######. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess a couple of things. Just going back to this charge that you intend to take in Q Four, could you just talk about what your hurdles are in terms of payback and timing, just to give us a sense of time frame and payback? And then secondly, on the CC and P margin, there was a 63 on my number, 63 bips pickup, quarter on quarter in the margin, which was significant. And I guess how do you think about the trajectory of that, particularly given the growth in US receivables? And I presume that a fair amount of the growth in the US receivables is coming from the GAAP, which is a higher yielding book. So how do we think about the margin trajectory in CC and P? Okay. Thank you, I'll take those. I'm not going to go into the Q Four charge in detail at this juncture, we're obviously still evaluating actions. You might expect that depending on what those charges relate to, the payback might be slightly different. So you'd expect, for example, property to take longer to pay back, whereas other actions that we might take would be faster. But when we talk to you in February, ##, we will outline what we've done and what we expect that payback to be. In terms of CCNP, you're correct. The net interest margin has stepped forward in the quarter. There are two real impacts in there. The first is growth in US receivables. So the growth in the cards business, as we said, balances are up 11% year on year, and that clearly has a powerful effect. At the same time, we see deposit migration in the private bank, which is no different to what we see in either corporate or in Buk. So that has an offsetting impact. Although in the private bank, what we see is a flow into invested assets. So we retain that income. It just goes on to a different line. There is a one off in the third quarter. It's not huge, but I would strip that out. Ongoing. So that's why we're saying we'd expect Q four NIM to step back towards Q two NIM. So don't think of this step up as permanent. Think there is momentum in the number, but this is somewhat exaggerated by that one off. Okay. And then can I just be cheeky and ask one other question, just given because I think there's been some confusion. If it's a small one, it's kind of a yes or no question anyway. But do you expect to deliver in line with your 10% or greater return in 2024? We will come back to you on 2024 guidance when we talk to you at the full year. As ###### said, that's when we plan to update the market on our expectations for returns, capital allocation, costs, distributions. But you should read that we are very focused on returns. Ongoing. Thank you. Okay, thank you. So can we go to the final question, please? Our final question today comes from from City. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me on two questions. One, hopefully very short. First question. You're encouraging us to look at the group Nii, including the CIB. So perhaps you could just comment on the transaction. Banking revenues obviously up a lot year on year, but they are down Q on Q, which slightly bucks the trend versus what we've seen at US peers. So perhaps you could elaborate on what drove the Q and Q decline there. And then second and broader point on deposits and pricing just in relation to the 14 point FCA Action plan. I think their fair value assessment was due by the end of August. You had to provide details on communication and evidence, what you are providing to the consumer by end september. I think the next big thing is this whole debate around on sale versus offsell, which comes in from the 31 July 2024. So anything you could say on on sale versus offsell, how big a bucket of offsell products you have, how the pricing compares, et cetera, et cetera. Thank you. Okay, so let me start in terms of transaction banking, did step back quarter on quarter, there was a relatively small impact from deposit migration. And again, I would say within corporate we're seeing migration from our non interest bearing into interest bearing, but those deposits are remaining within the bank. So that's certainly not the larger part of it. What we did see is an impact from the returns in our liquidity buffer. There's nothing idiosyncratic going on. There more that for any liquidity buffer, the returns are in two parts. The first is the carry, and then the second is, in any particular quarter, you would see some disposal income. In this environment, that disposal income has been very low. And given that much of that buffer income is actually attributed to transaction banking, it's had a disproportionate impact in this quarter that will obviously move around a little bit. So we'll see what happens through the Fourth. So on the consumer duty piece on SCA, we actually did our mailing through July and August in relation to savings. That was exactly, as you point out, designed to ensure that our customers are very much aware of the savings businesses that we have and the rates on offer. And increasingly, we see our customers using digital means to look and observe that anyway. But that mailing is behind us. We will do a further mailing in November and December to our current accounts. And for us, off sale is relatively small, so I wouldn't call it out as an impact. And okay, so with that, thank you, #####, for the #### rather for your final question. Really appreciate you attending the call today. Thank you for your continued interest.+",

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for joining Anna and me on today's third quarter results call. Against a background of mixed market activity and a competitive environment for UK retail deposits, the Group generated income of 6.3 billion pounds in the quarter, down modestly year on year, excluding last year's impact from the over issuance of securities. Our profit before tax was 1.9 billion pounds with earnings per share of 8.3 pence. We maintained a strong capital position with our CET One ratio at 14%, up around 20 basis points on the second quarter and at the top of our target range. In this context, we delivered a third quarter return on tangible equity of 11%, taking us to 12.5% for the year to date and we continue to target above 10% for the full year. We are managing credit well, with year to date loan loss rate of 43 basis points versus our through the cycle guidance of 50 to 60 basis points costs reduced by 4% in Q Three year on year, excluding over issuance costs last year and in Q Four. We will continue to drive further efficiencies and greater productivity for the bank. We expect this to continue to contribute to delivering enhanced returns for shareholders. We will update you on these and other actions alongside our full year results in February. Now, turning to the business highlights. We continue to grow our US cards business with End net Receivables up 11% year on year at $30 billion, and we announced a new partnership with Microsoft and Mastercard to issue Xbox's first ever co branded card in the US. The integration of our UK wealth business and our private bank is also progressing well. We grew clients assets and liabilities to nearly 180,000,000,000 pounds and invested assets to around 105,000,000,000 pounds, with this business making nearly 900 million pounds of income in the year to date and generating attractive returns in investment banking. We led some prominent transactions in this quarter, including the Arm ICO in the US. However, in the mixed market environment we've had pockets of underperformance relative to US peers. In part, this has reflected our business composition. We performed well in equity capital markets, which is a smaller business for us relative to others. We were also selective on leveraged finance deals as a risk management matter, which has affected our debt capital markets performance. We continue to be cautious about the market backdrop, but are confident in the potential of our business. And as an example, we are acting as sole financial advisor to Capri in their $8.5 billion acquisition by Tapestry, announced in the third quarter and expected to close in 2024. In market, this was our second highest Q Three income print in a decade, with income of 4% quarter on quarter better than the US. Peer average. However, income was down 13% against a record Q Three last year on a comparable basis in which we supported clients through extreme volatility and guilt in our home UK market this quarter, we did not benefit to the same extent as our US peers did from the volatility in US rates. As we have said previously, investment in our combined fixed income and equity financing business delivers stability to our overall markets. Over the past four years, our ranking in equity prime brokerage has moved up from 7th rank to joint fifth, complementing our existing strength of fixed income financing, where we rank jointly first globally for the first half of 2023. Turning now to Barclays UK, we delivered a roti in the business above 20% for the quarter. Both income and expenses were broadly stable, generating a cost income ratio of 56%, and we intend to improve this over time as we continue to transform the business digitally. There has been an impact on our deposits and margins from retail customers seeking a higher return on their savings, which Anna will cover in more detail. However, at the group level, deposits were up 7 billion pounds quarter on quarter, demonstrating the strength of our diversified deposit and funding base. Our performance over the past three years compared to the previous five, shows that we have reset and stabilized group returns, providing a solid foundation on which to build even further. Anna and I look forward to providing an investor update in February alongside our full year results, where we will talk more about our plan to deliver further value to our shareholders. This will include setting out our capital allocation priorities as well as revised financial targets for costs, returns and shareholder distributions. We have just completed the 750,000,000 pound buyback announced at the half year, taking total shareholder distributions to around 1.2 billion pounds so far this year, including dividends and buybacks. This is up over 30% on the first half of last year and reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Thank you for listening and I will pass it on to Anna."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you Venkatakrishnan, and good morning everyone. Turning now to slide six. Return on tangible equity for the third quarter was 11%, which takes us to 12.5% for the year to date. The cost income ratio was 63% in Q Three and 61% for the nine months, in line with our low 60s guidance for the full year. We continue to see limited signs of credit stress, as the loan loss rate for the quarter was 42 basis points and 43 for the nine months and we have maintained strong capital and liquidity positions. As you just heard from Venkatakrishnan, we will update you with revised financial targets at an investor update alongside our full year results. As part of this update, we are evaluating actions to reduce structural costs which may result in material additional charges in Q Four impacting this year's statutory performance, excluding any such charges. We continue to target a Roti above 10% for the full year, focusing now on Q Three. Starting on slide seven. There was no impact from the over issuance of securities this quarter, but given the largely offsetting impact to income and costs in Q Three last year, I will again use the adjusted numbers for the prior period. Group profit before tax was around 50 million lower at 1.9 billion, with income down 2% and costs down 4% year on year. Within total costs, operating costs were stable and there were no litigation and conduct charges this quarter, compared to 164,000,000 in Q Three last year. Impairment charges were up 52 million to 433,000,000, with the charge and business mix as we expected, largely driven by growth in US cards. Key NAV increased 25 Pence to 316 Pence, reflecting our profits and positive cash flow hedge reserve movements broadly offsetting last quarter's downward move. As usual, I will now cover the three key drivers of our returns, namely income costs and credit risk management. Starting on slide eight, group income was down 2% at 6.3 billion. The 8% stronger sterling US dollar rate in Q Three year on year reduced our reported income, around 40% of which is in dollars. CIB income fell 6%, with lower activity in the investment bank partially offset by corporate income growth year on year. Consumer cards and payments income was up 9%, driven by growth in US cards receivables and the UK wealth business transfer from Barclays UK in Q two, excluding the transfer, CCNP income was up 5% and Barclays UK income was up 1%. Net interest income across the bank grew by 179,000,000 or 6% year on year, driving a 13 basis point increase in group NIM to 3.98%. Barclays UK contributed around half of Group Nii this quarter, with approximately 20% from CIB and 30% from CCNP, mostly US cards, and the private bank Buk Nii was 17 million higher year on year with NIM of 304 basis points below where we anticipated at Q Two, which I will come back to when I cover Barclays UK. CCNP Nii increased by 64 million, mainly from US cards balance growth partially offset by private client deposit migration to our higher yielding products. This generated NIM of circa 8.9% in Q Three, which was up from circa 8.3% at Q Two and included a small one off increase in private bank, so we would expect NIM to step back a little in Q Four. CIB Nii increased 94 million year on year, which included an improvement of nine basis points to 3.65% in NIM, driven by the benefit of rate rises in transaction banking. Moving on to costs on slide ten, we are delivering our operating cost guidance with costs in Q Two and Q Three of around 4 billion below the Q One high point. The cost income ratio improved year on year to 63%, consistent with Q Two. Barclays UK cost income ratio was 56%, with total costs flat year on year. As we progressed our digital transformation and rationalization of the physical footprint and headcount consumer cards and payments operating costs increased by 9%, broadly in line with income. As we invested to grow US cards and our private bank CIB operating costs were stable year on year below the Q One level as guided as we said, we are evaluating actions to reduce structural costs across the group, and we'll give more detail at our investor update. Moving on to credit on slide eleven, we are seeing the benefit of our long standing, prudent approach to provisioning, both in terms of credit decisions we have taken in the past, reflected in our balance sheet provision and coverage ratios, as well as the credit protection we have in the CIB. The impairment allowance increased by 0.3 billion to 6.4 billion. This was primarily driven by our US. Cards portfolio. In line with our expectations, we updated the macroeconomic variables from Q Two, resulting in a modest impact on expected credit losses. We maintained robust coverage ratios of 1.4% for the group and 8.6% for our card portfolios in aggregate, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide. Starting with UK cards, we continue to see conservative customer behavior across our UK portfolios and credit performance remains benign. Customers are being disciplined about building unsecured balances with UK card repayment rates high across the credit spectrum. Although we have grown balances modestly over the past year, interest earning lending balances have decreased impacting NIM but benefiting credit performance. We do expect IELS to grow in 2024 as our more recent customer acquisition activity begins to mature. 30 days arrears rates remain stable and low relative to historic levels. The nature of our us. Cards proposition is different. As a reminder, we are the partner card issuer for around 20 client rewards programs, including some of the biggest brands in the US. Given our historic skew to travel and airlines, this is a high credit quality portfolio. Our risk mix has improved since the end of 2019, with 88% of the book above a 660 FICO, compared to 86% at the end of 2019, including the addition of the Gap portfolio in 2022. On the chart you can see that 30 day arrears rates are now in line with our pre pandemic experience at 2.7% as we expected. Our impairment coverage also increased to 9.7%, with stage two now at 35%, reflecting our expectation of higher unemployment from September's low level of 3.8% to a peak of 4.4% by Q three 2024. This would of course result in increased arrears, which are reflected in our balance sheet provisioning. Moving on to the impairment charge on slide 13. The impairment charge of 433,000,000 was up around 50 million year on year, giving a loan loss rate of 42 basis points. Most of the Q Three charge was driven by growth in US. Card balances. Continued seasoning of the Gap book in line with expectations and the increase in arrears that I mentioned. Our guidance of 50 to 60 basis points through the cycle is higher than the year to date experience. We are mindful that Q Four usually sees a higher charge, in part reflecting seasonality and our expectations of US cards growth over the holiday season. This generally leads to higher balances and some build an impairment under IFRS nine, where increased utilization, even by customers who are making timely payments, can trigger stage two migration. The Barclays UK charge was 59 million with a loan loss rate of ten basis points, and this has been below 30 now for nearly three years. Even though our customers are experiencing affordability pressures, this is not translating into credit stress as they manage their finances proactively. The CIB had a small release and we are seeing no real observed credit deterioration, with our synthetic credit protection also working well. Moving now to the business performance, starting with Bartheon's UK on slide 14, profits were stable year on year, with roti of 21% for the quarter. Excluding the UK, wealth transfer income was up 1%. Costs were broadly stable as our transformation plan progressed, resulting in a cost to income ratio of 56% for the quarter. Loan growth remained muted, reflecting customer caution in the current macroeconomic environment and our prudent risk positioning. The reduction in business banking assets was driven primarily by repayment of government backed loan schemes of 2.7 billion. Mortgage balances were stable in the quarter at 166,000,000,000, with Remortgaging still contributing most of the activity. Now looking at Buk NIM, which was 304 basis points. As a reminder, Buk Nii is around 25% of group income and one basis point of NIM equates to around 20 million of Nii annualized, or less than 0.1% of group income at Q Two. We said that we expected NIM to step down in Q Three and then to stabilize into Q Four. Most of the moving parts played out as expected in Q Three, with structural hedge tailwinds continuing and mortgage margin pressure somewhat easing. The impact of base rates was also in line given pass through rates have increased. However, the step down in NIM in Q Three was larger than expected, with deposit balance and mix trends more pronounced. Average balances quarter on quarter actually contributed a larger deposit effect than period end balances we have shown on the slide. When combined with pricing effects, this reduced NIM by a net 21 basis points compared to a net six basis points in Q Two. You can see that we grew deposits during the pandemic by 53 billion to 258,000,000,000 by the end of 2022. As customers built up cash with us in their current and Instant access accounts. We anticipated that these balances would fall as customers manage their finances proactively, paying down debt and locking in higher yields on their residual savings. Our current account moves appear in line with the latest bank of England industry data, but intense competitive pricing meant we did not capture as much of the flow into higher rate products. We emphasized at Q Two how sensitive guidance is to the level and mix of deposits, and this remains the case we now guide to a range of 305 to 310 basis points for the full year to help frame this. If we see similar trends in Q Four as we did in Q Three, both in terms of mix and volume, full year NIM would be towards the top end of this range. Turning now to structural hedge income, two thirds of which accrues to Barclays UK. Slide 16 illustrates the importance of the hedge to the level and visibility of our future net interest income. The hedge is designed to reduce volatility in nii, so in an environment where rates are peaking and eventually start to fall, it will help to stabilize NIM. It also provides a high degree of certainty to future nii. The chart shows that 95% of 2023 gross hedge income is already locked in, and the next two years portions of locked in nii have increased by three to 400 million per year since H one. As we rolled a further quarter of hedge maturities, notional hedge balances reduced by 4 billion in Q Three to 252,000,000,000. Given the trends we are seeing in retail deposits, we expect the notional balance to continue to reduce more or less in line with lower hedgeable deposits. Swap rates currently at around 4.5% means reinvestment rates remain well above maturing yields of around one to one and a half percent for the next two years, and with 50 to 60 billion of hedges maturing annually over this period, we expect the reinvestment effect to outweigh notional hedge declines. Turning now to consumer cards and payments on slide 17, growth in our US cards balances and the UK wealth transfer drove a 9% increase in CC and P income, partially offset by FX. We grew US cards balances by 11% year on year to $30 billion. In the private bank. Total invested assets were 105,000,000,000, up 27%, excluding UK wealth, as clients moved deposits to money market funds and other investments. With US payments income was modestly down year and year as customers adjusted their spending to lower value essential items which have lower margins, offsetting the 9% increase in payments. Processed roti was 9.6%, reflecting both higher income and operating costs year on year as we grow these businesses moving on to the CIB. CIB income fell 6% year on year in sterling terms, in part reflecting the stronger sterling US dollar rate. The more stable elements of our CIB income performed as we expected in markets. The relative stability from our combined fixed income and equity financing businesses was visible again compared to the downward move in intermediation and corporate delivered strong year on year income growth reflecting higher rates in transaction banking and the nonrepeat of leveraged finance marks this time last year in corporate lending. As you heard from ######, markets was down 13% in dollars versus a record third quarter in 2022. FIC fell 19% in dollars as we benefited less from US rates volatility compared to guilt volatility in the UK. This time last year, fixed income financing income reduced due to a normalization of inflation linked benefits, as we have mentioned previously, and we are smaller and securitized products, which was an area of strength for some of our peers. Equities was up 3% in dollars as derivatives and cash performance was partially offset by equity financing as client balances continued to grow, albeit as spreads tightened. Banking fees were down 24% year on year, with a better performance in ECM not sufficient to offset weaker DCM. And advisory, given the relative scale of those businesses for us, combined with stable costs and a small impairment release, roti was 9.2%, which, even in a mixed quarter like this one, does not reflect the potential of our franchise. CIB RWAs were relatively stable with the increase to 219,000,000,000 on Q Two, largely driven by FX. Turning now to capital funding and liquidity. Starting on slide 19, we continue to maintain a well capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. Looking at these metrics in more detail, starting with capital and slide 20, our CET One ratio increased around 20 basis points to 14% attributable profit generated 37 basis points, totaling 128 basis points over the last three quarters. As we indicated previously, our MDA hurdle increased to 11.8% from the increase in the UK countercyclical buffer, and we continue to operate with ample headroom whilst Basel 3.1 remains at proposal stage. We continue to guide to the day one RWA impact to be at the lower end of the five to 10% range. This reflects what we see from all the proposals across the jurisdictions we operate in, including the US. As a reminder, the PRA's rules remain the most relevant. On a group consolidated basis, our total deposit position remains stable as we have a diverse deposit franchise across consumer UK and international corporate customers. Within that, the decline in the UK deposits that we discussed earlier was more than offset this quarter by inflows from global corporates, and this places us in a strong position to manage seasonal fluctuations that we often see around yearend from balances held for financial sector clients. Our LCR of 159% represents a surplus of 116,000,000,000 above our minimum regulatory requirements. We continue to be comfortable with our liquidity position, and we have demonstrated its robustness throughout the market disruption earlier this year. So, concluding with our outlook, we are evaluating actions to reduce structural costs to help drive future returns, which may result in material additional charges in Q four impacting this year's statutory performance. Excluding any such structural cost actions, we continue to target roti above 10% in 2023 and a cost income ratio in the low 60s. Our loan loss rate guidance remains 50 to 60 basis points. This is higher than the year to date experience, allowing for some potential seasonality in US cards in Q Four. As of now, we are not seeing anything that concerns us and we would view the guidance as a through the cycle range. Our CET One ratio was at the top end of our target range, and strong capital generation in the year to date supports our commitment to return capital to shareholders. We will provide more details at an investor update at our full year results in February, including our capital allocation priorities and revised financial targets. Thank you for listening. We will now take your questions and as usual, please limit yourself to two per person so we get around to everybody."

        "text": "Hi, good morning. A couple of questions please. On first one on UK NIM, your guidance I think I understood the top end of the guidance, the 310, assumes a similar sort of deposit trend as in Q Three, I guess. Your guidance implicitly says that things could get worse in Q Four in terms of mix and volumes. Can you maybe sort of explain what happened during Q Three? And why have you given yourself some room for deteriorating trends? I think most of the guidance from your peers and maybe even yourselves was that once the rate sort of hikes were over, you would see much more stable deposits. So interested to see why you've left yourself some room for deterioration. And second question is on the restructuring charge in Q Four. Obviously your 10% Rot guidance is now x this restructuring charge. Question is, how much is that going to interfere with the payout and with buybacks that you may announce at the end of the year? Because I would have thought, given the provisions are going much better than expected, you would have had plenty of room to cover potential restructuring without going into your Rot guidance. But that doesn't seem to be the case. So maybe how should we think about year end distribution? Obviously capital going better, but more restructuring costs. Maybe sizing that restructuring costs will be helpful. Thank you."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you. Good morning and thanks for starting off the questioning. I'll take the first one and then I'll pass to Venkatakrishnan for the second half of that. So let me just talk through UK NIM in the third quarter and just to level set and reiterate what I said on the call. A basis point of NIM is 20 million annualized, less than 0.1% of groups income. What we said at Q Two was that we expected NIM to step down in the third quarter and somewhat stabilized into the fourth. There were a few moving parts within that and much of it has played out as we expected. So we've seen a lessening of the impact of mortgage churn, we've seen a continued tailwind from the structural hedges. Actually, deposit pricing played out roughly as we expected. And you can see that that's negative in the quarter for the first time, as we indicated it might be. What's really different is the movement in deposits. And what I said on the call earlier was that actually the movement in average deposits is a bit more significant than the quarter end might indicate. And whilst we saw very similar trends to the overall bank of England movement in current accounts through the quarter, we captured less of that into fixed term deposits than we might have expected to. And that related purely to the intensity of competition that we saw during the quarter and very intense at particular points. And it's really that that's made the difference. So I would say it's depositor behavior that has somewhat intensified in response to pricing. So previously we said that we expected that to be more stable in Q Four and that's simply because in Q Four you typically see a deposit stabilization pre Christmas. We now no longer anticipate that just because of these competitive dynamics and that's really what's causing us to change that outlook. We're not saying that it will be better or worse in the fourth quarter. I think what we are saying is that this customer deposit behavior has been relatively difficult to predict and that's why we're giving you a range indicating to you that if we saw something similar, that would be towards the top of that range. So that's the reason for the changing guidance. ######."

        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Yeah. Thanks I'm sure you sort of caught this through the presentation, but just to add on the NIM point, for 1 minute overall group deposits, as #### said, buk NIM is part of our overall NIM. Our overall deposits grew about 7 billion quarter on quarter and our Nii is up about 6% year on year at 3.2 billion and NIM itself at 3.98%. At the group level, again 13 bips higher. So think about in the larger context and also coming back to the restructuring charge, two things I would say. One is you should think of this structural cost action as in part of the investor update which we will provide in February. So what this is, is we have to announce it now because as we work through it, we will likely take a charge in Q Four. That's why we announce it now. But you should think of it as not something related to a quarter or the last two quarters, but part of the larger structural improvement of efficiency and productivity for the bank. As for your specific question, what I would say is a few things. Number one is that we very deliberately start this quarter at a strong capital position of 14% and we've got a capital generation of about 130 basis points of CET One ratio year to date. This underpins our ability to return capital to shareholders. As far as our desire, you know, we completed a 750,000,000 buyback in the first half. And so total distributions so far this year are 1.2 billion, which is about 30% higher versus the first half of last year. And this really reflects our commitment to return capital to shareholders. We spoke about the efficiencies we are driving across the group equally. You should know that we are comfortable to operate in the full range of 13% to 14% and we have been there in the past. Obviously, any capital action ultimately is approved by the board and approved by regulators. But from our point of view and we'll come back with the details in February from our point of view, good initial starting position, good capital generation across the bank. Understand the importance and the priority to our shareholders of returning capital, willingness to operate through the range."

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two for me. The first is coming back to the issue of the flagged restructuring charges. as you mentioned, capital really strong and in fact, the Q Three beat alone is a billion pounds relative to consensus. And so I guess anything that you could say to provide a rough sense of how much you're looking at spending here. I appreciate this is not the venue at which you wanted to give it, but today conversations with the investors are that there seem to be risks on the payout front, with no sense of how much cost savings we might be talking about or where in the group you might be looking to be more efficient. Clearly, we think it's the right thing to be doing, but the billion beat on CT One is 7% of annual group costs. You could do a lot with that. So anything you can do to be helpful on what the payback would be for the charges that are already in mind and which are triggering these provisions, that'd be the first and then secondly linked to that at your conference in New York last September. Last month, before, you said you were happy with the mix of business for the group. And so I wonder whether you'd give us a sense as to when you talk about updating investors on capital allocation priorities, whether you're really just talking about what grows faster in future or whether we should have in mind a sense that the present mix of capital allocation is up for debate. Thank you."

        "text": "Yeah. Good questions. Thank you. Let me begin on both of them and then I'll let #### add on on any details. So on the capital versus the spending, look, this is not the right place to be giving think you. Know, as I said in the answer to the previous question from ######, we started a good point on capital. We've been accretive on capital and view the spending and the restructuring in the larger term context. I'll let #### add to that in a minute. And on the second thing, what I would say mean I view the investor update in a simple way. It's obviously complex to analyze and execute, but I view the question in a simple way. It is what do you think is the target return that this bank can generate for its shareholders? So what's the rote ambition? How is it comprised at the group level and in the individual businesses? How much can it improve in the individual businesses and therefore, what is it that you wish to fund in that improvement? I also said in New York, it's very, very clear that the market values different businesses differently and we obviously have to take that into account in the way in which we think about our capital. So, you know, you sort of put it all together and you get the picture of where we think we want to go. But obviously more details on that later. And then ultimately, once you do that, then to be targeted about saying what of that growth and return you wish to you target returning to investors? Because I do absolutely take the point that we announce the buybacks on a half yearly basis and we don't have a target out there for that. And that would be something that I think our investors would find desirable. ####?"

Let me help you a little. You'll note that from our RA we have called out the year to date restructuring charge is around 120,000,000. So we've shown that to you and told you that it's largely in the UK. In any typical year we run at between two or 300 million. So by calling this out, we're indicating to you that it will be higher than that. But I can't comment on specific levels simply because we haven't finished the work. But as ###### said, as we take those decisions, we're extremely focused on future returns and we understand and are committed to shareholder returns. So that's very much in our mind. The other point around sort of the strength of the capital position. We've been operating with good cost and capital discipline all year. That's clearly the foundation of where we step out from in February and we'll tell you more then."

        "text": "Hi, good morning. Thank you very much. I just wanted to sorry, come back on the Buk NIM and really the trends that you were seeing on deposits through the third quarter and then what you're seeing so far in October. So, you mentioned that the averaging effect was actually worse than the endpoint position, suggesting that actually things got better in September, perhaps. So I was wondering if that's continued in October. So really how we should think about sort of the trajectory of those deposit flows through the quarter and then into Q Four. And then, just to clarify that when you say if Q Three trends continue, then expect to be at the top of the guided range, is that essentially taking the margin bridge on slide 15 and excluding the five basis points impact from pricing is how to think about that. Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thanks, Why don't I take those? So what we really mean by the averaging point is that the outflows were probably a bit more evenly spread through the quarter than they were in the second quarter, where we saw somewhat of an increase in intensity towards the second half. I don't think it was lessened in September at all. There were certainly quite a few headline rates out there that were extremely competitive in terms of October. I just call out the fact that we haven't yet seen the first month's end, so we're still midway through the first month. There's nothing in what we can see so far that's really sort of beyond our expectations. All right. With our own forecast, that's all I can really say at this point in time. But I would just sort of highlight that what we're seeing is the impact of the pricing in terms of the sort of range of guidance. What we're really saying, rather than any particular point on the bridge, is that depending on where those deposit flows go, you could end up with a very different exit rate. So that's what we're really calling out to you. And clearly, if we saw trends similar to what we saw I e. The deposit trends continue similar to what we saw in Q Three, we would be towards the top end of that range. And that would give you a particular jumping off point for 2024. What I would highlight, though, is that the structural hedge continues to protect the NIM overall. And what you have seen over the last quarter is that we've been able to lock in another large chunk, both of 2023 income, but another three to 400 million of 24 and 25 income just because of the way that hedge is rolling month on month. Thank you."

        "text": "Yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you. Just a quick follow up, if I could then. So given that you talked about the hedge into the coming years and you were expecting this deposit stabilization in Q Four, do you have a view going into next year in terms of deposit trajectory, given what you're seeing in terms of competition in the market? What this year has taught us is that customer deposit behavior is quite difficult to call. So what I'm not going to do is give you a 2024 NIM outlook. What I can tell you is that there are three factors that we're looking at. One is positive, one is neutral, and one is more negative. So the positive impact is clearly the impact of the structural hedge. And remember that two thirds of that goes into buk. The more neutral impact is that we do expect and we are seeing that the impacts, quarter on quarter of mortgage churn are starting to dissipate called that out for some time. What is more difficult to call is the impact of this ongoing deposit behavior, both the reduction in deposits because customers are using them in order to manage the broader economic environment, but also then seeking higher rates, difficult to call out when that would stabilize #####. But all I can say is that there are other factors in the mix, most importantly, the structural hedge. SPEAKER A Okay, thank you very much for that. Okay, thank you. Next question, please. Our next question comes from ##### #### from Autonomous. Please. Go ahead, #####. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two please. One on NIM and one on #####. So appreciate everything you've said about the difficulty in predicting deposit behavior and the fact that the UK NIM is not the be all, end all for your group revenue dynamic. But obviously we've had some pretty dramatic shifts in your NIM guidance over a few quarters. And there's a huge range of possible four Q exit levels implied by the range you're now giving us. So a very simple question. Please help us own views on what might happen. What's the average cost of your deposit balances in the UK and what proportion? And then on Roti in terms of the risk to the 10% Roti target, inclusive of restructuring charges, if I just kind of run the numbers on your equity for the year to date and Wave are out of four. Q to get to, say, a 9% Roti, including restructuring charges that would imply sort of a negative bottom line number for the fourth quarter. You've obviously delivered pretty strong Roti year to date. The fact that you're flagging potentially not being able to hit the greater than 10% Roti inclusive of restructuring charges implies fourth quarter could be a net loss. Is that the right way for us to be thinking about this? And within that, when you're flagging the 120,000,000 of restructuring charges year to date, is it the case that when we get to the fourth quarter, the catch up to the normal 200 to 300 is going to be excluded from your Roti calculation as well? How are you thinking about that? Is two to 300 in the Roti calculation and then the exceptional charge on top of that excluded? Or is the whole amount potentially going to be excluded when you calculate your rotate end of the year to assess delivery on that target. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much, #####. Why don't I take those two and I'm sure ###### will add it if he wants to. So you're right, there has been some considerable movement on the UK NIM, particularly over the last quarter. As I said, clearly that's driven by customer deposit behaviour. I would highlight for you that as we look at UK NIM, we are actually looking at quite a narrow measure. So in comparison to our peers, remember, they would be including all of the corporate income and asset base within there. And so really you should be looking, as you make comparisons to the rest of the UK, you should be looking across both the UK and the corporate NIM position. We don't disclose the average rate paid on our deposits, although what we have given you this time to be more helpful is a split of our deposit balances and indeed how that has trended over time. And it's showing very clearly that movement into term, as you would expect, and as many have commented from bank of England data on your second question. So to be clear, what we are not doing is giving any kind of PBT forecast for the fourth quarter here. It wouldn't be appropriate for us to do so. Not least, we haven't concluded our assessment of the structural actions that we may take. Merely what we're calling out is a few things. Firstly, we're clearly going into the fourth quarter with good Roti momentum. We've delivered 12.5% year to date, somewhat ahead of consensus. However, the fourth quarter does have some seasonal impacts in it. So typically we see lower CIB income, typically we see higher impairment in US cards in particular, simply because of the seasonality in spending. We also see impacts from the bank levy. And we've just given you an indication that we see a continuation of deposit trends in the UK. So not saying anything more than that in that typically you expect Roti to be lower in the fourth quarter than in the preceding three. And to the extent that we take decisions in that fourth quarter, that may impact the Roti now, as we do so, we are very focused on future returns for the business. So our overall objective here is to improve the returns of the business through time. Clearly, efficiency and effectiveness is a key part of that. So we're just calling out our intention to continue that cost focus for the business. Yeah, and I cannot emphasize that last point that #### I cannot emphasize too much that last point which #### made, which is that think about this in terms of the investor update in February and the longer term plan for productivity and efficiency in this bank. If I could just follow up on the roti point first, please. I mean, the year to date you've done 4.4 billion profit. Your average tangible is probably going to be something like 47 billion for the year. So you're pretty much all the way there to delivering a 10% royalty on the nine months to date. But to get to a point where you're flagging to us that you might not do greater than ten for the full year unless I'm missing something there, the maths implies potentially very material restructuring charges. Am I missing something there? It does seem in the context of a debate where I had some investors asking whether you might be announcing a surprise buy, this is obviously kind of top of mind for your investor base. How are you going to be balancing these things? Are we looking at potentially greater than a bit of restructuring or cost to achieve or whatever? We're going to be titling it in the fourth quarter. That's by the maths even, except the point about seasonality et. So, I understand the maths of what you're putting in front of me. I'm going to say the same thing that we have not yet concluded on those plans. To the extent that we do, we will update the market further at full year, both in terms around the costs, but also the ongoing impact that we would expect them to have, just as investors do. Distributions are top of our mind too, as ###### pointed out. So as we take these decisions, we will be extremely mindful. And as you said previously, we go into the fourth quarter very deliberately at the top end of our capital range. And on the deposit cost point. If I could on that as well, please. If I frame it slightly differently, how do you expect investors to be able to take a view on what might happen with the buk NIM unless we're armed with some basic information about what you're currently paying on deposits relative to the types of offers that are out there in the market. You'll flag competitive offers as a key driver for the fact you're re guiding them lower and seeing deposit attrition, but we don't know how much better those rates are relative to what you're currently paying or had been paying earlier in the. So it's very difficult for us to take a view on what's going to without. So, all I would say is that we price competitively, but not uncommercially. If you look at our savings, pricing is very clearly indicated both on our website and indeed in any branch. You will see that we are competitively positioned across our term deposits, across our Isas, across our instant access, for example, rainy day saver. So we don't genuinely believe that there's something mispriced in our savings franchise. We're happy with it. From quarter to quarter, you will see other competitors operating in a different way. Okay, thanks."

      {
        "speaker": "Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst",
        "text": "Firstly, the UK and then outside the UK. So first I'm trying to understand the comment that pricing played out as expected. Are you talking for Barclays or for the industry? As I would think about pricing and then movements and deposits for individual institutions as very much linked, had you priced up more in line with some peers than the balance move, wouldn't have been such a headwind. So perhaps you could clarify that point. I'm just trying to think about in the context of how you might want to react more to protect balances in the future in a competitive marketplace and then outside the UK, clearly that was much stronger. Could you just give a bit more color around what you're seeing, what the strategy is there and sort of are you having to pay up or is this very much profitable deposit growth that you're seeing outside the UK? Thank you. Okay, thanks guy. I'll take both of those. So what I meant by the pricing was, as we expected, clearly we knew at Q Two, when we reported to you the price changes we were going to make, and therefore that deposit bucket, the one that's called bank rate, is broadly as we expected it to be. Now, what subsequently happened to both the level and mix of deposits is much more driven by the external competitive environment. And that's what we are calling out very similarly to what I just said to #####. We are happy with the overall level of our savings pricing. Our strategy is to encourage our customers to develop healthy savings habits. We are pricing to, as far as possible, maintain our franchise rather than attract hot money. And we will price competitively, but not uncommercially. So to the extent that we see competitive pricing going in that direction, then obviously we would not follow it. I think the other thing just to put in the mix, as everybody is looking at the impact of buk NIM, please do not discount the impact of impairment. So all of this behaviour, this conservatism and behavior is also flowing through into the impairment line. And buk impairment has been lower than consensus for nine successive quarters. So just worth bearing that in mind. Second point that you asked about, which is around the deposit elsewhere in a high rate, persistently high inflationary environment, we would expect to see high level deposits flow from retail customers towards corporates. That's exactly what we see. And given our franchise, that is what you're observing. So UK corporate deposits are very stable. You see some migration, but very stable in totality. And what we've seen in the quarter is a continued inflow more from global corporates. That's particularly fairly long tenor term funding, competitively priced, but good for the deposit franchise overall. So, very much a continuation of what we called out actually in Q Two and indeed Q One."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",

I think to me it's one of the interesting things that we've seen, where we've seen people using their deposits to pay down debt, whether it's mortgages or other things. One, it showed that they had the ability to do it. So obviously it's helpful with impairments, but it also gives you an idea of the type of credit quality of customer we have, which I think is a good thing. So, as #### said, nine quarters continuously of positive surprises, meaning lower impairments than consensus in buk and people using deposits to pay down debt. It's all a good thing about credit quality. Okay, thank you. Thank you, guy. Next question, please."

        "text": "Morning both, and thank you for taking my questions. The firstly is around just some recent press speculation that you're looking to sell a stake in your UK merchant acquiring business. I know you won't want to comment on that directly, so perhaps the best way to phrase the question is to ask what do you think is the best way of Barclays generating value out of its UK merchant acquiring business going forward? And then secondly, I noted your statement around the PRA rules being the most relevant to the expected impact under Basel 3.1 in that context. The regulator gave a Mansion House speech last week. Our interpretation of that speech is that we'll likely see a softening of the rules around Basel 3.1 when they're announced later this year and in May 2024. Would you agree with that assertion? Thank you."

        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan ",
        "text": "Right, let me take both of them. First of all, in the UK merchant acquiring business, I think we are fortunate that we've got a business that has both issuances and acceptance. And it is very much a business which is targeted at corporates and SMEs. And what it does is that it adds another quiver to our arrow. It's a very positive quiver to our arrow. When we deal with them, we provide them transaction services, we provide them obviously, baited banking, foreign exchange services and then payments. So merchant acquiring the business itself overall is very good. I think there's a broader strategic question for us which other banks have faced, which is it's a very technology driven business. What is your comparative advantage in this? Is your comparative advantage in developing the technology or in implementing the technology or building machines which you put with clients? Or is your comparative advantage in helping service them as part of a larger set of banking services? That's the question we are looking at. And then I think the commercial arrangement will come out of the answer to that question. So that's the way we are thinking about that business. As far as Basel 3.1 goes, I would say two things. I also read the Mansion House speech with interest. I think the UK rules are solidifying. They will probably on the market risk side resemble the US rules and it is still too soon to say how much of an impact, what kind of changes going forward there are from what we've seen. So I don't want to sort of comment one way or another. I mean, the only thing I will say on this more broadly is I think at the end of the day, I know there's some commentary from the US banks that the impacts are greater on them. But these capital regimes, and we've been under the UK capital regime, of course these capital regimes are very difficult to calculate apple for apple. And so I think at the end of it, when you look at what the Fed has done and when you look at what the bank of England has done, what you're probably going to have is roughly comparable capital regimes between the US and the UK. Roughly comparable. So let me just round that off. I think, ###, we're obviously we know these speeches with interest, but we're waiting the final rules both in the US and in the UK and elsewhere. And of course we don't yet know what the impact of any changes around Color Two might be. So until we see it in print, still some uncertainty. So we continue to guide to that 5% to 10% that we've given you before, erring, towards probably the bottom end of that range. But thank you for the question. Next question, please. The next question comes from [Indescribablefrom Numis."

        "speaker": "Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst",
        "text": "Go ahead, Your line is now open. Hello there. Two from me again, please. The first, I just wondered what was in this seven basis points other drag that's coming through in the UK MIM in the quarter. I think you described it in the email as product mix, but is it just that or is there some treasury effect coming through there again like we saw earlier in the year and if so, how large? The second question is to focus on one of the bright spots of today's numbers that the TNAV very powerful move in the third quarter and the cash for hedge reserve seems to run my own by about 20%, I think, in just three months. I don't want to preempt anything you're going to say for the year on new financial targets and the like, but are you completely comfortable that in the medium term, including next year in 2025, that you can still do greater than 10% Rote target as it is today? All in, including any additional structural cost of actions, are taken through next year against this quite powerful move up in the Tnab? Because there's nothing to suggest the Tnab isn't going to keep moving up a pace from here. So they're the two questions. A - C.S. Venkatakrishnan \u2013 Okay, thanks I will take both of those. So in the seven bits other it is product, it contains pretty much everything else that isn't to the left. There's nothing significant in there individually, there's a bit of cards. There's a bit of business banking, as we see the government backed lending being paid down. There's also a little bit on barclays partner payments, barclays partner finance, rather. You might recall that we said that we were pausing new business in that space whilst we replatformed that business technology wise, because that's unsecured. Although it's small, it can have an impact on NIM. So nothing more than that. Nothing specifically in treasury to call out at all on TNAV. Clearly, that has moved significantly in the quarter. In part, that is actually a reversal of what you saw from the beginning of the year. So just to sort of unpack this a little bit, clearly what drives TNAV over time is attributable profit and us driving good returns, as we have done this quarter. So that's eight basis points. There was also three basis points that came from the fact that we'd conducted a large part of the share buyback by the end of the quarter. And this is obviously a per share measure. You're right to call out the cash flow hedge reserve, which was ten pence in this single quarter. But if you look at the disclosures at the back of the results announcement, actually, you can see that quarter to quarter, these reserve movements can be relatively material. And the third quarter just unwound the position from the beginning of the year. And what's actually going on here is that as rates fell back a little bit in the third quarter, the negative drag from that cash flow hedge reserve just lessened a little bit. But that was just unwinding. You might recall in the second quarter, there was a big move in the opposite direction that actually depressed TNAV. So really, as we think going forward from here, we try and strip out that kind of quarter to quarter volatility. What we're really focused on is the accretion of profit and driving robust returns. And that's really what we'll come back to you on in february. I want to come back to deposits and competition for deposits again. Clearly you've been surprised in the quarter by the level of competition out there, but the comments you're giving us back is very much that you're confident in your current pricing. I mean, what needs to change in terms of the level of competition out there for your view on that to change? If you look at your savings rates, they're clearly a step below your closest peers. And from what we can see in the data, then you're losing deposits that, whilst pricing up might be a threat to NIM, at least you're keeping deposits on the platform. So I just want to kind of understand your approach to competition short term, but also medium term. If these very competitive rates continue to stay out there. And second, you mentioned on the hedge that the hedge come down in relation to your hedgeable deposits. If I look at the disclosures you're giving us today, then it looks like you're hedging much, much more of your savings products than your peers. So I'd just like to get a bit more color around how you run that hedge versus your deposits, what your hedgeable deposits actually are, and how you see those developing over the next couple of quarters. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Why don't I take those and I'm sure ###### might add, particularly on pricing. So as I said on the previous answer, we are pretty comfortable with the way that we are placed on our pricing. Clearly, there is a difference in competitive pricing across the industry between what I would describe as bigger banks and challenger banks who might have a different need for liquidity, particularly over the next couple of years as Tffme runs off. So we are mindful of that and we keep our savings pricing under review. But as we are making savings decisions, we think about the franchise and we think about our liquidity and our balance sheet. Those decisions will be different bank by bank and institution by institution. And I wouldn't comment further than that. In terms of the hedge, our hedge strategy has been very consistent over the last few years. So what we do is we identify rate sensitive balances, we exclude those from the hedge, and then on top of that, we maintain a buffer and we hedge the remaining balance. We monitor that hedge on a monthly basis. And what you can see year to date is that we have trimmed our corporate hedge thus far. We do that by making the decision to pause all our part of the role month by month. And those are active decisions that we take. So we've got ample opportunities to adjust that hedge as we see deposits behavior changing as compares our hedge strategy versus competitors. I wouldn't comment on it. Just to follow up then, does that imply you see rate insensitive balances within your savings accounts? There are some balances within our deposits overall that are rate insensitive. So much of our current accounts would be rate insensitive simply because they relate to operational deposits. That will be true in Buk, as it is in the corporate bank, as it is in the private bank, although you'd expect those constituents to behave differently. So that is certainly true. There is also some rate insensitivity in savings because customers, and indeed corporates, do use some of their savings balances as sort of rainy day funds simplistically. And particularly in instant access accounts, we see customers turning over their savings within the period of about a year, for example. So we have demonstrable evidence of that insensitivity. ####, great. SPEAKER A The next question. Your line is now open. Yes. Morning everybody. Could I just ask you just trying to get the implications right for sort of 24 and 25 now, because if I look at the maths correctly, and I suppose I'm just checking my maths here, it looks like you've got an exit margin of somewhere around 290 into next year. And I guess we would imagine that that's going to continue to deteriorate because a lot of these deposit trends are long term trends. If you look back to the last time, interest rates were at 5%, the structure of a deposit franchise was completely different and the margins were much smaller than you're getting today. If that is the case, that looks to me like we're looking at maybe 500, 600 million off consensus for next year just for net interest income. And yet consensus is only looking at a 10% return on tangible even. Now, I assume you want 10% to be some sort of a base and you wouldn't want to be delivering lower than that. Is it the cost? Is it the cost program? Should we be looking at the cost program to offset that? Is that where the difference comes from? Or how else can we get ourselves back to 10%? Or should we be thinking that actually that is a risk? Now. Let me take that and I'm sure will add sure. I'm not going to comment on the exit rate from Q four. What we've done is we've given you a range, ed, we've told you what will happen if we see similar deposit trends. No, but I've just taken my math, that was all. We know what three are. Okay, so it is two nights. That's great. Thanks. Yeah. So your math, as I would expect, I'm sure, is very robust. As we've said before, it may or may not deteriorate next year. I mean, we've got a real tailwind from the hedge, so I'm going to go back to that. Secondly, we've got this neutralization of the mortgages month to month, and then you have ongoing deposit behavior. So you're right to say that we're in a different place to where we were sort of and we're going all the way back to 2006, 2007. I mean, I would remind you that at that point the liquidity positions of the very large banks was very different. So all of the large banks were running loan to deposit ratios well in excess of 100%, 100 and 5161 hundred and 70% in some instances. And therefore those fixed term deposits were essentially being used in lieu of wholesale funding to large part. So it's a different structure of market overall. So I'm not going to comment on where we end, but I would urge you to consider that we then make the jump from buk to group. So a percentage point or a bit of buk roti is 20 million. That is 0.1% of group income. So in all of these considerations, we need to consider the rest of the group. So, yes, Buk NIM is stepping back a bit, but we're also in a position where actually the market for markets, and particularly banking, is significantly depressed. So banking is coming off a decade low. We've seen pretty low levels of unsecured lending in the UK, relatively muted demand for wholesale debt, both in SMEs and in corporate. And of course, if you look across into CCNP, the US cards business continues to grow and the private bank continues to so I take the math point on Buk, but it is a relatively small part of the group. You're right to call out efficiency. We're very focused on that. We see that as a key part of driving our returns. And obviously we'll come back to you with the whole picture in February. Yeah, and I'll just add on the efficiency part of the structural cost actions. Think of it as a longer term approach to increasing the growth of this bank. That's what the efficiency is about. It's not about making ledger work. Can I just come back on that in terms of efficiency, though, are we talking CIB efficiency? Because your retail bank is making over a 20% return on equity. I mean, that feels like a really good number on most benchmarks. I don't know why you would want to take costs out of that particularly. So is it like head office and CIB or where would we be seeing that? So, look, we'll give you the details later. I applaud you for recognizing the rote of our retail bank. It has not come up yet, but you're absolutely right. It's doing 20% and it's doing well. But in every part of the bank, there are things which we can do better. Okay. And so that's not to take away from the performance of the retail bank. ####, I wouldn't have okay, thanks. Thanks. The next question comes from Jefferies. Please. Go ahead, ######. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess a couple of things. Just going back to this charge that you intend to take in Q Four, could you just talk about what your hurdles are in terms of payback and timing, just to give us a sense of time frame and payback? And then secondly, on the CC and P margin, there was a 63 on my number, 63 bips pickup, quarter on quarter in the margin, which was significant. And I guess how do you think about the trajectory of that, particularly given the growth in US receivables? And I presume that a fair amount of the growth in the US receivables is coming from the GAAP, which is a higher yielding book. So how do we think about the margin trajectory in CC and P? Okay. Thank you, I'll take those. I'm not going to go into the Q Four charge in detail at this juncture, we're obviously still evaluating actions. You might expect that depending on what those charges relate to, the payback might be slightly different. So you'd expect, for example, property to take longer to pay back, whereas other actions that we might take would be faster. But when we talk to you in February, ##, we will outline what we've done and what we expect that payback to be. In terms of CCNP, you're correct. The net interest margin has stepped forward in the quarter. There are two real impacts in there. The first is growth in US receivables. So the growth in the cards business, as we said, balances are up 11% year on year, and that clearly has a powerful effect. At the same time, we see deposit migration in the private bank, which is no different to what we see in either corporate or in Buk. So that has an offsetting impact. Although in the private bank, what we see is a flow into invested assets. So we retain that income. It just goes on to a different line. There is a one off in the third quarter. It's not huge, but I would strip that out. Ongoing. So that's why we're saying we'd expect Q four NIM to step back towards Q two NIM. So don't think of this step up as permanent. Think there is momentum in the number, but this is somewhat exaggerated by that one off. Okay. And then can I just be cheeky and ask one other question, just given because I think there's been some confusion. If it's a small one, it's kind of a yes or no question anyway. But do you expect to deliver in line with your 10% or greater return in 2024? We will come back to you on 2024 guidance when we talk to you at the full year. As ###### said, that's when we plan to update the market on our expectations for returns, capital allocation, costs, distributions. But you should read that we are very focused on returns. Ongoing. Thank you. Okay, thank you. So can we go to the final question, please? Our final question today comes from from City. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me on two questions. One, hopefully very short. First question. You're encouraging us to look at the group Nii, including the CIB. So perhaps you could just comment on the transaction. Banking revenues obviously up a lot year on year, but they are down Q on Q, which slightly bucks the trend versus what we've seen at US peers. So perhaps you could elaborate on what drove the Q and Q decline there. And then second and broader point on deposits and pricing just in relation to the 14 point FCA Action plan. I think their fair value assessment was due by the end of August. You had to provide details on communication and evidence, what you are providing to the consumer by end september. I think the next big thing is this whole debate around on sale versus offsell, which comes in from the 31 July 2024. So anything you could say on on sale versus offsell, how big a bucket of offsell products you have, how the pricing compares, et cetera, et cetera. Thank you. Okay, so let me start in terms of transaction banking, did step back quarter on quarter, there was a relatively small impact from deposit migration. And again, I would say within corporate we're seeing migration from our non interest bearing into interest bearing, but those deposits are remaining within the bank. So that's certainly not the larger part of it. What we did see is an impact from the returns in our liquidity buffer. There's nothing idiosyncratic going on. There more that for any liquidity buffer, the returns are in two parts. The first is the carry, and then the second is, in any particular quarter, you would see some disposal income. In this environment, that disposal income has been very low. And given that much of that buffer income is actually attributed to transaction banking, it's had a disproportionate impact in this quarter that will obviously move around a little bit. So we'll see what happens through the Fourth. So on the consumer duty piece on SCA, we actually did our mailing through July and August in relation to savings. That was exactly, as you point out, designed to ensure that our customers are very much aware of the savings businesses that we have and the rates on offer. And increasingly, we see our customers using digital means to look and observe that anyway. But that mailing is behind us. We will do a further mailing in November and December to our current accounts. And for us, off sale is relatively small, so I wouldn't call it out as an impact. And okay, so with that, thank you, #####, for the #### rather for your final question. Really appreciate you attending the call today. Thank you for your continued interest.+"

    "transcript": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Good morning. Thank you everybody for coming here and welcome to our Full Year 2023 Results Presentation as well as our Investor Update. You could see the agenda for the day on this slide. And so what we will do, we'll just go into the results for 2023 before turning to the broader investor update. So, as you saw this morning, I'll start with the results announcement with the performance highlights and then I'll hand over to Anna to take us all through the financials. So, we are delivering against our guidance. So, we achieved -- delivered on all our targets in 2023. And together with our consistently strong capital position throughout this year, what this enabled us to do was to give shareholders a material increase in distributions. Excluding the Q4 structural cost actions, return on tangible equity was 10.6% for 2023, in line with our target of above 10%. And on the same basis, our cost-to-income ratio who was 63%, in line with our guidance for the low 60s for the full year as well. As being accretive to future returns, the structural cost actions did not limit our ability to deliver a 37% year-on-year increase in total distributions, which now amounted to \u00a33 billion. This \u00a33 billion number for 2023 included a total dividend of \u00a30.08 per share with the full year amount of the dividend of \u00a30.053 being announced today and as well as a full year buyback of \u00a31 billion, which we expect to start in the coming days, and that's on top of the \u00a3750 million at the half year. Tangible book value per share has increased by \u00a30.36 year-on-year to \u00a30.331. And our CET1 ratio was 13.8%, which is at the top end of our target range, which you will recall is 13% to 14%. Overall, we view this performance as a strong foundation on which to build towards our revised financial targets over the next three years and which we announced this morning and we'll talk about in greater detail in a few minutes. But before that, the financial report of these results. Anna, over to you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Venkat and good morning everyone. Turning now to Slide 5. I think I'm going to need the script. Thank you very much. On a statutory basis, RoTE was 9% for full year 2023. This included the \u00a30.9 billion of structural cost actions taken in Q4. And given the materiality of those Q4 charge over and above normal annual cost actions, I'm going to exclude it from the financial performance metrics today. On this basis, 2023 return on tangible equity was 10.6%. I would note that there was no impact from the over-issuance of securities this year, but given the material impacts to income and costs in 2022, I will also use adjusted numbers as comparators. Group profit before tax was \u00a37.5 billion, down 3% year-on-year, and income increased by \u00a30.7 billion, while costs were \u00a30.2 billion higher, excluding the Q4 cost actions. Within costs, litigation and conduct charges were small this year at \u00a337 million compared to around \u00a30.6 billion in 2022. And operating costs, which include L&C, were up by \u00a30.8 billion. Impairment charges were \u00a30.7 billion to \u00a31.9 billion, representing a loan loss ratio of 46 basis points, better than our through-the-cycle guidance of 50 to 60. As usual, I'll now cover the three drivers of our returns: income, costs and credit risk management. We saw a continuation of year-to-date income trends through the fourth quarter, resulting in total income up 3% at \u00a325.4 billion for the year. Barclays UK income was up 5%, with growth in net interest income from rate increases outlaying lower card income and the transfer of UK Wealth in Q2. Consumer cards and payments income grew strongly, up 18%, driven by higher margins and balanced growth in both US cards and the Private Bank. Corporate and Investment Bank income was down 4%, as lower volatility in markets and a record low banking wallet impacted the industry. This outweighed the tailwind from interest rates in the Corporate Bank. On the next slide, you can see net interest income across the bank and that it grew by \u00a32.1 billion or 20% year-on-year, driving a 44 basis point increase in group NIM to 3.98%. The biggest contributors to NII growth were CC&P and CIB, together adding \u00a31.3 billion with around one quarter of the total NII growth coming from BUK. Going forward, whilst we will still report net interest margin, we will guide to group NII excluding the Investment Bank and head office. This is expected to be around \u00a30.3 billion lower in 2024 at around \u00a310.7 billion. BUK is expected to be a point -- approximately \u00a36.1 billion of this, excluding the impact of Tesco, which I'll touch on shortly. The benefits from the structural hedge are expected to be offset by continued product market pressures, particularly in the UK. Turning now to the structural hedge in more detail. The structural hedge is designed to reduce volatility in NII and manage interest rate risk. As rates have risen, this has dampened the growth in our NII, but in a falling rate environment we will see the benefit from the protection that it gives us. It generated \u00a33.6 billion in gross hedge income in 2023, up from \u00a32.2 billion in the prior year. It also provides a high degree of confidence in the net interest income growth assumed in our forward plan. To reiterate this, \u00a33.8 billion of gross hedge income is already locked in for 2024 from the hedge investment we did through 2023, and this will continue to build. Given trends in retail deposits, we do expect the notional balance to reduce in 2024 at a broadly similar rate to Q4 2023 before stabilizing in 2025. We have approximately \u00a3170 billion of hedges maturing over the next three years, and we expect to roll around three quarters of them over the period and with reinvestment rates remaining well above the average maturing yields of around 1.5% for the next three years. So, we do expect the reinvestment to outweigh notional hedge declines. Turning now to costs on Slide 9. As guided quarterly costs through the year remained below the Q1 high point. This excluded the Q4 bank levy of \u00a3180 million, which was flat year-on-year and the cost-income ratio for the year was 63% and excluding the Q4 structural cost actions. Group costs of \u00a316 billion were up \u00a30.2 billion year-on-year. Operating costs increased to support business growth and enhance resilience and control. For example, partner focused spend to drive balanced growth in US cards and Kensington mortgages in the UK as well as technology investments to support markets within the CIB. The impact of inflation was more than offset by efficiency savings. Looking at the \u00a3927 million of Q4 structural cost actions in more detail now on the next slide. These were across three main categories; people, property, and infrastructure. Around half was in our head office and relates to our merchant acquiring and German consumer financing businesses as well as a Canary Wharf office lease exit. A large proportion of this head office charge is goodwill and intangible write-downs and which will have no impact on capital and the other charges are spread across the businesses. We expect the overall payback to be just under two years with around half of the cost savings landing in 2024. You'll hear later how these cost actions are a key pillar in our plans to improve efficiency and drive a more productive cost base going forward. Moving on to credit on Slide 11. The impairment allowance was broadly stable at \u00a36.3 billion and we maintained our balance sheet coverage at 1.4%. The total impairment charge for 2023 of \u00a31.9 billion was up around \u00a30.7 billion year-on-year, and the full year loan loss rate of 46 basis points was below our through-the-cycle guidance. As we expected, this included a higher Q4 loan loss rate of 50 points, driven by an increase in US cards. US cards was also the largest component of the full year charge of \u00a31.5 billion in CC&P. The full year Barclays UK charge was around \u00a3300 million with a loan loss rate of 14 basis points. We continue to see conservative consumer behaviors across all our UK portfolios, and we do expect the loan loss rate in BUK to increase over the next three years as we grow unsecured lending. I'll go into more detail on the US cards impairment on the next slide. Our US cards portfolio credit trends are in line with the broader industry. The US consumer bank loan loss rate is elevated in comparison to recent periods as we build our impairment reserves because of an increase in delinquencies. Write-offs are low, but we do expect them to increase during 2024, which is why we're building the reserve now. As a result, our US cards coverage ratio stands at 10.2% on an IFRS 9 basis, and when calculated on a US accounting basis, the CECL coverage ratio of 8.2% is in line with our US cards peers. The portfolio remains high quality with 88 of the book above 660 FICO. We do expect the impairment charge to remain elevated through the first half of 2024 and then to reduce in the second half. Overall, I'd expect the charge for 2024 to be below the 2023 level, and we're guiding to a 400 basis points loan loss rate through the cycle. A brief word on Q4 performance on the next slide before I take you through the businesses. Profit before tax excluding Q4 structural cost actions was \u00a31 billion, down \u00a30.3 billion. Income was down \u00a30.2 billion year-on-year at \u00a35.6 billion, the second best Q4 in the last five years after 2022. This was driven by a reduction in non-NII, partially offset by an increase in NII, whilst operating costs were broadly stable. Impairment was around \u00a350 million higher at \u00a30.6 billion with the higher Q4 charge in CC&P from US cards, partially offset by a lower Barclays UK charge. Moving now to the business performance starting with Barclays UK on slide 14. RoTE was 19.7% in Q4 and has been consistently around 20% every quarter this year. Total income was \u00a31.8 billion with net interest income stable at \u00a31.6 billion and a \u00a30.2 billion reduction in non-NII year-on-year. This reflected the transfer of UK Wealth business in Q2 and a number of one-offs. We would expect non-NII to revert to a run rate greater than \u00a3250 million per quarter going forward. The NII generated a NIM in BUK of 307 basis points for Q4 and 313 for the full year. We said at Q3 that our 305 basis points to 310 basis points guidance. We're sensitive to the level and mix of deposits, and the deposit trends that we saw in Q3 slowed materially in Q4. Deposits were down \u00a32.1 billion compared to the reduction of \u00a36.6 billion in Q3 as the pace of deposit outflows and migration to higher savings rate slowed. The other NIM drivers played out broadly as we expected, and you can see these on the chart on the right-hand side. The structural hedge continued to be a tailwind to NIM, although a more modest 7 basis points in Q4 due to lower swap rates and a reduced hedge roll in the quarter. Bank rate effects turned negative in half two, reflecting pass-through in pricing and mortgage churn continue to ease. We also saw a positive contribution from treasury in the other category, as we flagged earlier in the year. Looking forward to 2024, we are guiding to NII for Barclays UK of circa \u00a36.1 billion compared to \u00a36.4 billion in 2023. We will have a building tailwind from the hedge roll. However, in the short term, consistent with our industry expectations, we do expect this to be more than offset by some further reduction in deposits but at a slower rate than in 2022 and a net reduction in mortgage. This excludes the impact of the Tesco Bank acquisition, which I'll summarize on the next slide. The acquisition accelerates our intention to grow unsecured lending in Barclays UK, which we will discuss in more detail later. The transaction involves the acquisition of \u00a38.3 million unsecured lending balances, roughly half credit card receivables and half unsecured loans, and approximately \u00a36.7 billion of customer deposits. This will result in \u00a38 billion of RWAs in completion, which is expected to be in half two. Given the uncertainty around this timing, our 2024 guidance does not include the impact of the acquisition, although it is reflected in our 2026 plans that we're announcing later today. Once completed, we estimate initially generating NII of around \u00a3400 million annualized and growing from that level. And as we complete the integration, costs will be somewhat elevated, but they should be broadly neutral to the cost -- group cost-income ratio. And as usual, following a portfolio acquisition, we also anticipate elevated impairment initially under IFRS 9 but again expect that to normalize. As a result, we forecast a slightly reduced BUK RoTE in 2024, but once integrated, the business will have an attractive RoTE profile accretive to the group RoTE over time. Turning now to Consumer Cards and Payments. Continued growth in US cards receivables and Private Bank client balances drove a \u00a30.1 billion increase in CC&P total income year-on-year. US cards balances grew to just over $32 billion, up to $2 billion in Q4, reflecting seasonally higher year-end spend. Client assets and liabilities in the Private Bank grew by \u00a34 billion in the quarter to around \u00a3183 billion with most of the growth being in invested assets. This is a positive trend for the future, but the initial growth is in assets under supervision, which does attract lower fees. CC&P RoTE was 2.6%, reflecting the impairment build in US cards I've just talked about. And this will be the last time we report the CC&P segment as we start to disclose our US Consumer Bank and our Private Bank and Wealth Management businesses separately. Moving on to the CIB. CIB income of \u00a32.4 billion was impacted by lower year-on-year global markets income. The Q4 market environment had lower volatility in markets and subdued industry activity for banking. Investment Banking performed relatively well in this context, up 13% in US dollars and up 36% on Q3 with DCM outperforming the market and offsetting continued lower activity in ECM and M&A. We maintained our banking market share in 2023 whilst we repositioned the business in a record low year for the industry wallet. Markets income was down 14% in US dollars, against a record Q4 comparator for us, whilst our business mix also affected us. Corporate lending income was materially down on Q3 at \u00a340 million, primarily due to leverage loan finance marks of \u00a385 million. Underlying corporate lending income was stable. Transaction Banking deposits were also stable whilst income fell slightly versus Q3. Whilst deposit migration continues, this was at a lower pace than earlier in the year. And as a result, we are now again rolling a portion of the structural hedge related to corporate deposits. Looking at markets in detail on the next slide. There were several factors driving our performance in markets this quarter. Similar to Q3, both our business mix and the record comparator contributed to FICC income being down 22% year-on-year in dollars. Lower volatility in UK gilts compared to Q4 2022 and an industry-wide slowdown in rates and credit impacted Barclays more than our peers. And conversely, the market rebounded in securitized products where we currently lack scale. Equities performed broadly in line with peers up 3% in US dollars year-on-year. Looking at the longer-term trends in markets over the last four years, our share in income has been consistently higher than the previous three. And our income now includes a greater proportion of financing which, as we've said before, provides greater stability to our overall markets income. Turning now to the capital funding and liquidity metrics on the next slide. We continue to maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. Looking at capital in more detail on slide 21. We finished the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%. The announced \u00a31 billion share buyback will take us to 13.5%, in the middle of our target range. We generated 18 basis points of capital from earnings in Q4 and just under 150 basis points over the full year, both of which exclude a circa 20 basis points impact of the Q4 structural cost actions. Excluding the reduction due to FX, the \u00a36 billion increase in RWAs reduced capital in Q4 by 23 basis points. We'll say more about our RWA flight path over the next three years later, but I want to address two main headwinds here. The first is a move of our US Cards portfolio to an Internal Ratings-Based or IRB model. We continue to make significant progress towards at least 85% of credit risk RWAs being IRB, which is the level required by the PRA for IRB bank. This move results in an expected increase in RWAs of around \u00a36 million from half2 2024. We don't expect any further material impacts from model migrations from current portfolios beyond US cards. The second headwind is Basel 3.1, which we have quantified publicly for some time. The PRA's recent policy paper was constructive, and we've also worked through some refinements and mitigations. Furthermore, our previous Basel 3.1 guidance included an element for US cards RWAs, which has been superseded by the IRB migration. The aggregate impact of these factors means a materially lower impact from Basel 3 on implementation. And given this lower estimate, the total effect of the two headwinds is broadly aligned to the previously guided day one impact of Basel 3.1 towards the lower end of the 5% to 10% of group RWAs. Furthermore, as more risks are captured in Pillar 1, we would expect some offsets in our Pillar 2 requirements. On this slide, we're illustrating the drivers of the RWA increase from implementing IRB for US cards. When applied to US cards, our IRB models generate greater risk weight density versus standardized models. And the key driver is that the models include 2009 financial crisis, stress loss assumptions despite current and expected experience being materially less adverse. Under the US Basel 3 end game treatment, we expect our peers in the US to also experience a capital increase, although noting that these rules are yet to be finalized. There will be further details on planned migration in the US consumer bank presentation later on. So to summarize, we delivered on our financial targets in 2023. This, along with our strong capital position, enabled us to deliver a material increase in distributions to shareholders. It also represents a strong foundation on, which to improve over the next few years. I'm now going to take the Q&A. Given the time constraints we have, please, can I ask you to limit yourself to a maximum of two questions per person, and please stick to the full year results topics. There'll be plenty of time to discuss the investor update later on. And if you could please introduce yourself, as usual, not least I'm blinded by lights, so I can't actually see you very well. So thank you.\nA - Anna Cross: Alvaro?\nAlvaro Serrano: Hi. Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. A couple of questions, please. On the markets performance in Q4, you've touched obviously on the drivers behind it. But I wonder in the guidance you've given for 2024, what kind of environment are you factoring given it's proven to be pretty volatile? And maybe the general environment for CIB, how you're seeing it and what you factored it in that, how sensitive that 10.5% in the environment. And related to the Tesco slide, I mean, it does look pretty profitable. But maybe when you've discussed Tesco and what the discussion was with head of the Board, how did you compare that acquisition versus potential topping up your share buyback that you would have been able to announce otherwise? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thank you for that. So thanks for both questions. So in terms of the markets environment, I'm not going to give a trading update at this point. But what you will see later on is that the assumptions that we're making about both the markets and the banking wallet are very reasonable actually. We're not expecting an increase in the market's wallet in particular in 2024. So we believe they're reasonable assumptions. And actually, that leaves the actions to grow revenues largely in our hands, and Venkat and Adeel will talk about those later. In terms of Tesco, we will be talking later about our desire to grow lending in the UK and unsecured lending in particular. Now many of you have commented on the fact that we've lost market share in unsecured over the last few years. And actually, what Tesco does is it allows us to accelerate and secure the plans that we would otherwise have pursued organically. And we believe that we can make those investments and fulfill the distribution plans, not only the ones that we've announced today, but the targets that we are giving ourselves over the next three years. So we'll balance shareholder returns with investments but in our high returning businesses. Okay. Next question, please. If I could go to Joe, please. Thank you. If you're beyond the first row of tables, I really won't be able to see you.\nJoe Dickerson: Thank you. It's Joe Dickerson from Jefferies. Just a quick question since we're sticking to the Q4 here. This other element of the UK NIM keeps on rearing itself. So that was a favorable nine basis points quarter-on-quarter. Do you expect that to smooth out over 2024, this kind of volatility from the other aspect? And I suppose related to that, what are the market indicators we might be able to look at to see how that line is moving? Because it's been pretty material now for -- off and on for some quarters.\nAngela Cross: Okay. So just to remind you, what's included in that other. So two things really, basically any other product other than deposits and mortgages. So to the extent that we're seeing cards or, indeed, our SME lending moving around, you're going to see it flow through there but also treasury. So our NIM, remember, is an all-in NIM, some of our peers have a banking NIM, which excludes those treasury impacts. Really, what's going on in the fourth quarter is a reversal of what we talked about a year ago. And as such I don\u2019t expect that that impact to reverse as we go into 2024. So it's really a reversal of the previous impacts in most material form. Thank you. Okay. Can I go to this corner, please?\nGuy Stebbings: Thank you. It's Guy Stebbings form BNP Paribas Exane. One on UK mortgages and one on US cards. I think you said in your remarks earlier that you're going to see a net reduction in mortgage balances in the UK, excluding the Tesco acquisition. It just seems a little bit odd given some of the improving dynamics within that market from a volume perspective, in terms of the data. So I just wanted to check assumptions there. Also, some peers have talked better new lending spreads in 2024 versus 2023? And then on US cards, it's quite a step up in capital requirements from that model change. Just interested to hear if that changes your views at all in terms of the appropriate pace of growth for that business, or was this something that was always going to happen at some point in time? It's just particular timing? Thank you.\nAngela Cross: Thank you, Guy. So the mortgage market through 2023 and actually as we enter 2024 has been somewhat dominated by refinancing activity. So it's pretty skinny margins, still attractive but skinny. And it tends to lead to a negative net in the market, which is what we've seen. So we're calling out nothing more than that, really, that the trends through the tail end of 2023 have been towards negative net. And similarly, that matches up with, I would say, the broader macro trend around deposits, where with QT and a sort of more constricted money supply, we'd expect deposits to fall. So it's really that, that we're calling out in BUK, a contraction in the market in those two larger products, which we would expect to reduce our net interest income expectations before ultimately we see the balance sheet start to grow, and we'd expect that in the second half of 2024. Your second question, so I'm not going to comment too much on the strategy of the cards business because we're going to come to that. But we obviously always knew that we were going to have to go through an IRB conversion for US cards. We typically update the market when the quantum becomes clear and when the timing becomes clear. And that's become clear to us in Q1 of this year. Why are we updating you now? As I said previously, we included an estimate for it contained within our Basel number. Actually, the way things have turned out, it's a bit bigger, it's a year earlier, but conversely is offset by some of the updates that we have on Basel. But later on, Denny will take you through some of the ways in which we expect to specifically counter at this. Okay. Thank you.\nBen Toms: Good morning. It's Ben Toms from RBC. Just back to the NIM, if that's okay. Your NIM for the full year came in above expectations. Can you just talk a little bit about the deposit dynamics you saw in Q4 and where they were better than you previously expected? And then into 2024, I think you talked about deposits, expectations for the deposit balance to continue to fall. Maybe just about how you would extrapolate Q4 into 2024? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Ben. Yes, we ended the year with a Q4 NIM of 307, bringing the full year to 313. You might recall at Q3, we said we expected to be between 305 and 310, but that was largely dependent on deposit dynamics. And actually, it might be good to go to Slide 15, if we can because it might be helpful for this question. We said it'd be largely dependent on deposit dynamics, and if we saw a replication of Q3, we'd be at the top end of that range. And by my math, that's around 296. We ended up at 307 and the biggest driver is really that movement that you can see on the slide, where the deposit pressure in Q3 was 16 basis points and the deposit pressure in Q4 was 7. And that's really because we saw a stabilization of deposits across Q4. And I think that comes sort of in two ways. Firstly, customer behavior, customer migration really slowed down. And secondly, we saw a stabilization in pricing as the rate environment settled. So as a result, it was a markedly different deposit -- deposit environment. Now clearly, we take that forward into 2024, noting those macro trends. And I would say, also noting that Q1 and Q2 tend to be fairly active as a deposit matter just because of seasonal effects, so paydown of tax, et cetera, but also because of the season. But in the second half of 2024, I would expect this deposit activity to slow down and perhaps a little. And of course, we've got that ongoing impact of the structural hedge. So as we go into 2024, I think it's fair to say perhaps there's a bit more NIM stabilization than we might have expected. But we expect downward pressure on the balance sheet coming from both deposits and mortgages. And we'd expect to start growing the balance sheet again really towards the back end of the year, particularly, for example, through organic card growth in the second half of 2024. And of course, none of that includes Tesco, and we'll update you when we know the completion date. Okay. Where next? Rohith?\nRohith Chandra-Rajan: Thanks. Good morning. Rohith Chandra-Rajan, Bank of America. Thanks for the color on FICC. Just in markets, the equities business, looks like it's been struggling with market share for about the last 18 months or so. So I was wondering, if you could give us a little bit more color about if there are particular product areas that have been more challenging relative to the peer group. And then secondly, just on -- back on capital. You seem very confident that it's just US cards where we've got model updates. Why do you not expect them anywhere else, because that's already been completed? Or you think the risk weightings on the other models are in the right place?\nAnna Cross: So on equities, actually, performance is fine in the fourth quarter. Nothing I'd specifically call out. Adeel is going to talk later on about a couple of specific product areas, where we want to do -- where we have a bit more focus on going. So I'll let him pick that up then. But there's nothing -- there's nothing stand out. There's nothing particular that I would call out for Q4. On the capital point, as I said before, it's a requirement for IRB banks to get to 85%. The eagle-eyed amongst you, if you look in the Pillar 3, I forgot which table, but it might be 28, you'll be able to see that actually post-US cards, we get to around 67%. The step between here and full compliance is largely around the wholesale models. And actually under standardized, the wholesale models do a pretty good job of having the right weights against counterparties to reflect what would otherwise be an advanced treatment. So on wholesale, which is our only remaining big movement to make, we are not anticipating a significant movement in RWAs. And of course, outside of cards, you'd expect a movement from standardized to advance to actually reduce the RWAs. It just doesn't in particular with cards. And our UK cards book is already IRB-compliant. So this brings the US cards book up in alignment with that. Okay, Andy. I think, Andy, you might be our last question in the interest of time.\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. It's Andrew Coombs from Citi. Two questions, please. First, on the UK, we talked about the net interest income, which came in notably ahead of consensus, of course. So in the UK, net interest income, we've already talked about and came in notably ahead of consensus expectations. But on the flip side, the non-net interest income came in below expectations. I know there is the transfer of [indiscernible] there. Are there any other one-offs you'd like to call out in the non-NII in the UK? And my second question, a similar vein. The corporate revenues in CIB, again slightly lower in the quarter, anything you'd like to call out there in terms of leveraged finance, marks or hedges or anything else in that line item? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thank you, Andy. So on the non-NII in UK, as you pointed out, it has changed structure because we moved UK Wealth into Private Banking and Wealth, and we did that in Q2 of 2023. The other thing just to call out is, previously, we've seen relatively lumpy debt sales go through that line in the past. Don't expect that going forward. We've got a forward flow arrangements. So it drips through the P&L in a much more gradual way. In terms of the one-offs across Q3 being positive and Q4 being negative, they're all too small really. There's nothing I would specifically call out, which is why we're trying to be helpful here and give you some guidance to help you model it going forward and saying that we expect it to be above 250. And on the corporate lending line, clearly, that does include the costs of our SRT and it does include the cost of the portfolio hedges. But really, the only significant point in the current quarter is \u00a385 million of leveraged loan marks that we took in the quarter. I wouldn't call anything else out specifically. I'd say that underlying corporate lending income is broadly stable from where it's been over the last few quarters. Okay. And with that, I will close the full year part and invite Venkat to pick up the strategy update.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you, Anna. Right. So now we come to the strategy update part. It's been 10 years since our last Investor Day. A lot has changed in the world since then. A lot has changed at Barclays. So today, what we do is we present our vision for the future. It's a vision of a better run, more strongly performing, higher returning bank. It's a vision of a Barclays, which encompasses a potent collection of businesses and capabilities. Each is strong by itself. And together, they are mutually beneficial and reinforcing. It's a Barclays, which is appropriate to a changing and multipolar world, one which values a UK based bank. Equally, it is a Barclays, which seeks to deepen and broaden its role in the UK even as it engages with the world from London. As I say, we are very bullish on the UK as a place in which to do business and from which to do business. Importantly, it is a vision for Barclays that is committed to generating strong financial returns and distributing them to shareholders. In my two years as CEO, I have worked very closely with my colleagues and the Executive Committee, outside of it and with the Board, examining the path on which we have been, the direction we need to take forward. And what you will see in here today are the results of that work. We are creating a simpler, a better, a more balanced bank, words, which I will come back to later. It's dedicated to higher returns for its investors, and how we do that is equally important. It's a vision anchored in ambition -- measured ambitions, I call it, and it's driven by disciplined delivery. And as I said, it's harnessed to our home here in the UK. So we've embraced this plan of measured ambition, measured confidence. We start actually with very strong foundations. Over 20 million UK retail customers, and that is before Tesco, and we bank a one-fourth of UK corporates. In the US, our credit card business has a further 20 million customers. In our Investment Bank, we've built leading global markets and banking businesses, which are at scale today. I repeat, at scale today, delivering for our clients at a time when many competitors have pulled back and, in fact, some still continue to do so. For a long time, fixed income has been the calling card of Barclays. We are number three in credit and joined first fixed income financing. Our investment bank has led landmark transactions. And importantly to me, we were the top UK investment bank in 2023. This is a title to which I feel we all always must aspire. I said that we did an investor update 10 years ago, and Barclays has changed since that time, in fact, changed substantially for the better. We've strengthened the back financially, improved its capitalization and are now leaner. We reduced our headcount by about one-third over this period and our footprint more than 50 countries then to 38 today. We've exited non-priority businesses in Africa, in Asia, in European retail banking as well as commodities, and there are two more in advanced stages of discussion. We've reduced our RWAs by about 20% in this period, strengthened our CET1 ratio by 4.5 percentage points to 13.8% at year end, as we just spoke about. And at the same time, unfortunately, we have incurred about \u00a316 billion on litigation and conduct issues and costs. To me, this is a very, very disappointing number. And it is a stark and serious reminder as to why it is so important to run a bank well. And at the heart of running a bank well is what I call running it in a consistently excellent way. It is the surest way we have to preserve our reputation, protect our bank and all our shareholders. Over the same period, we have reset our financial performance, particularly in the last three years, delivering return on tangible equity above 10% since 2021 and distributing \u00a37.7 billion to shareholders in that period, which is 35% higher than the prior seven years put together. And while this has been an improvement, it is not enough. And indeed, our shareholder experience needs to be better. We have listened, we have heard and we will do even better. So how will we do even better? At one level, I want Barclays to be renowned for excellent operational performance. To me, operational performance and financial success are two sides of the same coin. Operationally, we have worked to what I call this new standard of consistent excellence for over 1.5 years, looking to reduce complexity, harnessing technology, promoting strong risk and controls and aiming to deliver a better customer experience. We need to continue to do this. Financially, we need to drive towards higher returns from our businesses while improving our efficiency. As I will talk about, we will invest RWAs in our higher return in consumer and corporate businesses while maintaining the RWAs and the investment bank broadly stable at their current absolute level. As you will hear, the Investment Bank RWAs will shrink in real terms as they will have to self absorb the impact of Basel 3.1. Crucially, we are targeting higher, more predictable shareholder distributions. And lastly, we will have clearer financial reporting, which will allow you and us to mark our progress more easily. So what will this plan deliver? First of all, improvement in RoTE from 9% statutorily in 2023 to 12% and above -- to greater than 12% in 2026. Second, we plan to distribute at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026, and this is about 50% of our current market capitalization. Third, we are putting a cap on the RWAs in our Investment Bank, reducing its share of RWAs from 63% in our current CIB construct to around 50% by 2026. And to me, these are the three important parameters and numbers that we're focused on. How will we do this? Over the next three years, we aim to make the bank simpler, run it better and make it more balanced. What does simpler mean? It means, first of all, a simpler business structure and then one that is organized and operated in a simpler way. I'll spend some time on this slide. From today, we will run Barclays through a business structure that, as I said, delivers greater accountability and transparency in reporting to investors. And there are three messages I'd like to bring out on this slide. One, why is this a simpler structure; two, why do we have each of these five businesses; and three, why do they fit together, okay? The structure is simpler because even though we go from three units to five, this reflects the way in which we serve our customers and clients and it increases the transparency on our performance. We will no longer report either consumer cards and payments or the corporate and investment bank in their current construct. Instead first, we bring private banking and wealth management at Barclays into one unit and we report this separately from the US Consumer Bank, which contains our specialty credit card partnership business in the US. From the old CIB, we have created the UK Corporate Bank, which serves midsized corporates in the UK. And this will be managed and reported separately from the Investment Bank, which now comprises global markets and investment banking. The investment banking part also includes our international corporate bank, which serves multinational corporate and institutional clients under one roof. As part of our effort to become a simpler business, we've also considered the strengths and weak opportunities within our portfolio. As a result of that, if you look at what is in gray, we are in advanced discussions on the sale of our German consumer business and our Italian mortgage book, and this will complete our exit from European retail outside of the UK. We are also evaluating options for our UK merchant acquiring business, which I will talk more about later. So the first point was the five businesses. The second point is how do we think about each of these businesses? We are at scale in Barclays UK, we are at scale in the Investment Bank, and we are a scale in the UK Corporate Bank. Our focus is on improving each one of them. Some parts will need to grow and they will. In the Private Bank and Wealth Management space, we are very profitable, as we show you, but we need to scale further. And in the US consumer bank, we are on a journey to scale while mentioning our specialist -- maintaining our specialist focus, which must be more profitable. And that includes better management of capital and the lower cost to income ratio, and we'll talk about that. Finally, why does this collection of businesses fit together? The way we think about it is either they have a UK focus and/or they bring synergies to the bank. For instance, if you take the US consumer bank, it has client synergies with the investment bank but also with our US cards capability as our Tesco mortgage -- Tesco Bank transaction shows. And given that we have in that transaction entered into a partnership program, which is, in fact, the focus of our specialty business in the US. Further, the US consumer business diversifies investment bank in the US stress test CCAR. Lastly, we've announced management changes this morning for our five businesses. They reflect both the promotion of the next generation of leaders for our important businesses as well as a rotation within Barclays to broaden the experience of some of our existing business heads. So Barclays UK will be run by Vim Maru, who ran the equivalent business at Lloyd's, and we look to him to apply his experience with Barclays UK. The UK Corporate Bank will be run by Matt Hammerstein, my colleague who has run Barclays UK for over half a decade and is now ready to step into this new challenge. His deep experience in the UK makes him an opportunate and fit person to run this division. Private Banking and Wealth will be managed by my colleague, Sasha Wiggins, who has served as both my Chief of Staff and managed our public policy effort most recently. She has her career anchored in our Private Bank before she ran our business in Ireland, and she brings the knowledge and the profile and the connectivity within the bank to achieve this ambition successfully. And our Investment Bank will be run by Adeel Khan as Global Head of Markets and Cathal Deasy and Taylor Wright, who remain Co-Heads of Investment Banking. Stephen Dainton, who co-ran Markets with Adeel, is appointed President of Barclays Bank plc and Head of the Investment Bank management. My colleague, Paul Compton, who's been with us on the Executive Committee for eight years, will step back from his current role as Global Head of the CIB and become Chairman of Investment Banking, speaking and working with our most critical clients. The US Consumer Bank continues to be run by Denny Nealon. These business leaders or all members of the Barclays Executive Committee, and they will report to me. So, that was the structure. Equally important in running the bank in a simpler way is how we operate them. We removed 5,000 roles in 2023. We are also repositioning about 30% of the people from our common platform, Barclays Execution Services, which we call BX. That's about 20,000 people. And we are driving that -- moving them into the businesses driving closer ownership, greater accountability, and speed of execution. We are focused on technology, which is a big driver of simplicity. 75% of our workload so far has been moved to the cloud with a plan to get this to 85% to 90%. We expect to decommission a further 450 to 500 legacy systems on top of the 400 that we have decommissioned to-date with a much greater focus in the future on buy versus build. So, I said, first, a simpler bank and then a better bank. What does better mean? Having the simpler business means we can focus on delivering better performance for our customers and clients and as well as improving -- delivering an improved financial performance for you, our shareholders. And we managed to do it in these ways. First, to better returns. As you have heard, we aim to deliver greater than 12% RoTE by 2026. To do that, we will continue to generate consistent high returns Barclays UK, the UK Corporate Bank, and Private Banking and Wealth, while investing more in these higher-returning businesses. At the same time, we aim to improve the investment banks RoTE from 7% in 2023 to be in line with the group target of above 12% by 2026. And in the US Consumer Bank, we are also targeting an RoTE of for 2026, in line with the group. So, up from the 4% in 2023, and building back towards the levels of RoTE, which we have delivered previously. So, we are generating higher group returns by a combination of delivering higher returns from businesses which need to improve and allocating more core capital to businesses that have consistently generated higher returns, and we expect them to continue to do so. The second part of running better is to continue to invest selectively. We have spent \u00a3300 million on cost efficiency and revenue growth and protection in 2023, and this number is increasing to \u00a3500 million by 2026. And while we continue to invest selectively in the investment bank, the proportion that goes to consumer-facing businesses will grow to 70% and the absolute amount will double. We are getting capital resources, as I said, and investment resources. Better income is not just higher income, but better quality income. And we aim to grow our total income to around \u00a330 billion by 2026. Today, we already have a balanced mix of NII and non-NII, which is relatively resilient through rate cycles. But if you look at the bottom of this chart, you see two parts: retail and corporate and financing. We consider these two to be more stable income streams and they have grown by about 35% since 2021. And the proportion from these more stable income streams will be about 70% of the bank's total income by 2026. This slide reflects the anticipated effect of the announced acquisition of Tesco Bank and the planned disposal of our German cards business. Lastly, and very importantly to me, happy and satisfied customers are the sine qua non for any enterprise. And we need to improve our customer experience and outcomes. I mean, to illustrate this in the UK our Net Promoters Score ranked 8th among 12 leading banks. This is not good enough. We aim to improve the customer experience by investing in it deeply, and making it not just a point of focus, but a point of ambition and a point of pride. Our investments across all businesses are aimed at operational excellence and client satisfaction. As I said at the start, they are the same thing, and it's the same side of one other side of the coin of financial performance. So we spoke about simpler. We spoke about better and we spoke now I'm going to talk about balanced bank. And what does it mean? It means a more balanced allocation of RWAs with more capital deployed to our highest returning opportunities and it also means a more balanced geographical footprint, more concentrated in the UK and in the US. We will continue to add discipline on how we allocate capital both across the bank and within the businesses of the bank. Of the \u00a350 billion which we now expect an RWA increase between now and 2026, we intend to allocate about \u00a330 billion to our three UK businesses: Barclays UK, the UK Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth Management. Now this includes the about \u00a38 billion in RWAs in the Tesco Bank acquisition, which we announced 10 days ago. Of the \u00a320 billion in RWA increases are allocated to the U.S. consumer bank, about \u00a316 billion is driven by the changes in regulation that Anna spoke about earlier. Investment Bank RWAs as I have said will be relatively stable and, in fact, shrink in real terms because they are absorbing -- we are absorbing in the investment bank, the impact of Basel 3.1. Over the medium-term, this will rebalance RWAs between our consumer and wholesale businesses and will support more consistent and higher returns. As I have said, the investment bank is both very competitive and at scale. Our prior CIB construct accounted for about 63% of the group's RWAs. The newly segmented investment bank accounts for about 58%. And as a result of the rebalancing of the group that we've announced today, it will reduce to about 50% by 2026. Further, as I'll talk about later, we will recycle capital dynamically to the highest returning areas within the investment bank, and I'll talk about that in the next presentation. And we do that so that it can grow income without needing more capital, improving productivity and returns for the group. Taken together, all of this delivers a more balanced bank. Now, coming to geography, I said earlier that, we feel very confident in being a bank that operates in the UK and from the UK, and it is time to grow in our UK market. We have been UK-centered bank for 330 years. We are still transatlantic with an important presence in New York. But the UK is a great place to run a scaled banking franchise. The economy has remained resilient. The legal and regulatory environment is extremely strong and trusted. And for our international businesses, people want a UK counterparty. Taken together, operating out of London, we aim to be the UK-centered leader in global finance. So in summary, we aim for stronger returns, greater shareholder distributions and operational excellence. They all go together. We will do so by having a simpler structure, better operation and financial performance and a more balanced business. So I repeat the words I said earlier. On the one hand, simpler, better, more balanced that's the type of bank. On the other, we get there with our approach of being disciplined, consistently excellent in our operations and risk managed in a way that will deliver enhanced returns for our shareholders. So what I will do now is turn it over to Anna to talk through what all of this means in financial terms for our shareholders in more detail. Anna?\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Venkat. As you've heard, our new three year framework sets out more ambitious financial targets, it's going already, and meaningfully higher our shareholder distributions. I'm now going to take you through what underpins these plans. We start from a strong foundation, having delivered RoTE above 10% for three years now, excluding the structural cost actions taken in the last quarter. Our objective is to deliver RoTE above 12% in 2026 as we grow and generate further efficiencies. Along the way in 2024, we aim to deliver returns of greater than 10% whilst we reposition the organization and navigate the changing macroeconomic environment. Our plans to 2026 include the announced acquisition of Tesco Bank and the planned disposals of the German consumer business and Italian mortgage book, where we are in advanced discussions. I do anticipate that these planned disposals will reduce RoTE in 2024. So on an underlying basis, I expect we'll deliver around 10.5%, broadly flat to 2023. But this inorganic activity focuses our businesses for RoTE improvement beyond 2024. So in executing these plans, we are focused more on what we can control. And over the coming slides, I'll talk you through the drivers of RoTE across income, costs, impairment and why we're comfortable with the assumptions that we have made. But before I do though, I would like to cover the impacts from the cash flow hedge reserve on this slide. With a year-end value of negative \u00a33.7 billion, it is currently a drag to tangible book value per share. As we expect its value to increase going forward, we're confident that our tangible book value will increase from the year-end position of 331p per share. And whilst mechanistically, it creates a drag on routing. It's worth remembering that its movement -- that movements in the cash flow hedge reserve don't impact our ability to distribute capital. So, turning first to income. So what underpins our nearly \u00a35 billion of income growth? First, a tailwind from our structural hedge; second, some reasonable assumptions in the investment banking wallet; and third, the deployment of RWAs into areas where we have a credible opportunity to grow. So the plan includes the capital effect of \u00a330 billion of RWAs deployed into high-returning UK business, and we will focus that on areas where we are, frankly, underrepresented. For example, we've been traditionally been underweight in high-value mortgages. Our acquisition of Kensington provides us with the capability to expand in specialty mortgages and drive higher margins. In our UK corporate bank, our ratio of loans to deposits is very low and much lower than our peers. In UK cards, we have lost ground and aim to recover it. And clearly, the acquisition of the Tesco business accelerates and secures our plans in this respect. As a reminder, we hedged the return from rate-insensitive deposit balances and our equity, and in doing so, we smooth our income profile through rate cycles, reducing interest rate risk. Given that we are at the point in the cycle where rates may have peaked and are now expected to fall, it acts as support and stabilizer. We have around \u00a3170 billion of hedges maturing over the next three years at an average yield of 1.5%, significantly lower than current swap rates. The expected NII tailwind is significant and predictable. \u00a38.6 billion of aggregate income is already locked in over the next three years. And in addition to that, reinvesting around 3/4 of the \u00a3170 billion at current swap rates would compound over the next three years to increase structural hedge income in 2026 by \u00a32 billion versus 2023. Turning now to the assumptions that underpin our investment bank. Venkat and the Adeel are going to take you through how we plan to improve our RWA productivity and reallocate capital within the investment bank overall to generate higher income and returns. But it's very important to us that our growth in the investment bank is driven more by the execution of our own initiatives than by the market wallet. So we are not assuming that the market wallet returns to the highs of 2020 and '21. In fact, our plans assume that the market's wallet is broadly flat to 2023, and the investment banking wallet reverts to the 10-year average from last year's decade lows. Going forward, we do expect higher income from the investment bank. Of course, managing costs is at the heart of what we control, and I'm now going to explain how both the efficiency programs and the changing shape of our investment spend deliver a more efficient and profitable bank. I gave a breakdown of our structural cost actions earlier. And to date, we've used efficiency savings to offset inflation. Now we expect these to more than offset inflation, bringing us capacity for business growth. The first \u00a31 billion of savings lands in 2024, including payback from around half of the Q4 structural cost actions and a further \u00a31 billion of cost efficiencies is expected through to 2026. And it's really important to stress that the efforts will not end there but continue to benefit our businesses beyond that point. We would expect in our business growth cost to flex in line with income. So overall, we're targeting a cost-to-income ratio in the high 50s by 2026, improving from 63% in 2023. Given the income target of \u00a330 billion by 2026, we'd expect costs to be higher in absolute terms versus 2024 at around \u00a317 billion. So spend on regulatory change has been very intense in the run-up to Basel 3.1, and we anticipate that this will peak in 2024 and then fall to a more normal level as material projects complete. This will give us the capacity to invest more in income growth, efficiencies and returns without increasing our total investment spend. And on the next slide, you'll see how these actions will improve efficiencies in each of our businesses. We expect to drive better cost income ratios across all of our divisions and not all of them, however, will be top quartile compared to peers by 2026. Whilst the leading cost efficiency is a goal for all of our businesses over time, for some of them, we don't believe it's a credible ambition within this plan period. Barclays UK and the investment bank fall into that category and together represents some 70% of the cost savings we're expecting. And whilst the 2026 targets will take us more in line with the top quartile of peers, they don't represent the scale of our ambition, and we're committed to driving further efficiency savings beyond that point. In BUK, our ongoing transformation program has been successful in streamlining and digitizing, but there is more to do. And you'll hear more on how the identified savings will offset inflation and facilitate growth. In the investment bank, we spent about \u00a33 billion since 2021 to sustain and grow future income, and around two-thirds of that is in market technology whilst the focus in banking has been more on people. And we will now monetize the investments. So in the future, we aim to self-fund further investments, and total costs are expected to rise only modestly from 2023 levels. Turning now to our risk positioning. I explained earlier that we plan to increase RWAs in Barclays UK, UK Corporate and Private Banking and Wealth by an aggregate \u00a330 billion. This is a substantial shift in capital allocation and will reflect significant growth in lending across all three businesses in the planned period. When considering the associated risk, it is essential to understand where we start from in balance sheet terms. We've grown lending between 2019 and 2023 by \u00a329 billion but that's through mortgages at low LTVs and lending to corporates over which we have significant loss protection through risk transfer trades. Our unsecured lending has fallen despite US cards growth. So, at this point in the cycle and as inflation continues to fall, we see an opportunity to reestablish our position in lending in the UK and unsecured in particular. And because of where we start, we're comfortable that we can do that within our existing risk appetite whilst maintaining our 50 to 60 basis point loan loss rate through the cycle target. In Barclays UK, as we grow, we expect the normalization and loan loss rates towards 35 basis points, consistent with the 2019 level. In the US Corporate Bank, we expect the loan loss ratio of about 400 basis points through the cycle as we grow a more diversified portfolio and optimize our credit mix, still prime but not exclusively super prime like our LI files. And finally, as we grow our UK corporate bank lending book, we'll maintain our diversified portfolio, including our long-standing prudent approach to commercial real estate. And we'll continue to use significant risk transfer protection where appropriate, and I expect a loan loss rate of about 35 basis points. Over recent years, we benefited from our diversified business model through a range of macro environments. And this diversification has provided us with relative stability to RoTE during the 2020 to 2023 period that we've just experienced. For example, in 2022 at the onset of the pandemic, our global markets business supported our performance when elevated impairment charges impact to the rest of the group. In 2023, we've seen a weaker investment bank income and decreased volatility and lower deal activity. But in this environment, our consumer and corporate businesses have provided ballast to group returns. We believe there's a natural offset built into our diversified business model by income and by geography and further supported by the stabilizing effect of the structural hedge. And reflecting this, we are confident that we can deliver consistent returns in a range of scenarios, providing a floor to our ambition. And on this slide, we've provided you with our macroeconomic and market assumptions, which we view as realistic. The next few slides describe how our drive towards higher and more predictable returns come together for our shareholders. We have a clear hierarchy for capital allocation. In order of priority, first, how much capital do we need to run the bank, taking into account regulatory changes including Basel 3.1. Our 13% to 14% CET1 ratio range remains unchanged with sufficient flexibility and appetite to operate within the range and absorb headwinds. By doing so, we'll deliver for our investors, our customers, our clients and our colleagues regardless of the environment. Our next priority, having maintained our target regulatory capital is to our shareholders, and going forward we expect to generate a greater amount of free capital for shareholder distributions. And third, we will balance this thoughtfully as we invest selectively in our higher-returning divisions, resulting in a more profitable RWA mix over time and a better bank for our stakeholders. We set a high bar for investment returns relative to the importance we place on shareholder distributions. In 2023, our 9% statutory RoTE delivered more than 125 basis points of CET1 capital accretion. By 2026, with higher returns, we expect this to grow above 200 basis points. We expect meaningful capital generation over the next three years. Taking into account capital demands from regulatory change and investment in higher-returning businesses, we expect to have meaningful free capital supporting our distribution plan on the following slide. We have distributed a total of 7.7 to shareholders over the past three years compared to \u00a35.7 billion over the preceding 7, and we expect this to increase further through to 2026. We've made one step change. And as you've heard today, we plan to make another and return at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. And this is in addition to today's announced full year final distribution. Including those distributions, the total would be at least \u00a311.8 billion by 2026 and represents approximately 55% of our current market cap. From this year onwards, we plan to keep the total dividend broadly stable and grow dividend per share progressively through lower share count. Over the past three years, we've reduced our total number of shares in issue by around 13% and do expect further reduction from the higher planned share buybacks from here. So to summarize, there are three key points of reset in today's targets. First, we're targeting a RoTE of above 12% in 2026, up from 9% statutory in 2024. Second, we expect this improved profitability to support our plans to distribute at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. And finally, the proportion of the RWAs in our investment bank to the rest of the bank will reduce to around 50% by 2026. We have also set ourselves some supporting targets, which allow us and you to track our progress. We expect to grow our income to around \u00a330 billion by 2026 with more stable income streams growing by around 15% and maintaining a high-quality mix. We aim to improve our cost-income ratio to the high 50s as we balance future investments with further efficiency savings and capitalize on the cost actions we've taken already. And we maintain a 50 basis points to 60 basis points loan loss rate guidance as we grow our loan book within the existing risk appetite, all the while maintaining a solid foundation and operating across our 13% to 14% CET1 ratio range. Now I'll hand back to Venkat.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thanks, Anna. So to summarize this first part of the presentation, what is the investment case for Barclays? As I said, we have very strong foundations. We have a high returning UK retail and corporate franchise, which complements our top-tier global investment bank with scale in our home market in the UK and in the US. We manage our capital in a disciplined way, growing our higher returning divisions, while improving RWA productivity within the investment bank. And over the medium-term, we will rebalance our capital allocation between and across our consumer and wholesale businesses, and we do this in order to support more consistent and higher returns to our shareholders. So from a strong foundation of double-digit returns over the life of the plan, we plan to deliver over 12% RoTE by 2026. And I think this reflects both ambition and realism. We are well-capitalized, have deep liquidity, sound risk management. And when you combine that with consistent and improved profitability, we believe it enables a higher return of capital to you, our shareholders. And we plan to return at least \u00a310 billion, as Anna said, to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. This is our vision for a better run, more strongly performing and higher-returning Barclays. So I will now open for question and answers, for which we have about half an hour assigned. Please limit yourself to two questions per room that we can get around as many of you as possible. As always, please introduce yourself, and there will be more time for Q&A after the business presentations.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Alvaro.\nQ - Alvaro Serrano: Thank you. Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Again, just a couple of questions on, I guess, capital allocation and distribution. The disposals you've earmarked, Germany, sort of, the mortgage -- Italian mortgage business and the payments merchant acquiring, is this about, sort of, simplifying the business, sort of redeploying capital to sort of your core regions that you identified? And/or how much do you need this to further \u00a310 billion distribution? I guess where I'm coming from is, there's quite a bit of headwinds, as Anna pointed out probably earlier than expected on credit card. Do you need these disposals for the \u00a310 billion distribution to happen? How much are they dependent? And should we think about the \u00a310 billion to be a progressive number? Or is it back-end loaded? Or can you maybe talk about that? Thank you.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes. So let me answer the first part about the actions and then Anna can cover the capital piece. We're doing this to simplify our business, right? We -- in fact, one of these things was identified many years ago is something we wanted to do in Italian mortgages. And German cards, we are not the best holder for that asset. It's a non-core to us. So that's the reason to do it. Obviously, if you gain some benefits from it, you can deploy it elsewhere. But the primary purpose is the simplification of our business and concentrating on our core capabilities.\nA - Anna Cross: Thank you, Alvaro. Let me pick up the capital detail there. So, if I just take the businesses in turn, As Venkat said, the overall objective is simplification. Our German cards business is not large in scale. You'll see from our disclosures, it's about \u20ac4.5 billion. And as we noted earlier, we would expect that to be -- the disposal to be slightly accretive to capital but not an enormous number given the scale of the business. Our Italian mortgage business, we are relatively well-progressed. We might expect some negative impact on RoTE from the sales I called out previously, but we expect that to be capital-neutral. So, it's actually neutral to our distribution plans. And in relation to the payments business, we're not required -- or our distribution plans do not require any action on that business at all. As we said, we've got it under a strategic review as we consider in future options for it. But we don't require a sale of that business to fulfill the \u00a310 billion. As it relates to specific timing, the way I would think about it is we'd expect 2024 to be broadly similar to 2023 and we'd expect distributions to increase over time at the point when Basel 3.1 is behind us and when the high returns for the businesses start to come through. So, I would say a gradual increase over time. Okay, I was going to say Jason has his hand up for longer. So, let's go to Jason.\nQ - Jason Napier: Thanks. Good morning. Jason Napier from UBS. Two -- thank you -- and perhaps following on from comment you've just made. The impact of disposals in the round, all of the potential things that you're trying to get done on this year's RoTE, I appreciate Italy probably is a loss-making endeavor but there may be gains elsewhere. So, what have you got in the RoTE guide for this year for that? And then secondly, the targets for 2024 quite clearly suggests no negative operating leverage from all the moving around that's going to take place in the balance sheet and so on. And while I appreciate a lot of the guidance you've given for 2026, as you look at consensus for 2024, it's at least 10% lower in profit terms than you're suggesting you'll achieve today. Is there any color that you can provide on the place where you think the market is too pessimistic? Thank you.\nA - Anna Cross: Yes. Okay. So, I referred to it in my scripted remarks. We'd expect the impact of inorganic to be around 40 or 50 basis points this year. So, that's why we've distinguished between our statutory target of greater than 10 and indeed the number that I called out on an underlying basis, which is around 10.5. And as a RoTE matter, the biggest moving part in there is actually Italian mortgages. But as I said, no not expected to have a significant impact on capital. So, hopefully, that's relatively clear for 2024. In just of 2024, I would say as I look at consensus, obviously, our plans are above their -- my expectation of cost is broadly an element with consensus, so I think around 16.5%, I would be happy with that number. There is clearly a difference in terms of income expectation. I'd also call out, it looks like there's a difference in terms of impairment expectation as well. Remember, before I talked about US cards perhaps being a little bit heavier in the first half of the year and then falling later. So, I think they're probably the biggest difference is, Jason.\nQ - Raul Sinha: Thank you. It's Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. If I can have two as well, please. The first one is just one of the key highlights of your plan is the growth ambition both in the UK and outside the UK. And I guess if we look at the evolution over the last few years, the change here seems to be the ambition to grow the UK and in particular, I guess, a change in the UK unsecured and cards strategy. I think, Anna, you described it has not a change in risk appetite. And I was wondering if you could elaborate that. Because from the outside, it might appear that you are changing your risk appetite to take more risk in the UK. So that's the first question. The second question is, there are plenty of people out here who are more -- who reward cost-cutting plans and might be less optimistic on the revenue environment. So, just on that point, the 1.7 billion of business growth-related costs, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of how permanent those costs might be, and if you ended up in a macro environment, which is slightly different from what is in your plan, how much of that 1.7 billion can be flexed quite easily? Thank you.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Shall I take the first part, Anna on the risk and then you take the second part on cost. So within our broad risk appetite, which is the way we generally look at not just what our expected losses, our credit losses are, but also internal stress tests and so on. This fits well in. In a sense, it's a reversal of a risk position, which the former Chief Risk Officer took a few years ago, where post-Brexit and in COVID, we were extremely cautious on the UK consumer, rightly or wrongly. And equally, there was a structure which we had in our credit card business that favored longer bigger balance transfers. What we're talking about now is something that does not emphasize that. It is a generally higher quality, but broader expansion of unsecured lending. And this is both in loans and in cards. The Tesco portfolio by our judgment has a very similar credit profile to our own. And so it is within the broader risk limits. Obviously, you're taking on more risk by doing it than if you didn't, which is the point of your question. But we think on a risk return basis, it's going to be accretive, which is why -- of course, why we do it.\nA - Anna Cross: Thank you, Venkat. I think also, Raul, it's really important to remember where we start. So in BUK, I think over the last 10 quarters or so, we've had a very, very low loan loss rate. We've consistently -- under consensus consistently under 30 basis points. So we're starting from an extremely low base rate. And actually, we've already started acquiring. We stepped back into the market in '22. It just takes a while for that lending to season through, which is what we're observing now. On your second question around costs, our fundamental objective here is the RoTE, it's 12%. And therefore, as far as Venkat and I are concerned, the primary target is the cost-income ratio target. The \u00a317 billion is the number that falls out, okay? And that \u00a31.7 billion is the business growth that we would expect to flex. Now most of that is run the bank cost, there'll be an element of performance costs in there. And of course, we will seek to flex that if the income is either up or down relative to that \u00a317 billion, and that's why we're calling that number out specifically. As to your point around the macro though, I'll take you back to the point where we feel like we've made realistic assumptions. We've got a well-diversified bank. So we're confident in our ability to grow. We've set out today for you the expectation of that, which is 30 and 17. Obviously, over time, we'll flex both of those numbers, but the RoTE is the heart.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: And when we've looked at this plan through the range of economic scenarios Anna put out, we think it's fairly robust. Nothing is ever totally in variant, but it's fairly robust to changes in that. Okay. Sorry. And then Joe and then Andy, all right?\nQ - Ben Toms: Ben Toms from RBC. You mentioned at the beginning, if you wind back 10 years and look at the last investor update and since that point in time, we've had \u00a316 billion of litigation and issues. Going forward, could you just give us kind of what you've penciled in to the plan for conduct and litigation going forward, given that was probably quite a big surprise versus last time. And maybe comment on whether there's anything in there for motor finance. And then secondly, in terms of the ambition for the investment bank and keeping RWAs flattish, 50% of total group by 2026. Can you maybe just give some color on which product lines are the ones in the investment bank that will probably bear the brunt of absorbing the Basel 3.1 RWA inflation?\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Can I just say on the second half, why don't we wait until we have the investment bank presentation? You're going to get more detail on that. And then if you still have a question, we can on the first half, Anna, if you want to take it.\nA - Anna Cross: So as we plan going forward, obviously, we plan for an ongoing and relatively low level of litigation and conduct costs just purely as a technical matter if we were planning for anything in a concrete way or if we expected anything in a concrete way, then we'd be providing now and calling that out in today's results. So that's how we think about it. As it relates to motor finance, we exited the business in 2019. Up to that point, we had a relatively low single-digit market share. There's clearly the FCA review ongoing. There are a number of potential outcomes from that. And so at this point, we have not sought to make a provision both because of that range of outcomes, but also because we haven't received a material number of complaints. So that's the reason why we haven't provided at this stage\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Sorry, Joe, go ahead. Then I'll come back there.\nQ - Joe Dickerson: Hi, thank you. It's Joe Dickerson again from Jefferies. Just on the -- looking at the optionality in the UK merchant acquiring business. One, I'm supposing there's nothing in the 2026 targets that suggests completing something on that front, correct me if I'm wrong. And then two, is this something that you're looking at more from a cost efficiency standpoint? Or what would be the rationale there? Is it that it doesn't fit with the integrated overall payment solution, et cetera? \nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: So let me again go to the second part first and then Anna can come to the first part. We'll talk more about it. But in a nutshell, what it is, is about a form of partnership to deliver better technology more efficiently on acquiring to our clients. We intend to remain in the full ecosystem of payments, which includes acquiring. It's just we think that part can be delivered better in partnership with others, and that's what we're talking about. And so we'll come back to that.\nA - Anna Cross: And Joe, just in relation to the 2026 targets, we've included merchant acquiring within those targets, partly because we are exploring options at this point in time, we haven't made any decisions. But also, as Venkat pointed out this business in whatever form is critical to Barclays, the Barclays ecosystem, and in particular, to our corporate and SME clients. So either way, it's a service that we would expect to have. \nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes, Andy. Andrew Coombs\nQ \u2013 Andrew Coombs: Thank you. Andrew Coombs from Citi, again. Two questions. First, big picture strategic question. If you believe the press is part of Project Minerva, originally, there were some bigger strategic decisions considered the US cards, the equities business, et cetera, et cetera. Obviously, what you've decided today is more kind of shifting things around the edges and reallocation of capital as opposed to any larger exits or divestments. So if you could just elaborate on thoughts there, if there was anything you consider anything you ruled out, that would be helpful. Second question, number-specific question on Slide 48, our favorite hedge roll. I missed this initially, but in the footnote, you say you only plan to roll three quarters of the hedge, which would suggest quite a sizable decline in the notional. So why is that? What's the rationale there? And if you could also just provide us with the split of where the income is recognized now on the new segmentation basis. So two-thirds will be in UK, but how does the other one-third split between IBAN and corporate UK?\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: So, what I said at the start, Andy, was that in two years as CEO, working with my colleagues, working with the Board, we've obviously taken a broad and deep look at the bank and the direction which we want to take. And your question was specifically about the investment bank. And it has been very clear to me from the very start that the investment bank, a, has been at scale, approaching scale, that the businesses which we have work fairly well together and are linked and are mutually reinforcing. We'll talk a little about efficiencies which we can do within the investment bank, between banking and markets and even within markets. So I'll come back later to that question about where are we getting our the efficiencies from when we come to the investment bank section. But it's equally important to recognize where we start from in the investment bank. There are many businesses in which we are not. And we are at scale for what we do. We are not in commodities. We are not in Asian equities. We are not in local emerging markets other than in India and a bit in Brazil and Mexico, actually Mexico. So there are things we are not in and we don't plan to get into them. And if you even look at the last three or four years, the areas we have built are three and talk about it, areas of focus. Financing is one of them where we've been steadily accreting market share. Equities has been one of them through prime, but not just prime; and securitized products because in the fixed income is the calling card of Barclays, as I said, and you can't be in fixed income without being strong in securitized products. And we've always been good in origination and financing and what we are doing is building trading. So it is very conscious of the ecosystem in markets -- and in banking, as we will talk about, it's been debt capital markets heavy moving to equity and ECM. But it fits together. We don't feel the need at the scale which we have and the footprint that we have to take any of the sort of more drastic actions that others have taken. So let's come back to US cards. I believe it's a business of great synergy, as said, and it stands on its own two feet. It had a low RoTE print this year, but we're going to talk to you about how we manage the capital change as well as how we -- not just in some capital management but also cost management. So we'll come back to that.\nA - Anna Cross: And on the hedge roll, I mean, what that three quarters tells you is that we do expect continued migration and reduction in deposits called out the sort of broader macro effects and really we're reflecting those. So that's why we're saying we -- our assumption is that we'll roll about three-quarters of it, and that's what builds up the math that I referred to. As to where that actually lands, still two-thirds within BUK. The rest of it will be spread across UK corporate. There will be some in the investment bank both because of the international corporate bank, but also remember, the equity structural hedges allocated through RWAs and then obviously the private banking and wealth. So perhaps we'll come back to you and others, Andy, with a bit more of a detailed split of how we expect to land in the future.\nQ - Andrew Coombs: Thanks.\nQ - Guy Stebbings: Thank you. It's Guy Stebbings from BNP Paribas Exane. Building with you on the first of Andy's question again around the outlook for the IB in the plan. I presume you had multiple iterations that you considered, and one of those perhaps you wouldn't have constrained capital to the IB at all as you are in real terms here ex the regulatory changes. I'm just interested in that plan, how much incremental revenues you might have generated from the IB. Obviously, not looking for a number, but just in broad senses. And with that being the case, if you are constraining capital, I'm just trying to get a sense as to how much that could inhibit market share gains? Thank you.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: So just as we -- I said, we came to a conclusion very quickly that the IB was at scale. We came to a conclusion equally quickly that it was at the appropriate scale, right? And in fact, what we needed to get was capital efficiency, which is what we are doing. And that's what we're going to talk about. So in essence, the analysis didn't go there. I didn't think it needed to go there, right? Capital efficiency was what we thought we could get. And what you will see later is a plan that looks to get greater revenues with less capital. Right. Other questions, yes.\nQ - Rohith Chandra-Rajan: Rohith Chandra-Rajan. And just kind of follow on from that, actually. If your revenue aspirations end up being more capital intensive than you currently planned for, how would you deal with that? Would you not go for those revenues and maintain your RWA expectations? Or would you try and cut costs further to compensate? Or would -- I guess the other option is to change your distribution. So when you're thinking about those options, what would be the ordering there? So that was the first one. And then the second one was just, you've given us some very helpful information on how you're re-segmenting the businesses. Curious to understand a bit more about how that changes the way that you actually run the business. So this essentially is a breaking out of subdivisions within existing businesses. So what synergies or improvements does that drive across the business? Is it just focus or is it something else?\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Shall I try both?\nA - Anna Cross: Yeah.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Okay. So I think when you look at the way we -- Anna described the capital and the use of capital, she said there were three things. The first thing was to be a well-capitalized bank, and that is the 13% to 14%. The second thing was the shareholder returns, the \u00a310 billion. And the third thing was after that, investments. If you look at the investments we're making and have been making and we lay out in this plan, they are in businesses that are today returning in the high-teens or 20% and above. well above what most people would consider our cost of capital. So that's basically the answer to your question, Rohith, that if we have that waterfall, we have the discipline that anything we are going to do is going to be above what is our accepted cost of capital. And so, I don't foresee ourselves breaking from that waterfall, right? We're going to be guided by it. That's the first part. On re-segmentation, and Anna, you should stick into both. But on re-segmentation, first of all, as I said, it's guided by how we run our businesses and our clients. There are tremendous synergies, including synergies, which you might not easily anticipate. I spoke about the synergies between US cards and the UK cards business. Tesco is a 20 million credit card portfolio, 20 million is a lot of people to bring on to your systems. When we did GAAP, we did 10 million, right? So we clearly have an experience of a scale that, frankly, no other UK bank can match. You'll also see synergies between private banking and wealth and our corporate bank, private banking and wealth and our investment bank in terms of both products and clients and, of course, private banking and wealth and our UK banking network. We'll talk about that and the corporate bank synergies to everybody else. So there are strong synergies, which we intend to exploit and continue to exploit as we go through this. And you'll hear more about it in the afternoon, later today.\nA - Angela Cross: I'll just reiterate that the capital allocation priorities are very clear. On the second point, the way I think about it, we report how we manage, not the other way around. And we want to manage the business in a very client-focused way. And therefore, our reporting is changing in alignment with that. But we will still continue to generate the synergies that Venkat is talking about. We will still leverage common technologies and common services across our BX entity. So still very, very focused on keeping the firm connected with that consistency.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: And when you think about that last point about common technologies and services, when you run a large bank today, as some of you who work in one now, there's a lot of investment that you have to make. We spoke about some regulatory change. It's models, it's fraud systems, it's all sorts of things, risk systems. And to be able to, in essence, spread it across many businesses is really important, right? So it's a synergy in cost that people don't often think about, but redeploying quantitative resources, redeploying databases and technology is a big part of it. Other questions? All right. So we reassemble at 10:45. So there is food and drinks at the back. We'll come back to our regular presentations. The ladies, is somewhere there and the gents is somewhere outside. Thank you. So we'll see you at 10:45, about 20 minutes.\nEnd of Q&A: [Break]\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you. All right. So we're now going to begin with the discussions about the individual businesses. We'll begin first with the Investment Bank and then we'll go to U.S. Cards and Barclays U.K. And then I will come back to spend two minutes on -- not two minutes, a few minutes, on the U.K. Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth. Later this year, you're going to hear from the heads of those businesses in more detail. And then within the Investment Bank, Adeel Khan is going to talk about the Markets business. I will cover banking at a higher level. And later this year, you'll hear from Kahil and Taylor in detail on banking. So let's begin with the Investment Bank. For over two decades, investors have been asking questions about the size and the importance of Investment Bank at Barclays. And you heard a little even today. Should we have it? Will it be competitive? Is it good for the U.K. to have an investment bank and more? Let me be very clear. I am proud of what we've achieved. We have built a leading business, a globally competitive investment bank. As I've said, it's performed very well. It is at scale. It is a critical part of Barclays, and will continue to be an important part of Barclays. I'm equally clear that there is a lot more to do. Our investment bank has to be higher-returning, and relatively speaking, it has to become a smaller part of Barclays. As I've also said in answer to some of the questions, our Investment Bank is a focused business. We powerfully cover large sections of the global capital markets with deep client relationships. And what we want to do is strengthen this position in our key areas of coverage. We aim to deepen our client relationships and to monetize the investments we have already made. And even as our investment bank grows in absolute income, we aim to hold our capital broadly flat to today's levels. And so importantly, therefore, we expect a higher RoTE from our investment bank. And we're going to be more efficient in our use of capital, as I've discussed earlier. But the simple way to think about it, is that we are looking for the Investment Bank to grow and to contribute more while consuming less, to contribute more while consuming less and we're going to show you how. So what is the Investment Bank? We've changed that structure, as I mentioned earlier. And so going forward, its two businesses: Global Markets and Investment Banking. Together in 2023, they contributed \u00a311 billion of top line revenue to the bank. The UK Corporate Bank was part of what we called the CIB, and that is now reported separately and I'll talk about it later. There is also an important business, the international corporate bank, which serves our largest corporate clients in the UK and elsewhere. It already works closely with our investment banking business but now will be managed, operated and reported as one unit. This combination of businesses will allow us to deepen our relationships with clients, both large cap and multinational corporates, which require access to the full spectrum of investment banking capabilities. And so that is beyond DCM, ECM and advisory into corporate lending and transaction banking. The Global Markets business, which comprises fixed income and equities, remains the same. Important, of course, is how markets and banking cooperate and work together to deliver the entire suite of investment bank capabilities to our clients, and I'll come back to that. So today, the investment bank has strong foundations. As I said, with the scale and breadth to succeed amongst our largest global peers, and we are focused on our core strengths, which is very important. It's diversified and has a stable top line, which I will take you through, and we have focused top tier businesses and have demonstrated strong risk and capital discipline. The secret sauce in our investment bank is in our synergies. I'll repeat it. The secret sauce in our investment bank is in our synergies. We are big enough to offer multiple sophisticated products to our clients, but both nimble and culturally driven to work closely across banking and markets to customize delivery and to create tailored solutions. And this nimbleness and cultural drive are really important. In fact, we are renowned for the sophistication of our service, especially our fixed income and risk solutions for our clients. About 55% of our revenues come from the Americas, which is the largest financial market in the world, and which is why I believe we are the only known US domiciled investment bank that can consistently compete with the US banks and win. This audience more than anybody else should appreciate the importance of a strong research franchise. And so I think you know us well here. We have many top research teams and we are maintaining momentum as a top five research house globally. We lead with data-driven content and help clients identify and adapt to changing thematic trends of the future, and these capabilities underpin our client relationships. And it's an important ingredient in helping us grow our rankings both with our top 100 markets clients and with banking clients and you'll hear Adeel about that in a minute. So let's go to financial performance. Looking at our financial performance over the last three years, what you will see is that our income has been relatively stable at around \u00a311 billion, and I'll talk a little about that. But RoTE has reduced from 14% three years ago to 7% in 2023. Both RWAs and costs have risen as we've invested deliberately in the business. But what we want to show you now is how we will improve our RWA productivity, capture cost efficiencies and generate income growth by monetizing the investments, which we have already made. We aim for the RoTE of the investment bank to be in line with the group's greater than 12% target by 2026 through three key levers: income, RWA productivity and cost -- income, RWA productivity and cost. So let me start with income. One reason why people have always questioned the value of the investment bank within Barclays is they think that it's a volatile business. And up to a point, it is. There are parts of this business income that fluctuate with the markets and fluctuate with the economic environment. What we have been doing though is to construct a business that has greater stability through two things: one is diversification and the other is what we call ballast, businesses with stable income. So if you look at the top-line, it has been in the \u00a311 billion to \u00a311.5 billion range since 2020 through changing, and some would argue, volatile market environment which include COVID, which include recent geopolitical instability. So let me take those two things first. First, you take diversification. We get diversification between the volatility-related elements of banking fees and market trading revenues or what we call intermediation, the top two lines. And in volatile markets, trading revenues go up, deal volumes tend to shrink. And in common times, the opposite happens. So this means a combination of the two more stable than for banks which have only one deal making or only have trading, right? That's the diversification between the relatively volatile elements. Then you come to the ballast, which is what you see circled at the bottom. And the first part of that is our financing income, the money which we make from lending to institutional clients against stocks, what people call prime, and against bonds, which we call fixed income financing. It's a business in which we have invested heavily over the last number of years. It's technologically complex and it's very sophisticated. You have to manage the risks well. And our income has grown from around \u00a31.8 billion in 2019 to \u00a32.9 billion in 2023. Adeel will talk about this in a moment. The second source of ballast is our international corporate bank. That income has grown also. It's helped, of course, by the rising interest rate environment. But in turn, it makes for a more stable top-line. So I said first is income. And you continue with income, and what you've got, as I said, is a scale business overall, but two businesses at slightly different stages of evolution and success. In Global Markets, we've made significant investments in technology and capital and we've had a corresponding growth in revenues. What we want to do now is monetize the investments which we have made and continue and deepen our capital discipline. The bottom-line here is that the markets business is at scale, it's well invested in, and it's a counterparty of choice for the most sophisticated investors in the world. The investment banking business is at an earlier stage of maturity. It has just gone through a repositioning under new leadership. We have to strengthen in DCM and in the UK and with financial sponsors -- we have strength in DCM and in the UK and with financial sponsors, but we need them to broaden and we need to deepen. We're happy to focus here on RWA productivity, trying to move the business from being debt-heavy, which tends to be RWA-heavy to be more balanced across advisory and ECM, and fully integrate with our international corporate bank. Anna spoke to you earlier about the income growth in the investment bank and how much of it is under control, is in our control. And on this slide, what I want to convey to you is that over half of our income growth is coming from initiatives, which we control. This means, of course, doing things better, because our team and client relationships can improve and deepen. And it is not arising from heroic assumptions about wallet growth or market share. We expect high single-digit income CAGR through 2026, but over half of that comes from management initiatives in markets and banking, which Adeel and I will cover in more detail shortly. The remainder comes from a normalization of the industry wallet. But as you heard from Anna earlier, it's not the industry wallet going from lows to highs, but it's going from its currently low levels to more historically normal levels. So the first lever was income. The second is RWA productivity. So moving to that second lever, what does RWA productivity mean? And why is it important? As you can see from the top left, as we've increased RWAs in the markets business, we've actually kept the ratio of income to RWAs relatively constant. This reflects capital discipline, which we need to continue by recycling capital continuously to higher returning opportunities. And it also benefits from the higher velocity of capital, which we allocate to markets. On the other hand, the right hand side shows banking income over RWA, and this has declined over this period, which reflects the reliance on DCM in our current mix. As I mentioned, we have a plan to improve this, and I'll cover this among the key initiatives in a moment. Overall, we intend to increase RWA productivity by reallocating capital towards the higher returning international corporate bank, and that's within investment banking, and as well as towards financing opportunities in markets. So income, RWA productivity, costs. And so the third important lever is costs. We have invested in a very planned and focused way in the investment bank, both in markets and banking, to the tune of about \u00a33 billion in cash investment in the last three years. In markets, it's mostly been about technology. Investing in the modernization of our infrastructure not only simplifies our operations and reduces costs, it also drives improved stability on our platforms, which leads to better client outcomes. Remember what I said at the start. Technology excellence and client outcomes are the same thing. In investment banking, of course, it's much more of a human capital business. And what we've invested is in people with a focus of the infusion of talent in our focus sectors and products. Now, what we intend to do is to monetize these investments and grow future income with relatively modest cost growth expected across the investment bank. So this includes higher performance costs, given the higher income, which we have in our plan. We will, of course, continue to make focused investments in our client franchise, but we expect these to be self-funded by efficiency savings. Overall, we expect to deliver an improved cost income ratio from around the 69% we have now to the high 50s by 2026. So, let me now take you through these two pieces, and Adeel Khan is going to begin -- I'll begin with investment banking and then Adeel will go to market. So in investment banking, I said that our markets and banking businesses are at different stages of evolution. What our markets business did three to five years ago has been paying off, and we look to do the same in investment banking. So we start with some points of advantage. As I said, we are consistently number six globally. We finished this year over 2023 as the top UK investment bank, which is a position I always inspire to hold. We look more like a US bank than a European one. If you look at 66% of our revenues coming from the Americas and which is a much more profitable market than Europe. I've also said debt and DCM is the calling card of Barclays, where we are number five globally. We've also ranked number five with financial sponsors and have established ECM and advisory practices, but we need to grow them, and I'll describe that shortly. We intend to leverage our strength in DCM in several ways. We drive greater product penetration with clients, making existing capital allocated to our loan book work harder for us. First, we aim to broaden the product relationship with existing clients, principally by a treasury-oriented products and services. Second, we will continue to provide sophisticated rates, FX and equity risk management solutions to our clients through ongoing collaboration with global markets. And these synergies are important. This kind of business is typically originated with investment banking clients, but designed and executed in our markets business. Adding incremental products requires minimal additional capital and provides attractive recurring revenues, as I'll cover on the next slide. Our international corporate banking business is already well established in the UK, where if you look at it, 92% of our UK investment banking clients, have corporate banking dealings with us. That number is far lower outside the UK, and we aim to increase that by fully integrating our treasury platform into the investment bank. The ICB generates high-quality income and about 80% of it is recurring, therefore, making it more stable and more predictable, and it is capital efficient, helping RWA productivity, which is an important area of focus for us, as I said. We also need to rebalance our investment banking mix. We recognize clearly that we are overweight in DCM, and we are going to grow the proportion of our relative share in ECM and M&A, and we aim to do this in two ways. First, we have invested on the top right to upgrade talent in technology health care and energy transition. Over 60% of the hires for which we made in 2023 were in these sectors. And together, they represent -- these sectors represent about 40% of the industry wallet in the last three years, and we are confident that they will continue to be important. We also have an opportunity to leverage our strong position with financial sponsored relationships, where we rank on par with our US peers and to do more, ECM and M&A with the same sponsor clients as our US peers do. So to summarize on investment banking, we've got the products. We've got the client relationships. We've got the capability. What we've got to do now is to translate it into returns. And the bottom line in the Investment Bank is we expect to generate about \u00a3700 million of income growth by 2026 from management initiatives. We will do this by building our key share to the levels we had a few years ago in the ways in which I outlined, and by improving our income productivity to drive further returns. I will turn over now to Adeel to talk about global markets, and then I'll come back to conclude.\nAdeel Khan: Thank you, Venkat. Good morning, everyone. My name is Adeel Khan. I run the markets business at Barclays, and I've been here for the last 15 years, a stat I'm incredibly proud of. So before I start, I think it's important to set the stage. Over the last few years, we've all lived in an increasingly challenging environment. This has been experienced by a lot of few. As Venkat mentioned, we've gone through a pandemic, a war in Middle East and Europe and also a unpredictable inflationary environment. So our clients have also experienced this and the increasingly need a more reliable partner. So with all of this in mind, our ambition for the business is fairly simple. Number one, we want to be a consistent partner for our clients. And secondly, we want to drive stable double-digit returns for our shareholders. So how do we do this and what are our drivers for success. Firstly, we won deep, broad client relationships within our business. Secondly, we want prudent risk and capital discipline within our businesses. And lastly, we want to transform our technology to drive better outcomes. So now I will run you through our plans for the next few years. But before that, let's start with the numbers. So on the top left, you can see in 2019, we produced \u00a35.3 billion of revenues. Now we knew at \u00a35.3 billion, we cannot produce stable double-digit returns or be consistent to our clients. So we embarked on a new strategy. And over the last four years, we have increased our average revenues by \u00a32.2 billion. And today, we run a \u00a37.5 billion revenue franchise. Now we care deeply about the capital we use to produce these numbers. And last year, our income to RWA ratio was 6.2%. Now that is a little light compared to where we like to operate, and we have generally operated higher. Plus in periods of volatility, like 2020, we were at 8%, which means we serve as a natural hedge for group income. Now over this period, we've also grown our institutional client market share by 200 basis points. In fact, since 2019, we have been the second fastest-growing client franchise among the major banks. Now if you look on the right, you can see that we have diversified ourselves across geographies, capabilities and businesses. Our regional footprint has a strong lean towards Americas. As Venkat mentioned, we are the only non-US bank with scale access to the largest capital markets pool in the world. Our businesses are equally weighted among equities, spread and macro. And while individually, these revenue streams can be volatile depending on the operating environment, together, we think they are stable. And lastly, we have grown financing. It is one-third of our revenues today. This is a stable and predictable income that allows us to be more strategic with our clients. So in summary, when you think about markets today, it is a business with deep, broad client relationships. It's also highly diversified, so it can produce stable double-digit returns. And lastly, it is at scale at scale to be competitive and a relevant player in the market. Now Venkat talked about simpler, better and more balanced, I will walk you through the same journey and starting with simple. So for us, it's very simple. Our client franchise is what drives everything. On the top left, you can see through an intense focus on our clients, we have been improving our client franchise. Today, we are a top five client franchise in global markets, in fixed income and in equities. In fact, what is more impressive because you have US banks in the mix here is that we have grown our client franchise by one notch in markets, two notches in fixed income and three notches in equities. Within our client franchise, we have also grown our share with the top 100 clients by 220 basis points. And our growth and progress is not limited to that account base. We've made similar progress with the next 150 and the rest of our clients. Now if you look on the right, you can see how many of our top 100 clients we rank top 5 with. In 2021, that number was 30%. We wanted to deepen our relationships with these clients. Why? Because they are large and they're growing. They're also more complex. So they like to partner with the same reliable banks again and again. And that brings more predictability and stability to our income. So we implemented an accountability framework with a lead client executive per account. And we figured out where we needed to lean in across the investment bank and the group versus asking for more. And today, through that framework, we have grown our number to 49. Now we will apply the same framework and intensity of coverage to grow this number further to 70 by 2026. Now staying on the team of simpler clients are important. They bring us to business, but the stability of our platform relies heavily on how well we risk manage ourselves. On the left, you can see that we have broadly kept flat broadly stable VAR profile despite transacting much more volumes to our platforms. Over the last few years, we've also made a deliberate effort to move away from illiquid longer-dated type intermediation activities into more flow focused businesses. And so because of that today, we turn over 80% of our market's cash balance sheet on a weekly basis. And this is what enables us to outperform in periods of volatility like Q1 2020 and Q2 2022. At the same time, 70% of our capital profile today is under two years, and that is how we recycle 20% of our intermediation RWAs every quarter towards higher returning opportunities. Now on the right, you can see the bell curve of our income distribution, and you can see how we have shifted it to the right. In 2019, half of our trading days, half of our trading days sat in the \u00a30 to \u00a315 million bucket. Today, we have moved them all into the \u00a316 million to \u00a330 million bucket. This effectively means we have raised the floor on our income, and it also makes us more stable. In this process, we've also taken the number of our loss days or loss-making days from 16 to seven in 2023. Now moving to the team of better. Let's start with our businesses. Here, you can see the strength of our franchise. Our top five revenue rank businesses are 53% of the wallet today. So effectively, we are a top five player in half of the market's wallet. This is a very large wallet of nearly \u00a3100 billion. And within these businesses, we have a strong market share of 11% today. In 2019, we had 8% market share. And over the last few years, we have grown that, and we've held a double-digit market share now for the last three years. Also today, 72% of our income comes from these established capabilities, which again means we are more stable. So how did we achieve this? Since 2019, we used our capital discipline and allocated them an extra five points of capital. And now five years later, their contribution to our revenues has increased by 12 points versus the respective wallet contribution only growing by two points. This tells you that there is strong evidence here that when we provide oxygen to our established capabilities, we can outperform the market. Let's take the example of our equity prime business, which Venkat talked about. In 2019, we were outside the top five. This is a business that requires a huge amount of infrastructure. And we know in order to finance a client, we must be able to execute clear, settle and asset service to collateral across all major global markets. So when the operating environment changed in 2020, we invested. And today, we run a top five franchise that actively competes with its US peers. Now I'd like to make two final points on this slide. Firstly, the 11% market share we have here, this is in our established capabilities. We want to grow this further. This is where we have operating leverage. And secondly, as Venkat mentioned, prior to 2019, we did make some very difficult decisions. We exited commodities. We exited parts of our onshore emerging market trading businesses. We exited parts of our Asia equity business, and that is what has allowed us and enabled us to be consistent to our clients for the last few years. Now moving on to the rest of our franchise. There are parts of our franchise where we are not top five. We still have a healthy market share of 5% within these businesses. And we think about -- when we think about these businesses, they are important to us for two reasons. Firstly, they help us maintain a stable ecosystem to our clients, so we can be consistent to our clients. Secondly, they represent opportunities for us either because we have lost some market share or the operating environment is changing. For example, last year, in European rates and equity directives, we did lose some market share due to idiosyncratic reasons. But traditionally, these businesses have been very large for us because in rates, we have our Sterling franchise. We're also a primary dealer in 17 countries. And our corporate derivative franchise through banking brings us large structural advantages. Similarly, in equity derivatives, we are one of the largest issuers of structured nodes. So over the last 12 months, we are addressing our platform gaps, and we have already allocated them the capital they need to regain their lost market shares. Securitized products, is a different example. This is where the operating environment has changed. The life cycle here is you originate a pool of assets, you finance those assets and finally, you trade those securities. We have a top three origination franchise. We've built the top five financing franchise, but we did not trade these securities. So in 2021, when QT was starting, we realized there was an opportunity. So we invested in the product. And today, just as the operating environment is improving and our clients need us, our investment is starting to come alive. Now these three opportunities together represent an extra \u00a3500 million of revenues for us, and just a 1% market share here gives us an extra \u00a3200 million of revenues. So given our historic market shares and the fact that our client franchise has stayed strong within these businesses, it gives us confidence that our plans are measured and prudent. Now staying on the team of better, a common dependency across all of this is technology. Today, within our trading businesses, our clients increasingly experience us through our electronic offering and in our financing businesses through the stability and delivery of our platforms. Now this experience relies heavily on running a smooth life cycle of a transaction. And the life cycle of a transaction through pre-trade, pricing and post-trade has large dependencies on your technology infrastructure. So our journey here started by simplifying our infrastructure. We started getting rid of legacy applications, legacy point-to-point feed, and we have now decommissioned 84 applications since 2021. Once we simplified our infrastructure, we started modernizing it. We started putting new applications in the cloud. We started containerizing new applications, and we also started creating more reusable applications. So what happens once you have simplified and modernized your infrastructure, you start to become more stable and agile. And today, we run a much more reliable platform. Our outages are down by 78%, and that is something our clients care about deeply. At the same time, our breaks are down by 53%, and that is something our regulators care about deeply. And finally, now we are more agile. We are releasing more algorithms. We're deploying product features quicker within our platforms. So, why does all of this matter? Because eventually, we want better electronic platforms, because we want these businesses to play a bigger role in our revenues as their capital-light businesses. And you can see that our efforts are paying off. Today, we are ranked number one on London Stock Exchange, and we have grown our low-touch equity and FX revenues by 87% since 2019. So finally, moving to the team of more balanced. We want to be more predictable and stable. So we did that by growing financing. Since 2019, through a very deliberate strategy, we have grown our financing revenues at a 13% CAGR for -- from \u00a31.8 billion to \u00a32.9 billion in 2023. Today, they represent 36% of our markets revenues, a very stable 36%. Now, why did we want to grow these revenues? Firstly, they represent stable and predictable income for us. Secondly, if you look at all the consolidation, AUM consolidation going on among clients, their financing needs are going up. This gives us an opportunity and enables us to be a much deeper partner with our largest accounts. Thirdly, these are RWA efficient businesses that are secured lending businesses. So, we like the risk profile -- the risk-weighted profile of these businesses. And lastly, there are huge barriers to entry here. So, to operate at scale, you require a huge amount of investment. Now, our platform has been tested over the last few years here. Between 2019 and 2023, there were some very large moves in asset prices. And these moves happen in a very, very short period of time. That is the worst kind of operating environment you can have for this business. Despite all of that, we managed our credit and operational risks very well through this period. Now, I want to share two more facts with you before I leave this slide that gives us confidence in our financing platform today. Today, we have a financing relationship with 96 of our top 100 markets clients. Secondly, over the last -- or since 2021, over 50% -- more than 50% of \u00a31 billion-plus hedge fund launches. These are large, very experienced hedge fund managers. They chose Barclays to be their prime broker at the beginning of their journey. That gives us a lot of confidence in our platform, but it also tells you that clients are trusting us at the beginning of their journey. Now, to wrap-up, we will stay focused on clients. We want to further deepen our relationships by achieving a top 5 rank with 70 of our top 100 clients. We're going to remain prudent around risk and capital management. We're going to deliver an extra \u00a3500 million through a three select intermediation businesses, while maintaining momentum in our top five franchises. We will complete and monetize our technology transformation, so capital-light businesses can play a bigger role. And finally, we're going to bring more balance to our financing revenues by growing them by an extra \u00a3600 million. Now, I'd like to finish by saying we have been executing a strategy that is working since 2019. We have been consistent to our clients. We have been a reliable partner to our clients. At the same time, we have the ability to produce double-digit returns regardless of the operating environment. So, the next few years are about executing the same strategy with the same precision and discipline that we have applied over the last few years. Thank you. And now I'll pass it back to Venkat.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you, Adeel. So, I'll wrap up on the Investment Bank. So, what you've heard from Adeel in the market side, and what you heard from me is that overall, we intend to improve the investment banks RoTE to be in line with the group target of about 12% -- above 12% by 2026. We recognize that this is a significant increase on the 7% last year. And I believe from what I've told you though, that and what you've heard from a deal, that this is a credible and achievable ambition built from the foundations we've developed. Our income growth target in this is a high single-digit CAGR, and it's firmly predicated on initiatives which are within our control. And it monetizes investments which we have made in cost and capital, driving strong operating jaws and resulting in a cost-to-income ratio in the high 50s. You have heard that we are limiting the proportion of the Investment Bank RWAs to the rest of the group at around 50% by 2026, as we allocate more capital elsewhere to higher return in consumer and corporate businesses. We can achieve this, while absorbing regulatory inflation within the investment bank, due to the capital discipline, which already exists in our markets business and a pathway to improving return on RWA in the Investment Bank. And as I said at the start of this, we are looking for the Investment Bank overall to do more with less, keeping the cloud clients at the heart of what we do and indeed deepening those relationships with clients. We expect this plan to generate stable and attractive returns on a consistent basis, supporting our group targets and delivering value to our shareholders. So I will now hand over to Denny Nealon to take you through the US Consumer Bank Presentation.\nDenny Nealon: Okay. So, good morning, everybody. I'm Denny Nealon, CEO of the US Consumer Bank, a role I've held for the last four years. I've been in the financial services industry more than 25 years, having previously worked at JPMorgan Chase and Bank One and have been with Barclays since 2004. I'm excited to be here today and talk with you about the US Consumer Bank, a business that was previously reported within the consumer, cards and payments division. I'll focus my comments on three areas. First, I'll provide an overview of the business, as well as some key US market characteristics. Then I'll review our financial performance and key performance drivers. And finally, I'll walk through our plan to achieve mid-teens road on a sustainable basis post migration to IRB capital rules. Now, let me tell you more about the business. So the US Consumer Bank has been part of Barclays for 20 years, and we're principally focused on providing credit cards to US consumers. We operate in what we call partnership cards, which is essentially a business-to-business to consumer model, where we partner with global corporations. Partners choose us to help them drive increased sales and customer loyalty through the co-brand or reward cards that we provide. Focusing on partnership cards is a conscious choice that we made, which plays to our strengths in a market where we would otherwise have to invest significantly to build brand awareness. The strategy has worked well for us. We've grown significantly and are now the ninth largest issuer in the US and a leading partnership issuer. We have approximately 20 million customers across 20 partnerships and [Technical Difficulty] Yes, thank you. Okay, so starting back with Slide 92. As you can see on this slide, we partner with 20 leading U.S. brands across multiple industries. And I already mentioned a few of them by name. A key point here, very strong relationships, many of whom have been with us for more than a decade and our historical renewal rate is about 90%. And importantly, this portfolio is very balanced by size without undue concentration risk. That said, the current portfolio mix is heavily weighted to airlines. So we are diversifying our sector exposure. The addition of GAAP in a partner in 2022 was a noteworthy first step, which I'll talk more about later. So Slide 93 and now turning to financial performance from 2021 to 2023. First point, first I'll point out that the 4% road he delivered in 2023 is clearly below our target level. I will explain the drivers of this performance shortly. But it's important to state that this level of return is not representative of the strong underlying performance of the business. We've grown net receivables by $10 billion, or 45% over the last two years to $32 billion. We've achieved that through a balanced mix of strong organic growth post-COVID and strong inorganic growth from the acquisition of the AARP and GAAP portfolios, with combined balances of close to $4 billion at acquisition. Alongside balanced growth, we have also seen significant growth in income and an improvement in NIM to 10.9%, driven by the benefits of a higher interest rate environment, the addition of the GAAP portfolio, and normalizing revolve rates from COVID lows, and a steadily improving cost-to-income ratio, in part reflecting benefits of beginning to scale the business. But offsetting these, the loan loss rate increased to 500 basis points as we built reserves for the expected rise in write-offs, which were coming off of historic lows consistent with those seen across the industry. In addition, new accounts were down significantly due to less travel during COVID, which otherwise would have matured and added to profitability in 2023. This, along with a large allowance build, resulted in a lower-than-normal RoTE of 4%. Now, switching to the next slide, Slide 94, I'd like to use the remainder of this presentation to articulate why we are confident that we can deliver returns in line with the group target by 2026, even in the face of regulatory headwinds in the form of IRB and late fee legislation, and also give some color on the impairment outlook and why we think it will revert towards our historic long-term average in the future. Now moving to Slide 95. We have a very clear path to deliver RoTE in line with the group target by 2026, which incorporates three elements. The first is the stabilization of consumer credit performance. Second, the specific actions we're taking, which will improve performance by scaling the business, driving improved operational efficiency, and expanding margins, each of which I'll talk about in more detail shortly. And third, it considers regulatory headwinds that we are actively working to mitigate. But first, it's important to understand USCB's track record, which gives us confidence that we can deliver on this plan. If you move to Slide 96, please. As you can see from this slide, the business has a long track record of growth, returns, and prudent risk management. In the nine years before COVID, the business delivered an average RoTE of 16%, helping the group achieve its return targets over that time. The RoTE performance since 2020 has been uneven, reflecting impacts from COVID, but given the recent balance recovery and normalization of customer behavior, we expect future performance to return to the more consistent pattern delivered between 2011 and 2019. It's also worth noting that we are making very deliberate investments to scale of business. New account originations incurred J-curve effect, principally driven by upfront marketing and day one impairment build, which dampens in year RoTE. That said, these annual new account vintages mature to RoTEs of greater than 20% over time. This is one of the key reasons why scaling the business is so important. This J-curve effect will decrease significantly at greater scale with a mature higher returning back book becomes a larger percentage of the total portfolio. Additionally, greater scale has the added benefit of reducing volatility when we add new partners in the future. Now moving to slide 97. We're back up. Okay. Now building on the theme of USCB's strong track record. What we wanted to highlight on this next page is how the business compared to other top 10 US issuers over the last 10 years, using delinquency rates as a proxy for credit quality. And as you can see from the chart, we have consistently maintained our position within the peer group during the period. Even in the early and mid-2010s, when our average FICO score was a bit lower than it is today. And being positioned in the middle of the peer group is consistent with our partnership-focused model, where we balance the need to deliver resilient risk-adjusted margins for shareholders with trying to say, yes, to as many of our partners' customers as we can. While we've seen a recent uptick in 30-day delinquencies, this is expected as we are coming off historic lows during COVID, and as you can see, very much in line with industry trends. We believe this 10-year period demonstrates two things: first, that we have demonstrated strong credit discipline over time; and second, that we have not taken on outsized risk to grow the portfolio at the rate we have. Now let's take a closer look at the drivers of impairment over the last few years. As previously mentioned, the recent normalization of delinquencies was expected and is largely a reflection of customer activity catching up from COVID lows. While write-offs have been broadly stable, you can see that we've rebuilt loan loss reserves to cover the write-offs we expect in the future following the normalization of delinquency rates. While this positions us well for the future, the in-year impact in 2023 was significant. Now looking ahead, we expect delinquencies to continue to tick up in the first half of 2024 and then to stabilize. The result is that we expect the 24 and 25 impairment charges to be below 23 levels and for our loan loss rates during those periods to be closer to our long-term average rate of around 400 basis points. Importantly, we remain well-provisioned as evidenced by a strong total coverage ratio of 10.2%. As you can see, we've also provided our US legal entity CECL coverage rate of 8.2%, which is in line with US peers. Finally, it's important to note that we continue to feel encouraged by the health of the US consumer. Unemployment levels remain near historic lows, moderation in inflation is contributing to real wage growth. There are still healthy levels of excess savings and strong spend and repayment levels persist. Now in line with the group, our plan to improve returns can be viewed through the lens of simpler, better and more balanced. And I'll speak to these individually in a moment. But to summarize, we are looking to improve operating efficiency, scale and diversify the business, improve margins and optimize the use of our balance sheet. Now, starting with simpler. As you can see from the charts, recent investment in the business has improved operational efficiency, but we recognize there's more to do. We've invested to digitize the business and built the retail platform as part of the Gap acquisition, which will enable us to add new partners more efficiently in the future. This increased investment onboard Gap, combined with lower card balances and subdued income post-COVID, drove our cost-to-income ratio in 2021 to 60%, significantly higher than our long-term average. Since then, though, these investments have helped reduce the cost per average active account by 15% and contributed to a reduction in cost income ratio to 51% in 2023. Now looking forward, as we continue digitizing, automating and scanning the business, we expect a further reduction in cost per average active account, contributing alongside margin improvements to a cost-to-income ratio in the mid-40s by 2026, broadly in line with our historic average. On the left-hand side of the slide, we provide a few examples of what we mean when we say we can become more efficient and improve customer experience by digitizing and automating key customer journeys. Transaction dispute or rewards are two great examples of common points of customer friction, which today too often result in customers reaching out to our call centers. We can simplify processes like these that customers can self-serve through the device of their choice without ever picking up the phone. That's simpler for our customers and more efficient for us. And we have similar opportunities on the colleague front and so are investing significantly to upgrade colleague tools and are leveraging automation to eliminate manual time-consuming activities. Now, moving to better and more balance. We will also look to scale and diversify our business, targeting $40 billion in net receivables by 2026. That strong track record of growth since 2011, where we've grown receivables at an 8.5% CAGR versus a 5% industry average, gives us confidence that we can achieve this through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. We see a large opportunity to grow in the retail vertical, and we expect the retail portion of the portfolio to increase from around 15% today to around 20% by 2026. And this will also help us rebalance our FICO mix to improve risk-adjusted returns. We also plan to recalibrate our risk-based pricing in response to industry-wide lead fee reductions. We expect that over time, this and other actions will fully offset any headwinds from these changes. Now on the liability side, today, we're about 60% funded by core deposits, which is a great low-cost way of funding our card assets. We are investing in new capabilities for our deposit platform, including targeted marketing to our partners and a tier-based pricing strategy, which should result in around 75% of funding coming from core deposits by 2026. Overall, we expect these actions to drive more than 100 basis points of NIM expansion by 2026. Now turning to the shift to IRB capital requirements, which you heard Anna speak about earlier. The first point, I'd like to make is to reiterate that this is a PRA driven adjustment that is industry-wide and not US CV specific. There is no underlying credit problem that is driving this increase in RWAs. We expect US card issuers to also see an increase in 2025 under proposed Basel rules. But as you can see, the capital treatment for us under IRB is significantly more conservative than the current standardized model. This will impact us in the second half of this year with an expected RWA increase of around \u00a316 billion or our risk weighted density equivalent increase of around 60%. While this will have an adverse impact on returns, we've been focused on a series of actions that will reduce the impact and help deliver returns in line with the group target by 2026 and mid-teens returns over the long run. These actions include: re-optimizing credit line strategies and leveraging strategic risk transfer agreements to reduce capital requirements, enabling USA need to continue to grow but at a less capital-intensive rate. So, to summarize, the US partnership market is very attractive with solid economics, ample room for growth, and require specialized capabilities and expertise that we have developed over the last 20 years. We have a proven track record of winning and growing partnerships, producing strong outcomes for our partners and customers and delivering strong value return for shareholders. Although there remains some uncertainty with regard to the macroeconomic environment, we are well positioned. We have extensive experience managing credit through multiple cycles and are also well equipped to manage regulatory change. As you can see, we are outlining key targets for the business that underpin our commitment to deliver returns in line with the group target by 2026. First, we will continue to scale the business and grow receivables to \u00a340 billion. We will deliver a net interest margin of more than 12%, which represents more than 100 basis points of growth. We will drive cost-to-income ratio down to the 51% we saw in 2023 to the mid-40s, reflecting our long-term average. We will continue to manage credit risk prudently, and we will manage loan loss rate to around 400 basis points, also consistent with our long-term average. On RWAs, we are taking action and expect 2026 RWAs to be around \u00a345 billion, which represents an RWA density of around 145%. As we deliver upon these targets, we will be building momentum in the business that not only will deliver returns in line with the group target in 2026, but will generate increased confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term goal to deliver mid-teen roadies on a sustainable basis. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to future opportunities to discuss the business deal. I will now hand over to Vim Maru, CEO of Barclays UK.\nVim Maru: Good morning, everyone. I'm Vim Maru, the new CEO of Barclays UK. I know many of you here today through my 20 years in financial services, and I look forward to getting to know you again in my new capacity. So let me take you through how Barclays UK or BUK, as we call it, is going to support the ambitions and targets that Venkat and Anna just set out. As you know, BUK is our ring-fenced bank. It serves retail customers and small business clients across the UK. Barclays 330-year heritage helps to build deep customer trust and a strong brand position. Whilst our history gives us those foundations, our focus is on positioning the business for the future as a growing high-returning business, which delivers good customer outcomes. That's about making BUK more efficient, investing in our client and customer relationships and growing through more tailored products. Before I come to each of those, let me briefly remind you exactly what BUK is. BUK operates at scale in an attractive and sophisticated market. We have 20 million active customers. The depth and breadth of those relationships provide a robust and strong deposit base. That is the foundation of our lending businesses where we are a leading player in the mortgage, credit card and loan markets for individuals and small businesses. Over 80% of our income is generated by net interest income, and we are committed to growing this through a combination of lending growth, asset margin enhancement and the structural hedge program that Anna mentioned earlier. That structural hedge program is a fundamentally important part of how we manage the business through an interest rate cycle. The strength of our deposit franchise is the result of significant investment in focus over many years, irrespective of the rate cycle. That hedge helps ensure we can maintain investment in our customers, efficiency and asset growth. All of that underpins our plans to maintain a high RoTE performance. RoTE for the past three years has been around 18% or higher. We have been disciplined in the way we have delivered these returns with positive jaws in our cost-to-income ratio, low impairments through tight credit controls during the pandemic and a conservative funding profile with low loan-to-deposit ratio. We know we have more work to do to drive more efficiencies and lower our cost to income ratio, which we aim to reduce to around 50% by 2026. Our prudent risk and funding profile means we have the capacity to grow lending whilst maintaining our discipline, thus enhancing our profitability. So how do we intend to do that? Consistent with the group's strategy, we are focused on making BUK simpler, better and more balanced. We will be simpler by investing in digitization, automation and technology, delivering material efficiencies. We will be better by investing in customer experience and our product offering, supporting the relationships that underpin our deposit franchise and creating opportunities to broaden these relationships. We will be more balanced. We have positioned the business conservatively over the past few years. Now is the time to grow by winning back market share on the asset side of the business, particularly in unsecured lending and business banking. I'm going to spend a little time on each of those to bring them to life and how we intend to deliver. On delivering a simpler BUK, we have invested significantly in transforming the business in the past three years. That combined with economic headwinds over the pandemic led to a cost-to-income ratio of 68% in 2021. Our investments and changes in the environment have brought that to 58% today. But we must go further. Our aim is to get that to about 50% by 2026. In the chart on the left, we have segmented our cost base into four parts to show how we think about our costs. We are focused on driving efficiencies across all four, but I have singled out the top two, because this is where we believe we lag peers. On distribution, this covers the cost of servicing our customers day-to-day. We have historically operated with a higher number of branches, creating higher associated real estate and people costs. We have acted by reducing our branch presence as customer behavior has shifted. Our focus will now shift on optimizing the way we engage with our customers and communities. We will do that through a far more efficient and flexible footprint. By the end of this year, we will have over 900 touch points available across the country, including branches, flexible community sites and shared banking hubs. Of course, the primary basis of customer interaction today is through our digital channels. In fact, 98% of customer interactions are now digital. Our touch point optimization will strengthen that further completing our digitization work and leveraging our physical footprint as a value-added complement to it. In Operations and Technology, we are in the process of automating the parts of our operation, which are not yet processed straight through and simplifying and upgrading our technology capabilities. The historic complexity and fragmentation of our technology means that the transition cost has increased this proportion of our costs. However, this is an investment in our future capabilities and further efficiencies that we must make. The evolution of our cost base over the last three years has been shaped by these investments. The left side of this slide outlines the impact of our cost actions to date. We have streamlined BUK through actions such as rationalizing our product portfolio, reducing our branch numbers and headcount and simplifying our technology estate, all of which I mentioned on the prior slide. That has brought base costs down by 7% and contributed to our cost-to-income ratio declining from 68% to 58%, notwithstanding the impact of inflation on our underlying costs. That gives us confidence in our ability to drive our cost-to-income ratio to about 50% in 2026 as our investment in efficiency will continue to offset any lingering inflation. This cost discipline not only delivers efficiency today, but it also creates capacity to invest in both future cost efficiency and future revenue. On the right-hand side of this slide, you see that our plans reflect an 80% increase in transformation investment spend over the next three years to \u00a31.2 billion from \u00a3700 million in the prior three year period. Our investment in driving cost efficiencies will continue through customer journey, automation, optimization and simplification. The mix of investment will evolve with continued focus on revenue growth as we align our products with customer needs better and capture the opportunities of the partnerships that you saw on a prior slide. Combined with the benefits of our investments to date, we expect the income benefit from investment to increase by about \u00a3600 million in 2026 from \u00a3100 million in the prior period. Combined with the expected efficiency savings, that makes our aim to deliver a cost-to-income ratio of 50%, both achievable and credible. Let's shift to how we make the UK better. That requires increased focus on an investment in improving our relationship with our customers and clients. As I mentioned at the beginning, our starting point is strong, evidenced by a deep deposit franchise rooted in trust earned across multiple generations. We know that our focus on transformation over the past years has disrupted those relationships. You see that in the dip in our overall Net Promoter Score in the chart on the top left here. For example, the scale and pace of our branch closures as well as the product and service simplification that we've undertaken has disrupted how we interact with and support customers. Meanwhile, work required to update the information that we hold on business clients has created understandable frustration on their part. We are committed to enhancing that position from here on. I showed you earlier that we've rationalized our product offering by 32% and made our range simpler. We did that in part for efficiency, but also so that we could invest in tailoring our offering to better align the service that we provide with the needs and expectations of our different customers. We have much more to do to get that alignment as precise as it needs to be. Getting that alignment right creates the opportunities for us to enhance our relationships with our customers and as we do so, we would expect to see average balances grow and an increase in the number of needs that we solve for each customer. By being better, we improve customer satisfaction, we support our deposit franchise, and we maintain the foundation of a resilient funding profile that enables us to grow the asset side of the business. And that brings me to the third priority, how we intend to make BUK more balanced. As I mentioned at the beginning, we are a scale player across our balance sheet. The last three to four years has benefited scale players on the liability side of the business as consumers and businesses retained high cash balances across the pandemic, coupled with economic uncertainty, the severely limited their appetite or need for borrowing. We believe we are at the beginning of more stability in the UK with the inflation outlook having moderated and the consequent rate stability, giving more confidence to borrowers, both individuals and businesses. We are also confident that our investments to date have placed us in a good position so that we can capture the opportunity that recovery will present. A quick reminder of where we have come from. We made deliberate choices to navigate the longstanding economic uncertainties in the UK with a low-risk profile. That was prudent, but it led to market share declines, particularly in unsecured lending and a lower margin profile in mortgages and a persistence of a low loan-to-deposit ratio in business banking. In short, we didn't take the opportunity to reallocate or recycle underutilized risk appetite from one area of BUK to another. That opportunity is now in front of us. I'd like to bring each of those to life a little more now. In unsecured lending, our plan is to grow market share. We have simplified our customer journeys and revamped our credit and affordability models to enable this. In consumer loans, we have historically focused on relationship lending, but we will shortly begin to open up our lending to all qualifying customers, whether they bank with us or not. I will shortly come back to a dedicated slide on the recently announced Tesco deal. In mortgages, our aim is to improve application margins through a number of initiatives. First, by improving our broker support, including by simplifying how we support brokers and improving the platform through which they provide us with their applications. Secondly, we will do more high loan-to-value lending as a proportion of our total book. Our current position versus peers is conservative at 6%. We have capacity to grow that proportion without materially shifting our risk position. We also have the capability to offer specialized solutions through our Kensington acquisition from last year, where the margin opportunity is typically significantly higher than that of our existing Barclays product range. And finally, we intend to increase our focus on the mortgage needs of our Premier and Blue customers who are far more likely to come to us directly. In Business Banking, we will grow our lending market share by leveraging our existing relationships on the liability side, both in terms of access to customers and our ability to automate credit decisioning given the visibility we already have on their financial positions. We will also continue to broaden our lending proposition, including in the asset finance space and accelerate digitization of client journeys to make it easier for them to access what we offer. Whilst lending is at the heart of our growth opportunity, we will conduct this in a controlled way that maintains our disciplined risk profile. I'd like to bring that to life explicitly. As I noted earlier, we made deliberate choices to derisk during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty in the UK. While that impacted market share negatively, it also led to historically low loan loss rates. You see that clearly on the left side of this slide. Today, that rate stands at 14 basis points versus 36 basis points in 2019. It's worth noting that even that 2019 level was lower than years before that. We have capacity to grow within the parameters of our historic loan loss experience and our 2026 plan delivers a risk profile that is consistent with that 2019 level. The right side of this slide shows you that same information in a graphical format for BUK at the top and then cards and loans below that. You can see the larger Blue Eagle representing 2026, lies in between the 2019 position to its right and the 2023 position to its left for the business overall. My point simply that we have room to grow as we pivot the UK to take advantage of opportunities to increase market share and margins and deliver a more balanced asset profile within BUK and ultimately, for the group. Given the recent announcement of our intention to acquire the retail banking business of Tesco and enter into a long-term exclusive partnership, you will naturally wonder how that fits within the ambitions that I've just shared. This slide outlines what that banking business is. \u00a38 billion of high-quality unsecured loans split evenly between credit cards and personal loans, funded by \u00a37 billion of non-transactional deposits that fit neatly into what I outlined earlier about being better. We are naturally excited by this opportunity. It takes us a long way towards the unsecured lending growth ambitions that I just shared. In particular, this provides the opportunity to grow both the lending and deposit products through the Barclays and Tesco brands, which we believe appeal to different segments of the market. The long-term exclusive partnership with Tesco also provides an unparalleled platform to work with the UK's leading loyalty program as well as the opportunity to market through Tesco channels and the open market. This builds on our existing UK partnerships with other leading retail, consumer electronics, and loyalty program brands. Importantly, the customer base is similar to ours, leading to broadly aligned risk profiles. So, this fits squarely within the risk appetite framework that I outlined earlier. By delivering on our plan, we position BUK for the future and deliver an attractive and sustainable RoTE profile that is high teens in 2026 on a larger balance sheet. Underpinning that is continued growth in income, where we expect a compound annual growth rate of mid-single-digits CAGR over the next three years, concentrated in net interest income. Our continued focus on efficiency will lead our cost-to-income ratio to around 50% by 2026. We expect the better utilization of risk appetite to normalize our loan loss rate towards the 2019 level in a controlled and disciplined progression. And as we grow our asset position, our RWAs will necessarily grow as a result and BUK's contribution to the Group's RWA profile is expected to grow. Given our focus on unsecured lending, you should expect the impairment build in RWA growth to be slightly more weighted towards the first year than the associated revenue build. That will cause RoTE to moderate in 2024, then recover to our target. Our ability to invest in that future revenue growth, as I said at the very beginning, is protected by the structural hedge, reflected in the 2024 net interest income guidance of \u00a36.1 billion that Anna referenced earlier, although that excludes any contribution from the Tesco portfolios when that transfers to the UK expected in the second half of this year. So, our focus on efficiencies will make us simpler, our focus on our customers and clients will make us better, and our plans for growth will make us more balanced. We have invested significantly in recent years to prepare the business to growth. We are now ready to seize the opportunity before us. Thank you for your time, and I will hand back to Venkat.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you. So, we will now spend a little time on the Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth, which are two new reporting units. I mentioned that we will also come back later in the year with a presentation on each of these by Matt and Sasha, respectively, in addition to a deepdive on the Investment Bank. So, you will have the opportunity later to hear from them. The UK Corporate Bank is the beating heart of Barclays' 330-year history. We have relationships with about 25% of the UK market. These relationships average 18 years in length and they are covered with a network of locally-based teams around the country. Under the resegmentation, the UK Corporate Bank includes a large part of the operations, which we previously reported in the corporate lending and transaction banking lines. It also includes corporate card issuing previously included in consumer cards and payments. So what this does is that it brings together our trade and working capital solutions into one business. The integrated business has reported strong returns and last year generated about \u00a31.8 billion in income. The income streams are diversified, and the key priority for us is to grow the fee income alongside capital-efficient growth in lending. So what is it that we do here? On this slide, I'll summarize the breadth of our offering to corporates. We support clients with their short and long-term financing needs, including extending finance to support the transition to net zero. We provide working capital solutions through card issuance, overdrafts, invoice discounting and traditional revolving facilities. We help clients to move their money, to pay suppliers and employees, to collect money from their customers and reconcile their transactions. We also help clients to invest liquidity through a range of solutions. We support clients in managing risk as they grow their international exposure through our award-winning trade finance and FX propositions. And what this range does is it positions us well to grow over the next few years, while giving clients access to expertise in other parts of the group. Our clients' needs are evolving quickly, and we are focused, therefore, on delivering operational needs simply and seamlessly. And to meet these, we have priority areas, which are well defined, starting with the importance of our leading payments ecosystem. And digital delivery is important because it frees up time for our clients and also makes our bankers more efficient, allowing them to spend their efforts sharing data-driven strategic insights. And this client interaction will enable us to deepen and to broaden our client relationships. And as growth opportunities emerge, clients want us to make it easier for them to access the right financing structures in quick and simple ways. I said I will talk about payments. We spoke earlier about looking for a partnership in our merchant acquiring business. So I want to say a little bit about the payment ecosystem, which is about making and receiving payments. This is an essential part of the functions we provide our corporate clients. We are one of the largest sterling clearers in the UK. We are a leading corporate card issuer with more than \u00a312 billion of payments per annum and the third largest merchant acquirer across Europe. That's the far right. We process over 300 billion payments a year a pound in payments a year, which we estimate represents one in every three card payments in the UK system. Our objective always is to bring the best capabilities and the most efficient services to our clients, and we pursue the models which deliver these outcomes. Our traditional bank payment systems have largely been built in-house over many years and are very resilient. What we are doing now is focusing on developing further digital solutions. And the landscape across card issuing in the middle and merchant acquiring on the right has been fast moving with much innovation. We've had years of experience combining strong in-house capabilities with those provided by some of the partners listed here in order to benefit from greater scale in technology and operations. In merchant acquiring now, which is on the far right, we are exploring how best via partnerships to provide further benefits of scale, global scale and new technologies and innovation to our clients. That is what that strategic exploration is about. As with the rest of the bank that you've heard, we talk about simpler, better and more balanced. We are focused on making this business simpler by enabling clients to access the solutions and services more easily. Our main digital channel, something we call iPortal already gives clients access to a wide variety of services through a single entry point, and they can self-serve about 30% of their needs, and the adoption for these solutions is around 90%. We plan now to build on this, expanding our self-service capabilities through both online and mobile access and increasing the efficiency, speed and frankly, better controls. And what this will allow us to do is to decommission legacy systems. And what we've been doing is also investing in stable and automated back-office platforms and the tools our relationship teams use, making their client interactions, as I said, more productive. All of this, we expect will improve the client experience while using efficiencies to fund investment and it allows us to retain our low cost income ratio. We aim to be better by deepening the relationships, which we have. We were the first bank to introduce industry specialist teams more than 20 years ago, and we continue to lead and to innovate. Our network of business development directors has resulted in more than 550 client wins in 2023 and a growing market share. And we are hiring additional coverage bankers in areas where we see growth opportunities and continuing to develop our propositions. Recently, we migrated our trade finance business from legacy technology to cloud-based systems. 40% of our clients use five or more products, which is up three percentage points over the last two years, and this demonstrates our ability to increase that penetration. And as we deepen our relationships and improve our offering, we think we can do more with 28% of our clients using two products or fewer today, the potential for revenue growth here is significant. And we are confident that we can increase our share of wallet from existing clients and grow through new client acquisitions. So next, I want to focus on lending, which makes us more balanced. We have a loan-to-deposit ratio here in the UK Corporate Bank in the low 30s, and we are well-placed to grow, providing a better balance for the business as we grow more fee income. And we will deploy more RWAs to support this effort, which in turn can lead to deeper and wider client relationships. Our existing book is well-diversified across sectors, and we have a track record of low impairment. And so we'll continue, of course, to use the group's significant risk transfer program, providing first loss protection and reducing both impairment risk and capital requirements. Within our credit risk appetite, there are areas where we can be more competitive on price and take larger credit positions with stronger clients. And we are confident in that way of growing lending at attractive risk-adjusted returns as we develop our digital delivery and product offering. And we also expect to generate business for other parts of the bank, leveraging our track record in the debt capital markets. So finally, on the corporate bank, I just want to highlight some key financials and summarize our ambitions. As I said, a key priority is to grow fee income alongside a capital-efficient growth in lending, our recent performance positions as well to achieve this. Over the last two years, we've grown at a 15% CAGR. This reflects, of course, the benefit of -- to NII from rising rates, but also double-digit growth in fee income and net client growth. And while loan and deposit volumes have been stable, our propositions and client relationships have enabled a 10% growth in clients in the last two years. The income growth has actually helped us with resulted in a healthy cost/income ratio and contributed to returns increasing from 14% to 20%. We have the opportunity now to grow income further while we increased our investment in simplification and automation. So we still aim to deliver a cost income ratio in the high 40s. And post COVID, we have benefited from a gradual release of modeled impairment, and we expect a more normalized impairment profile going forward. Overall, we expect returns to moderate from the 20% we reported last year, but we still target high-teens over the coming years. So to summarize, the UK Corporate Bank is already delivering strong returns. We are confident we can continue to grow at these attractive returns despite the normalization of rates and impairment Lastly, Private Banks and Wealth Management. On top of my mind, day I became CEO, who was an ambition to realize the great opportunity that the Private Bank and Wealth Management business provides for Barclays. We had a strong private bank, have a strong private bank, both in the UK and in select international markets. But the wealth management business in the U.K. and our digital investing business, what we call smart investor was unprofitable and subscale. Moreover, these two businesses sat in separate parts of the bank on either side of the ring plans. Over the last 12 months, we have put them together again with the regulatory commission. And what this does is it provides us with a very significant opportunity to serve the financial needs of UK customers in our retail business, together with serving our high and ultra-high net worth clients. In addition, it enables us to have a single investment function and shared platforms. We aim to provide advice to our customers and clients at each stage of their financial -- personal financial journeys. And we will do so with robust financial management tools, which are fairly priced, managed transparently, constructive simply and delivered efficiently. So this is the Private Bank and Wealth Management business today. As you can see on the left-hand side, the business has been structured into four distinct segments. Firstly, self-directed digital investing for those who are starting out or want to invest anything from \u00a31 upwards, a UK wealth management proposition for those that are more advanced stage in their financial journeys. And of course, a service for high and ultra-high net worth clients domestically and internationally, who have a full access to a full suite of private banking products. What you see on the right is that the business has grown its assets and liabilities on the average of 10% a year over the last five years, and it's reasonably well diversified both geographically and in terms of products. The combined business today is already producing high returns, 31% in 2023 compared to 14% RoTE in 2021. A good part of that growth has come from deposits, given the impact of higher rates, but we've also been growing our investing and lending offerings. The income has grown from \u00a31 billion to \u00a31.3 billion, and our cost-income ratio has shrunk from 86% to 69%. This is a very good and profitable business, but what it needs to do is to scale, particularly in the digital investing and the U.K. Wealth Management segments. Again, given its high contribution to the group, this is an area of investment. So again, we're going to do this by being simpler, better, and more balanced. Part of what I, being simpler, as I said, was to combine the businesses. We now have one management team, a single investment function, shared platforms, and simpler segmented customer propositions. And there are significant efficiencies from doing this. Part of being better is for us to fully leverage the synergies across the bank. And we are developing a more effective two-way referral flow for clients with other business units within the group. Barclays U.K. provides us with a significant source of new client referrals into digital investing and wealth management. And having a closer collaboration with the investment bank enhances our distinctive point of differentiation by giving private banking clients access to a wider range of investment solutions. Being more balanced is in part by growing our digital investing and U.K. wealth management offering to the scale that is aligned to the size and scale of our U.K. retail bank. This proposition has very high operating leverage and we are focused now on making specific enhancements to provide better service to our customers. Very recently we launched a new pricing structure and we will now focus on the content and digital capabilities we need to enhance the customer service and journey. In the U.K. wealth management space, we will lower the entry point to \u00a3250,000, and again focus on providing easily accessible advice, digitally enabled as much as possible, and a simplified transparent investment proposition. Both of these will be better integrated within our banking app and our website. Moving to the private bank. Across the U.K. and our international business, we have over \u00a3160 billion of client assets and liabilities. And we provide a high-touch personalized client service. Our priorities are actually fairly similar for both segments. We need to build out our teams, including our U.K. regional footprint, as well as our teams in the international markets where we already have an investment banking presence. Also we need to invest in systems and processes to enhance the client experience. In addition, we will invest in our client solutions, including alternatives and lending capabilities. Altogether, these priorities are going to require an investment into our private bank, which will lead to our RoTE being greater than 25% by 2026, which is slightly lower than last year's numbers. We aim to deliver high-quality, double-digit asset and liability growth across segments and maintain a cost-income ratio in the high 60s. To conclude, we have a great opportunity in this business, and it's one that I'm really excited about. We need to be simpler in terms of our business and the propositions, which we provide our customers and clients. We need to be better in terms of our service and technology capabilities and more balanced by scaling our UK wealth offering. Now, almost every bank talks about doing better in private banking and wealth. And so you might well ask, what makes Barclays succeed. I think there are three things. One is the scale and depth of our franchise in the UK and how few of our customers use our investment services today. There are 3 million customers in Barclays UK with investable assets who we benefit from our digital investing or our UK wealth offering. The second in my opinion is that the UK market could be better served, particularly for those customers in the intermediate stages of their financial journey. I think there's a real role for us to provide a service which is transparent, which is competitive, which is digitally available, but with access to human advice. And finally, we have proven we can grow this business. Over the last few years, five years, we've grown client assets and liabilities by 10% per annum. We have won awards internationally, the best foreign private bank in Switzerland, the number one private bank in Monaco, the number one international private bank in India. And we are confident we can achieve an RoTE of greater than 25% by 2026. And to me, private banking and wealth represents a very attractive opportunity for the bank. It's a capital-light fee income-based business and high returning. So with that, what we will do is I'll invite my colleagues to come up, and we will move to the final part of Q&A or for today's investor update with Q&A on the business presentation, which you've heard. As previously, please limit yourself to two questions and introduce yourself. And I am the MC [ph]. All right. Who would like to go first? Yeah, Alvaro.\nQ - Alvaro Serrano: Happy to go first, again. To first again Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Just a couple of questions. One is on the efficiency gains in the investment bank. I don't know if you can make it a bit more tangible for us, given any examples of where you see capital efficiencies in particular. Obviously, there's been discussion in the past about leverage finance deals that are still on the balance sheet. Is that a source of capital efficiency? And if so, maybe help us quantify it or give us a bit more sort of flavor on how easy those efficiencies are to deliver? And second, on US Cards, the 12% NIM. You've listed sort of quite a few things that drive the NIM improvement and rates wasn't one of them. And I realize this business, it is lower rates is good for it. So maybe, I've seen your rate assumption at the back, but can you quantify maybe how much rate plays into that NIM expansion in the US Cards business? Thank you.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: So, why don't I take the first one? I'll pass it to Anna to start on the second one, maybe, Denny, you can chime in afterwards. So, at a macro level within the investment bank, efficiency, capital efficiency, which is what I think you're talking about, RWA per unit income is going to come in a few ways. Within markets, as we've said, we've always -- we've maintained a high level. And I think recycling capital and focusing on liquidity and sort of revolving as a deals at 20% a quarter of what you put out and increasing that is going to be one source. In investment banking, it's coming in a couple of ways. Number one, it is from the move from DCM, which is capital heavy into ECM and M&A. The second is recycling capital as it gets released into -- into international corporate banking and the transactional services, which are going to be closely managed by the Investment Bank of managed within the Investment Bank and which represents higher recurring revenue and an allocation of RWAs into the financing side of markets. So at a macro level, that's how it happens. Obviously, with individual clients, over time, we will assess whether we are getting the right mix of business for the capital which we lay out. And -- but that's part of exactly that reallocation. Anna, then do you want to start on them?\nA - Anna Cross: Yeah. Sure. Why don't I start, and then I'll hand to Denny. So you're right, we're not calling out rates. We saw a benefit from rates in 2023 actually because of the lag effect of repricing as rates rose within the US, which obviously we don't expect to recur. Actually, our NIM expectations are much more about what we expect to happen to pricing to mix. And deposits do matter, but only to the extent that we expect a greater proportion of retail funding in the future. But Denny, you might want to expand on pricing?\nA - Denny Nealon: Really as Anna just said, there's really four things going on. So I think the whole industry will see some margin compression as rates come down. So that's built into our forecast. But I highlighted three things that are going to help us drive NIM expansion. One is we have -- we are going to be going more in the retail sector. We expect that to help us rebalance our FICO mix they'll help deliver higher margins. Second, alongside the late-fee legislation, we'll be re-pricing some of our existing accounts. And then we have a really strong award-winning deposit platform, and we're investing in that. And so we expect to get more value from that going forward. So those three things are what offset that margin compression that you can expect from rates drop.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Next question Yeah, Joe? Joe then Rohith, and Raul.\nQ - Joe Dickerson: Hi, Joe Dickerson from Jefferies. Just in terms of the competitive landscape in your two US areas, so the investment bank and then the Cards and Payments business. Could you just perhaps elaborate on how the Basel end game may be impacting the competitive landscape in the US, although, I do see that the banks in the US have done a pretty good job of pushing back on that. But your views on that would be interesting. And then in the consumer space and cards, in particular, we've seen in the past 24 hours, Capital One in Discover, effectively Capital One going to the network business. So, how you see the impact on the landscape changing in the US cards or not as may be the case as a result of that merger.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yeah. So let me start with Capital One discover, then I will just give a broad answer to the first part of your question and let a Adeel and Denny talk about that. Unless, Anna, you want to add something, too? So on Capital One Discover, look, we've got to see the details on it. Clearly, it is a transaction that is based on a cards portfolio as well as payment rails and payment capabilities. And it shows, if anything, that these things are valued in the banking system today. As I hope you've seen in the last few hours, both cards and payments are critical parts of the Barclays proposition as well, and something which we think we're good at and trying to do better. So that's my sort of first takeaway from it. And we'll, of course, have to see the details. And I will say that there is a regulatory angle of it, which, you know, my colleague Jason Goldberg, I have to plug Barclays Research, wrote overnight with Terry Ma. And we have to understand that better as well. Okay. So then coming back to the competitive landscape in the U.S. So at one very high level, capital rules generally increase over time and banks adjust to them, The big banks adjust, right? And I imagine that's what ultimately will happen. And what I do hope is whatever settles down in the U.K. -- in the U.S. capital landscape is relatively mirrored in the U.K., whereas you know the regulators also have a competitiveness mandate in addition to financial safety. So we'll have to see where it goes. And what we hope is that it's sort of fair across both sides of the pond. What you have seen us do is move to internalize what that will be, both at the overall Basel level, as Anna said, to the lower end of 5% to 10%, which includes what we said for IRB in the U.S. cards business, already included in U.K. cards, and then we've got a bit of corporates to go. So I think it will all finalize over the next two years. Hopefully, it will be relatively even but we will adjust competitively as we have done in the past. Adeel?\nA - Adeel Khan : Yes, I agree with what completely agree with what you're saying. I think as Anna referenced the impact of Basel, we expect it to be the lower end of 5% to 10%. So that that means mid to high single digits for markets. And look, I think, I go back to what I said earlier in my presentation, our ambition is to generate double-digit returns for shareholders. So if they're businesses that will be impacted because of Basel, will be ruthless about allocating and reallocating capital within our portfolio to accommodate for that.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: And on the card side, what I'd say is, as we showed actually on the slide, we expect that through the actions that we're taking that we'll be able to get our density rate to similar levels to what U.S. issuers will have. So I don't think there's going to be any competitive issue there. And at the end of the day, we've had capital differences over the years between the U.S. and U.K. over time. And it's never kept us from winning business at good returns in the past, now, or in the future. And really, because what that really is about at the end of day is not just about price, it's about can we help partners drive their business forward by helping them increase sales and customer loyalty. And we think because of the capabilities that we've built, we do that pretty well. Anna, anything to add?\nA - Anna Cross : Yes, just a couple of comments, Joe. The first would be, clearly, we're reacting to what we know here, and there's some time to go to see the final rules. So what the teams are doing is they're firmly focused on what we can control, both in Denny's world and in Adeel's world. We would expect to see some increase in capital in the U.S. from our U.S. peers. The exact level of that, we'll see. I think what's really important for us to just remember though is that less than 10% of our Greek capital is in the IHC. And so for us some of these movements in US rules are less important than what happens with our primary regulator in the -- with the PRA in the UK, which we still expect to be the binding position for Barclays.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Rohith.\nQ - Rohith Chandra-Rajan: Thank you. Rohith Chandra-Rajan, Bank of America. A couple of questions along similar lines. Sorry to be boring. The US -- sorry, the IB, thank you for the additional commentary around kind of the flows of the RWAs. I think -- so, so far, really, you talked about optimization and move from DCM into ECM and Advisory and then a negative in terms of \u2013 a small negative in terms of Basel 3 in markets. Is there anywhere else within particularly, I guess, the markets business, where outside of optimization you might be taking some capital away from businesses in order to fund the capital-light growth that you're talking about in some of the focus areas for markets? That would be the first one. And then again, on -- the second one is just on -- again, on US cards. I guess what you've shown is you have some inefficiencies relative to your local peers from a capital density perspective, which you expect to offset through mitigation, but that usually comes at some cost. And Venkat, you talked earlier about the benefits of being a diversified business, but when you've got a standalone cards business without a broader US retail offering, there are some, I guess, some headwinds from an efficiency perspective relative to peers. So what is it that makes Barclays a good cards business in the US compared to a large US bank, for example.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Right. Adeel, do you want to take the first one on \u2013 let me start on cards and Den you can fill in. Thank you, Rohith. So we really think about our business through the lens of two components. We have a bunch of top five revenue rent franchises where we are maintaining a pretty high income to RWA ratio. And then you have the non-top five franchises, which we showed you. If you look at the non-top five franchises, there are two types of businesses there. One, which we need to maintain to be stable to our clients. Within those, we have a pretty, pretty low capital footprint. And then you have the rest of our franchise, which we think we have room to improve because we've either lost market share or the operating environment is changing. If you look at that component of our franchise today, we have 38% of our RWAs allocated versus them driving 28% of our income. So it also tells you that those three focus businesses which we've talked to you about, we've already allocated the capital they need and the technology resources they need so we can drive that income over the next -- over the coming years.\nA - Adeel Khan: So then coming Rohith to the question on the US cards business. The first thing to import that I focus on is we have to have an apples-to-apples comparison. This is a specialized partnership card business. We are not looking to compare this to a broad-based US bank's cards business, which includes its own branded cards. We are not in branded cards. In fact, the important thing, whether you talk about this or whether you can talk about our markets business or investment bank, is that we focus on the things which we try -- which we think we do very well and which are attractive to our clients. This specialized cards business has a few attractive features to it. Number one is we have 20 corporate clients, B2B, B2C, 20 million customers. We are not competing with the end customer -- for the end customer with a corporate client. We are not trying to sell them a mortgage. We're not trying to do other things with them, which many other banks might. And what it does is allow us to focus on increasing the engagement with the corporate -- which the corporate customer has with the underlying client. And that is the thing that leads to the revenue uplift for the corporate client, and that's what Denny had on one of his pages, 6x, 7x. So we don't compete. Second is we are good at what we do. And that's an indication of both the blue-chip quality of our clients and the 90% renewal rate that he spoke about. So it's an apples-to-apples comparison would not have us talk against the broader US banking market. Of course, there are things we need to do better. We need to adjust for the capital rules, we need to improve and increase our sort of own funding of this and manage our costs better. And as we get scale, improve the RoTE. So we have a lot to do to improve it. But the apples-to-apples comparison is not versus a general US bank. Anything to add?\nA - Denny Nealon: You answered that really well. I'm very proud of you. No, I'd just piggyback on something I said earlier. We are a specialist issuer. Most of the largest US banks, I think you're really asking about, they don't compete every day in partnerships. They focus on their own proprietary brand. And the other thing I've pointed out earlier is the size and scale of the partnership market is very significant. So there's a big game to play for, and we believe that we have built a sustainable competitive advantage and the capabilities we bring to the table. And as Venkat said, that focus on helping drive our partners' businesses forward is different than most banks bring to the table. And so what we build is about how do we -- because we believe if they do well, we do well. And so our focus there is pretty unique, and it's worked really well.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: And if I may add one thing -- sorry, Raul, just one thing on risk management in that business is underlying credit risk management, but it's also choosing your partners well, choosing partners with whom you can actually bring that expertise to bear and managing that relationship over time, right? And in the end, if those attributes that lead to a high renewal rate and it's those attributes that lead to a test cultures in use in the UK. Sorry, Raul.\nQ - Raul Sinha: Thanks, Venkat. It's Raul here from JPMorgan. Still plenty of questions, but I'll stick to two. The first one is on what's going on in the UK in terms of consumer duty. So -- in terms of consumer duty. So there's a broad agenda that is leading to various implications for financial services players. Obviously, apart from motor finance, you're present in most products in the UK, but one of the features of the UK market is very limited cross-selling. So I guess the question for you and for Vim is where do you think are the risks for you in your current business model as configured, especially as we go into the new rules, July this year on the back book? And then secondly, where might be the opportunities for you as other players have to reconfigure their own pricing. And I think your recent stock broker changes have probably been a step in that direction.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Let me start with the second half, and then I'll turn it over to Vim. So I think consumer duty, which is a very beneficial way to look at actually what products people provide to customers and managing mis-selling risk across an appropriateness risk across the consumer product landscape is a good thing for the customer. As in all forms of regulation, it actually ends up benefiting the larger players because what we were able to do is understand it, manage it, absorb the fixed costs, and operate. Frankly, over the long-term service as a barrier to entry. I think, therefore, when I spoke earlier about Wealth and I said fairly priced, transparently constructed, efficiently delivered, it's easier for us to do these things than for smaller companies because we can, -- A, we know how to do it because we do it in other parts of our business; and B, we can sort of structure it and absorb the cost better. So, I think it's an advantage to the large players as generally forms of regulation are.\nA - Vim Maru: So, I think a couple of things to add. And I think that point about our scale and what we've done in the past is quite important because I think one of the things that struck me about Barclays and you'll see it in other banks too, I guess, is just the culture from a customer focus perspective is really strong. And treating customers fairly has been around for a while and the nature and behavior that we have here has been strong, too. Of course, Consumer Duty made us think through every line of our business and consider very carefully with the tweaks that we should make, but it's not been as heavier lift because of the culture that's already innate in our business. And so I think that's been a huge help in where we were and the steps that we have to take. And actually, I think we've made lots of great progress. I think the important thing here is a level playing field. Actually, there are some things that sit outside of the fence in terms of regulation and then making sure that the regulators then apply all of that in a similar and coherent way right across the market. I think that's the important thing to call out. And then you touched a little bit about sort of limited cross-selling. To some extent, when you look at our balance sheet, and I talked about it, conscious steps that we've taken have led to that. And actually, one of the things that we're trying to do as we lean into the changing shape of our balance sheet as we move forward is actually protecting our franchise and increasing that cross-selling capability. So, at the moment, some of our customers are going somewhere else for a credit card because of what we've chosen to do in the past. That's a real opportunity for us to really deepen the franchise and increase the number of products and services that we offer to our customers.\nQ - Raul Sinha: One more just on buyback capacity, mainly for Anna. I'm sorry to ask about the next buyback when you've not even started this one. But the capital walk for 2024 is quite difficult to nail down, just given the moving parts that you've got. You start with 13.5% pro forma and then obviously, first quarter of every year, usually there is a trading related RWA pickup. So, it tends to be not very capital-generative. And then I guess you build capital towards your 125 basis points per year sort of run rate through the year. But when we think about the moving parts around the \u00a316 billion of RWA you had on coming in the second half, plus the various acquisitions, Tesco, whether or not you sell the timing of German cards, should we still be thinking about six months as the right kind of beat of looking at capital return and buybacks? Or do we think about that as sort of end of 2024?\nA - Anna Cross: Thank you. So, I think the root of this is the capital-generative nature of the business and our ability to consistently generate capital year-on-year out, which we've demonstrated. And I would say that, clearly, there is some seasonality to the business. You've called it out, we typically deploy more capital in Q1, but typically, we generate more capital in Q1. That's what we demonstrated in most years. Around the \u00a316 billion and indeed the onboarding of Tesco, those are in our capital flight path. And you wouldn't expect me to talk to you specifically about timing today. That's a matter for the Board, and it's something that we'll consider. But we have got a fairly a fairly consistent pathway going, if you like to look at it that way. And the other thing that we've done is very clearly highlight for you today our priority, which is number one, regulation; number two, the shareholder; and three, investment. So that should tell you how we're thinking about the return of capital as we go through 2024, but actually beyond 2025 and 2026.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: We have time for one more ahead. Go ahead, Ben.\nQ - Ben Toms: Ben Toms from RBC. You talked about the improvement in application margins in the UK for mortgages. I just wonder whether you might give a sense of where we're at now and where you expect those application margins to go to? It sounds like it's largely mixed base for those margins? And then secondly, in Wealth and Private Banking, the RoTE. I appreciate the guidance is greater than 25%, which includes some scope for a bigger than that, but the step down from where you are today to that number is relatively large. Is there something in there for the fact that you're still having to invest in that business in 2026, and therefore, post 2026, you'd expect a step-up? Or is there an acceptance that it requires ongoing investment in that business every year? Thank you.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Right. Do you want to start with mortgage? Go ahead.\nA - Anna Cross: I will. So as you know, we don't -- we comment on spreads and mortgages. What I would just say is that spreads have been attractive, but pretty thin, as I said earlier. Because the market is very much dominated by refinancing activity and you see that typically in Barclays, if you look at our loan to values, they are low, just above 50% of the portfolio, and we're acquiring in the sort of mid-60s. So there is a real margin opportunity here for us to utilize the capability that we've got within Kensington. And then, you might want to add to that, but...\nA - Adeel Khan: I think -- so mix is one, for sure. I think the other is process and service, which I think I'd call out because at the moment, if you don't have great service and growth process, you end up having to compete more on price. And so I think as we invest more in our capabilities that I talked about, that should help us be able to compete better in the broker market as well as in the direct market, too.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: All right. All right. One final question, Andy, for you.\nA - Andrew Coombs: Andrew Coombs from City. I just down the UK. Firstly, a clarification on slide 114, you talk about mid single-digit NII CAGR in the targets. Is that off of the 2023 6.4? Or is that off the 2024, 6.1 plus the 0.4 from Tesco's?\nA - Anna Cross: Very simply, it's from 2023 from the 6.4%...\nA - Andrew Coombs: Perfect. And then more broadly, you outlined some of the initiatives on slide 111 that you have in order to grow the revenue base within that mid-single-digit Nii CAGR, there's kind of three moving parts. One is those initiatives that you've outlined. The second is the impact of the structural hedge. And then the third is the impact to lower rates, I guess, if I had to break it down to three parts. How much of that revenue CAGR, broadly speaking, is from your own initiatives that you are now implementing, do you think?\nA - Anna Cross: So Andy, we haven't broken that down. I think what we have done is we've given you an indication of the RWAs that we expect to deploy within this business, not directly but if you take the \u00a330 billion and imagine it splits broadly in alignment with the RWAs of the businesses that we're focused upon. Then you'll get an indication of really how much we expect to come from lending growth. And we gave you some modeling tools, if you like, around the structural hedge earlier, so the \u00a3170 million, the reinvestment and two-thirds of that goes to the UK.\nA - Andrew Coombs: Right. So sorry, go ahead.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Just going to build. I think it's pretty broad-based as well in terms of those initiatives. So it's not concentrated in one area or the other. And the structural hedge is really important, but the dynamics change between 2024 and 2026, because obviously, you still got some deposit migration happening now, then you have a different effect coming with rates. And then, of course, all of those lending actions that we've talked about there on that slide start to play through into 2026.\nA - Anna Cross: Just very conscious, we didn't answer Ben's second question, which was why do we expect a greater than 25% RoTE in the private bank? Do you want to pic that one?\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yeah, sorry. My bad. Its investment, so it is -- investment is what brings it down from the 30% plus down to 25%. I think on this one, we are looking out to 2026. We are starting from fairly early levels in both the digital investment and the wealth management business. So it would be full hardy of me to project beyond 2026. But I think it's important to say that this is an important and attractive business for us, and we're going to invest.\nA - Andrew Coombs: Great.\nEnd of Q&A:\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thanks. So those who follow Test Cricket know that launch has taken promptly at 1 PM So I want to thank you for coming. And let me just repeat and thank you for being here for the last 4.5 hours. So I hope you got the sense of why Barclays. We've got very high return in UK, retail and corporate franchises. We have a top-tier global investment bank. We've got multiple levers to allocate capital in a discipline where we're looking to drive growth within the higher returning divisions of the bank and greater RWA productivity within the investment bank. We are resetting our level on RoTE to 12%, higher than 12% in 2026 and capital return of at least \u00a310 billion in the next three years, 2024 to 2026. Those are summary statistics. There's a lot more. We are available over lunch to chat with you as well. So thank you for coming, and thanks for spending the time with us. We really appreciate it.",

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you everybody for coming here and welcome to our Full Year 2023 Results Presentation as well as our Investor Update. You could see the agenda for the day on this slide. And so what we will do, we'll just go into the results for 2023 before turning to the broader investor update. So, as you saw this morning, I'll start with the results announcement with the performance highlights and then I'll hand over to Anna to take us all through the financials. So, we are delivering against our guidance. So, we achieved -- delivered on all our targets in 2023. And together with our consistently strong capital position throughout this year, what this enabled us to do was to give shareholders a material increase in distributions. Excluding the Q4 structural cost actions, return on tangible equity was 10.6% for 2023, in line with our target of above 10%. And on the same basis, our cost-to-income ratio who was 63%, in line with our guidance for the low 60s for the full year as well. As being accretive to future returns, the structural cost actions did not limit our ability to deliver a 37% year-on-year increase in total distributions, which now amounted to \u00a33 billion. This \u00a33 billion number for 2023 included a total dividend of \u00a30.08 per share with the full year amount of the dividend of \u00a30.053 being announced today and as well as a full year buyback of \u00a31 billion, which we expect to start in the coming days, and that's on top of the \u00a3750 million at the half year. Tangible book value per share has increased by \u00a30.36 year-on-year to \u00a30.331. And our CET1 ratio was 13.8%, which is at the top end of our target range, which you will recall is 13% to 14%. Overall, we view this performance as a strong foundation on which to build towards our revised financial targets over the next three years and which we announced this morning and we'll talk about in greater detail in a few minutes. But before that, the financial report of these results. Anna, over to you."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat and good morning everyone. Turning now to Slide 5. I think I'm going to need the script. Thank you very much. On a statutory basis, RoTE was 9% for full year 2023. This included the \u00a30.9 billion of structural cost actions taken in Q4. And given the materiality of those Q4 charge over and above normal annual cost actions, I'm going to exclude it from the financial performance metrics today. On this basis, 2023 return on tangible equity was 10.6%. I would note that there was no impact from the over-issuance of securities this year, but given the material impacts to income and costs in 2022, I will also use adjusted numbers as comparators. Group profit before tax was \u00a37.5 billion, down 3% year-on-year, and income increased by \u00a30.7 billion, while costs were \u00a30.2 billion higher, excluding the Q4 cost actions. Within costs, litigation and conduct charges were small this year at \u00a337 million compared to around \u00a30.6 billion in 2022. And operating costs, which include L&C, were up by \u00a30.8 billion. Impairment charges were \u00a30.7 billion to \u00a31.9 billion, representing a loan loss ratio of 46 basis points, better than our through-the-cycle guidance of 50 to 60. As usual, I'll now cover the three drivers of our returns: income, costs and credit risk management. We saw a continuation of year-to-date income trends through the fourth quarter, resulting in total income up 3% at \u00a325.4 billion for the year. Barclays UK income was up 5%, with growth in net interest income from rate increases outlaying lower card income and the transfer of UK Wealth in Q2. Consumer cards and payments income grew strongly, up 18%, driven by higher margins and balanced growth in both US cards and the Private Bank. Corporate and Investment Bank income was down 4%, as lower volatility in markets and a record low banking wallet impacted the industry. This outweighed the tailwind from interest rates in the Corporate Bank. On the next slide, you can see net interest income across the bank and that it grew by \u00a32.1 billion or 20% year-on-year, driving a 44 basis point increase in group NIM to 3.98%. The biggest contributors to NII growth were CC&P and CIB, together adding \u00a31.3 billion with around one quarter of the total NII growth coming from BUK. Going forward, whilst we will still report net interest margin, we will guide to group NII excluding the Investment Bank and head office. This is expected to be around \u00a30.3 billion lower in 2024 at around \u00a310.7 billion. BUK is expected to be a point -- approximately \u00a36.1 billion of this, excluding the impact of Tesco, which I'll touch on shortly. The benefits from the structural hedge are expected to be offset by continued product market pressures, particularly in the UK. Turning now to the structural hedge in more detail. The structural hedge is designed to reduce volatility in NII and manage interest rate risk. As rates have risen, this has dampened the growth in our NII, but in a falling rate environment we will see the benefit from the protection that it gives us. It generated \u00a33.6 billion in gross hedge income in 2023, up from \u00a32.2 billion in the prior year. It also provides a high degree of confidence in the net interest income growth assumed in our forward plan. To reiterate this, \u00a33.8 billion of gross hedge income is already locked in for 2024 from the hedge investment we did through 2023, and this will continue to build. Given trends in retail deposits, we do expect the notional balance to reduce in 2024 at a broadly similar rate to Q4 2023 before stabilizing in 2025. We have approximately \u00a3170 billion of hedges maturing over the next three years, and we expect to roll around three quarters of them over the period and with reinvestment rates remaining well above the average maturing yields of around 1.5% for the next three years. So, we do expect the reinvestment to outweigh notional hedge declines. Turning now to costs on Slide 9. As guided quarterly costs through the year remained below the Q1 high point. This excluded the Q4 bank levy of \u00a3180 million, which was flat year-on-year and the cost-income ratio for the year was 63% and excluding the Q4 structural cost actions. Group costs of \u00a316 billion were up \u00a30.2 billion year-on-year. Operating costs increased to support business growth and enhance resilience and control. For example, partner focused spend to drive balanced growth in US cards and Kensington mortgages in the UK as well as technology investments to support markets within the CIB. The impact of inflation was more than offset by efficiency savings. Looking at the \u00a3927 million of Q4 structural cost actions in more detail now on the next slide. These were across three main categories; people, property, and infrastructure. Around half was in our head office and relates to our merchant acquiring and German consumer financing businesses as well as a Canary Wharf office lease exit. A large proportion of this head office charge is goodwill and intangible write-downs and which will have no impact on capital and the other charges are spread across the businesses. We expect the overall payback to be just under two years with around half of the cost savings landing in 2024. You'll hear later how these cost actions are a key pillar in our plans to improve efficiency and drive a more productive cost base going forward. Moving on to credit on Slide 11. The impairment allowance was broadly stable at \u00a36.3 billion and we maintained our balance sheet coverage at 1.4%. The total impairment charge for 2023 of \u00a31.9 billion was up around \u00a30.7 billion year-on-year, and the full year loan loss rate of 46 basis points was below our through-the-cycle guidance. As we expected, this included a higher Q4 loan loss rate of 50 points, driven by an increase in US cards. US cards was also the largest component of the full year charge of \u00a31.5 billion in CC&P. The full year Barclays UK charge was around \u00a3300 million with a loan loss rate of 14 basis points. We continue to see conservative consumer behaviors across all our UK portfolios, and we do expect the loan loss rate in BUK to increase over the next three years as we grow unsecured lending. I'll go into more detail on the US cards impairment on the next slide. Our US cards portfolio credit trends are in line with the broader industry. The US consumer bank loan loss rate is elevated in comparison to recent periods as we build our impairment reserves because of an increase in delinquencies. Write-offs are low, but we do expect them to increase during 2024, which is why we're building the reserve now. As a result, our US cards coverage ratio stands at 10.2% on an IFRS 9 basis, and when calculated on a US accounting basis, the CECL coverage ratio of 8.2% is in line with our US cards peers. The portfolio remains high quality with 88 of the book above 660 FICO. We do expect the impairment charge to remain elevated through the first half of 2024 and then to reduce in the second half. Overall, I'd expect the charge for 2024 to be below the 2023 level, and we're guiding to a 400 basis points loan loss rate through the cycle. A brief word on Q4 performance on the next slide before I take you through the businesses. Profit before tax excluding Q4 structural cost actions was \u00a31 billion, down \u00a30.3 billion. Income was down \u00a30.2 billion year-on-year at \u00a35.6 billion, the second best Q4 in the last five years after 2022. This was driven by a reduction in non-NII, partially offset by an increase in NII, whilst operating costs were broadly stable. Impairment was around \u00a350 million higher at \u00a30.6 billion with the higher Q4 charge in CC&P from US cards, partially offset by a lower Barclays UK charge. Moving now to the business performance starting with Barclays UK on slide 14. RoTE was 19.7% in Q4 and has been consistently around 20% every quarter this year. Total income was \u00a31.8 billion with net interest income stable at \u00a31.6 billion and a \u00a30.2 billion reduction in non-NII year-on-year. This reflected the transfer of UK Wealth business in Q2 and a number of one-offs. We would expect non-NII to revert to a run rate greater than \u00a3250 million per quarter going forward. The NII generated a NIM in BUK of 307 basis points for Q4 and 313 for the full year. We said at Q3 that our 305 basis points to 310 basis points guidance. We're sensitive to the level and mix of deposits, and the deposit trends that we saw in Q3 slowed materially in Q4. Deposits were down \u00a32.1 billion compared to the reduction of \u00a36.6 billion in Q3 as the pace of deposit outflows and migration to higher savings rate slowed. The other NIM drivers played out broadly as we expected, and you can see these on the chart on the right-hand side. The structural hedge continued to be a tailwind to NIM, although a more modest 7 basis points in Q4 due to lower swap rates and a reduced hedge roll in the quarter. Bank rate effects turned negative in half two, reflecting pass-through in pricing and mortgage churn continue to ease. We also saw a positive contribution from treasury in the other category, as we flagged earlier in the year. Looking forward to 2024, we are guiding to NII for Barclays UK of circa \u00a36.1 billion compared to \u00a36.4 billion in 2023. We will have a building tailwind from the hedge roll. However, in the short term, consistent with our industry expectations, we do expect this to be more than offset by some further reduction in deposits but at a slower rate than in 2022 and a net reduction in mortgage. This excludes the impact of the Tesco Bank acquisition, which I'll summarize on the next slide. The acquisition accelerates our intention to grow unsecured lending in Barclays UK, which we will discuss in more detail later. The transaction involves the acquisition of \u00a38.3 million unsecured lending balances, roughly half credit card receivables and half unsecured loans, and approximately \u00a36.7 billion of customer deposits. This will result in \u00a38 billion of RWAs in completion, which is expected to be in half two. Given the uncertainty around this timing, our 2024 guidance does not include the impact of the acquisition, although it is reflected in our 2026 plans that we're announcing later today. Once completed, we estimate initially generating NII of around \u00a3400 million annualized and growing from that level. And as we complete the integration, costs will be somewhat elevated, but they should be broadly neutral to the cost -- group cost-income ratio. And as usual, following a portfolio acquisition, we also anticipate elevated impairment initially under IFRS 9 but again expect that to normalize. As a result, we forecast a slightly reduced BUK RoTE in 2024, but once integrated, the business will have an attractive RoTE profile accretive to the group RoTE over time. Turning now to Consumer Cards and Payments. Continued growth in US cards receivables and Private Bank client balances drove a \u00a30.1 billion increase in CC&P total income year-on-year. US cards balances grew to just over $32 billion, up to $2 billion in Q4, reflecting seasonally higher year-end spend. Client assets and liabilities in the Private Bank grew by \u00a34 billion in the quarter to around \u00a3183 billion with most of the growth being in invested assets. This is a positive trend for the future, but the initial growth is in assets under supervision, which does attract lower fees. CC&P RoTE was 2.6%, reflecting the impairment build in US cards I've just talked about. And this will be the last time we report the CC&P segment as we start to disclose our US Consumer Bank and our Private Bank and Wealth Management businesses separately. Moving on to the CIB. CIB income of \u00a32.4 billion was impacted by lower year-on-year global markets income. The Q4 market environment had lower volatility in markets and subdued industry activity for banking. Investment Banking performed relatively well in this context, up 13% in US dollars and up 36% on Q3 with DCM outperforming the market and offsetting continued lower activity in ECM and M&A. We maintained our banking market share in 2023 whilst we repositioned the business in a record low year for the industry wallet. Markets income was down 14% in US dollars, against a record Q4 comparator for us, whilst our business mix also affected us. Corporate lending income was materially down on Q3 at \u00a340 million, primarily due to leverage loan finance marks of \u00a385 million. Underlying corporate lending income was stable. Transaction Banking deposits were also stable whilst income fell slightly versus Q3. Whilst deposit migration continues, this was at a lower pace than earlier in the year. And as a result, we are now again rolling a portion of the structural hedge related to corporate deposits. Looking at markets in detail on the next slide. There were several factors driving our performance in markets this quarter. Similar to Q3, both our business mix and the record comparator contributed to FICC income being down 22% year-on-year in dollars. Lower volatility in UK gilts compared to Q4 2022 and an industry-wide slowdown in rates and credit impacted Barclays more than our peers. And conversely, the market rebounded in securitized products where we currently lack scale. Equities performed broadly in line with peers up 3% in US dollars year-on-year. Looking at the longer-term trends in markets over the last four years, our share in income has been consistently higher than the previous three. And our income now includes a greater proportion of financing which, as we've said before, provides greater stability to our overall markets income. Turning now to the capital funding and liquidity metrics on the next slide. We continue to maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. Looking at capital in more detail on slide 21. We finished the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%. The announced \u00a31 billion share buyback will take us to 13.5%, in the middle of our target range. We generated 18 basis points of capital from earnings in Q4 and just under 150 basis points over the full year, both of which exclude a circa 20 basis points impact of the Q4 structural cost actions. Excluding the reduction due to FX, the \u00a36 billion increase in RWAs reduced capital in Q4 by 23 basis points. We'll say more about our RWA flight path over the next three years later, but I want to address two main headwinds here. The first is a move of our US Cards portfolio to an Internal Ratings-Based or IRB model. We continue to make significant progress towards at least 85% of credit risk RWAs being IRB, which is the level required by the PRA for IRB bank. This move results in an expected increase in RWAs of around \u00a36 million from half2 2024. We don't expect any further material impacts from model migrations from current portfolios beyond US cards. The second headwind is Basel 3.1, which we have quantified publicly for some time. The PRA's recent policy paper was constructive, and we've also worked through some refinements and mitigations. Furthermore, our previous Basel 3.1 guidance included an element for US cards RWAs, which has been superseded by the IRB migration. The aggregate impact of these factors means a materially lower impact from Basel 3 on implementation. And given this lower estimate, the total effect of the two headwinds is broadly aligned to the previously guided day one impact of Basel 3.1 towards the lower end of the 5% to 10% of group RWAs. Furthermore, as more risks are captured in Pillar 1, we would expect some offsets in our Pillar 2 requirements. On this slide, we're illustrating the drivers of the RWA increase from implementing IRB for US cards. When applied to US cards, our IRB models generate greater risk weight density versus standardized models. And the key driver is that the models include 2009 financial crisis, stress loss assumptions despite current and expected experience being materially less adverse. Under the US Basel 3 end game treatment, we expect our peers in the US to also experience a capital increase, although noting that these rules are yet to be finalized. There will be further details on planned migration in the US consumer bank presentation later on. So to summarize, we delivered on our financial targets in 2023. This, along with our strong capital position, enabled us to deliver a material increase in distributions to shareholders. It also represents a strong foundation on, which to improve over the next few years. I'm now going to take the Q&A. Given the time constraints we have, please, can I ask you to limit yourself to a maximum of two questions per person, and please stick to the full year results topics. There'll be plenty of time to discuss the investor update later on. And if you could please introduce yourself, as usual, not least I'm blinded by lights, so I can't actually see you very well. So thank you."

But I wonder in the guidance you've given for 2024, what kind of environment are you factoring given it's proven to be pretty volatile? And maybe the general environment for CIB, how you're seeing it and what you factored it in that, how sensitive that 10.5% in the environment. And related to the Tesco slide, I mean, it does look pretty profitable. But maybe when you've discussed Tesco and what the discussion was with head of the Board, how did you compare that acquisition versus potential topping up your share buyback that you would have been able to announce otherwise? Thank you."

But what you will see later on is that the assumptions that we're making about both the markets and the banking wallet are very reasonable actually. We're not expecting an increase in the market's wallet in particular in 2024. So we believe they're reasonable assumptions. And actually, that leaves the actions to grow revenues largely in our hands, and Venkat and Adeel will talk about those later. In terms of Tesco, we will be talking later about our desire to grow lending in the UK and unsecured lending in particular. Now many of you have commented on the fact that we've lost market share in unsecured over the last few years. And actually, what Tesco does is it allows us to accelerate and secure the plans that we would otherwise have pursued organically. And we believe that we can make those investments and fulfill the distribution plans, not only the ones that we've announced today, but the targets that we are giving ourselves over the next three years. So we'll balance shareholder returns with investments but in our high returning businesses. Okay. Next question, please. If I could go to Joe, please. Thank you.

So that was a favorable nine basis points quarter-on-quarter. Do you expect that to smooth out over 2024, this kind of volatility from the other aspect? And I suppose related to that, what are the market indicators we might be able to look at to see how that line is moving? Because it's been pretty material now for -- off and on for some quarters."

So to the extent that we're seeing cards or, indeed, our SME lending moving around, you're going to see it flow through there but also treasury. So our NIM, remember, is an all-in NIM, some of our peers have a banking NIM, which excludes those treasury impacts. Really, what's going on in the fourth quarter is a reversal of what we talked about a year ago. And as such I don\u2019t expect that that impact to reverse as we go into 2024. So it's really a reversal of the previous impacts in most material form. Thank you. Okay. Can I go to this corner, please?"

I think you said in your remarks earlier that you're going to see a net reduction in mortgage balances in the UK, excluding the Tesco acquisition. It just seems a little bit odd given some of the improving dynamics within that market from a volume perspective, in terms of the data. So I just wanted to check assumptions there. Also, some peers have talked better new lending spreads in 2024 versus 2023? And then on US cards, it's quite a step up in capital requirements from that model change. Just interested to hear if that changes your views at all in terms of the appropriate pace of growth for that business, or was this something that was always going to happen at some point in time? It's just particular timing? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Angela Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Guy. So the mortgage market through 2023 and actually as we enter 2024 has been somewhat dominated by refinancing activity. So it's pretty skinny margins, still attractive but skinny. And it tends to lead to a negative net in the market, which is what we've seen. So we're calling out nothing more than that, really, that the trends through the tail end of 2023 have been towards negative net. And similarly, that matches up with, I would say, the broader macro trend around deposits, where with QT and a sort of more constricted money supply, we'd expect deposits to fall. So it's really that, that we're calling out in BUK, a contraction in the market in those two larger products, which we would expect to reduce our net interest income expectations before ultimately we see the balance sheet start to grow, and we'd expect that in the second half of 2024. Your second question, so I'm not going to comment too much on the strategy of the cards business because we're going to come to that. But we obviously always knew that we were going to have to go through an IRB conversion for US cards. We typically update the market when the quantum becomes clear and when the timing becomes clear. And that's become clear to us in Q1 of this year. Why are we updating you now? As I said previously, we included an estimate for it contained within our Basel number. Actually, the way things have turned out, it's a bit bigger, it's a year earlier, but conversely is offset by some of the updates that we have on Basel. But later on, Denny will take you through some of the ways in which we expect to specifically counter at this. Okay. Thank you."

Can you just talk a little bit about the deposit dynamics you saw in Q4 and where they were better than you previously expected? And then into 2024, I think you talked about deposits, expectations for the deposit balance to continue to fall. Maybe just about how you would extrapolate Q4 into 2024? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Ben. Yes, we ended the year with a Q4 NIM of 307, bringing the full year to 313. You might recall at Q3, we said we expected to be between 305 and 310, but that was largely dependent on deposit dynamics. And actually, it might be good to go to Slide 15, if we can because it might be helpful for this question. We said it'd be largely dependent on deposit dynamics, and if we saw a replication of Q3, we'd be at the top end of that range. And by my math, that's around 296. We ended up at 307 and the biggest driver is really that movement that you can see on the slide, where the deposit pressure in Q3 was 16 basis points and the deposit pressure in Q4 was 7. And that's really because we saw a stabilization of deposits across Q4. And I think that comes sort of in two ways. Firstly, customer behavior, customer migration really slowed down. And secondly, we saw a stabilization in pricing as the rate environment settled. So as a result, it was a markedly different deposit -- deposit environment. Now clearly, we take that forward into 2024, noting those macro trends. And I would say, also noting that Q1 and Q2 tend to be fairly active as a deposit matter just because of seasonal effects, so paydown of tax, et cetera, but also because of the season. But in the second half of 2024, I would expect this deposit activity to slow down and perhaps a little. And of course, we've got that ongoing impact of the structural hedge. So as we go into 2024, I think it's fair to say perhaps there's a bit more NIM stabilization than we might have expected. But we expect downward pressure on the balance sheet coming from both deposits and mortgages. And we'd expect to start growing the balance sheet again really towards the back end of the year, particularly, for example, through organic card growth in the second half of 2024. And of course, none of that includes Tesco, and we'll update you when we know the completion date. Okay. Where next? Rohith?"

So I was wondering, if you could give us a little bit more color about if there are particular product areas that have been more challenging relative to the peer group. And then secondly, just on -- back on capital. You seem very confident that it's just US cards where we've got model updates. Why do you not expect them anywhere else, because that's already been completed? Or you think the risk weightings on the other models are in the right place?"

Adeel is going to talk later on about a couple of specific product areas, where we want to do -- where we have a bit more focus on going. So I'll let him pick that up then. But there's nothing -- there's nothing stand out. There's nothing particular that I would call out for Q4. On the capital point, as I said before, it's a requirement for IRB banks to get to 85%. The eagle-eyed amongst you, if you look in the Pillar 3, I forgot which table, but it might be 28, you'll be able to see that actually post-US cards, we get to around 67%. The step between here and full compliance is largely around the wholesale models. And actually under standardized, the wholesale models do a pretty good job of having the right weights against counterparties to reflect what would otherwise be an advanced treatment. So on wholesale, which is our only remaining big movement to make, we are not anticipating a significant movement in RWAs. And of course, outside of cards, you'd expect a movement from standardized to advance to actually reduce the RWAs. It just doesn't in particular with cards. And our UK cards book is already IRB-compliant. So this brings the US cards book up in alignment with that. Okay, Andy. I think, Andy, you might be our last question in the interest of time."

I know there is the transfer of [indiscernible] there. Are there any other one-offs you'd like to call out in the non-NII in the UK? And my second question, a similar vein. The corporate revenues in CIB, again slightly lower in the quarter, anything you'd like to call out there in terms of leveraged finance, marks or hedges or anything else in that line item? Thank you."

So on the non-NII in UK, as you pointed out, it has changed structure because we moved UK Wealth into Private Banking and Wealth, and we did that in Q2 of 2023. The other thing just to call out is, previously, we've seen relatively lumpy debt sales go through that line in the past. Don't expect that going forward. We've got a forward flow arrangements. So it drips through the P&L in a much more gradual way. In terms of the one-offs across Q3 being positive and Q4 being negative, they're all too small really. There's nothing I would specifically call out, which is why we're trying to be helpful here and give you some guidance to help you model it going forward and saying that we expect it to be above 250. And on the corporate lending line, clearly, that does include the costs of our SRT and it does include the cost of the portfolio hedges. But really, the only significant point in the current quarter is \u00a385 million of leveraged loan marks that we took in the quarter. I wouldn't call anything else out specifically. I'd say that underlying corporate lending income is broadly stable from where it's been over the last few quarters. Okay.

        "text": "Thank you, Anna. Right. So now we come to the strategy update part. It's been 10 years since our last Investor Day. A lot has changed in the world since then. A lot has changed at Barclays. So today, what we do is we present our vision for the future. It's a vision of a better run, more strongly performing, higher returning bank. It's a vision of a Barclays, which encompasses a potent collection of businesses and capabilities. Each is strong by itself. And together, they are mutually beneficial and reinforcing. It's a Barclays, which is appropriate to a changing and multipolar world, one which values a UK based bank. Equally, it is a Barclays, which seeks to deepen and broaden its role in the UK even as it engages with the world from London. As I say, we are very bullish on the UK as a place in which to do business and from which to do business. Importantly, it is a vision for Barclays that is committed to generating strong financial returns and distributing them to shareholders. In my two years as CEO, I have worked very closely with my colleagues and the Executive Committee, outside of it and with the Board, examining the path on which we have been, the direction we need to take forward. And what you will see in here today are the results of that work. We are creating a simpler, a better, a more balanced bank, words, which I will come back to later. It's dedicated to higher returns for its investors, and how we do that is equally important. It's a vision anchored in ambition -- measured ambitions, I call it, and it's driven by disciplined delivery. And as I said, it's harnessed to our home here in the UK. So we've embraced this plan of measured ambition, measured confidence. We start actually with very strong foundations. Over 20 million UK retail customers, and that is before Tesco, and we bank a one-fourth of UK corporates. In the US, our credit card business has a further 20 million customers. In our Investment Bank, we've built leading global markets and banking businesses, which are at scale today. I repeat, at scale today, delivering for our clients at a time when many competitors have pulled back and, in fact, some still continue to do so. For a long time, fixed income has been the calling card of Barclays. We are number three in credit and joined first fixed income financing. Our investment bank has led landmark transactions. And importantly to me, we were the top UK investment bank in 2023. This is a title to which I feel we all always must aspire. I said that we did an investor update 10 years ago, and Barclays has changed since that time, in fact, changed substantially for the better. We've strengthened the back financially, improved its capitalization and are now leaner. We reduced our headcount by about one-third over this period and our footprint more than 50 countries then to 38 today. We've exited non-priority businesses in Africa, in Asia, in European retail banking as well as commodities, and there are two more in advanced stages of discussion. We've reduced our RWAs by about 20% in this period, strengthened our CET1 ratio by 4.5 percentage points to 13.8% at year end, as we just spoke about. And at the same time, unfortunately, we have incurred about \u00a316 billion on litigation and conduct issues and costs. To me, this is a very, very disappointing number. And it is a stark and serious reminder as to why it is so important to run a bank well. And at the heart of running a bank well is what I call running it in a consistently excellent way. It is the surest way we have to preserve our reputation, protect our bank and all our shareholders. Over the same period, we have reset our financial performance, particularly in the last three years, delivering return on tangible equity above 10% since 2021 and distributing \u00a37.7 billion to shareholders in that period, which is 35% higher than the prior seven years put together. And while this has been an improvement, it is not enough. And indeed, our shareholder experience needs to be better. We have listened, we have heard and we will do even better. So how will we do even better? At one level, I want Barclays to be renowned for excellent operational performance. To me, operational performance and financial success are two sides of the same coin. Operationally, we have worked to what I call this new standard of consistent excellence for over 1.5 years, looking to reduce complexity, harnessing technology, promoting strong risk and controls and aiming to deliver a better customer experience. We need to continue to do this. Financially, we need to drive towards higher returns from our businesses while improving our efficiency. As I will talk about, we will invest RWAs in our higher return in consumer and corporate businesses while maintaining the RWAs and the investment bank broadly stable at their current absolute level. As you will hear, the Investment Bank RWAs will shrink in real terms as they will have to self absorb the impact of Basel 3.1. Crucially, we are targeting higher, more predictable shareholder distributions. And lastly, we will have clearer financial reporting, which will allow you and us to mark our progress more easily. So what will this plan deliver? First of all, improvement in RoTE from 9% statutorily in 2023 to 12% and above -- to greater than 12% in 2026. Second, we plan to distribute at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026, and this is about 50% of our current market capitalization. Third, we are putting a cap on the RWAs in our Investment Bank, reducing its share of RWAs from 63% in our current CIB construct to around 50% by 2026. And to me, these are the three important parameters and numbers that we're focused on. How will we do this? Over the next three years, we aim to make the bank simpler, run it better and make it more balanced. What does simpler mean? It means, first of all, a simpler business structure and then one that is organized and operated in a simpler way. I'll spend some time on this slide. From today, we will run Barclays through a business structure that, as I said, delivers greater accountability and transparency in reporting to investors. And there are three messages I'd like to bring out on this slide. One, why is this a simpler structure; two, why do we have each of these five businesses; and three, why do they fit together, okay? The structure is simpler because even though we go from three units to five, this reflects the way in which we serve our customers and clients and it increases the transparency on our performance. We will no longer report either consumer cards and payments or the corporate and investment bank in their current construct. Instead first, we bring private banking and wealth management at Barclays into one unit and we report this separately from the US Consumer Bank, which contains our specialty credit card partnership business in the US. From the old CIB, we have created the UK Corporate Bank, which serves midsized corporates in the UK. And this will be managed and reported separately from the Investment Bank, which now comprises global markets and investment banking. The investment banking part also includes our international corporate bank, which serves multinational corporate and institutional clients under one roof. As part of our effort to become a simpler business, we've also considered the strengths and weak opportunities within our portfolio. As a result of that, if you look at what is in gray, we are in advanced discussions on the sale of our German consumer business and our Italian mortgage book, and this will complete our exit from European retail outside of the UK. We are also evaluating options for our UK merchant acquiring business, which I will talk more about later. So the first point was the five businesses. The second point is how do we think about each of these businesses? We are at scale in Barclays UK, we are at scale in the Investment Bank, and we are a scale in the UK Corporate Bank. Our focus is on improving each one of them. Some parts will need to grow and they will. In the Private Bank and Wealth Management space, we are very profitable, as we show you, but we need to scale further. And in the US consumer bank, we are on a journey to scale while mentioning our specialist -- maintaining our specialist focus, which must be more profitable. And that includes better management of capital and the lower cost to income ratio, and we'll talk about that. Finally, why does this collection of businesses fit together? The way we think about it is either they have a UK focus and/or they bring synergies to the bank. For instance, if you take the US consumer bank, it has client synergies with the investment bank but also with our US cards capability as our Tesco mortgage -- Tesco Bank transaction shows. And given that we have in that transaction entered into a partnership program, which is, in fact, the focus of our specialty business in the US. Further, the US consumer business diversifies investment bank in the US stress test CCAR. Lastly, we've announced management changes this morning for our five businesses. They reflect both the promotion of the next generation of leaders for our important businesses as well as a rotation within Barclays to broaden the experience of some of our existing business heads. So Barclays UK will be run by Vim Maru, who ran the equivalent business at Lloyd's, and we look to him to apply his experience with Barclays UK. The UK Corporate Bank will be run by Matt Hammerstein, my colleague who has run Barclays UK for over half a decade and is now ready to step into this new challenge. His deep experience in the UK makes him an opportunate and fit person to run this division. Private Banking and Wealth will be managed by my colleague, Sasha Wiggins, who has served as both my Chief of Staff and managed our public policy effort most recently. She has her career anchored in our Private Bank before she ran our business in Ireland, and she brings the knowledge and the profile and the connectivity within the bank to achieve this ambition successfully. And our Investment Bank will be run by Adeel Khan as Global Head of Markets and Cathal Deasy and Taylor Wright, who remain Co-Heads of Investment Banking. Stephen Dainton, who co-ran Markets with Adeel, is appointed President of Barclays Bank plc and Head of the Investment Bank management. My colleague, Paul Compton, who's been with us on the Executive Committee for eight years, will step back from his current role as Global Head of the CIB and become Chairman of Investment Banking, speaking and working with our most critical clients. The US Consumer Bank continues to be run by Denny Nealon. These business leaders or all members of the Barclays Executive Committee, and they will report to me. So, that was the structure. Equally important in running the bank in a simpler way is how we operate them. We removed 5,000 roles in 2023. We are also repositioning about 30% of the people from our common platform, Barclays Execution Services, which we call BX. That's about 20,000 people. And we are driving that -- moving them into the businesses driving closer ownership, greater accountability, and speed of execution. We are focused on technology, which is a big driver of simplicity. 75% of our workload so far has been moved to the cloud with a plan to get this to 85% to 90%. We expect to decommission a further 450 to 500 legacy systems on top of the 400 that we have decommissioned to-date with a much greater focus in the future on buy versus build. So, I said, first, a simpler bank and then a better bank. What does better mean? Having the simpler business means we can focus on delivering better performance for our customers and clients and as well as improving -- delivering an improved financial performance for you, our shareholders. And we managed to do it in these ways. First, to better returns. As you have heard, we aim to deliver greater than 12% RoTE by 2026. To do that, we will continue to generate consistent high returns Barclays UK, the UK Corporate Bank, and Private Banking and Wealth, while investing more in these higher-returning businesses. At the same time, we aim to improve the investment banks RoTE from 7% in 2023 to be in line with the group target of above 12% by 2026. And in the US Consumer Bank, we are also targeting an RoTE of for 2026, in line with the group. So, up from the 4% in 2023, and building back towards the levels of RoTE, which we have delivered previously. So, we are generating higher group returns by a combination of delivering higher returns from businesses which need to improve and allocating more core capital to businesses that have consistently generated higher returns, and we expect them to continue to do so. The second part of running better is to continue to invest selectively. We have spent \u00a3300 million on cost efficiency and revenue growth and protection in 2023, and this number is increasing to \u00a3500 million by 2026. And while we continue to invest selectively in the investment bank, the proportion that goes to consumer-facing businesses will grow to 70% and the absolute amount will double. We are getting capital resources, as I said, and investment resources. Better income is not just higher income, but better quality income. And we aim to grow our total income to around \u00a330 billion by 2026. Today, we already have a balanced mix of NII and non-NII, which is relatively resilient through rate cycles. But if you look at the bottom of this chart, you see two parts: retail and corporate and financing. We consider these two to be more stable income streams and they have grown by about 35% since 2021. And the proportion from these more stable income streams will be about 70% of the bank's total income by 2026. This slide reflects the anticipated effect of the announced acquisition of Tesco Bank and the planned disposal of our German cards business. Lastly, and very importantly to me, happy and satisfied customers are the sine qua non for any enterprise. And we need to improve our customer experience and outcomes. I mean, to illustrate this in the UK our Net Promoters Score ranked 8th among 12 leading banks. This is not good enough. We aim to improve the customer experience by investing in it deeply, and making it not just a point of focus, but a point of ambition and a point of pride. Our investments across all businesses are aimed at operational excellence and client satisfaction. As I said at the start, they are the same thing, and it's the same side of one other side of the coin of financial performance. So we spoke about simpler. We spoke about better and we spoke now I'm going to talk about balanced bank. And what does it mean? It means a more balanced allocation of RWAs with more capital deployed to our highest returning opportunities and it also means a more balanced geographical footprint, more concentrated in the UK and in the US. We will continue to add discipline on how we allocate capital both across the bank and within the businesses of the bank. Of the \u00a350 billion which we now expect an RWA increase between now and 2026, we intend to allocate about \u00a330 billion to our three UK businesses: Barclays UK, the UK Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth Management. Now this includes the about \u00a38 billion in RWAs in the Tesco Bank acquisition, which we announced 10 days ago. Of the \u00a320 billion in RWA increases are allocated to the U.S. consumer bank, about \u00a316 billion is driven by the changes in regulation that Anna spoke about earlier. Investment Bank RWAs as I have said will be relatively stable and, in fact, shrink in real terms because they are absorbing -- we are absorbing in the investment bank, the impact of Basel 3.1. Over the medium-term, this will rebalance RWAs between our consumer and wholesale businesses and will support more consistent and higher returns. As I have said, the investment bank is both very competitive and at scale. Our prior CIB construct accounted for about 63% of the group's RWAs. The newly segmented investment bank accounts for about 58%. And as a result of the rebalancing of the group that we've announced today, it will reduce to about 50% by 2026. Further, as I'll talk about later, we will recycle capital dynamically to the highest returning areas within the investment bank, and I'll talk about that in the next presentation. And we do that so that it can grow income without needing more capital, improving productivity and returns for the group. Taken together, all of this delivers a more balanced bank. Now, coming to geography, I said earlier that, we feel very confident in being a bank that operates in the UK and from the UK, and it is time to grow in our UK market. We have been UK-centered bank for 330 years. We are still transatlantic with an important presence in New York. But the UK is a great place to run a scaled banking franchise. The economy has remained resilient. The legal and regulatory environment is extremely strong and trusted. And for our international businesses, people want a UK counterparty. Taken together, operating out of London, we aim to be the UK-centered leader in global finance. So in summary, we aim for stronger returns, greater shareholder distributions and operational excellence. They all go together. We will do so by having a simpler structure, better operation and financial performance and a more balanced business. So I repeat the words I said earlier. On the one hand, simpler, better, more balanced that's the type of bank. On the other, we get there with our approach of being disciplined, consistently excellent in our operations and risk managed in a way that will deliver enhanced returns for our shareholders. So what I will do now is turn it over to Anna to talk through what all of this means in financial terms for our shareholders in more detail. Anna?"

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat. As you've heard, our new three year framework sets out more ambitious financial targets, it's going already, and meaningfully higher our shareholder distributions. I'm now going to take you through what underpins these plans. We start from a strong foundation, having delivered RoTE above 10% for three years now, excluding the structural cost actions taken in the last quarter. Our objective is to deliver RoTE above 12% in 2026 as we grow and generate further efficiencies. Along the way in 2024, we aim to deliver returns of greater than 10% whilst we reposition the organization and navigate the changing macroeconomic environment. Our plans to 2026 include the announced acquisition of Tesco Bank and the planned disposals of the German consumer business and Italian mortgage book, where we are in advanced discussions. I do anticipate that these planned disposals will reduce RoTE in 2024. So on an underlying basis, I expect we'll deliver around 10.5%, broadly flat to 2023. But this inorganic activity focuses our businesses for RoTE improvement beyond 2024. So in executing these plans, we are focused more on what we can control. And over the coming slides, I'll talk you through the drivers of RoTE across income, costs, impairment and why we're comfortable with the assumptions that we have made. But before I do though, I would like to cover the impacts from the cash flow hedge reserve on this slide. With a year-end value of negative \u00a33.7 billion, it is currently a drag to tangible book value per share. As we expect its value to increase going forward, we're confident that our tangible book value will increase from the year-end position of 331p per share. And whilst mechanistically, it creates a drag on routing. It's worth remembering that its movement -- that movements in the cash flow hedge reserve don't impact our ability to distribute capital. So, turning first to income. So what underpins our nearly \u00a35 billion of income growth? First, a tailwind from our structural hedge; second, some reasonable assumptions in the investment banking wallet; and third, the deployment of RWAs into areas where we have a credible opportunity to grow. So the plan includes the capital effect of \u00a330 billion of RWAs deployed into high-returning UK business, and we will focus that on areas where we are, frankly, underrepresented. For example, we've been traditionally been underweight in high-value mortgages. Our acquisition of Kensington provides us with the capability to expand in specialty mortgages and drive higher margins. In our UK corporate bank, our ratio of loans to deposits is very low and much lower than our peers. In UK cards, we have lost ground and aim to recover it. And clearly, the acquisition of the Tesco business accelerates and secures our plans in this respect. As a reminder, we hedged the return from rate-insensitive deposit balances and our equity, and in doing so, we smooth our income profile through rate cycles, reducing interest rate risk. Given that we are at the point in the cycle where rates may have peaked and are now expected to fall, it acts as support and stabilizer. We have around \u00a3170 billion of hedges maturing over the next three years at an average yield of 1.5%, significantly lower than current swap rates. The expected NII tailwind is significant and predictable. \u00a38.6 billion of aggregate income is already locked in over the next three years. And in addition to that, reinvesting around 3/4 of the \u00a3170 billion at current swap rates would compound over the next three years to increase structural hedge income in 2026 by \u00a32 billion versus 2023. Turning now to the assumptions that underpin our investment bank. Venkat and the Adeel are going to take you through how we plan to improve our RWA productivity and reallocate capital within the investment bank overall to generate higher income and returns. But it's very important to us that our growth in the investment bank is driven more by the execution of our own initiatives than by the market wallet. So we are not assuming that the market wallet returns to the highs of 2020 and '21. In fact, our plans assume that the market's wallet is broadly flat to 2023, and the investment banking wallet reverts to the 10-year average from last year's decade lows. Going forward, we do expect higher income from the investment bank. Of course, managing costs is at the heart of what we control, and I'm now going to explain how both the efficiency programs and the changing shape of our investment spend deliver a more efficient and profitable bank. I gave a breakdown of our structural cost actions earlier. And to date, we've used efficiency savings to offset inflation. Now we expect these to more than offset inflation, bringing us capacity for business growth. The first \u00a31 billion of savings lands in 2024, including payback from around half of the Q4 structural cost actions and a further \u00a31 billion of cost efficiencies is expected through to 2026. And it's really important to stress that the efforts will not end there but continue to benefit our businesses beyond that point. We would expect in our business growth cost to flex in line with income. So overall, we're targeting a cost-to-income ratio in the high 50s by 2026, improving from 63% in 2023. Given the income target of \u00a330 billion by 2026, we'd expect costs to be higher in absolute terms versus 2024 at around \u00a317 billion. So spend on regulatory change has been very intense in the run-up to Basel 3.1, and we anticipate that this will peak in 2024 and then fall to a more normal level as material projects complete. This will give us the capacity to invest more in income growth, efficiencies and returns without increasing our total investment spend. And on the next slide, you'll see how these actions will improve efficiencies in each of our businesses. We expect to drive better cost income ratios across all of our divisions and not all of them, however, will be top quartile compared to peers by 2026. Whilst the leading cost efficiency is a goal for all of our businesses over time, for some of them, we don't believe it's a credible ambition within this plan period. Barclays UK and the investment bank fall into that category and together represents some 70% of the cost savings we're expecting. And whilst the 2026 targets will take us more in line with the top quartile of peers, they don't represent the scale of our ambition, and we're committed to driving further efficiency savings beyond that point. In BUK, our ongoing transformation program has been successful in streamlining and digitizing, but there is more to do. And you'll hear more on how the identified savings will offset inflation and facilitate growth. In the investment bank, we spent about \u00a33 billion since 2021 to sustain and grow future income, and around two-thirds of that is in market technology whilst the focus in banking has been more on people. And we will now monetize the investments. So in the future, we aim to self-fund further investments, and total costs are expected to rise only modestly from 2023 levels. Turning now to our risk positioning. I explained earlier that we plan to increase RWAs in Barclays UK, UK Corporate and Private Banking and Wealth by an aggregate \u00a330 billion. This is a substantial shift in capital allocation and will reflect significant growth in lending across all three businesses in the planned period. When considering the associated risk, it is essential to understand where we start from in balance sheet terms. We've grown lending between 2019 and 2023 by \u00a329 billion but that's through mortgages at low LTVs and lending to corporates over which we have significant loss protection through risk transfer trades. Our unsecured lending has fallen despite US cards growth. So, at this point in the cycle and as inflation continues to fall, we see an opportunity to reestablish our position in lending in the UK and unsecured in particular. And because of where we start, we're comfortable that we can do that within our existing risk appetite whilst maintaining our 50 to 60 basis point loan loss rate through the cycle target. In Barclays UK, as we grow, we expect the normalization and loan loss rates towards 35 basis points, consistent with the 2019 level. In the US Corporate Bank, we expect the loan loss ratio of about 400 basis points through the cycle as we grow a more diversified portfolio and optimize our credit mix, still prime but not exclusively super prime like our LI files. And finally, as we grow our UK corporate bank lending book, we'll maintain our diversified portfolio, including our long-standing prudent approach to commercial real estate. And we'll continue to use significant risk transfer protection where appropriate, and I expect a loan loss rate of about 35 basis points. Over recent years, we benefited from our diversified business model through a range of macro environments. And this diversification has provided us with relative stability to RoTE during the 2020 to 2023 period that we've just experienced. For example, in 2022 at the onset of the pandemic, our global markets business supported our performance when elevated impairment charges impact to the rest of the group. In 2023, we've seen a weaker investment bank income and decreased volatility and lower deal activity. But in this environment, our consumer and corporate businesses have provided ballast to group returns. We believe there's a natural offset built into our diversified business model by income and by geography and further supported by the stabilizing effect of the structural hedge. And reflecting this, we are confident that we can deliver consistent returns in a range of scenarios, providing a floor to our ambition. And on this slide, we've provided you with our macroeconomic and market assumptions, which we view as realistic. The next few slides describe how our drive towards higher and more predictable returns come together for our shareholders. We have a clear hierarchy for capital allocation. In order of priority, first, how much capital do we need to run the bank, taking into account regulatory changes including Basel 3.1. Our 13% to 14% CET1 ratio range remains unchanged with sufficient flexibility and appetite to operate within the range and absorb headwinds. By doing so, we'll deliver for our investors, our customers, our clients and our colleagues regardless of the environment. Our next priority, having maintained our target regulatory capital is to our shareholders, and going forward we expect to generate a greater amount of free capital for shareholder distributions. And third, we will balance this thoughtfully as we invest selectively in our higher-returning divisions, resulting in a more profitable RWA mix over time and a better bank for our stakeholders. We set a high bar for investment returns relative to the importance we place on shareholder distributions. In 2023, our 9% statutory RoTE delivered more than 125 basis points of CET1 capital accretion. By 2026, with higher returns, we expect this to grow above 200 basis points. We expect meaningful capital generation over the next three years. Taking into account capital demands from regulatory change and investment in higher-returning businesses, we expect to have meaningful free capital supporting our distribution plan on the following slide. We have distributed a total of 7.7 to shareholders over the past three years compared to \u00a35.7 billion over the preceding 7, and we expect this to increase further through to 2026. We've made one step change. And as you've heard today, we plan to make another and return at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. And this is in addition to today's announced full year final distribution. Including those distributions, the total would be at least \u00a311.8 billion by 2026 and represents approximately 55% of our current market cap. From this year onwards, we plan to keep the total dividend broadly stable and grow dividend per share progressively through lower share count. Over the past three years, we've reduced our total number of shares in issue by around 13% and do expect further reduction from the higher planned share buybacks from here. So to summarize, there are three key points of reset in today's targets. First, we're targeting a RoTE of above 12% in 2026, up from 9% statutory in 2024. Second, we expect this improved profitability to support our plans to distribute at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. And finally, the proportion of the RWAs in our investment bank to the rest of the bank will reduce to around 50% by 2026. We have also set ourselves some supporting targets, which allow us and you to track our progress. We expect to grow our income to around \u00a330 billion by 2026 with more stable income streams growing by around 15% and maintaining a high-quality mix. We aim to improve our cost-income ratio to the high 50s as we balance future investments with further efficiency savings and capitalize on the cost actions we've taken already. And we maintain a 50 basis points to 60 basis points loan loss rate guidance as we grow our loan book within the existing risk appetite, all the while maintaining a solid foundation and operating across our 13% to 14% CET1 ratio range. Now I'll hand back to Venkat."

        "text": "Thanks, Anna. So to summarize this first part of the presentation, what is the investment case for Barclays? As I said, we have very strong foundations. We have a high returning UK retail and corporate franchise, which complements our top-tier global investment bank with scale in our home market in the UK and in the US. We manage our capital in a disciplined way, growing our higher returning divisions, while improving RWA productivity within the investment bank. And over the medium-term, we will rebalance our capital allocation between and across our consumer and wholesale businesses, and we do this in order to support more consistent and higher returns to our shareholders. So from a strong foundation of double-digit returns over the life of the plan, we plan to deliver over 12% RoTE by 2026. And I think this reflects both ambition and realism. We are well-capitalized, have deep liquidity, sound risk management. And when you combine that with consistent and improved profitability, we believe it enables a higher return of capital to you, our shareholders. And we plan to return at least \u00a310 billion, as Anna said, to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. This is our vision for a better run, more strongly performing and higher-returning Barclays. So I will now open for question and answers, for which we have about half an hour assigned. Please limit yourself to two questions per room that we can get around as many of you as possible. As always, please introduce yourself, and there will be more time for Q&A after the business presentations."

        "text": "Thank you. Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Again, just a couple of questions on, I guess, capital allocation and distribution. The disposals you've earmarked, Germany, sort of, the mortgage -- Italian mortgage business and the payments merchant acquiring, is this about, sort of, simplifying the business, sort of redeploying capital to sort of your core regions that you identified? And/or how much do you need this to further \u00a310 billion distribution? I guess where I'm coming from is, there's quite a bit of headwinds, as Anna pointed out probably earlier than expected on credit card. Do you need these disposals for the \u00a310 billion distribution to happen? How much are they dependent? And should we think about the \u00a310 billion to be a progressive number? Or is it back-end loaded? Or can you maybe talk about that? Thank you."

        "speaker": "A - C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Yes. So let me answer the first part about the actions and then Anna can cover the capital piece. We're doing this to simplify our business, right? We -- in fact, one of these things was identified many years ago is something we wanted to do in Italian mortgages. And German cards, we are not the best holder for that asset. It's a non-core to us. So that's the reason to do it. Obviously, if you gain some benefits from it, you can deploy it elsewhere. But the primary purpose is the simplification of our business and concentrating on our core capabilities."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A - Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Alvaro. Let me pick up the capital detail there. So, if I just take the businesses in turn, As Venkat said, the overall objective is simplification. Our German cards business is not large in scale. You'll see from our disclosures, it's about \u20ac4.5 billion. And as we noted earlier, we would expect that to be -- the disposal to be slightly accretive to capital but not an enormous number given the scale of the business. Our Italian mortgage business, we are relatively well-progressed. We might expect some negative impact on RoTE from the sales I called out previously, but we expect that to be capital-neutral. So, it's actually neutral to our distribution plans. And in relation to the payments business, we're not required -- or our distribution plans do not require any action on that business at all. As we said, we've got it under a strategic review as we consider in future options for it. But we don't require a sale of that business to fulfill the \u00a310 billion. As it relates to specific timing, the way I would think about it is we'd expect 2024 to be broadly similar to 2023 and we'd expect distributions to increase over time at the point when Basel 3.1 is behind us and when the high returns for the businesses start to come through. So, I would say a gradual increase over time. Okay, I was going to say Jason has his hand up for longer. So, let's go to Jason."

The impact of disposals in the round, all of the potential things that you're trying to get done on this year's RoTE, I appreciate Italy probably is a loss-making endeavor but there may be gains elsewhere. So, what have you got in the RoTE guide for this year for that? And then secondly, the targets for 2024 quite clearly suggests no negative operating leverage from all the moving around that's going to take place in the balance sheet and so on. And while I appreciate a lot of the guidance you've given for 2026, as you look at consensus for 2024, it's at least 10% lower in profit terms than you're suggesting you'll achieve today.

        "text": "Yes. Okay. So, I referred to it in my scripted remarks. We'd expect the impact of inorganic to be around 40 or 50 basis points this year. So, that's why we've distinguished between our statutory target of greater than 10 and indeed the number that I called out on an underlying basis, which is around 10.5. And as a RoTE matter, the biggest moving part in there is actually Italian mortgages. But as I said, no not expected to have a significant impact on capital. So, hopefully, that's relatively clear for 2024. In just of 2024, I would say as I look at consensus, obviously, our plans are above their -- my expectation of cost is broadly an element with consensus, so I think around 16.5%, I would be happy with that number. There is clearly a difference in terms of income expectation. I'd also call out, it looks like there's a difference in terms of impairment expectation as well. Remember, before I talked about US cards perhaps being a little bit heavier in the first half of the year and then falling later. So, I think they're probably the biggest difference is, Jason."

        "text": "Thank you. It's Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. If I can have two as well, please. The first one is just one of the key highlights of your plan is the growth ambition both in the UK and outside the UK. And I guess if we look at the evolution over the last few years, the change here seems to be the ambition to grow the UK and in particular, I guess, a change in the UK unsecured and cards strategy. I think, Anna, you described it has not a change in risk appetite. And I was wondering if you could elaborate that. Because from the outside, it might appear that you are changing your risk appetite to take more risk in the UK. So that's the first question. The second question is, there are plenty of people out here who are more -- who reward cost-cutting plans and might be less optimistic on the revenue environment. So, just on that point, the 1.7 billion of business growth-related costs, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of how permanent those costs might be, and if you ended up in a macro environment, which is slightly different from what is in your plan, how much of that 1.7 billion can be flexed quite easily? Thank you."

So within our broad risk appetite, which is the way we generally look at not just what our expected losses, our credit losses are, but also internal stress tests and so on. This fits well in. In a sense, it's a reversal of a risk position, which the former Chief Risk Officer took a few years ago, where post-Brexit and in COVID, we were extremely cautious on the UK consumer, rightly or wrongly. And equally, there was a structure which we had in our credit card business that favored longer bigger balance transfers. What we're talking about now is something that does not emphasize that. It is a generally higher quality, but broader expansion of unsecured lending. And this is both in loans and in cards. The Tesco portfolio by our judgment has a very similar credit profile to our own. And so it is within the broader risk limits. Obviously, you're taking on more risk by doing it than if you didn't, which is the point of your question. But we think on a risk return basis, it's going to be accretive, which is why -- of course, why we do it."

        "text": "Thank you, Venkat. I think also, Raul, it's really important to remember where we start. So in BUK, I think over the last 10 quarters or so, we've had a very, very low loan loss rate. We've consistently -- under consensus consistently under 30 basis points. So we're starting from an extremely low base rate. And actually, we've already started acquiring. We stepped back into the market in '22. It just takes a while for that lending to season through, which is what we're observing now. On your second question around costs, our fundamental objective here is the RoTE, it's 12%. And therefore, as far as Venkat and I are concerned, the primary target is the cost-income ratio target. The \u00a317 billion is the number that falls out, okay? And that \u00a31.7 billion is the business growth that we would expect to flex. Now most of that is run the bank cost, there'll be an element of performance costs in there. And of course, we will seek to flex that if the income is either up or down relative to that \u00a317 billion, and that's why we're calling that number out specifically. As to your point around the macro though, I'll take you back to the point where we feel like we've made realistic assumptions. We've got a well-diversified bank. So we're confident in our ability to grow. We've set out today for you the expectation of that, which is 30 and 17. Obviously, over time, we'll flex both of those numbers, but the RoTE is the heart."

So that's how we think about it. As it relates to motor finance, we exited the business in 2019. Up to that point, we had a relatively low single-digit market share. There's clearly the FCA review ongoing. There are a number of potential outcomes from that. And so at this point, we have not sought to make a provision both because of that range of outcomes, but also because we haven't received a material number of complaints.

If you believe the press is part of Project Minerva, originally, there were some bigger strategic decisions considered the US cards, the equities business, et cetera, et cetera. Obviously, what you've decided today is more kind of shifting things around the edges and reallocation of capital as opposed to any larger exits or divestments. So if you could just elaborate on thoughts there, if there was anything you consider anything you ruled out, that would be helpful. Second question, number-specific question on Slide 48, our favorite hedge roll. I missed this initially, but in the footnote, you say you only plan to roll three quarters of the hedge, which would suggest quite a sizable decline in the notional. So why is that? What's the rationale there? And if you could also just provide us with the split of where the income is recognized now on the new segmentation basis. So two-thirds will be in UK, but how does the other one-third split between IBAN and corporate UK?"

        "speaker": "A - C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "So, what I said at the start, Andy, was that in two years as CEO, working with my colleagues, working with the Board, we've obviously taken a broad and deep look at the bank and the direction which we want to take. And your question was specifically about the investment bank. And it has been very clear to me from the very start that the investment bank, a, has been at scale, approaching scale, that the businesses which we have work fairly well together and are linked and are mutually reinforcing. We'll talk a little about efficiencies which we can do within the investment bank, between banking and markets and even within markets. So I'll come back later to that question about where are we getting our the efficiencies from when we come to the investment bank section. But it's equally important to recognize where we start from in the investment bank. There are many businesses in which we are not. And we are at scale for what we do. We are not in commodities. We are not in Asian equities. We are not in local emerging markets other than in India and a bit in Brazil and Mexico, actually Mexico. So there are things we are not in and we don't plan to get into them. And if you even look at the last three or four years, the areas we have built are three and talk about it, areas of focus. Financing is one of them where we've been steadily accreting market share. Equities has been one of them through prime, but not just prime; and securitized products because in the fixed income is the calling card of Barclays, as I said, and you can't be in fixed income without being strong in securitized products. And we've always been good in origination and financing and what we are doing is building trading. So it is very conscious of the ecosystem in markets -- and in banking, as we will talk about, it's been debt capital markets heavy moving to equity and ECM. But it fits together. We don't feel the need at the scale which we have and the footprint that we have to take any of the sort of more drastic actions that others have taken. So let's come back to US cards. I believe it's a business of great synergy, as said, and it stands on its own two feet. It had a low RoTE print this year, but we're going to talk to you about how we manage the capital change as well as how we -- not just in some capital management but also cost management. So we'll come back to that."

So that's why we're saying we -- our assumption is that we'll roll about three-quarters of it, and that's what builds up the math that I referred to. As to where that actually lands, still two-thirds within BUK. The rest of it will be spread across UK corporate. There will be some in the investment bank both because of the international corporate bank, but also remember, the equity structural hedges allocated through RWAs and then obviously the private banking and wealth. So perhaps we'll come back to you and others, Andy, with a bit more of a detailed split of how we expect to land in the future."

I'm just interested in that plan, how much incremental revenues you might have generated from the IB. Obviously, not looking for a number, but just in broad senses.

If your revenue aspirations end up being more capital intensive than you currently planned for, how would you deal with that? Would you not go for those revenues and maintain your RWA expectations? Or would you try and cut costs further to compensate? Or would -- I guess the other option is to change your distribution. So when you're thinking about those options, what would be the ordering there? So that was the first one. And then the second one was just, you've given us some very helpful information on how you're re-segmenting the businesses. Curious to understand a bit more about how that changes the way that you actually run the business. So this essentially is a breaking out of subdivisions within existing businesses. So what synergies or improvements does that drive across the business? Is it just focus or is it something else?"

        "text": "Okay. So I think when you look at the way we -- Anna described the capital and the use of capital, she said there were three things. The first thing was to be a well-capitalized bank, and that is the 13% to 14%. The second thing was the shareholder returns, the \u00a310 billion. And the third thing was after that, investments. If you look at the investments we're making and have been making and we lay out in this plan, they are in businesses that are today returning in the high-teens or 20% and above. well above what most people would consider our cost of capital. So that's basically the answer to your question, Rohith, that if we have that waterfall, we have the discipline that anything we are going to do is going to be above what is our accepted cost of capital. And so, I don't foresee ourselves breaking from that waterfall, right? We're going to be guided by it. That's the first part. On re-segmentation, and Anna, you should stick into both. But on re-segmentation, first of all, as I said, it's guided by how we run our businesses and our clients. There are tremendous synergies, including synergies, which you might not easily anticipate. I spoke about the synergies between US cards and the UK cards business. Tesco is a 20 million credit card portfolio, 20 million is a lot of people to bring on to your systems. When we did GAAP, we did 10 million, right? So we clearly have an experience of a scale that, frankly, no other UK bank can match. You'll also see synergies between private banking and wealth and our corporate bank, private banking and wealth and our investment bank in terms of both products and clients and, of course, private banking and wealth and our UK banking network. We'll talk about that and the corporate bank synergies to everybody else. So there are strong synergies, which we intend to exploit and continue to exploit as we go through this.

But we will still continue to generate the synergies that Venkat is talking about. We will still leverage common technologies and common services across our BX entity.

And to be able to, in essence, spread it across many businesses is really important, right?

We'll begin first with the Investment Bank and then we'll go to U.S. Cards and Barclays U.K. And then I will come back to spend two minutes on -- not two minutes, a few minutes, on the U.K. Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth. Later this year, you're going to hear from the heads of those businesses in more detail. And then within the Investment Bank, Adeel Khan is going to talk about the Markets business. I will cover banking at a higher level. And later this year, you'll hear from Kahil and Taylor in detail on banking. So let's begin with the Investment Bank. For over two decades, investors have been asking questions about the size and the importance of Investment Bank at Barclays. And you heard a little even today. Should we have it? Will it be competitive? Is it good for the U.K. to have an investment bank and more? Let me be very clear. I am proud of what we've achieved. We have built a leading business, a globally competitive investment bank. As I've said, it's performed very well. It is at scale. It is a critical part of Barclays, and will continue to be an important part of Barclays. I'm equally clear that there is a lot more to do. Our investment bank has to be higher-returning, and relatively speaking, it has to become a smaller part of Barclays. As I've also said in answer to some of the questions, our Investment Bank is a focused business. We powerfully cover large sections of the global capital markets with deep client relationships. And what we want to do is strengthen this position in our key areas of coverage. We aim to deepen our client relationships and to monetize the investments we have already made. And even as our investment bank grows in absolute income, we aim to hold our capital broadly flat to today's levels. And so importantly, therefore, we expect a higher RoTE from our investment bank. And we're going to be more efficient in our use of capital, as I've discussed earlier. But the simple way to think about it, is that we are looking for the Investment Bank to grow and to contribute more while consuming less, to contribute more while consuming less and we're going to show you how. So what is the Investment Bank? We've changed that structure, as I mentioned earlier. And so going forward, its two businesses: Global Markets and Investment Banking. Together in 2023, they contributed \u00a311 billion of top line revenue to the bank. The UK Corporate Bank was part of what we called the CIB, and that is now reported separately and I'll talk about it later. There is also an important business, the international corporate bank, which serves our largest corporate clients in the UK and elsewhere. It already works closely with our investment banking business but now will be managed, operated and reported as one unit. This combination of businesses will allow us to deepen our relationships with clients, both large cap and multinational corporates, which require access to the full spectrum of investment banking capabilities. And so that is beyond DCM, ECM and advisory into corporate lending and transaction banking. The Global Markets business, which comprises fixed income and equities, remains the same. Important, of course, is how markets and banking cooperate and work together to deliver the entire suite of investment bank capabilities to our clients, and I'll come back to that. So today, the investment bank has strong foundations. As I said, with the scale and breadth to succeed amongst our largest global peers, and we are focused on our core strengths, which is very important. It's diversified and has a stable top line, which I will take you through, and we have focused top tier businesses and have demonstrated strong risk and capital discipline. The secret sauce in our investment bank is in our synergies. I'll repeat it. The secret sauce in our investment bank is in our synergies. We are big enough to offer multiple sophisticated products to our clients, but both nimble and culturally driven to work closely across banking and markets to customize delivery and to create tailored solutions. And this nimbleness and cultural drive are really important. In fact, we are renowned for the sophistication of our service, especially our fixed income and risk solutions for our clients. About 55% of our revenues come from the Americas, which is the largest financial market in the world, and which is why I believe we are the only known US domiciled investment bank that can consistently compete with the US banks and win. This audience more than anybody else should appreciate the importance of a strong research franchise. And so I think you know us well here. We have many top research teams and we are maintaining momentum as a top five research house globally. We lead with data-driven content and help clients identify and adapt to changing thematic trends of the future, and these capabilities underpin our client relationships. And it's an important ingredient in helping us grow our rankings both with our top 100 markets clients and with banking clients and you'll hear Adeel about that in a minute. So let's go to financial performance. Looking at our financial performance over the last three years, what you will see is that our income has been relatively stable at around \u00a311 billion, and I'll talk a little about that. But RoTE has reduced from 14% three years ago to 7% in 2023. Both RWAs and costs have risen as we've invested deliberately in the business. But what we want to show you now is how we will improve our RWA productivity, capture cost efficiencies and generate income growth by monetizing the investments, which we have already made. We aim for the RoTE of the investment bank to be in line with the group's greater than 12% target by 2026 through three key levers: income, RWA productivity and cost -- income, RWA productivity and cost. So let me start with income. One reason why people have always questioned the value of the investment bank within Barclays is they think that it's a volatile business. And up to a point, it is. There are parts of this business income that fluctuate with the markets and fluctuate with the economic environment. What we have been doing though is to construct a business that has greater stability through two things: one is diversification and the other is what we call ballast, businesses with stable income. So if you look at the top-line, it has been in the \u00a311 billion to \u00a311.5 billion range since 2020 through changing, and some would argue, volatile market environment which include COVID, which include recent geopolitical instability. So let me take those two things first. First, you take diversification. We get diversification between the volatility-related elements of banking fees and market trading revenues or what we call intermediation, the top two lines. And in volatile markets, trading revenues go up, deal volumes tend to shrink. And in common times, the opposite happens. So this means a combination of the two more stable than for banks which have only one deal making or only have trading, right? That's the diversification between the relatively volatile elements. Then you come to the ballast, which is what you see circled at the bottom. And the first part of that is our financing income, the money which we make from lending to institutional clients against stocks, what people call prime, and against bonds, which we call fixed income financing. It's a business in which we have invested heavily over the last number of years. It's technologically complex and it's very sophisticated. You have to manage the risks well. And our income has grown from around \u00a31.8 billion in 2019 to \u00a32.9 billion in 2023. Adeel will talk about this in a moment. The second source of ballast is our international corporate bank. That income has grown also. It's helped, of course, by the rising interest rate environment. But in turn, it makes for a more stable top-line. So I said first is income. And you continue with income, and what you've got, as I said, is a scale business overall, but two businesses at slightly different stages of evolution and success. In Global Markets, we've made significant investments in technology and capital and we've had a corresponding growth in revenues. What we want to do now is monetize the investments which we have made and continue and deepen our capital discipline. The bottom-line here is that the markets business is at scale, it's well invested in, and it's a counterparty of choice for the most sophisticated investors in the world. The investment banking business is at an earlier stage of maturity. It has just gone through a repositioning under new leadership. We have to strengthen in DCM and in the UK and with financial sponsors -- we have strength in DCM and in the UK and with financial sponsors, but we need them to broaden and we need to deepen. We're happy to focus here on RWA productivity, trying to move the business from being debt-heavy, which tends to be RWA-heavy to be more balanced across advisory and ECM, and fully integrate with our international corporate bank. Anna spoke to you earlier about the income growth in the investment bank and how much of it is under control, is in our control. And on this slide, what I want to convey to you is that over half of our income growth is coming from initiatives, which we control. This means, of course, doing things better, because our team and client relationships can improve and deepen. And it is not arising from heroic assumptions about wallet growth or market share. We expect high single-digit income CAGR through 2026, but over half of that comes from management initiatives in markets and banking, which Adeel and I will cover in more detail shortly. The remainder comes from a normalization of the industry wallet. But as you heard from Anna earlier, it's not the industry wallet going from lows to highs, but it's going from its currently low levels to more historically normal levels. So the first lever was income. The second is RWA productivity. So moving to that second lever, what does RWA productivity mean? And why is it important? As you can see from the top left, as we've increased RWAs in the markets business, we've actually kept the ratio of income to RWAs relatively constant. This reflects capital discipline, which we need to continue by recycling capital continuously to higher returning opportunities. And it also benefits from the higher velocity of capital, which we allocate to markets. On the other hand, the right hand side shows banking income over RWA, and this has declined over this period, which reflects the reliance on DCM in our current mix. As I mentioned, we have a plan to improve this, and I'll cover this among the key initiatives in a moment. Overall, we intend to increase RWA productivity by reallocating capital towards the higher returning international corporate bank, and that's within investment banking, and as well as towards financing opportunities in markets. So income, RWA productivity, costs. And so the third important lever is costs. We have invested in a very planned and focused way in the investment bank, both in markets and banking, to the tune of about \u00a33 billion in cash investment in the last three years. In markets, it's mostly been about technology. Investing in the modernization of our infrastructure not only simplifies our operations and reduces costs, it also drives improved stability on our platforms, which leads to better client outcomes. Remember what I said at the start. Technology excellence and client outcomes are the same thing. In investment banking, of course, it's much more of a human capital business. And what we've invested is in people with a focus of the infusion of talent in our focus sectors and products. Now, what we intend to do is to monetize these investments and grow future income with relatively modest cost growth expected across the investment bank. So this includes higher performance costs, given the higher income, which we have in our plan. We will, of course, continue to make focused investments in our client franchise, but we expect these to be self-funded by efficiency savings. Overall, we expect to deliver an improved cost income ratio from around the 69% we have now to the high 50s by 2026. So, let me now take you through these two pieces, and Adeel Khan is going to begin -- I'll begin with investment banking and then Adeel will go to market. So in investment banking, I said that our markets and banking businesses are at different stages of evolution. What our markets business did three to five years ago has been paying off, and we look to do the same in investment banking. So we start with some points of advantage. As I said, we are consistently number six globally. We finished this year over 2023 as the top UK investment bank, which is a position I always inspire to hold. We look more like a US bank than a European one. If you look at 66% of our revenues coming from the Americas and which is a much more profitable market than Europe. I've also said debt and DCM is the calling card of Barclays, where we are number five globally. We've also ranked number five with financial sponsors and have established ECM and advisory practices, but we need to grow them, and I'll describe that shortly. We intend to leverage our strength in DCM in several ways. We drive greater product penetration with clients, making existing capital allocated to our loan book work harder for us. First, we aim to broaden the product relationship with existing clients, principally by a treasury-oriented products and services. Second, we will continue to provide sophisticated rates, FX and equity risk management solutions to our clients through ongoing collaboration with global markets. And these synergies are important. This kind of business is typically originated with investment banking clients, but designed and executed in our markets business. Adding incremental products requires minimal additional capital and provides attractive recurring revenues, as I'll cover on the next slide. Our international corporate banking business is already well established in the UK, where if you look at it, 92% of our UK investment banking clients, have corporate banking dealings with us. That number is far lower outside the UK, and we aim to increase that by fully integrating our treasury platform into the investment bank. The ICB generates high-quality income and about 80% of it is recurring, therefore, making it more stable and more predictable, and it is capital efficient, helping RWA productivity, which is an important area of focus for us, as I said. We also need to rebalance our investment banking mix. We recognize clearly that we are overweight in DCM, and we are going to grow the proportion of our relative share in ECM and M&A, and we aim to do this in two ways. First, we have invested on the top right to upgrade talent in technology health care and energy transition. Over 60% of the hires for which we made in 2023 were in these sectors. And together, they represent -- these sectors represent about 40% of the industry wallet in the last three years, and we are confident that they will continue to be important. We also have an opportunity to leverage our strong position with financial sponsored relationships, where we rank on par with our US peers and to do more, ECM and M&A with the same sponsor clients as our US peers do. So to summarize on investment banking, we've got the products. We've got the client relationships. We've got the capability. What we've got to do now is to translate it into returns. And the bottom line in the Investment Bank is we expect to generate about \u00a3700 million of income growth by 2026 from management initiatives. We will do this by building our key share to the levels we had a few years ago in the ways in which I outlined, and by improving our income productivity to drive further returns. I will turn over now to Adeel to talk about global markets, and then I'll come back to conclude."

        "speaker": "Adeel Khan",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat. Good morning, everyone. My name is Adeel Khan. I run the markets business at Barclays, and I've been here for the last 15 years, a stat I'm incredibly proud of. So before I start, I think it's important to set the stage. Over the last few years, we've all lived in an increasingly challenging environment. This has been experienced by a lot of few. As Venkat mentioned, we've gone through a pandemic, a war in Middle East and Europe and also a unpredictable inflationary environment. So our clients have also experienced this and the increasingly need a more reliable partner. So with all of this in mind, our ambition for the business is fairly simple. Number one, we want to be a consistent partner for our clients. And secondly, we want to drive stable double-digit returns for our shareholders. So how do we do this and what are our drivers for success. Firstly, we won deep, broad client relationships within our business. Secondly, we want prudent risk and capital discipline within our businesses. And lastly, we want to transform our technology to drive better outcomes. So now I will run you through our plans for the next few years. But before that, let's start with the numbers. So on the top left, you can see in 2019, we produced \u00a35.3 billion of revenues. Now we knew at \u00a35.3 billion, we cannot produce stable double-digit returns or be consistent to our clients. So we embarked on a new strategy. And over the last four years, we have increased our average revenues by \u00a32.2 billion. And today, we run a \u00a37.5 billion revenue franchise. Now we care deeply about the capital we use to produce these numbers. And last year, our income to RWA ratio was 6.2%. Now that is a little light compared to where we like to operate, and we have generally operated higher. Plus in periods of volatility, like 2020, we were at 8%, which means we serve as a natural hedge for group income. Now over this period, we've also grown our institutional client market share by 200 basis points. In fact, since 2019, we have been the second fastest-growing client franchise among the major banks. Now if you look on the right, you can see that we have diversified ourselves across geographies, capabilities and businesses. Our regional footprint has a strong lean towards Americas. As Venkat mentioned, we are the only non-US bank with scale access to the largest capital markets pool in the world. Our businesses are equally weighted among equities, spread and macro. And while individually, these revenue streams can be volatile depending on the operating environment, together, we think they are stable. And lastly, we have grown financing. It is one-third of our revenues today. This is a stable and predictable income that allows us to be more strategic with our clients. So in summary, when you think about markets today, it is a business with deep, broad client relationships. It's also highly diversified, so it can produce stable double-digit returns. And lastly, it is at scale at scale to be competitive and a relevant player in the market. Now Venkat talked about simpler, better and more balanced, I will walk you through the same journey and starting with simple. So for us, it's very simple. Our client franchise is what drives everything. On the top left, you can see through an intense focus on our clients, we have been improving our client franchise. Today, we are a top five client franchise in global markets, in fixed income and in equities. In fact, what is more impressive because you have US banks in the mix here is that we have grown our client franchise by one notch in markets, two notches in fixed income and three notches in equities. Within our client franchise, we have also grown our share with the top 100 clients by 220 basis points. And our growth and progress is not limited to that account base. We've made similar progress with the next 150 and the rest of our clients. Now if you look on the right, you can see how many of our top 100 clients we rank top 5 with. In 2021, that number was 30%. We wanted to deepen our relationships with these clients. Why? Because they are large and they're growing. They're also more complex. So they like to partner with the same reliable banks again and again. And that brings more predictability and stability to our income. So we implemented an accountability framework with a lead client executive per account. And we figured out where we needed to lean in across the investment bank and the group versus asking for more. And today, through that framework, we have grown our number to 49. Now we will apply the same framework and intensity of coverage to grow this number further to 70 by 2026. Now staying on the team of simpler clients are important. They bring us to business, but the stability of our platform relies heavily on how well we risk manage ourselves. On the left, you can see that we have broadly kept flat broadly stable VAR profile despite transacting much more volumes to our platforms. Over the last few years, we've also made a deliberate effort to move away from illiquid longer-dated type intermediation activities into more flow focused businesses. And so because of that today, we turn over 80% of our market's cash balance sheet on a weekly basis. And this is what enables us to outperform in periods of volatility like Q1 2020 and Q2 2022. At the same time, 70% of our capital profile today is under two years, and that is how we recycle 20% of our intermediation RWAs every quarter towards higher returning opportunities. Now on the right, you can see the bell curve of our income distribution, and you can see how we have shifted it to the right. In 2019, half of our trading days, half of our trading days sat in the \u00a30 to \u00a315 million bucket. Today, we have moved them all into the \u00a316 million to \u00a330 million bucket. This effectively means we have raised the floor on our income, and it also makes us more stable. In this process, we've also taken the number of our loss days or loss-making days from 16 to seven in 2023. Now moving to the team of better. Let's start with our businesses. Here, you can see the strength of our franchise. Our top five revenue rank businesses are 53% of the wallet today. So effectively, we are a top five player in half of the market's wallet. This is a very large wallet of nearly \u00a3100 billion. And within these businesses, we have a strong market share of 11% today. In 2019, we had 8% market share. And over the last few years, we have grown that, and we've held a double-digit market share now for the last three years. Also today, 72% of our income comes from these established capabilities, which again means we are more stable. So how did we achieve this? Since 2019, we used our capital discipline and allocated them an extra five points of capital. And now five years later, their contribution to our revenues has increased by 12 points versus the respective wallet contribution only growing by two points. This tells you that there is strong evidence here that when we provide oxygen to our established capabilities, we can outperform the market. Let's take the example of our equity prime business, which Venkat talked about. In 2019, we were outside the top five. This is a business that requires a huge amount of infrastructure. And we know in order to finance a client, we must be able to execute clear, settle and asset service to collateral across all major global markets. So when the operating environment changed in 2020, we invested. And today, we run a top five franchise that actively competes with its US peers. Now I'd like to make two final points on this slide. Firstly, the 11% market share we have here, this is in our established capabilities. We want to grow this further. This is where we have operating leverage. And secondly, as Venkat mentioned, prior to 2019, we did make some very difficult decisions. We exited commodities. We exited parts of our onshore emerging market trading businesses. We exited parts of our Asia equity business, and that is what has allowed us and enabled us to be consistent to our clients for the last few years. Now moving on to the rest of our franchise. There are parts of our franchise where we are not top five. We still have a healthy market share of 5% within these businesses. And we think about -- when we think about these businesses, they are important to us for two reasons. Firstly, they help us maintain a stable ecosystem to our clients, so we can be consistent to our clients. Secondly, they represent opportunities for us either because we have lost some market share or the operating environment is changing. For example, last year, in European rates and equity directives, we did lose some market share due to idiosyncratic reasons. But traditionally, these businesses have been very large for us because in rates, we have our Sterling franchise. We're also a primary dealer in 17 countries. And our corporate derivative franchise through banking brings us large structural advantages. Similarly, in equity derivatives, we are one of the largest issuers of structured nodes. So over the last 12 months, we are addressing our platform gaps, and we have already allocated them the capital they need to regain their lost market shares. Securitized products, is a different example. This is where the operating environment has changed. The life cycle here is you originate a pool of assets, you finance those assets and finally, you trade those securities. We have a top three origination franchise. We've built the top five financing franchise, but we did not trade these securities. So in 2021, when QT was starting, we realized there was an opportunity. So we invested in the product. And today, just as the operating environment is improving and our clients need us, our investment is starting to come alive. Now these three opportunities together represent an extra \u00a3500 million of revenues for us, and just a 1% market share here gives us an extra \u00a3200 million of revenues. So given our historic market shares and the fact that our client franchise has stayed strong within these businesses, it gives us confidence that our plans are measured and prudent. Now staying on the team of better, a common dependency across all of this is technology. Today, within our trading businesses, our clients increasingly experience us through our electronic offering and in our financing businesses through the stability and delivery of our platforms. Now this experience relies heavily on running a smooth life cycle of a transaction. And the life cycle of a transaction through pre-trade, pricing and post-trade has large dependencies on your technology infrastructure. So our journey here started by simplifying our infrastructure. We started getting rid of legacy applications, legacy point-to-point feed, and we have now decommissioned 84 applications since 2021. Once we simplified our infrastructure, we started modernizing it. We started putting new applications in the cloud. We started containerizing new applications, and we also started creating more reusable applications. So what happens once you have simplified and modernized your infrastructure, you start to become more stable and agile. And today, we run a much more reliable platform. Our outages are down by 78%, and that is something our clients care about deeply. At the same time, our breaks are down by 53%, and that is something our regulators care about deeply. And finally, now we are more agile. We are releasing more algorithms. We're deploying product features quicker within our platforms. So, why does all of this matter? Because eventually, we want better electronic platforms, because we want these businesses to play a bigger role in our revenues as their capital-light businesses. And you can see that our efforts are paying off. Today, we are ranked number one on London Stock Exchange, and we have grown our low-touch equity and FX revenues by 87% since 2019. So finally, moving to the team of more balanced. We want to be more predictable and stable. So we did that by growing financing. Since 2019, through a very deliberate strategy, we have grown our financing revenues at a 13% CAGR for -- from \u00a31.8 billion to \u00a32.9 billion in 2023. Today, they represent 36% of our markets revenues, a very stable 36%. Now, why did we want to grow these revenues? Firstly, they represent stable and predictable income for us. Secondly, if you look at all the consolidation, AUM consolidation going on among clients, their financing needs are going up. This gives us an opportunity and enables us to be a much deeper partner with our largest accounts. Thirdly, these are RWA efficient businesses that are secured lending businesses. So, we like the risk profile -- the risk-weighted profile of these businesses. And lastly, there are huge barriers to entry here. So, to operate at scale, you require a huge amount of investment. Now, our platform has been tested over the last few years here. Between 2019 and 2023, there were some very large moves in asset prices. And these moves happen in a very, very short period of time. That is the worst kind of operating environment you can have for this business. Despite all of that, we managed our credit and operational risks very well through this period. Now, I want to share two more facts with you before I leave this slide that gives us confidence in our financing platform today. Today, we have a financing relationship with 96 of our top 100 markets clients. Secondly, over the last -- or since 2021, over 50% -- more than 50% of \u00a31 billion-plus hedge fund launches. These are large, very experienced hedge fund managers. They chose Barclays to be their prime broker at the beginning of their journey. That gives us a lot of confidence in our platform, but it also tells you that clients are trusting us at the beginning of their journey. Now, to wrap-up, we will stay focused on clients. We want to further deepen our relationships by achieving a top 5 rank with 70 of our top 100 clients. We're going to remain prudent around risk and capital management. We're going to deliver an extra \u00a3500 million through a three select intermediation businesses, while maintaining momentum in our top five franchises. We will complete and monetize our technology transformation, so capital-light businesses can play a bigger role. And finally, we're going to bring more balance to our financing revenues by growing them by an extra \u00a3600 million. Now, I'd like to finish by saying we have been executing a strategy that is working since 2019. We have been consistent to our clients. We have been a reliable partner to our clients. At the same time, we have the ability to produce double-digit returns regardless of the operating environment. So, the next few years are about executing the same strategy with the same precision and discipline that we have applied over the last few years. Thank you. And now I'll pass it back to Venkat."

        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Thank you, Adeel. So, I'll wrap up on the Investment Bank. So, what you've heard from Adeel in the market side, and what you heard from me is that overall, we intend to improve the investment banks RoTE to be in line with the group target of about 12% -- above 12% by 2026. We recognize that this is a significant increase on the 7% last year. And I believe from what I've told you though, that and what you've heard from a deal, that this is a credible and achievable ambition built from the foundations we've developed. Our income growth target in this is a high single-digit CAGR, and it's firmly predicated on initiatives which are within our control. And it monetizes investments which we have made in cost and capital, driving strong operating jaws and resulting in a cost-to-income ratio in the high 50s. You have heard that we are limiting the proportion of the Investment Bank RWAs to the rest of the group at around 50% by 2026, as we allocate more capital elsewhere to higher return in consumer and corporate businesses. We can achieve this, while absorbing regulatory inflation within the investment bank, due to the capital discipline, which already exists in our markets business and a pathway to improving return on RWA in the Investment Bank. And as I said at the start of this, we are looking for the Investment Bank overall to do more with less, keeping the cloud clients at the heart of what we do and indeed deepening those relationships with clients. We expect this plan to generate stable and attractive returns on a consistent basis, supporting our group targets and delivering value to our shareholders. So I will now hand over to Denny Nealon to take you through the US Consumer Bank Presentation."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Denny Nealon",
        "text": "Okay. So, good morning, everybody. I'm Denny Nealon, CEO of the US Consumer Bank, a role I've held for the last four years. I've been in the financial services industry more than 25 years, having previously worked at JPMorgan Chase and Bank One and have been with Barclays since 2004. I'm excited to be here today and talk with you about the US Consumer Bank, a business that was previously reported within the consumer, cards and payments division. I'll focus my comments on three areas. First, I'll provide an overview of the business, as well as some key US market characteristics. Then I'll review our financial performance and key performance drivers. And finally, I'll walk through our plan to achieve mid-teens road on a sustainable basis post migration to IRB capital rules. Now, let me tell you more about the business. So the US Consumer Bank has been part of Barclays for 20 years, and we're principally focused on providing credit cards to US consumers. We operate in what we call partnership cards, which is essentially a business-to-business to consumer model, where we partner with global corporations. Partners choose us to help them drive increased sales and customer loyalty through the co-brand or reward cards that we provide. Focusing on partnership cards is a conscious choice that we made, which plays to our strengths in a market where we would otherwise have to invest significantly to build brand awareness. The strategy has worked well for us. We've grown significantly and are now the ninth largest issuer in the US and a leading partnership issuer. We have approximately 20 million customers across 20 partnerships and [Technical Difficulty] Yes, thank you. Okay, so starting back with Slide 92. As you can see on this slide, we partner with 20 leading U.S. brands across multiple industries. And I already mentioned a few of them by name. A key point here, very strong relationships, many of whom have been with us for more than a decade and our historical renewal rate is about 90%. And importantly, this portfolio is very balanced by size without undue concentration risk. That said, the current portfolio mix is heavily weighted to airlines. So we are diversifying our sector exposure. The addition of GAAP in a partner in 2022 was a noteworthy first step, which I'll talk more about later. So Slide 93 and now turning to financial performance from 2021 to 2023. First point, first I'll point out that the 4% road he delivered in 2023 is clearly below our target level. I will explain the drivers of this performance shortly. But it's important to state that this level of return is not representative of the strong underlying performance of the business. We've grown net receivables by $10 billion, or 45% over the last two years to $32 billion. We've achieved that through a balanced mix of strong organic growth post-COVID and strong inorganic growth from the acquisition of the AARP and GAAP portfolios, with combined balances of close to $4 billion at acquisition. Alongside balanced growth, we have also seen significant growth in income and an improvement in NIM to 10.9%, driven by the benefits of a higher interest rate environment, the addition of the GAAP portfolio, and normalizing revolve rates from COVID lows, and a steadily improving cost-to-income ratio, in part reflecting benefits of beginning to scale the business. But offsetting these, the loan loss rate increased to 500 basis points as we built reserves for the expected rise in write-offs, which were coming off of historic lows consistent with those seen across the industry. In addition, new accounts were down significantly due to less travel during COVID, which otherwise would have matured and added to profitability in 2023. This, along with a large allowance build, resulted in a lower-than-normal RoTE of 4%. Now, switching to the next slide, Slide 94, I'd like to use the remainder of this presentation to articulate why we are confident that we can deliver returns in line with the group target by 2026, even in the face of regulatory headwinds in the form of IRB and late fee legislation, and also give some color on the impairment outlook and why we think it will revert towards our historic long-term average in the future. Now moving to Slide 95. We have a very clear path to deliver RoTE in line with the group target by 2026, which incorporates three elements. The first is the stabilization of consumer credit performance. Second, the specific actions we're taking, which will improve performance by scaling the business, driving improved operational efficiency, and expanding margins, each of which I'll talk about in more detail shortly. And third, it considers regulatory headwinds that we are actively working to mitigate. But first, it's important to understand USCB's track record, which gives us confidence that we can deliver on this plan. If you move to Slide 96, please. As you can see from this slide, the business has a long track record of growth, returns, and prudent risk management. In the nine years before COVID, the business delivered an average RoTE of 16%, helping the group achieve its return targets over that time. The RoTE performance since 2020 has been uneven, reflecting impacts from COVID, but given the recent balance recovery and normalization of customer behavior, we expect future performance to return to the more consistent pattern delivered between 2011 and 2019. It's also worth noting that we are making very deliberate investments to scale of business. New account originations incurred J-curve effect, principally driven by upfront marketing and day one impairment build, which dampens in year RoTE. That said, these annual new account vintages mature to RoTEs of greater than 20% over time. This is one of the key reasons why scaling the business is so important. This J-curve effect will decrease significantly at greater scale with a mature higher returning back book becomes a larger percentage of the total portfolio. Additionally, greater scale has the added benefit of reducing volatility when we add new partners in the future. Now moving to slide 97. We're back up. Okay. Now building on the theme of USCB's strong track record. What we wanted to highlight on this next page is how the business compared to other top 10 US issuers over the last 10 years, using delinquency rates as a proxy for credit quality. And as you can see from the chart, we have consistently maintained our position within the peer group during the period. Even in the early and mid-2010s, when our average FICO score was a bit lower than it is today. And being positioned in the middle of the peer group is consistent with our partnership-focused model, where we balance the need to deliver resilient risk-adjusted margins for shareholders with trying to say, yes, to as many of our partners' customers as we can. While we've seen a recent uptick in 30-day delinquencies, this is expected as we are coming off historic lows during COVID, and as you can see, very much in line with industry trends. We believe this 10-year period demonstrates two things: first, that we have demonstrated strong credit discipline over time; and second, that we have not taken on outsized risk to grow the portfolio at the rate we have. Now let's take a closer look at the drivers of impairment over the last few years. As previously mentioned, the recent normalization of delinquencies was expected and is largely a reflection of customer activity catching up from COVID lows. While write-offs have been broadly stable, you can see that we've rebuilt loan loss reserves to cover the write-offs we expect in the future following the normalization of delinquency rates. While this positions us well for the future, the in-year impact in 2023 was significant. Now looking ahead, we expect delinquencies to continue to tick up in the first half of 2024 and then to stabilize. The result is that we expect the 24 and 25 impairment charges to be below 23 levels and for our loan loss rates during those periods to be closer to our long-term average rate of around 400 basis points. Importantly, we remain well-provisioned as evidenced by a strong total coverage ratio of 10.2%. As you can see, we've also provided our US legal entity CECL coverage rate of 8.2%, which is in line with US peers. Finally, it's important to note that we continue to feel encouraged by the health of the US consumer. Unemployment levels remain near historic lows, moderation in inflation is contributing to real wage growth. There are still healthy levels of excess savings and strong spend and repayment levels persist. Now in line with the group, our plan to improve returns can be viewed through the lens of simpler, better and more balanced. And I'll speak to these individually in a moment. But to summarize, we are looking to improve operating efficiency, scale and diversify the business, improve margins and optimize the use of our balance sheet. Now, starting with simpler. As you can see from the charts, recent investment in the business has improved operational efficiency, but we recognize there's more to do. We've invested to digitize the business and built the retail platform as part of the Gap acquisition, which will enable us to add new partners more efficiently in the future. This increased investment onboard Gap, combined with lower card balances and subdued income post-COVID, drove our cost-to-income ratio in 2021 to 60%, significantly higher than our long-term average. Since then, though, these investments have helped reduce the cost per average active account by 15% and contributed to a reduction in cost income ratio to 51% in 2023. Now looking forward, as we continue digitizing, automating and scanning the business, we expect a further reduction in cost per average active account, contributing alongside margin improvements to a cost-to-income ratio in the mid-40s by 2026, broadly in line with our historic average. On the left-hand side of the slide, we provide a few examples of what we mean when we say we can become more efficient and improve customer experience by digitizing and automating key customer journeys. Transaction dispute or rewards are two great examples of common points of customer friction, which today too often result in customers reaching out to our call centers. We can simplify processes like these that customers can self-serve through the device of their choice without ever picking up the phone. That's simpler for our customers and more efficient for us. And we have similar opportunities on the colleague front and so are investing significantly to upgrade colleague tools and are leveraging automation to eliminate manual time-consuming activities. Now, moving to better and more balance. We will also look to scale and diversify our business, targeting $40 billion in net receivables by 2026. That strong track record of growth since 2011, where we've grown receivables at an 8.5% CAGR versus a 5% industry average, gives us confidence that we can achieve this through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. We see a large opportunity to grow in the retail vertical, and we expect the retail portion of the portfolio to increase from around 15% today to around 20% by 2026. And this will also help us rebalance our FICO mix to improve risk-adjusted returns. We also plan to recalibrate our risk-based pricing in response to industry-wide lead fee reductions. We expect that over time, this and other actions will fully offset any headwinds from these changes. Now on the liability side, today, we're about 60% funded by core deposits, which is a great low-cost way of funding our card assets. We are investing in new capabilities for our deposit platform, including targeted marketing to our partners and a tier-based pricing strategy, which should result in around 75% of funding coming from core deposits by 2026. Overall, we expect these actions to drive more than 100 basis points of NIM expansion by 2026. Now turning to the shift to IRB capital requirements, which you heard Anna speak about earlier. The first point, I'd like to make is to reiterate that this is a PRA driven adjustment that is industry-wide and not US CV specific. There is no underlying credit problem that is driving this increase in RWAs. We expect US card issuers to also see an increase in 2025 under proposed Basel rules. But as you can see, the capital treatment for us under IRB is significantly more conservative than the current standardized model. This will impact us in the second half of this year with an expected RWA increase of around \u00a316 billion or our risk weighted density equivalent increase of around 60%. While this will have an adverse impact on returns, we've been focused on a series of actions that will reduce the impact and help deliver returns in line with the group target by 2026 and mid-teens returns over the long run. These actions include: re-optimizing credit line strategies and leveraging strategic risk transfer agreements to reduce capital requirements, enabling USA need to continue to grow but at a less capital-intensive rate. So, to summarize, the US partnership market is very attractive with solid economics, ample room for growth, and require specialized capabilities and expertise that we have developed over the last 20 years. We have a proven track record of winning and growing partnerships, producing strong outcomes for our partners and customers and delivering strong value return for shareholders. Although there remains some uncertainty with regard to the macroeconomic environment, we are well positioned. We have extensive experience managing credit through multiple cycles and are also well equipped to manage regulatory change. As you can see, we are outlining key targets for the business that underpin our commitment to deliver returns in line with the group target by 2026. First, we will continue to scale the business and grow receivables to \u00a340 billion. We will deliver a net interest margin of more than 12%, which represents more than 100 basis points of growth. We will drive cost-to-income ratio down to the 51% we saw in 2023 to the mid-40s, reflecting our long-term average. We will continue to manage credit risk prudently, and we will manage loan loss rate to around 400 basis points, also consistent with our long-term average. On RWAs, we are taking action and expect 2026 RWAs to be around \u00a345 billion, which represents an RWA density of around 145%. As we deliver upon these targets, we will be building momentum in the business that not only will deliver returns in line with the group target in 2026, but will generate increased confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term goal to deliver mid-teen roadies on a sustainable basis. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to future opportunities to discuss the business deal. I will now hand over to Vim Maru, CEO of Barclays UK."

        "speaker": "Vim Maru",
        "text": "Good morning, everyone. I'm Vim Maru, the new CEO of Barclays UK. I know many of you here today through my 20 years in financial services, and I look forward to getting to know you again in my new capacity. So let me take you through how Barclays UK or BUK, as we call it, is going to support the ambitions and targets that Venkat and Anna just set out. As you know, BUK is our ring-fenced bank. It serves retail customers and small business clients across the UK. Barclays 330-year heritage helps to build deep customer trust and a strong brand position. Whilst our history gives us those foundations, our focus is on positioning the business for the future as a growing high-returning business, which delivers good customer outcomes. That's about making BUK more efficient, investing in our client and customer relationships and growing through more tailored products. Before I come to each of those, let me briefly remind you exactly what BUK is. BUK operates at scale in an attractive and sophisticated market. We have 20 million active customers. The depth and breadth of those relationships provide a robust and strong deposit base. That is the foundation of our lending businesses where we are a leading player in the mortgage, credit card and loan markets for individuals and small businesses. Over 80% of our income is generated by net interest income, and we are committed to growing this through a combination of lending growth, asset margin enhancement and the structural hedge program that Anna mentioned earlier. That structural hedge program is a fundamentally important part of how we manage the business through an interest rate cycle. The strength of our deposit franchise is the result of significant investment in focus over many years, irrespective of the rate cycle. That hedge helps ensure we can maintain investment in our customers, efficiency and asset growth. All of that underpins our plans to maintain a high RoTE performance. RoTE for the past three years has been around 18% or higher. We have been disciplined in the way we have delivered these returns with positive jaws in our cost-to-income ratio, low impairments through tight credit controls during the pandemic and a conservative funding profile with low loan-to-deposit ratio. We know we have more work to do to drive more efficiencies and lower our cost to income ratio, which we aim to reduce to around 50% by 2026. Our prudent risk and funding profile means we have the capacity to grow lending whilst maintaining our discipline, thus enhancing our profitability. So how do we intend to do that? Consistent with the group's strategy, we are focused on making BUK simpler, better and more balanced. We will be simpler by investing in digitization, automation and technology, delivering material efficiencies. We will be better by investing in customer experience and our product offering, supporting the relationships that underpin our deposit franchise and creating opportunities to broaden these relationships. We will be more balanced. We have positioned the business conservatively over the past few years. Now is the time to grow by winning back market share on the asset side of the business, particularly in unsecured lending and business banking. I'm going to spend a little time on each of those to bring them to life and how we intend to deliver. On delivering a simpler BUK, we have invested significantly in transforming the business in the past three years. That combined with economic headwinds over the pandemic led to a cost-to-income ratio of 68% in 2021. Our investments and changes in the environment have brought that to 58% today. But we must go further. Our aim is to get that to about 50% by 2026. In the chart on the left, we have segmented our cost base into four parts to show how we think about our costs. We are focused on driving efficiencies across all four, but I have singled out the top two, because this is where we believe we lag peers. On distribution, this covers the cost of servicing our customers day-to-day. We have historically operated with a higher number of branches, creating higher associated real estate and people costs. We have acted by reducing our branch presence as customer behavior has shifted. Our focus will now shift on optimizing the way we engage with our customers and communities. We will do that through a far more efficient and flexible footprint. By the end of this year, we will have over 900 touch points available across the country, including branches, flexible community sites and shared banking hubs. Of course, the primary basis of customer interaction today is through our digital channels. In fact, 98% of customer interactions are now digital. Our touch point optimization will strengthen that further completing our digitization work and leveraging our physical footprint as a value-added complement to it. In Operations and Technology, we are in the process of automating the parts of our operation, which are not yet processed straight through and simplifying and upgrading our technology capabilities. The historic complexity and fragmentation of our technology means that the transition cost has increased this proportion of our costs. However, this is an investment in our future capabilities and further efficiencies that we must make. The evolution of our cost base over the last three years has been shaped by these investments. The left side of this slide outlines the impact of our cost actions to date. We have streamlined BUK through actions such as rationalizing our product portfolio, reducing our branch numbers and headcount and simplifying our technology estate, all of which I mentioned on the prior slide. That has brought base costs down by 7% and contributed to our cost-to-income ratio declining from 68% to 58%, notwithstanding the impact of inflation on our underlying costs. That gives us confidence in our ability to drive our cost-to-income ratio to about 50% in 2026 as our investment in efficiency will continue to offset any lingering inflation. This cost discipline not only delivers efficiency today, but it also creates capacity to invest in both future cost efficiency and future revenue. On the right-hand side of this slide, you see that our plans reflect an 80% increase in transformation investment spend over the next three years to \u00a31.2 billion from \u00a3700 million in the prior three year period. Our investment in driving cost efficiencies will continue through customer journey, automation, optimization and simplification. The mix of investment will evolve with continued focus on revenue growth as we align our products with customer needs better and capture the opportunities of the partnerships that you saw on a prior slide. Combined with the benefits of our investments to date, we expect the income benefit from investment to increase by about \u00a3600 million in 2026 from \u00a3100 million in the prior period. Combined with the expected efficiency savings, that makes our aim to deliver a cost-to-income ratio of 50%, both achievable and credible. Let's shift to how we make the UK better. That requires increased focus on an investment in improving our relationship with our customers and clients. As I mentioned at the beginning, our starting point is strong, evidenced by a deep deposit franchise rooted in trust earned across multiple generations. We know that our focus on transformation over the past years has disrupted those relationships. You see that in the dip in our overall Net Promoter Score in the chart on the top left here. For example, the scale and pace of our branch closures as well as the product and service simplification that we've undertaken has disrupted how we interact with and support customers. Meanwhile, work required to update the information that we hold on business clients has created understandable frustration on their part. We are committed to enhancing that position from here on. I showed you earlier that we've rationalized our product offering by 32% and made our range simpler. We did that in part for efficiency, but also so that we could invest in tailoring our offering to better align the service that we provide with the needs and expectations of our different customers. We have much more to do to get that alignment as precise as it needs to be. Getting that alignment right creates the opportunities for us to enhance our relationships with our customers and as we do so, we would expect to see average balances grow and an increase in the number of needs that we solve for each customer. By being better, we improve customer satisfaction, we support our deposit franchise, and we maintain the foundation of a resilient funding profile that enables us to grow the asset side of the business. And that brings me to the third priority, how we intend to make BUK more balanced. As I mentioned at the beginning, we are a scale player across our balance sheet. The last three to four years has benefited scale players on the liability side of the business as consumers and businesses retained high cash balances across the pandemic, coupled with economic uncertainty, the severely limited their appetite or need for borrowing. We believe we are at the beginning of more stability in the UK with the inflation outlook having moderated and the consequent rate stability, giving more confidence to borrowers, both individuals and businesses. We are also confident that our investments to date have placed us in a good position so that we can capture the opportunity that recovery will present. A quick reminder of where we have come from. We made deliberate choices to navigate the longstanding economic uncertainties in the UK with a low-risk profile. That was prudent, but it led to market share declines, particularly in unsecured lending and a lower margin profile in mortgages and a persistence of a low loan-to-deposit ratio in business banking. In short, we didn't take the opportunity to reallocate or recycle underutilized risk appetite from one area of BUK to another. That opportunity is now in front of us. I'd like to bring each of those to life a little more now. In unsecured lending, our plan is to grow market share. We have simplified our customer journeys and revamped our credit and affordability models to enable this. In consumer loans, we have historically focused on relationship lending, but we will shortly begin to open up our lending to all qualifying customers, whether they bank with us or not. I will shortly come back to a dedicated slide on the recently announced Tesco deal. In mortgages, our aim is to improve application margins through a number of initiatives. First, by improving our broker support, including by simplifying how we support brokers and improving the platform through which they provide us with their applications. Secondly, we will do more high loan-to-value lending as a proportion of our total book. Our current position versus peers is conservative at 6%. We have capacity to grow that proportion without materially shifting our risk position. We also have the capability to offer specialized solutions through our Kensington acquisition from last year, where the margin opportunity is typically significantly higher than that of our existing Barclays product range. And finally, we intend to increase our focus on the mortgage needs of our Premier and Blue customers who are far more likely to come to us directly. In Business Banking, we will grow our lending market share by leveraging our existing relationships on the liability side, both in terms of access to customers and our ability to automate credit decisioning given the visibility we already have on their financial positions. We will also continue to broaden our lending proposition, including in the asset finance space and accelerate digitization of client journeys to make it easier for them to access what we offer. Whilst lending is at the heart of our growth opportunity, we will conduct this in a controlled way that maintains our disciplined risk profile. I'd like to bring that to life explicitly. As I noted earlier, we made deliberate choices to derisk during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty in the UK. While that impacted market share negatively, it also led to historically low loan loss rates. You see that clearly on the left side of this slide. Today, that rate stands at 14 basis points versus 36 basis points in 2019. It's worth noting that even that 2019 level was lower than years before that. We have capacity to grow within the parameters of our historic loan loss experience and our 2026 plan delivers a risk profile that is consistent with that 2019 level. The right side of this slide shows you that same information in a graphical format for BUK at the top and then cards and loans below that. You can see the larger Blue Eagle representing 2026, lies in between the 2019 position to its right and the 2023 position to its left for the business overall. My point simply that we have room to grow as we pivot the UK to take advantage of opportunities to increase market share and margins and deliver a more balanced asset profile within BUK and ultimately, for the group. Given the recent announcement of our intention to acquire the retail banking business of Tesco and enter into a long-term exclusive partnership, you will naturally wonder how that fits within the ambitions that I've just shared. This slide outlines what that banking business is. \u00a38 billion of high-quality unsecured loans split evenly between credit cards and personal loans, funded by \u00a37 billion of non-transactional deposits that fit neatly into what I outlined earlier about being better. We are naturally excited by this opportunity. It takes us a long way towards the unsecured lending growth ambitions that I just shared. In particular, this provides the opportunity to grow both the lending and deposit products through the Barclays and Tesco brands, which we believe appeal to different segments of the market. The long-term exclusive partnership with Tesco also provides an unparalleled platform to work with the UK's leading loyalty program as well as the opportunity to market through Tesco channels and the open market. This builds on our existing UK partnerships with other leading retail, consumer electronics, and loyalty program brands. Importantly, the customer base is similar to ours, leading to broadly aligned risk profiles. So, this fits squarely within the risk appetite framework that I outlined earlier. By delivering on our plan, we position BUK for the future and deliver an attractive and sustainable RoTE profile that is high teens in 2026 on a larger balance sheet. Underpinning that is continued growth in income, where we expect a compound annual growth rate of mid-single-digits CAGR over the next three years, concentrated in net interest income. Our continued focus on efficiency will lead our cost-to-income ratio to around 50% by 2026. We expect the better utilization of risk appetite to normalize our loan loss rate towards the 2019 level in a controlled and disciplined progression. And as we grow our asset position, our RWAs will necessarily grow as a result and BUK's contribution to the Group's RWA profile is expected to grow. Given our focus on unsecured lending, you should expect the impairment build in RWA growth to be slightly more weighted towards the first year than the associated revenue build. That will cause RoTE to moderate in 2024, then recover to our target. Our ability to invest in that future revenue growth, as I said at the very beginning, is protected by the structural hedge, reflected in the 2024 net interest income guidance of \u00a36.1 billion that Anna referenced earlier, although that excludes any contribution from the Tesco portfolios when that transfers to the UK expected in the second half of this year. So, our focus on efficiencies will make us simpler, our focus on our customers and clients will make us better, and our plans for growth will make us more balanced. We have invested significantly in recent years to prepare the business to growth. We are now ready to seize the opportunity before us. Thank you for your time, and I will hand back to Venkat."

        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Thank you. So, we will now spend a little time on the Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth, which are two new reporting units. I mentioned that we will also come back later in the year with a presentation on each of these by Matt and Sasha, respectively, in addition to a deepdive on the Investment Bank. So, you will have the opportunity later to hear from them. The UK Corporate Bank is the beating heart of Barclays' 330-year history. We have relationships with about 25% of the UK market. These relationships average 18 years in length and they are covered with a network of locally-based teams around the country. Under the resegmentation, the UK Corporate Bank includes a large part of the operations, which we previously reported in the corporate lending and transaction banking lines. It also includes corporate card issuing previously included in consumer cards and payments. So what this does is that it brings together our trade and working capital solutions into one business. The integrated business has reported strong returns and last year generated about \u00a31.8 billion in income. The income streams are diversified, and the key priority for us is to grow the fee income alongside capital-efficient growth in lending. So what is it that we do here? On this slide, I'll summarize the breadth of our offering to corporates. We support clients with their short and long-term financing needs, including extending finance to support the transition to net zero. We provide working capital solutions through card issuance, overdrafts, invoice discounting and traditional revolving facilities. We help clients to move their money, to pay suppliers and employees, to collect money from their customers and reconcile their transactions. We also help clients to invest liquidity through a range of solutions. We support clients in managing risk as they grow their international exposure through our award-winning trade finance and FX propositions. And what this range does is it positions us well to grow over the next few years, while giving clients access to expertise in other parts of the group. Our clients' needs are evolving quickly, and we are focused, therefore, on delivering operational needs simply and seamlessly. And to meet these, we have priority areas, which are well defined, starting with the importance of our leading payments ecosystem. And digital delivery is important because it frees up time for our clients and also makes our bankers more efficient, allowing them to spend their efforts sharing data-driven strategic insights. And this client interaction will enable us to deepen and to broaden our client relationships. And as growth opportunities emerge, clients want us to make it easier for them to access the right financing structures in quick and simple ways. I said I will talk about payments. We spoke earlier about looking for a partnership in our merchant acquiring business. So I want to say a little bit about the payment ecosystem, which is about making and receiving payments. This is an essential part of the functions we provide our corporate clients. We are one of the largest sterling clearers in the UK. We are a leading corporate card issuer with more than \u00a312 billion of payments per annum and the third largest merchant acquirer across Europe. That's the far right. We process over 300 billion payments a year a pound in payments a year, which we estimate represents one in every three card payments in the UK system. Our objective always is to bring the best capabilities and the most efficient services to our clients, and we pursue the models which deliver these outcomes. Our traditional bank payment systems have largely been built in-house over many years and are very resilient. What we are doing now is focusing on developing further digital solutions. And the landscape across card issuing in the middle and merchant acquiring on the right has been fast moving with much innovation. We've had years of experience combining strong in-house capabilities with those provided by some of the partners listed here in order to benefit from greater scale in technology and operations. In merchant acquiring now, which is on the far right, we are exploring how best via partnerships to provide further benefits of scale, global scale and new technologies and innovation to our clients. That is what that strategic exploration is about. As with the rest of the bank that you've heard, we talk about simpler, better and more balanced. We are focused on making this business simpler by enabling clients to access the solutions and services more easily. Our main digital channel, something we call iPortal already gives clients access to a wide variety of services through a single entry point, and they can self-serve about 30% of their needs, and the adoption for these solutions is around 90%. We plan now to build on this, expanding our self-service capabilities through both online and mobile access and increasing the efficiency, speed and frankly, better controls. And what this will allow us to do is to decommission legacy systems. And what we've been doing is also investing in stable and automated back-office platforms and the tools our relationship teams use, making their client interactions, as I said, more productive. All of this, we expect will improve the client experience while using efficiencies to fund investment and it allows us to retain our low cost income ratio. We aim to be better by deepening the relationships, which we have. We were the first bank to introduce industry specialist teams more than 20 years ago, and we continue to lead and to innovate. Our network of business development directors has resulted in more than 550 client wins in 2023 and a growing market share. And we are hiring additional coverage bankers in areas where we see growth opportunities and continuing to develop our propositions. Recently, we migrated our trade finance business from legacy technology to cloud-based systems. 40% of our clients use five or more products, which is up three percentage points over the last two years, and this demonstrates our ability to increase that penetration. And as we deepen our relationships and improve our offering, we think we can do more with 28% of our clients using two products or fewer today, the potential for revenue growth here is significant. And we are confident that we can increase our share of wallet from existing clients and grow through new client acquisitions. So next, I want to focus on lending, which makes us more balanced. We have a loan-to-deposit ratio here in the UK Corporate Bank in the low 30s, and we are well-placed to grow, providing a better balance for the business as we grow more fee income. And we will deploy more RWAs to support this effort, which in turn can lead to deeper and wider client relationships. Our existing book is well-diversified across sectors, and we have a track record of low impairment. And so we'll continue, of course, to use the group's significant risk transfer program, providing first loss protection and reducing both impairment risk and capital requirements. Within our credit risk appetite, there are areas where we can be more competitive on price and take larger credit positions with stronger clients. And we are confident in that way of growing lending at attractive risk-adjusted returns as we develop our digital delivery and product offering. And we also expect to generate business for other parts of the bank, leveraging our track record in the debt capital markets. So finally, on the corporate bank, I just want to highlight some key financials and summarize our ambitions. As I said, a key priority is to grow fee income alongside a capital-efficient growth in lending, our recent performance positions as well to achieve this. Over the last two years, we've grown at a 15% CAGR. This reflects, of course, the benefit of -- to NII from rising rates, but also double-digit growth in fee income and net client growth. And while loan and deposit volumes have been stable, our propositions and client relationships have enabled a 10% growth in clients in the last two years. The income growth has actually helped us with resulted in a healthy cost/income ratio and contributed to returns increasing from 14% to 20%. We have the opportunity now to grow income further while we increased our investment in simplification and automation. So we still aim to deliver a cost income ratio in the high 40s. And post COVID, we have benefited from a gradual release of modeled impairment, and we expect a more normalized impairment profile going forward. Overall, we expect returns to moderate from the 20% we reported last year, but we still target high-teens over the coming years. So to summarize, the UK Corporate Bank is already delivering strong returns. We are confident we can continue to grow at these attractive returns despite the normalization of rates and impairment Lastly, Private Banks and Wealth Management. On top of my mind, day I became CEO, who was an ambition to realize the great opportunity that the Private Bank and Wealth Management business provides for Barclays. We had a strong private bank, have a strong private bank, both in the UK and in select international markets. But the wealth management business in the U.K. and our digital investing business, what we call smart investor was unprofitable and subscale. Moreover, these two businesses sat in separate parts of the bank on either side of the ring plans. Over the last 12 months, we have put them together again with the regulatory commission. And what this does is it provides us with a very significant opportunity to serve the financial needs of UK customers in our retail business, together with serving our high and ultra-high net worth clients. In addition, it enables us to have a single investment function and shared platforms. We aim to provide advice to our customers and clients at each stage of their financial -- personal financial journeys. And we will do so with robust financial management tools, which are fairly priced, managed transparently, constructive simply and delivered efficiently. So this is the Private Bank and Wealth Management business today. As you can see on the left-hand side, the business has been structured into four distinct segments. Firstly, self-directed digital investing for those who are starting out or want to invest anything from \u00a31 upwards, a UK wealth management proposition for those that are more advanced stage in their financial journeys. And of course, a service for high and ultra-high net worth clients domestically and internationally, who have a full access to a full suite of private banking products. What you see on the right is that the business has grown its assets and liabilities on the average of 10% a year over the last five years, and it's reasonably well diversified both geographically and in terms of products. The combined business today is already producing high returns, 31% in 2023 compared to 14% RoTE in 2021. A good part of that growth has come from deposits, given the impact of higher rates, but we've also been growing our investing and lending offerings. The income has grown from \u00a31 billion to \u00a31.3 billion, and our cost-income ratio has shrunk from 86% to 69%. This is a very good and profitable business, but what it needs to do is to scale, particularly in the digital investing and the U.K. Wealth Management segments. Again, given its high contribution to the group, this is an area of investment. So again, we're going to do this by being simpler, better, and more balanced. Part of what I, being simpler, as I said, was to combine the businesses. We now have one management team, a single investment function, shared platforms, and simpler segmented customer propositions. And there are significant efficiencies from doing this. Part of being better is for us to fully leverage the synergies across the bank. And we are developing a more effective two-way referral flow for clients with other business units within the group. Barclays U.K. provides us with a significant source of new client referrals into digital investing and wealth management. And having a closer collaboration with the investment bank enhances our distinctive point of differentiation by giving private banking clients access to a wider range of investment solutions. Being more balanced is in part by growing our digital investing and U.K. wealth management offering to the scale that is aligned to the size and scale of our U.K. retail bank. This proposition has very high operating leverage and we are focused now on making specific enhancements to provide better service to our customers. Very recently we launched a new pricing structure and we will now focus on the content and digital capabilities we need to enhance the customer service and journey. In the U.K. wealth management space, we will lower the entry point to \u00a3250,000, and again focus on providing easily accessible advice, digitally enabled as much as possible, and a simplified transparent investment proposition. Both of these will be better integrated within our banking app and our website. Moving to the private bank. Across the U.K. and our international business, we have over \u00a3160 billion of client assets and liabilities. And we provide a high-touch personalized client service. Our priorities are actually fairly similar for both segments. We need to build out our teams, including our U.K. regional footprint, as well as our teams in the international markets where we already have an investment banking presence. Also we need to invest in systems and processes to enhance the client experience. In addition, we will invest in our client solutions, including alternatives and lending capabilities. Altogether, these priorities are going to require an investment into our private bank, which will lead to our RoTE being greater than 25% by 2026, which is slightly lower than last year's numbers. We aim to deliver high-quality, double-digit asset and liability growth across segments and maintain a cost-income ratio in the high 60s. To conclude, we have a great opportunity in this business, and it's one that I'm really excited about. We need to be simpler in terms of our business and the propositions, which we provide our customers and clients. We need to be better in terms of our service and technology capabilities and more balanced by scaling our UK wealth offering. Now, almost every bank talks about doing better in private banking and wealth. And so you might well ask, what makes Barclays succeed. I think there are three things. One is the scale and depth of our franchise in the UK and how few of our customers use our investment services today. There are 3 million customers in Barclays UK with investable assets who we benefit from our digital investing or our UK wealth offering. The second in my opinion is that the UK market could be better served, particularly for those customers in the intermediate stages of their financial journey. I think there's a real role for us to provide a service which is transparent, which is competitive, which is digitally available, but with access to human advice. And finally, we have proven we can grow this business. Over the last few years, five years, we've grown client assets and liabilities by 10% per annum. We have won awards internationally, the best foreign private bank in Switzerland, the number one private bank in Monaco, the number one international private bank in India. And we are confident we can achieve an RoTE of greater than 25% by 2026. And to me, private banking and wealth represents a very attractive opportunity for the bank. It's a capital-light fee income-based business and high returning. So with that, what we will do is I'll invite my colleagues to come up, and we will move to the final part of Q&A or for today's investor update with Q&A on the business presentation, which you've heard. As previously, please limit yourself to two questions and introduce yourself. And I am the MC [ph]. All right. Who would like to go first? Yeah, Alvaro."

        "speaker": "Q - Alvaro Serrano",
        "text": "Happy to go first, again. To first again Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Just a couple of questions. One is on the efficiency gains in the investment bank. I don't know if you can make it a bit more tangible for us, given any examples of where you see capital efficiencies in particular. Obviously, there's been discussion in the past about leverage finance deals that are still on the balance sheet. Is that a source of capital efficiency? And if so, maybe help us quantify it or give us a bit more sort of flavor on how easy those efficiencies are to deliver? And second, on US Cards, the 12% NIM. You've listed sort of quite a few things that drive the NIM improvement and rates wasn't one of them. And I realize this business, it is lower rates is good for it. So maybe, I've seen your rate assumption at the back, but can you quantify maybe how much rate plays into that NIM expansion in the US Cards business? Thank you."

        "speaker": "A - C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "So, why don't I take the first one? I'll pass it to Anna to start on the second one, maybe, Denny, you can chime in afterwards. So, at a macro level within the investment bank, efficiency, capital efficiency, which is what I think you're talking about, RWA per unit income is going to come in a few ways. Within markets, as we've said, we've always -- we've maintained a high level. And I think recycling capital and focusing on liquidity and sort of revolving as a deals at 20% a quarter of what you put out and increasing that is going to be one source. In investment banking, it's coming in a couple of ways. Number one, it is from the move from DCM, which is capital heavy into ECM and M&A. The second is recycling capital as it gets released into -- into international corporate banking and the transactional services, which are going to be closely managed by the Investment Bank of managed within the Investment Bank and which represents higher recurring revenue and an allocation of RWAs into the financing side of markets. So at a macro level, that's how it happens. Obviously, with individual clients, over time, we will assess whether we are getting the right mix of business for the capital which we lay out. And -- but that's part of exactly that reallocation. Anna, then do you want to start on them?"

        "text": "Yeah. Sure. Why don't I start, and then I'll hand to Denny. So you're right, we're not calling out rates. We saw a benefit from rates in 2023 actually because of the lag effect of repricing as rates rose within the US, which obviously we don't expect to recur. Actually, our NIM expectations are much more about what we expect to happen to pricing to mix. And deposits do matter, but only to the extent that we expect a greater proportion of retail funding in the future. But Denny, you might want to expand on pricing?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A - Denny Nealon",
        "text": "Really as Anna just said, there's really four things going on. So I think the whole industry will see some margin compression as rates come down. So that's built into our forecast. But I highlighted three things that are going to help us drive NIM expansion. One is we have -- we are going to be going more in the retail sector. We expect that to help us rebalance our FICO mix they'll help deliver higher margins. Second, alongside the late-fee legislation, we'll be re-pricing some of our existing accounts. And then we have a really strong award-winning deposit platform, and we're investing in that. And so we expect to get more value from that going forward. So those three things are what offset that margin compression that you can expect from rates drop."

        "text": "Hi, Joe Dickerson from Jefferies. Just in terms of the competitive landscape in your two US areas, so the investment bank and then the Cards and Payments business. Could you just perhaps elaborate on how the Basel end game may be impacting the competitive landscape in the US, although, I do see that the banks in the US have done a pretty good job of pushing back on that. But your views on that would be interesting. And then in the consumer space and cards, in particular, we've seen in the past 24 hours, Capital One in Discover, effectively Capital One going to the network business. So, how you see the impact on the landscape changing in the US cards or not as may be the case as a result of that merger."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A - C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Yeah. So let me start with Capital One discover, then I will just give a broad answer to the first part of your question and let a Adeel and Denny talk about that. Unless, Anna, you want to add something, too? So on Capital One Discover, look, we've got to see the details on it. Clearly, it is a transaction that is based on a cards portfolio as well as payment rails and payment capabilities. And it shows, if anything, that these things are valued in the banking system today. As I hope you've seen in the last few hours, both cards and payments are critical parts of the Barclays proposition as well, and something which we think we're good at and trying to do better. So that's my sort of first takeaway from it. And we'll, of course, have to see the details. And I will say that there is a regulatory angle of it, which, you know, my colleague Jason Goldberg, I have to plug Barclays Research, wrote overnight with Terry Ma. And we have to understand that better as well. Okay. So then coming back to the competitive landscape in the U.S. So at one very high level, capital rules generally increase over time and banks adjust to them, The big banks adjust, right? And I imagine that's what ultimately will happen. And what I do hope is whatever settles down in the U.K. -- in the U.S. capital landscape is relatively mirrored in the U.K., whereas you know the regulators also have a competitiveness mandate in addition to financial safety. So we'll have to see where it goes. And what we hope is that it's sort of fair across both sides of the pond. What you have seen us do is move to internalize what that will be, both at the overall Basel level, as Anna said, to the lower end of 5% to 10%, which includes what we said for IRB in the U.S. cards business, already included in U.K. cards, and then we've got a bit of corporates to go. So I think it will all finalize over the next two years. Hopefully, it will be relatively even but we will adjust competitively as we have done in the past. Adeel?"

      {
        "speaker": "A - Adeel Khan ",
        "text": "Yes, I agree with what completely agree with what you're saying. I think as Anna referenced the impact of Basel, we expect it to be the lower end of 5% to 10%. So that that means mid to high single digits for markets. And look, I think, I go back to what I said earlier in my presentation, our ambition is to generate double-digit returns for shareholders. So if they're businesses that will be impacted because of Basel, will be ruthless about allocating and reallocating capital within our portfolio to accommodate for that."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A - C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "And on the card side, what I'd say is, as we showed actually on the slide, we expect that through the actions that we're taking that we'll be able to get our density rate to similar levels to what U.S. issuers will have. So I don't think there's going to be any competitive issue there. And at the end of the day, we've had capital differences over the years between the U.S. and U.K. over time. And it's never kept us from winning business at good returns in the past, now, or in the future. And really, because what that really is about at the end of day is not just about price, it's about can we help partners drive their business forward by helping them increase sales and customer loyalty. And we think because of the capabilities that we've built, we do that pretty well. Anna, anything to add?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A - Anna Cross ",
        "text": "Yes, just a couple of comments, Joe. The first would be, clearly, we're reacting to what we know here, and there's some time to go to see the final rules. So what the teams are doing is they're firmly focused on what we can control, both in Denny's world and in Adeel's world. We would expect to see some increase in capital in the U.S. from our U.S. peers. The exact level of that, we'll see. I think what's really important for us to just remember though is that less than 10% of our Greek capital is in the IHC. And so for us some of these movements in US rules are less important than what happens with our primary regulator in the -- with the PRA in the UK, which we still expect to be the binding position for Barclays."

The US -- sorry, the IB, thank you for the additional commentary around kind of the flows of the RWAs. I think -- so, so far, really, you talked about optimization and move from DCM into ECM and Advisory and then a negative in terms of \u2013 a small negative in terms of Basel 3 in markets. Is there anywhere else within particularly, I guess, the markets business, where outside of optimization you might be taking some capital away from businesses in order to fund the capital-light growth that you're talking about in some of the focus areas for markets? That would be the first one. And then again, on -- the second one is just on -- again, on US cards. I guess what you've shown is you have some inefficiencies relative to your local peers from a capital density perspective, which you expect to offset through mitigation, but that usually comes at some cost. And Venkat, you talked earlier about the benefits of being a diversified business, but when you've got a standalone cards business without a broader US retail offering, there are some, I guess, some headwinds from an efficiency perspective relative to peers. So what is it that makes Barclays a good cards business in the US compared to a large US bank, for example."

        "text": "Right. Adeel, do you want to take the first one on \u2013 let me start on cards and Den you can fill in. Thank you, Rohith. So we really think about our business through the lens of two components. We have a bunch of top five revenue rent franchises where we are maintaining a pretty high income to RWA ratio. And then you have the non-top five franchises, which we showed you. If you look at the non-top five franchises, there are two types of businesses there. One, which we need to maintain to be stable to our clients. Within those, we have a pretty, pretty low capital footprint. And then you have the rest of our franchise, which we think we have room to improve because we've either lost market share or the operating environment is changing. If you look at that component of our franchise today, we have 38% of our RWAs allocated versus them driving 28% of our income. So it also tells you that those three focus businesses which we've talked to you about, we've already allocated the capital they need and the technology resources they need so we can drive that income over the next -- over the coming years."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A - Adeel Khan",
        "text": "So then coming Rohith to the question on the US cards business. The first thing to import that I focus on is we have to have an apples-to-apples comparison. This is a specialized partnership card business. We are not looking to compare this to a broad-based US bank's cards business, which includes its own branded cards. We are not in branded cards. In fact, the important thing, whether you talk about this or whether you can talk about our markets business or investment bank, is that we focus on the things which we try -- which we think we do very well and which are attractive to our clients. This specialized cards business has a few attractive features to it. Number one is we have 20 corporate clients, B2B, B2C, 20 million customers. We are not competing with the end customer -- for the end customer with a corporate client. We are not trying to sell them a mortgage. We're not trying to do other things with them, which many other banks might. And what it does is allow us to focus on increasing the engagement with the corporate -- which the corporate customer has with the underlying client. And that is the thing that leads to the revenue uplift for the corporate client, and that's what Denny had on one of his pages, 6x, 7x. So we don't compete. Second is we are good at what we do. And that's an indication of both the blue-chip quality of our clients and the 90% renewal rate that he spoke about. So it's an apples-to-apples comparison would not have us talk against the broader US banking market. Of course, there are things we need to do better. We need to adjust for the capital rules, we need to improve and increase our sort of own funding of this and manage our costs better. And as we get scale, improve the RoTE. So we have a lot to do to improve it. But the apples-to-apples comparison is not versus a general US bank. Anything to add?"

        "speaker": "A - Denny Nealon",
        "text": "You answered that really well. I'm very proud of you. No, I'd just piggyback on something I said earlier. We are a specialist issuer. Most of the largest US banks, I think you're really asking about, they don't compete every day in partnerships. They focus on their own proprietary brand. And the other thing I've pointed out earlier is the size and scale of the partnership market is very significant. So there's a big game to play for, and we believe that we have built a sustainable competitive advantage and the capabilities we bring to the table. And as Venkat said, that focus on helping drive our partners' businesses forward is different than most banks bring to the table. And so what we build is about how do we -- because we believe if they do well, we do well. And so our focus there is pretty unique, and it's worked really well."

So -- in terms of consumer duty. So there's a broad agenda that is leading to various implications for financial services players. Obviously, apart from motor finance, you're present in most products in the UK, but one of the features of the UK market is very limited cross-selling. So I guess the question for you and for Vim is where do you think are the risks for you in your current business model as configured, especially as we go into the new rules, July this year on the back book? And then secondly, where might be the opportunities for you as other players have to reconfigure their own pricing. And I think your recent stock broker changes have probably been a step in that direction."

        "speaker": "A - C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Let me start with the second half, and then I'll turn it over to Vim. So I think consumer duty, which is a very beneficial way to look at actually what products people provide to customers and managing mis-selling risk across an appropriateness risk across the consumer product landscape is a good thing for the customer. As in all forms of regulation, it actually ends up benefiting the larger players because what we were able to do is understand it, manage it, absorb the fixed costs, and operate. Frankly, over the long-term service as a barrier to entry. I think, therefore, when I spoke earlier about Wealth and I said fairly priced, transparently constructed, efficiently delivered, it's easier for us to do these things than for smaller companies because we can, -- A, we know how to do it because we do it in other parts of our business; and B, we can sort of structure it and absorb the cost better. So, I think it's an advantage to the large players as generally forms of regulation are."

        "speaker": "A - Vim Maru",
        "text": "So, I think a couple of things to add. And I think that point about our scale and what we've done in the past is quite important because I think one of the things that struck me about Barclays and you'll see it in other banks too, I guess, is just the culture from a customer focus perspective is really strong. And treating customers fairly has been around for a while and the nature and behavior that we have here has been strong, too. Of course, Consumer Duty made us think through every line of our business and consider very carefully with the tweaks that we should make, but it's not been as heavier lift because of the culture that's already innate in our business. And so I think that's been a huge help in where we were and the steps that we have to take. And actually, I think we've made lots of great progress. I think the important thing here is a level playing field. Actually, there are some things that sit outside of the fence in terms of regulation and then making sure that the regulators then apply all of that in a similar and coherent way right across the market. I think that's the important thing to call out. And then you touched a little bit about sort of limited cross-selling. To some extent, when you look at our balance sheet, and I talked about it, conscious steps that we've taken have led to that. And actually, one of the things that we're trying to do as we lean into the changing shape of our balance sheet as we move forward is actually protecting our franchise and increasing that cross-selling capability. So, at the moment, some of our customers are going somewhere else for a credit card because of what we've chosen to do in the past. That's a real opportunity for us to really deepen the franchise and increase the number of products and services that we offer to our customers."

        "text": "One more just on buyback capacity, mainly for Anna. I'm sorry to ask about the next buyback when you've not even started this one. But the capital walk for 2024 is quite difficult to nail down, just given the moving parts that you've got. You start with 13.5% pro forma and then obviously, first quarter of every year, usually there is a trading related RWA pickup. So, it tends to be not very capital-generative. And then I guess you build capital towards your 125 basis points per year sort of run rate through the year. But when we think about the moving parts around the \u00a316 billion of RWA you had on coming in the second half, plus the various acquisitions, Tesco, whether or not you sell the timing of German cards, should we still be thinking about six months as the right kind of beat of looking at capital return and buybacks? Or do we think about that as sort of end of 2024?"

And I would say that, clearly, there is some seasonality to the business. You've called it out, we typically deploy more capital in Q1, but typically, we generate more capital in Q1. That's what we demonstrated in most years. Around the \u00a316 billion and indeed the onboarding of Tesco, those are in our capital flight path. And you wouldn't expect me to talk to you specifically about timing today. That's a matter for the Board, and it's something that we'll consider. But we have got a fairly a fairly consistent pathway going, if you like to look at it that way. And the other thing that we've done is very clearly highlight for you today our priority, which is number one, regulation; number two, the shareholder; and three, investment. So that should tell you how we're thinking about the return of capital as we go through 2024, but actually beyond 2025 and 2026."

And then secondly, in Wealth and Private Banking, the RoTE. I appreciate the guidance is greater than 25%, which includes some scope for a bigger than that, but the step down from where you are today to that number is relatively large. Is there something in there for the fact that you're still having to invest in that business in 2026, and therefore, post 2026, you'd expect a step-up?

    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome to Barclays Q1 2024 Results Analyst and Investor Conference Call. I will now hand over to C.S. Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive, before I hand over to Anna Cross, Group Finance Director.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's results call for the first quarter of 2024. At our investor update a little over nine weeks ago, we set out a three-year plan to deliver a better run, more strongly performing and higher returning Barclays. To do so, we aim to make Barclays a simpler, better and more balanced bank. We are executing in a disciplined way against this plan and this is our first progress report against our longer journey. I am happy with our overall Q1 performance, which keeps pace with our financial targets for 2024 to 2026. These are: first, grow returns with a target RoTE of about 12% in 2026; second, to rebalance the bank with a target to reduce RWAs in the Investment Bank from 58% of group RWAs to around 50% in 2026; and third, to distribute more capital to shareholders with a target of returning at least \u00a310 billion over 2024 to 2026. We also set a target for return on tangible equity above 10% in 2024. And in the first quarter, we delivered 12.3%, in line with our plan. Total income for the quarter was \u00a37 billion, of which group net interest income, excluding the Investment Bank and head office was \u00a32.7 billion. Our cost-to-income ratio was 60%, demonstrating ongoing cost discipline as we see the benefit of the cost actions which we took in the fourth quarter of last year coming through. We achieved around \u00a3200 million of gross cost efficiency savings in Q1 out of our targeted \u00a31 billion for the full-year 2024. We remain well capitalized. Our CET1 ratio was 13.5%, which is at the midpoint of our target range. And we have completed about 35% of the \u00a31 billion share buyback which we announced at full-year 2023. Across the bank, and within each of our five divisions, we are driving an improved operational and financial performance to enhance returns, which Anna will cover in more detail shortly. Our business re-segmentation and the framework of targets which we laid out on the 20th of February, have helped to provide both internal and external transparency as well as accountability in our delivery. As Anna and I talked to our colleagues across Barclays, we are encouraged by how the organization has embraced this plan. In February, we described a three-year plan of measured ambition and disciplined execution. As part of this, we have set up a transformation office, which is responsible for monitoring our delivery across all aspects of the plan. One important aspect was proceeding with a non-strategic business disposal that we announced at our investor update. We have announced the sale of our performing Italian mortgage portfolio, and we remain in advanced discussions on the sale of our German consumer business. Turning to the financial side. Overall, we are where we expected to be at this stage. You can see on this slide the returns on tangible equity for each of our divisions and for the group for the quarter alongside our 2026 targets. These are the most important metrics for me and the Executive Committee team and Anna will take you through each of them shortly after I cover a few points on divisional execution. In the Investment Bank, we are continuing our journey to improve returns. RoTE for the quarter was 12%, broadly in line with the group. As with any quarter, there were some areas of strength, some areas of potential improvement and others where we should do better. We said in February that we will hold ourselves to account in a detailed and transparent way on a group basis and by division. In Global Markets, we did not capture market opportunities to the same extent as some of our competitors did. For example, FICC was not as strong as we would have liked, and we will have more to do on European rates, one of the three focused areas which we identified in February. On the other hand, we are starting to monetize investments made in the other identified focus areas, securitized products and equity derivatives. I'm pleased about this, and Anna will talk to you about this in more detail. In Investment Banking, DCM delivered an improved performance in the quarter, and we have the potential to do better. As we said at the investor update, we are focused on improving our performance in ECM and advisory, but there is naturally a longer pathway to success in these businesses. As an example of our progress in advisory, our recently established energy transition group has announced nine transactions since late December, showcasing our active advisory role in one of our focus sectors. In Barclays U.K., we expect our recently announced acquisition of Tesco Bank to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. Our strategic partnership with the U.K.'s largest retailer will help accelerate our planned growth in unsecured lending in our home market. This is an important step in our plan to deploy an additional \u00a330 billion of RWAs into our higher returning U.K. businesses: Barclays U.K., the U.K. Corporate Bank and the Private Banking and Wealth Management division. Over the medium term, this will rebalance RWAs between our businesses and support more consistent and higher return for our shareholders. One divisional number that stands out on this slide is 5.3% RoTE in our U.S. Consumer Bank. Although this has progressed from last year's 4.1% RoTE, we recognize we have a lot more to do in order to deliver returns in line with our overall group target of above 12% in 2026. And we have a detailed plan to do so as we set out in February. There was a notable point of execution in this quarter in this division. We announced the sale of $1.1 billion of credit card receivables to Blackstone as we manage capital in the business and strive to improve returns. Our U.K. Corporate Bank delivered a RoTE of 15.2%. We look forward to telling you more about this business in a deep dive scheduled for the 18th of June. I will now hand over to Anna to take you through the first quarter financials in more detail.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 6, we have laid out the Q1 financial highlights for Barclays and you'll see the same throughout the presentation for each business. I won't go through these slides, but have included them for ease of reference. Starting on Slide 7. The headline message is that Q1 was in line with the plan we laid out at the investor update in February. We delivered a RoTE of 12.3% and earnings per share of 10.3 pence in Q1. There were a number of items driving the year-on-year RoTE move. Income and returns were lower in the Investment Bank compared to a strong prior year Q1 comparator. Operating costs, which excludes bank levy and litigation and conduct, were down 3% reflecting ongoing strong cost discipline as well as efficiency savings, including some benefits from the structural cost actions taken in Q4 2023. Total costs were up 2% year-on-year at \u00a34.2 billion, which included \u00a3120 million charge in Q1 '24 from the revised Bank of England levy scheme. We expect this to be partially offset by increased income over the course of the year, resulting in a net annualized reduction in PBC of circa \u00a350 million for 2024. Impairment was broadly flat year-on-year. And finally, TNAV per share increased 34 pence year-on-year to 335 pence including the effect of a less negative cash flow hedge reserve driven by the rate environment as expected. Overall, we continue to target our statutory RoTE of above 10% in 2024. At our investor update in February, we emphasized the quality and stability of our income. The more stable revenues we generate from retail, corporate and financing in the Investment Bank provides balance to our income profile. I will talk about the individual business drivers shortly. Together, these contributed 68% of Group income in Q1, and are expected to continue to grow above 70% by 2026. Total income was down 4% year-on-year at \u00a37 billion and group net interest income, excluding the IB and head office, was \u00a32.7 billion, as you can see on Slide 9. NII was broadly stable year-on-year. Even though, the balance sheet composition and rate outlook are very different between those two points in time. Our long-term structural hedge tailwinds offset the pressure on NII from deposit movements and mortgage margins, as well as rate headwinds going forward. We still expect Group NII, ex Investment Bank and Head Office, of circa \u00a310.7 billion for the full-year and Barclays U.K. NII of circa \u00a36.1 billion, excluding Tesco Bank, which we now expect to complete in Q4 2024. Deposit balances were impacted by seasonal reductions in Q1, in part due to tax payments. We expect underlying deposit trends to continue to slow after Q1 and loans to stabilize in the second half. We expect the benefit from the structural hedge, which you can see on Slide 10, to largely offset these product dynamics, resulting in broadly stable NII. As a reminder, the structural hedge is designed to reduce volatility in NII and manage interest rate risk. As rates have risen, the hedge has dampened the growth in our NII, and in a falling rate environment we will see the benefit from the protection that it gives us. We have around \u00a3170 billion of hedges maturing between 2024 and 2026 at an average yield of 1.5%, significantly lower than current swap rates. The expected NII tailwind is significant and predictable. \u00a39.3 billion of aggregate income is now locked in over the three years to the end of 2026, up from \u00a38.6 billion at the year end. As we said in February, reinvesting around three quarters of the \u00a3170 billion at around 3.5% would compound over the next three years, to increase structural hedge income in 2026 by circa \u00a32 billion versus 2023. Turning now to costs on Slide 11. Total costs were up 2% at \u00a34.2 billion, including the \u00a3120 million charge from the revised Bank of England Levy scheme. Operating costs were down 3% year-on-year. Our cost to income ratio was 60%, and despite the levy, we still expect it to be circa 63% for 2024. We expect a total of \u00a31 billion of efficiency savings for full-year 2024; half of which will be driven by the structural cost actions we took in 2023, and half by prior and ongoing efficiency investments. We have achieved \u00a30.2 billion of this in Q1. These efficiencies have enabled us to offset inflation, regulatory and control spend and created capacity for investments. Turning now to impairment on Slide 12. The loan loss rate of 51 basis points for the quarter was within our through the cycle guidance of 50 to 60, and the impairment charge was broadly flat year-on-year at \u00a3513 million. The Barclays U.K. charge was \u00a358 million, equating to an 11 basis points loan loss rate. Starting from this low and stable base, we expect to track towards circa 35 basis points over time, as we complete the Tesco Bank acquisition and grow the balance sheet, as outlined at our Investor Update. The charge of \u00a3410 million in the U.S. Consumer Bank increased year-on-year, whilst the loan loss rate was 610 basis points, a slight decrease on the Q4 level. Slide 13 shows that our actual loss experience in the U.S. Consumer Bank remains low, although we have seen a sequential quarterly increase in write-offs, as delinquency rates have increased in line with the industry. As we said before, we expect write-offs to increase during the remainder of this year, which is why we have been building reserves. We expect the U.S. Consumer Bank impairment charge to remain elevated through the first half of 2024 and to improve in the second half, resulting in a lower full-year charge this year. And we continue to guide to loan loss rate trending down towards the long-term average of circa 400 basis points. Turning now to the businesses. As I mentioned, you can see Barclays U.K. financial highlights and targets on Slide 14, but I will talk to Slide 15. RoTE was 18.5% and total income was \u00a31.8 billion, down \u00a3135 million year-on-year, driven by the product dynamics in deposits and mortgages, lower cards income and the transfer of U.K. Wealth in Q2 2023. NII of \u00a31.5 billion was broadly stable on Q4 and we continue to target circa \u00a36.1 billion of NII for Barclays U.K. in 2024, supported by the strength of the structural hedge tailwind. The NII target excludes Tesco Bank, which we expect to contribute circa \u00a3400 million of additional annualized NII, following Q4 2024 completion. Non-NII was \u00a3277 million in the quarter, following the non-repeat of one-offs in Q4 last year. We expect a run rate greater than \u00a3250 million per quarter going forward, as we guided in Q4. Total costs were \u00a31.1 billion, down 3% due to efficiency savings, and the transfer of U.K. Wealth in Q2 last year, partially offset by an increase of \u00a354 million from the revised Bank of England levy scheme. Cost to income ratio was 58%. Moving onto the Barclays U.K. customer balance sheet on Slide 16. Normal Q1 seasonality was a contributor to the \u00a33.9 billion deposit reduction from Q4 to \u00a3237 billion. Underlying deposit trends were as expected and broadly consistent with Q4. Deposit migration has continued to slow and pricing in the savings market has stabilized. On the lending side, lead indicators such as mortgage applications and card acquisition volumes, are largely positive, but will take time to flow into the balance sheet. Gross mortgage lending remained in line with 2023 trends, with balances of \u00a3163 billion. However, we grew our flow share in High Loan to Value mortgages, as per our stated ambition. U.K. Cards balances were stable at circa \u00a310 billion. Acquisition volumes are strong and consumer spending was in line with expectations, whilst repayment rates remained high. Moving onto the financial highlights for the U.K. Corporate Bank on Slide 17. This is new divisional disclosure since our re-segmentation, so the numbers may be less familiar. As a reminder, our U.K. Corporate Bank serves mid-sized U.K. corporate clients and has relationships with around 25% of the U.K. market, and includes our corporate card issuing business. As you can see on Slide 18, the U.K. Corporate Bank RoTE was 15.2%. Income was down 6% year-on-year at \u00a3434 million, primarily due to the interest rate and inflationary environment driving lower returns from the liquidity pool. Total costs increased by 20%, reflecting investment spend to support growth and the impact of the revised Bank of England levy scheme, which alone reduced RoTE by around 3 percentage points. Turning now to Private Banking and Wealth Management, which is another one of our newly re-segmented divisions, created following the combination of our Private Bank and U.K. Wealth businesses in Q2 last year. This is a high returning business with opportunities for growth going forward. Moving to Slide 20. RoTE was 28.7%, supported by growth in client assets and liabilities. Although we have not restated the historical financials prior to the U.K. Wealth transfer in Q2 last year, we have called out the RoTE impact of circa 3.4%. Income increased by around \u00a350 million year-on-year, driven by \u00a348 billion of balance growth, both from the U.K. Wealth transfer and an underlying \u00a319 billion increase, consistent with strong equity market levels. This was partially offset by continued, although slowing deposit migration. Costs increased year-on-year, mostly as a result of the transfer, but also due to ongoing investments in growing the business. Turning now to the Investment Bank on Slide 22. The Investment Bank delivered Q1 RoTE of 12%. Total income of \u00a33.3 billion was down 7% versus a strong year-on-year comparator. Total costs were down 2%, driven by non-repeat of last year's European levy, lower performance related costs, and included this quarter's Bank of England levy charge of \u00a333 million, resulting in a CIR of 60%. RWAs were up \u00a33 billion on Q4, reflecting normal seasonality. RWA productivity, measured by income over average RWAs, was 6.5%. The plan remains to improve Investment Bank RWA productivity, whilst keeping RWAs in the division broadly flat, as we set out in the investor update. Now looking at the specific income drivers for each business line in more detail on Slide 23. When we think about this business versus our peers, we use a U.S. dollar comparator, so that\u2019s what I will talk to here. Markets income was down 5% year-on-year. Within this, equities was up 30% and FICC was down 19%, with both comparisons impacted by specific items. Equities included a non-recurring gain on Visa B shares of \u00a3125 million and was up 11% excluding this with good performance in cash, prime and equity derivatives, one of our focus businesses from the investor update. FICC performance in Q1 last year included inflation-linked gains which we called out at the time, with income down 14% excluding this, driven by industry-wide lower activity in macro. We can do better here. We have work to do to regain market share in European rates, another of our focus businesses. Conversely, the market for Securitized Products, our third focus business, has been favorable and given the investments made, we have been able to monetize this more than we would have done in the past. Excluding the inflation-linked gains last year, financing income across FICC and equities remained around \u00a3700 million, providing the more stable income stream to markets that we have focused on. Investment Banking fee income was up 6% year-on-year in dollar terms. DCM delivered improved performance across both investment grade and leverage finance, and ECM also showed encouraging signs of recovery. Advisory income was lower against a strong comparator, but we have a healthy pipeline of announced deals, which will add to revenue on completion. As with the U.K. Corporate Bank, International Corporate Bank income was impacted year-on-year by the changing rate and inflationary environment on deposits and liquidity pool returns. Turning now to the U.S. Consumer Bank on Slide 25. The U.S. Consumer Bank generated RoTE of 5.3%, reflecting higher impairment versus the prior year, which more than offset higher income and lower costs. Income growth of 4% included an increase in NII on higher cards balances year-on-year. Total costs were down by 9%, reflecting efficiency savings and lower marketing spend, driving a cost to income ratio of 46%. End net receivables reduced in line with normal seasonal trends in Q1 versus Q4, and also included the sale of $1.1 billion of own-brand credit card receivables to Blackstone, ending the quarter at just over $30 billion. As a reminder, this transaction reduced RWAs through the derecognition of these receivables, which we continue to service for a fee. The late fees legislation once it comes into effect later this year will be a headwind to fee income, but we expect to mitigate this through actions to drive higher NII, including from revised pricing, although there will be a lag while these actions are introduced. We are looking to increase the proportion of core deposits in our funding mix in this business to around 75% by 2026. At 67%, the mix was broadly unchanged on last year, but up sequentially from year-end levels. Turning now to the Head Office on Slide 26. Head Office income was up 22% year-on-year at \u00a3194 million, driven by a gain on disposal of a legacy investment and increased German cards income, partially offset by lower payments income, hedge accounting and treasury items. The sale of our performing Italian retail mortgage book is expected to complete in Q2, generating a pre-tax loss of circa \u00a3225 million whilst reducing RWAs by circa \u00a30.8 billion. The transaction will have a negative 2024 RoTE impact of circa 45 basis points, but is broadly neutral to capital. We are also in discussions with respect to the disposals of the remaining non-performing and Swiss-Franc linked portfolios. We expect these disposals to generate a small pre-tax loss, but again be broadly neutral to capital. Turning now to the balance sheet, starting with capital on Slide 27. The CET1 ratio was 13.5% at the end of Q1, where we expected it to be, in the middle of our target range and down 30 basis points on year-end. This reflected seasonally higher capital usage in Q1 and the ongoing \u00a31 billion full-year 2023 buyback that comes off the CET1 ratio post year-end. Our capital distribution plans remain unchanged: to return at least \u00a310 billion of capital to shareholders between 2024 and 2026, with this year's total broadly in line with the 2023 level of \u00a33 billion. Moving onto Risk Weighted Assets on Slide 28. RWAs increased by around \u00a37 billion in line with our expectations, driven by normal seasonal trends versus Q4 in the Investment Bank. There were also some regulatory model changes in Barclays U.K., which we expect to be partially offset over the course of this year. Our guidance remains for regulatory driven RWA inflation to be at the lower end of 5% to 10% of December 2023 Group RWAs, as we reiterated in February. As I noted earlier, TNAV per share grew to 335 pence, up 34 pence year-on-year, driven by attributable profit and the reduced cash flow hedge reserve drag on shareholders' equity. Additionally, share repurchases reduced our share count by 4% over the same timeframe, driving TNAV accretion of 7 pence per share. I won't dwell on this slide, but we continue to maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet, with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. In summary, we are focused on disciplined execution. This quarter is the first step in delivering the targets we laid out in February and which we are reiterating today. Thank you for listening. Moving now to Q&A. And as usual, please could you stick to a maximum of two questions, so we can get around to everyone in good time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Joseph Dickerson from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Joseph. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Dickerson: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just had a question on the -- a couple of questions on the U.K. business, and then the U.S. business. Just in terms of the U.K. balance sheet versus the NII performance, and I note that the NIM, which I'm glad we're not talking about as much anymore, was up 2 bps. And it looks like separately, the current account mix shift is starting to settle now with \u00a359 billion of current account balances versus \u00a360 billion last quarter. So do you think that we have kind of arrested the mix away from current accounts? I mean, clearly, the Bank of England data shows some flow into noninterest-bearing accounts, at least for the first two months of the year. So just wondering what the outlook there is because it seems like that you can easily deliver on your target for this year on the NII guide there. So any comment around those moving parts would be helpful. And then in the U.S., I guess how do we get the trajectory on the credit loss number? I mean, how should we think about that from the 610 basis points in Q1 to 400 basis points by 2026, given that, I suppose, unemployment could deteriorate in the U.S. or what have you. But clearly, part of the mix is also going to be coming from the GAAP portfolio. So I'm just wondering what's the confidence in the moving parts to go from 610 to around to circa 400 basis points. And on the U.S., could you also just confirm that the fee -- late fee matter is embedded already reflected within the guidance that you've given for that unit at the update in February? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thanks for the questions. I think just on the U.K. question, I think it's worth just reflecting on Slide 16, where we've shown you the balance sheet progression as a deposit matter. And I think you're right, we are seeing some stabilization in underlying deposits. And the way I read that is partly through the current account movement, but it's also -- whilst you continue to see some movement towards time deposits, that rate of change is definitely sold down. And what we see in Q1 is a mixture of those deposit trends continuing, but at a slower pace and what I would describe as normal seasonality. So in Q1, people pay the tax bills they also sort of pay off credit card bills, et cetera. And you also see that a little bit in business banking. So I think it's as we expected to see. From here on in, I think now in Q2 and beyond, you get almost beyond the [indiscernible], which can cause a bit of noise in the U.K. I think we'd expect those deposit trends to continue. So that's how I'd characterize those changes in the U.K. As far as the U.S. is concerned, I think worth looking at Page 13, which is a replication of the slide that we gave you at the year-end. And what that shows is we expected write-off to increase in the U.S. because delinquencies had been rising through last year, in line with the industry, and as the standard required us to re-reserve in advance. So what you see in Q1 is really a switch around in the balance between reserving actual write-offs, so write-offs have gone up, and reserving is now starting to settle back down. So for 2024 we expect higher impairment charges in the first half, lower in the second half and for the year as a whole to be lower than 2023. And in terms of the longer term trends in this business, I mean you're right in terms of one of our objectives is to have a higher proportion of retail. But actually, our GAAP portfolio is very high quality. And the FICO balance that we've got in the book now is no different to what it was pre-GAAP. And as we grow that retail proportion in time, what we also see is a roll-off of the legacy slightly lower FICO portfolio such that the mix remains broadly similar to what it is today. So that's why we're guiding to this longer-term position of 400, and that's what gives us confidence. And just to confirm on your final piece, yes, we did include late fees. The late fee matter in our RoTE projections. We'd expect those to come in -- I mean, obviously, planning for May. They may be slightly later than that. We have offsets to come in the plan, but they slightly lag the imposition of the legislation. So you'll see a bit of a gap there, but that's what we expected.\nJoseph Dickerson: Thanks, Anna.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Joe. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Benjamin Toms from RBC. Please go ahead, Benjamin. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Toms: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The first is on the Investment Bank, please. You noted this morning there's more to do in European rates within the IB. Can you just give us some more color on what's left to do there? Is that investments in people or infrastructure or both? And when do you think we'll start seeing some progress for that product line? And then secondly, your -- sorry, NIM was up in the quarter by 2 basis points, but NII was slightly down by about 2%. Could you give us some guidance whether you think that we've now seen a trough in your NII? Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes, thanks. So let me begin and then Anna will take up the NII point. So in European rates, it's people and a little bit of dealing with intensifying of the client penetration. So I would expect -- so hiring people. We've already got today a very strong presence in the primary markets in Europe, in DCM and especially with government bond trading. And what we are doing is supplementing the skills that we have on the trading desk. And I would expect, not in months, but in quarters, to start seeing some of the improvement. Of course, it's a function of market environment as well but it's mostly an investment to people.\nAnna Cross: Thanks, Ben. On your second question, I think it's worth looking at the new disclosure that we've given you around the NII movement in the U.K., which is on the bottom right of Page 15. And what we're seeing here in the quarter is more stability in margin than we saw throughout 2023. And you can see there that there's still some product margin dilution, which is coming from mortgages and it's also coming from those deposit changes, but largely offset by that continued strength in the structural hedge. And what's really going on here is balance sheet movement. So the reduction in deposits that I talked about before, also just more of a broader market-wide movement in terms of reduction in mortgage balances, so we continue to guide to 6.1 -- or circa \u00a36.1 billion for the full-year. Still confident in that guidance. And I'd just reflect perhaps on the NII across the group more broadly, which was stable year-on-year. And we do think, not taking into account -- not just the U.K., but the corporate bank, Private Banking and Wealth as well and indeed, our U.S. Cards business. So we're pleased with that, as a result. And that's a good position from which we can grow. The only other thing I would call out is, of course, that circa \u00a36.1 billion is ex-Tesco, and we now expect Tesco to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. Okay, thank you, Ben. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAlvaro Serrano: Good morning. A couple of questions. One on the IB and another one -- a follow-up on provisions in the U.S. On the IB, there's a few moving parts that you've called out. But I also note your U.S. competitors, they've been -- there's been a bit of a mix sort of messages on the pipeline. So I just wanted to pick your thoughts on the seasonality you see during this year considering the one-offs we've seen in the quarter, what seasonality could we expect in markets? And also in DCM, maybe the number is obviously up, but according to Dealogic and other NPAs, it could have been up more. Or do -- how do you see the pipeline there? Because, as I said, some of your peers were a bit more cautious. And on the U.S. cards, noted your comments, Anna, around the reserve build. But in your modeling, you obviously -- the 400 basis points -- to trend towards 400 basis points. Based on that, when would you expect the delinquencies to peak? Because conscious that typically, the seasonality provisions is the provisions tend to be higher in the second half. So just looking for data points that we could look out for to confirm that 400 basis points in particular, the peak and delinquencies? Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: It's Venkat. So let me begin on the first one on the IB. So on seasonality, I think in markets with one provider, which I'll say in a second, you should expect the normal seasonality that you see, which is a little quieter in the summer and then picking up in the fourth quarter. And so far, the second quarter is behaving like second quarters, generally do in seasonality sensors. The thought on DCM and the proviso I will make on overall fixed income markets is there is an assumption there about when volatility comes. And obviously, that's very, very hard to predict. We've seen, since the 1st of November, a round trip of about 90 basis points in 10-year gilts and approximately the same, slightly less than 10-year treasury. And so the question really is based on rate expectations, do they stabilize at this level or there's further opportunity, I don't know the answer. And -- but in part, that answer affects the next question, which is on DCM. And I think there are two parts to this. One is, obviously, rates are much higher than people might have thought six months ago. But at the same time, or at the same -- three months ago. At the same time, spreads are much tighter. And so I think the tightness of spreads is going to be one important factor in the thinking of issuers on actually what they bring out to the market. So I'm expecting that you will continue to see people tempted by the lower spreads.\nAnna Cross: Okay, Alvaro, I'll take the second question. So in terms of modeling, what we expect is for U.S. unemployment to go up from its current position. And you can see that in our IFRS 9 assumptions. What that would tell us is that we should continue to see some increase in delinquency. That said, a couple of things, our expectations of that peak of unemployment have actually come down quarter-on-quarter. So we've seen an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, we believe for the U.S. And actually, that economy remains robust. So whilst we expect to see a continuation of delinquency, we are content that we have very robust coverage. You'll see that our coverage is now over 11% on an IFRS 9 basis. It's 8.5% on a CECL basis, so we're well covered. Where we had concerns, probably, at the lower end of the FICO scores, we've taken action on credit lines. So we feel like we're preparing well both in terms of provisioning and indeed, our credit actions, if you like. But it is progressing as we expected to and given the IFRS 9 forecast we have for unemployment. Thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRohith Chandra-Rajan: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I had a couple on revenues, please. The first one's just coming to the Investment Bank, where revenue performance is well below peers even after adjusting for the one-offs that you flagged, and that's particularly the case for FICC and fees and even equities is off quite a low Q1 2023 base. So thanks very much for the color that you've given us in terms of kind of the product narrative. I was just wondering, because you target a lot of market share gain and quite a lot of improvement in return on risk-weighted assets, I'm just wondering when we should think about that from a timing perspective? Is that a similar sort of time frame to what Venkat was talking about in terms of the euro rate benefits coming through. So thinking about seeing those market share and RWA benefits over the coming quarters, is that realistic for the IB as a whole? And then the second one is just back on Barclays U.K. actually. Anna talked about mortgage flows being in line with 2022. I just wanted to clarify what you were talk about there. Is that sort of gross lending? Or is it approval because I think approvals particularly are up year-on-year significantly. Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thanks, Rohith. I'll take both of those questions, and I'll start the first, Venkat might wish to add. So you're right. There are two particular quirks, if you like, in both equities and our FICC numbers. In equities, there's a one-off in the current quarter, which we've called out, actually, excluding that, but business is up 11% in dollar terms, which we actually believe compares very favorably to our U.S. peers and demonstrates that we're making progress, and we called our cash, and we all called out prime, and we called equity derivatives, which of course, is one of our vacant areas. FICC, on the other hand, you might recall this time last year, we were talking about some inflation-specific income in there, that does color the comparisons a little bit. But even after we split that out, it's down 14% in dollar terms, which we don't believe lines up too favorably against our U.S. peers. There's a few things going on in there. We are pleased with the progress in securitized products. And in previous quarters, we would have said we're small in that business, we still are. But we've been able to monetize it much more effectively because of the investments that we've put in. And then across banking, I mean Venkat's covered that, but it feels like quarter-on-quarter progress. When we stand back from it all, this is one quarter in a 12-quarter plan. And we do believe that we have the right plans to grow this business, but we're not going to see the results after one quarter. So I won't give you a time frame, but hopefully, we'll be able to show you regularly how we are making progress. That's one of the reasons why we set up the reporting that we have so that we're not seeing a huge change in that revenue over RWA number yet, but it's important to us, and therefore, we're just showing you that. And on BUK, you're right to call me out on this. So let me be very specific. I was talking about gross flows. Apps are up 22% for the market in the first quarter. And interestingly, what we're seeing is the purchase market coming back in the U.K., which is really good after '23 being very much remortgage dominated. So that's really good. We think that helps for us, although it will take time for that to flow into the balance sheet. One thing I would call out is we feel like we've taken share in higher loan-to-value mortgages, which again, was one of the areas we were seeking to do. But just to be really clear, this is going to take time to flow into the balance sheet. But thank you for the question. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from [indiscernible] from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, thanks very much. And good morning everybody. Can I just ask you about capital? And firstly, could you just update us if there is any update on the U.S. cards business. I think it's Q3. I think we had \u00a316 billion. I'm not sure if that was my number or your number, but additional risk-weighted assets which I guess if you put on a pro forma now, that takes you really down to \u00a313 billion or a little bit below. So I guess the first question is, is that still the right sort of number? And then the second question is, I sort of thought that the German consumer disposal would sort of pay for some of that, if that makes sense. And therefore, you still have plenty of capital in the second half. But it sounds like that's not going to be so likely now. So am I right about that? Should we really be thinking that Q3 is going to be sort of low point for capital really? And how should we think about that in terms of capital in the second half? Thanks very much.\nAnna Cross: Thanks, Ed. There's a lot in that, but let me try and keep up. So no change to our guidance around the U.S. card regulatory model changes. So still expecting 16. Still expecting that in the third quarter. So in terms of the numbers that you read out, I understand -- so I understand the math behind it and the pro forma. The thing I would say is there are obviously a lot of moving parts here. There's the organic generation of capital, which you can see in the first quarter has been strong. There's some seasonality in RWAs, which will obviously move as the year goes on. And typically, we would expect Q1 to be in the middle of the range, or maybe even slightly below the middle of our range because of that. You've then got inorganic actions. And I'm not going to comment on the specific timing of the German card disposal, but I would say it continues to progress. And then you've got business mitigants. So I'd call out the Blackstone transaction, and you can imagine that we continue to work hard on RWA efficiency across the group more broadly. So in terms of sort of capital generation and distribution, our plans remain as they were on the 20th of February in terms of both the priority, clarity, first, reg; second shareholder distribution; third investment in the business, and we are still planning to distribute greater than \u00a310 billion across '24 to '26, and we're still expecting to deliver broadly what we did last year, so around \u00a33 billion in the current year. So capital-wise, we're on track to where we expect it to be.\nUnidentified Analyst: Oaky, that's great. Thanks.\nAnna Cross: Okay, thank you, Ed. Can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Guy Stebbings from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead sir. Your line is now open.\nGuy Stebbings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. One on Box U.K. and then one on U.S. cards. Yes, thanks for the new disclosure on Slide 15 on the NII bridge as it were. Just looking forward, some of dynamics look quite encouraging, but still the guidance implies a slight headwind versus the Q1 run rate on NII. So I guess I would have thought the hedge and the product margin dynamics are pretty neutral from sort of Q2, perhaps even slight benefit beyond that as we think about the hedge benefit and support from higher LTV lending perhaps outweighing some of the headwinds. So I'm just trying to understand what is the headwind from it? Is the deposit volume component still being a drag even post the season effects that you called out in Q1? And then on U.S. Cards, you highlighted the increase in core deposits percentage balance. I just wondered how much of that is a sort of dollar increase or how much has that been impacted by the fall in lending balances and perhaps a reduction in other funding? And sort of how are you going to grow the growth -- drive that growth in core deposits as we look forward? Is it really about the changes in providing deposit proposition the same at or some of the lending? Or is it pricing? If I can just squeeze in a follow-up on U.S. cards. You talked about mitigating the late payment fees. I just wondered how much of what's embedded in the plan is sort of the market reacting to that versus what's more in your control? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thank you, Guy. So just reflecting back on Slide 15. I mean I'd just reiterate what I said before, that really '24, we see about a bit more stabilization in the margin because of the factors you call out and the strength of that hedge. And then also, you've got continued deposit migration. So even though it's slowing down, we still expect it to be there. And in terms of the mortgage market, while we're seeing encouraging signs in terms of the market, it is going to take a while for that to start flowing into the balance sheet. So you see a balance sheet that contracts before it starts to expand, and that's really what underpins our circa \u00a36.1 billion. So it's playing out in the first quarter sort of as we expected it might. In terms of your question 2a on dollar deposits, it is exactly what you say. So we're expecting really, this is a product led and actually, the way we go to market with those dollar deposits reaching more directly to consumers. And again, this is the first quarter in a 12-quarter plan. It's going to move around a little bit. And actually, I've been looking for longer-term trends there really, but it's product propositionally driven. And then finally, just in terms of the market on late fees, I think we do see some price changes coming through, which is sort of what we anticipated and we would expect to participate in that which is why I said late fee legislation happens first, the pricing changes will drift through over time. The only other thing I would say is, of course, given the nature of our business, we are able to share the impact of those late fees with some of our partners. So you might expect the impact for us to be slightly less than it would be more market-wide. But overall, we considered all of that and included it in the RoTE sort of pathways and guidance that we gave you on the 20th of February. So no change.\nGuy Stebbings: Okay, thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Guy. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Cant from Autonomous. Please go ahead, Chris. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Cant: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. One very quick one to follow-up on the last question, please. Could you just give us some quantification of the expected annualized impact around the late fee changes for your U.S. consumer business? I think it would be helpful to understand what the sort of initial impact you're expecting there is even if you expect some industry-wide and idiosyncratic mitigations over time. That would be the first question, please. Secondly, on NII, just conscious that you do have this \u00a3120 million Bank of England levy. You're indicating that there's a \u00a370 million offsetting revenues this year, I think, you said \u00a350 million net impact year 1. And I understand that's going to go through the NII line. And when I think about what swap markets have done since your guidance would have been struck at the full-year, I guess it's a bit more supportive, slightly higher average base rate for this year, slightly higher average swap rates than have \u00a370-or-so millions of benefit to come through relative to plan from this Bank of England funding adjustment. Why hasn't the NII guidance being nudged higher? Is that just prudence? Or is there something else going on in there, which is maybe a little bit worse than expected? And I guess related to that, what is your guidance around NII sensitivity to base rate at this point, please? You haven't given us anything in the slides quite some time. And given the relative size of your hedge versus peers and some of the commentary you gave at 2Q results last year, I do wonder actually whether in the very short term base rate not coming down as much as negative or very near-term NII trends? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thanks, Chris. I will take those. So on the first one, we haven't quantified it publicly. However, on the 20th of February, we did include it in the flight path. You can see that it's actually a net negative over the period. So you can see it being a drag on the RoTE, but it is part of that. But I'd just reiterate, I would expect it to be slightly less than other market participants some are calling out just because of the impact from the partners. So in terms of NII more generally, we continue to guide to circa \u00a310.7 billion for the full business excluding the IB and head office and to circa \u00a36.1 billion for BUK. And you're right, there have been some movements in swap markets. But of course, they do move around a great deal. And what we did on the 20th of February was try and underpin our targets with prudent macroeconomic assumptions. Of course, we monitor those very regularly. We consider the impacts on the business, but we're not going to mark-to-market those targets on a quarterly basis. Just mathematically, you're right, we would expect some offsetting income from that Bank of England levy. I think we've called that out, around \u00a375 million. But one quarter end, we're not going to adjust the targets that we've given you. In terms of your specifics around the sensitivity, I would say, given the scale of our hedge, we are and always have been less sensitive to immediate changes in base rates. That remains true. The -- any sort of near-term change in rates is less important to us than just a mechanistic rolling of that hedged quarter in, quarter out. And there's nothing that I would call out as a negative in terms of rates being higher for longer. Of course, you might expect some benefit in liabilities, but there might be some offsetting matters in terms of asset formation, for example. So that's why at this stage, we're really happy with the \u00a36.1 billion and the \u00a310.7 billion. Okay, thank you, Chris. Perhaps, we can go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robin Down from HSBC. Please go ahead, Robin. Your line is now open.\nRobin Down: Good morning. Just two. Just to quickly follow-up on Chris. So just to confirm, the \u00a3300 million reduction in NII within BUK, that was set before the BOE levy kind of changes? I guess you are going to get probably about a \u00a350 million NII benefit within BUK. Just could clear that up. Second question, a much broader question. Obviously, you've got an RoTE target for this year of greater than 10%. I think consensus is currently around 8.8%. And when I look at the numbers, it looks like you need about \u00a31 billion revenue growth based on your 2024 RoTE bridge. And that's just not something at consensus or my own forecast currently have factored in. I think consensus has about \u00a3250 million of income growth. I guess a great disparity there must particularly be in the IB given you've given us fairly precise guidance on things like NII elsewhere. I'm just wondering if there's any kind of anything hardened -- you kind of point to and say, look, I think consensus is just wrong on this number when you look at our models? Any color there, that would be greatly appreciated.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thanks, Robin. So on the first one, our circa \u00a36.1 billion for BUK was struck for the 20th of February, which was before these BOE changes. They just mathematically, that is true. But we are in the first quarter, which is why I'd reiterate, we're happy with our progress thus far. In terms of your RoTE of greater than 10%, the 12.3% that we've delivered in the first quarter is exactly where we thought we would be. So -- and within that, the constituent parts are what I was looking for. So number one, real stability and income, particularly in NII and particularly in our financing businesses. They provide real balance to our income overall, the 63% of income in the quarter, and that's what we're focused on growing because it's a really good base for us to deploy the RWAs into the U.K. and to focus on those areas within the IB. The second thing I was looking for was delivery of cost and efficiency. We said \u00a31 billion for the full-year. We've delivered \u00a3200 million of that in the first quarter. So we're on track there. Third thing was continued good credit conditions. And again, we've seen that. So good credit performance at 51 basis points, really at the bottom end of our sort of through-the-cycle range, which again gives us a good base to grow from. And then finally, the capital position. So there's nothing different in our performance versus we expected when we spoke to you on the 12th -- on the 20th of February. However, there probably are some changes in shape relative to last year. So last year, we had an income -- sorry, we had an impairment profile that was very back-end loaded. This year, it's pulled forward, driven very much by the U.S. positioning. The second thing is we did see quite a sharp change in NII -- sorry, in NIM last year, driven by the deposit mechanics that really started to kick in, in the second and the third quarter. The third thing is we did see a drop-off last year driven by the cash flow hedge reserve and the way that was impacting the tangible equity of the group. And then finally, I'd also call out, in the current quarter, that Bank of England levy has a 70 basis points impact. Now we expect that to be not quite neutral, but nearly neutral over the year as a whole. So that is depressing the first quarter RoTE. Now of course, last year also, after a strong first quarter, we saw a dramatic force in IBCs in particular, to a decade low year for the whole market. And we're seeing more positive signs this year. So I think it's quite a nuanced question. But overall, we still believe that we can hit greater than 10% for the year, and we're exactly where we thought we'd be at this point.\nRobin Down: Great, thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thanks, Robin. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jonathan Pierce from Numis. Please go ahead, Jonathan. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Pierce: Good morning guys. A couple of questions. Back on the hedge and then a broader question [indiscernible]. On the hedge, I think you probably pushed on about a quarter of this hedge now since medium-term rates moved above 3%, yet the yield on it is still only 1.8%. And it sort of implies that the rest of the hedge, despite all the hedges earning closer to 1%. So I'm just trying to square that with a 1.5% maturity guidance -- yield guidance that you've given over the next few years. Is that just a prudent number you've thrown out there and actually the maturity yield on the hedges over the next few years is closer to 1% rather than 1.5%? Or is there actually a very decent tailwind expected into 2027 and '28 as well? The second question is not entirely unconnected. When I look at 2026 consensus RoTE, NII rebase for \u00a330 billion revenue number rather than where consensus is in the mid-28s you're getting to your target. So I assume on that basis, you recognize the consensus TNAV numbers out end of '25 and into 2026. And then there's a -- sorry, final question on this, maybe to the Venkat. The LTIP targets, incredibly commendable, but you don't get paid out in full unless you hit the 14% RoTE in 2026. But I'm just wondering what's your thinking there? It looks extremely aggressive, given consensus doesn't even believe you'll make the 12%. So why did you put a 14% RoTE target into that latest delta? Thank you so much.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Jonathan, thanks for the question. I think there are three. So let me deal with the first two, and then I'll pass the third one to Venkat. So on the hedge, no, it wasn't prudent. It's the actual number. So we do expect the average maturing yield to be 1.5%. We do expect \u00a3170 billion to roll '24 to '26, inclusive. We haven't talked about the tailwinds, '27 and '28. We talked about the tailwind for '26 which we said, given the assumption that we gave you or the indicative number rather that we gave you of 3.5% swap rate, that would add \u00a32 billion or around \u00a32 billion of income by 2026 relative to '23. And you can see the progress that we've made in the quarter. So for 2024 alone, when we were at the year-end, we locked in \u00a33.8 billion. Now we've locked in \u00a34 billion. And that compares to a total gross hedge income of \u00a33.6 billion last year. So there is a very powerful tailwind that comes from this hedge. To your second question, we do -- I won't specifically comment on the consensus numbers that far out, but we do expect an increase in the tailwind -- sorry, an increase in TNAV. We're seeing it grow as we expected, both because of the mechanics of the cash flow hedge reserve. And you might recall, we called that out specifically on the 20th of February. It was one of the moving parts as a headwind to RoTE, both in 2024 and beyond into 2026. So it's being driven by just the mechanics of the cash flow hedge reserve. It's being driven by AP accretion. And of course, it's being driven by the reduced share count over time. And that's really why we're seeing it move forward. And clearly, as a management team, we're most focused on the loss of those two, just noting that the cash flow hedge reserve can move around quite a bit. So it's AP accretion and really that buyback value creation that we're focused on. And Venkat?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes. I mean I would just say, and to pick up on that point on TNAV, this is a very important fundamental improvement in the bank when you just see the TNAV go up. And as Anna said, we emphasize the second two parts, which is AP accretion and share count. Coming back to the LTIP. Well, first of all, it should be clear, the LTIP targets and the composition and levels of compensation for both Anna and me are set by the Board. And normally, there is in the LTIP, it's aligned to, obviously, these financial targets, but there's always a little bit of stretch in them so that -- sort of incentivization of management. And that's all there is to it. So I think with that -- questions are over, if I may, I'd just like to say thank you very much for your time. As Anna and I have emphasized throughout, we are on track with the three-year plan which we laid out in February 2024. We both, Anna and I, look forward to seeing many of you on the road and on the 18th of June for our business deep dive with the U.K. Corporate Bank. So thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining. This concludes today's call.",

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's results call for the first quarter of 2024. At our investor update a little over nine weeks ago, we set out a three-year plan to deliver a better run, more strongly performing and higher returning Barclays. To do so, we aim to make Barclays a simpler, better and more balanced bank. We are executing in a disciplined way against this plan and this is our first progress report against our longer journey. I am happy with our overall Q1 performance, which keeps pace with our financial targets for 2024 to 2026. These are: first, grow returns with a target RoTE of about 12% in 2026; second, to rebalance the bank with a target to reduce RWAs in the Investment Bank from 58% of group RWAs to around 50% in 2026; and third, to distribute more capital to shareholders with a target of returning at least \u00a310 billion over 2024 to 2026. We also set a target for return on tangible equity above 10% in 2024. And in the first quarter, we delivered 12.3%, in line with our plan. Total income for the quarter was \u00a37 billion, of which group net interest income, excluding the Investment Bank and head office was \u00a32.7 billion. Our cost-to-income ratio was 60%, demonstrating ongoing cost discipline as we see the benefit of the cost actions which we took in the fourth quarter of last year coming through. We achieved around \u00a3200 million of gross cost efficiency savings in Q1 out of our targeted \u00a31 billion for the full-year 2024. We remain well capitalized. Our CET1 ratio was 13.5%, which is at the midpoint of our target range. And we have completed about 35% of the \u00a31 billion share buyback which we announced at full-year 2023. Across the bank, and within each of our five divisions, we are driving an improved operational and financial performance to enhance returns, which Anna will cover in more detail shortly. Our business re-segmentation and the framework of targets which we laid out on the 20th of February, have helped to provide both internal and external transparency as well as accountability in our delivery. As Anna and I talked to our colleagues across Barclays, we are encouraged by how the organization has embraced this plan. In February, we described a three-year plan of measured ambition and disciplined execution. As part of this, we have set up a transformation office, which is responsible for monitoring our delivery across all aspects of the plan. One important aspect was proceeding with a non-strategic business disposal that we announced at our investor update. We have announced the sale of our performing Italian mortgage portfolio, and we remain in advanced discussions on the sale of our German consumer business. Turning to the financial side. Overall, we are where we expected to be at this stage. You can see on this slide the returns on tangible equity for each of our divisions and for the group for the quarter alongside our 2026 targets. These are the most important metrics for me and the Executive Committee team and Anna will take you through each of them shortly after I cover a few points on divisional execution. In the Investment Bank, we are continuing our journey to improve returns. RoTE for the quarter was 12%, broadly in line with the group. As with any quarter, there were some areas of strength, some areas of potential improvement and others where we should do better. We said in February that we will hold ourselves to account in a detailed and transparent way on a group basis and by division. In Global Markets, we did not capture market opportunities to the same extent as some of our competitors did. For example, FICC was not as strong as we would have liked, and we will have more to do on European rates, one of the three focused areas which we identified in February. On the other hand, we are starting to monetize investments made in the other identified focus areas, securitized products and equity derivatives. I'm pleased about this, and Anna will talk to you about this in more detail. In Investment Banking, DCM delivered an improved performance in the quarter, and we have the potential to do better. As we said at the investor update, we are focused on improving our performance in ECM and advisory, but there is naturally a longer pathway to success in these businesses. As an example of our progress in advisory, our recently established energy transition group has announced nine transactions since late December, showcasing our active advisory role in one of our focus sectors. In Barclays U.K., we expect our recently announced acquisition of Tesco Bank to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. Our strategic partnership with the U.K.'s largest retailer will help accelerate our planned growth in unsecured lending in our home market. This is an important step in our plan to deploy an additional \u00a330 billion of RWAs into our higher returning U.K. businesses: Barclays U.K., the U.K. Corporate Bank and the Private Banking and Wealth Management division. Over the medium term, this will rebalance RWAs between our businesses and support more consistent and higher return for our shareholders. One divisional number that stands out on this slide is 5.3% RoTE in our U.S. Consumer Bank. Although this has progressed from last year's 4.1% RoTE, we recognize we have a lot more to do in order to deliver returns in line with our overall group target of above 12% in 2026. And we have a detailed plan to do so as we set out in February. There was a notable point of execution in this quarter in this division. We announced the sale of $1.1 billion of credit card receivables to Blackstone as we manage capital in the business and strive to improve returns. Our U.K. Corporate Bank delivered a RoTE of 15.2%. We look forward to telling you more about this business in a deep dive scheduled for the 18th of June. I will now hand over to Anna to take you through the first quarter financials in more detail."

        "text": "Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 6, we have laid out the Q1 financial highlights for Barclays and you'll see the same throughout the presentation for each business. I won't go through these slides, but have included them for ease of reference. Starting on Slide 7. The headline message is that Q1 was in line with the plan we laid out at the investor update in February. We delivered a RoTE of 12.3% and earnings per share of 10.3 pence in Q1. There were a number of items driving the year-on-year RoTE move. Income and returns were lower in the Investment Bank compared to a strong prior year Q1 comparator. Operating costs, which excludes bank levy and litigation and conduct, were down 3% reflecting ongoing strong cost discipline as well as efficiency savings, including some benefits from the structural cost actions taken in Q4 2023. Total costs were up 2% year-on-year at \u00a34.2 billion, which included \u00a3120 million charge in Q1 '24 from the revised Bank of England levy scheme. We expect this to be partially offset by increased income over the course of the year, resulting in a net annualized reduction in PBC of circa \u00a350 million for 2024. Impairment was broadly flat year-on-year. And finally, TNAV per share increased 34 pence year-on-year to 335 pence including the effect of a less negative cash flow hedge reserve driven by the rate environment as expected. Overall, we continue to target our statutory RoTE of above 10% in 2024. At our investor update in February, we emphasized the quality and stability of our income. The more stable revenues we generate from retail, corporate and financing in the Investment Bank provides balance to our income profile. I will talk about the individual business drivers shortly. Together, these contributed 68% of Group income in Q1, and are expected to continue to grow above 70% by 2026. Total income was down 4% year-on-year at \u00a37 billion and group net interest income, excluding the IB and head office, was \u00a32.7 billion, as you can see on Slide 9. NII was broadly stable year-on-year. Even though, the balance sheet composition and rate outlook are very different between those two points in time. Our long-term structural hedge tailwinds offset the pressure on NII from deposit movements and mortgage margins, as well as rate headwinds going forward. We still expect Group NII, ex Investment Bank and Head Office, of circa \u00a310.7 billion for the full-year and Barclays U.K. NII of circa \u00a36.1 billion, excluding Tesco Bank, which we now expect to complete in Q4 2024. Deposit balances were impacted by seasonal reductions in Q1, in part due to tax payments. We expect underlying deposit trends to continue to slow after Q1 and loans to stabilize in the second half. We expect the benefit from the structural hedge, which you can see on Slide 10, to largely offset these product dynamics, resulting in broadly stable NII. As a reminder, the structural hedge is designed to reduce volatility in NII and manage interest rate risk. As rates have risen, the hedge has dampened the growth in our NII, and in a falling rate environment we will see the benefit from the protection that it gives us. We have around \u00a3170 billion of hedges maturing between 2024 and 2026 at an average yield of 1.5%, significantly lower than current swap rates. The expected NII tailwind is significant and predictable. \u00a39.3 billion of aggregate income is now locked in over the three years to the end of 2026, up from \u00a38.6 billion at the year end. As we said in February, reinvesting around three quarters of the \u00a3170 billion at around 3.5% would compound over the next three years, to increase structural hedge income in 2026 by circa \u00a32 billion versus 2023. Turning now to costs on Slide 11. Total costs were up 2% at \u00a34.2 billion, including the \u00a3120 million charge from the revised Bank of England Levy scheme. Operating costs were down 3% year-on-year. Our cost to income ratio was 60%, and despite the levy, we still expect it to be circa 63% for 2024. We expect a total of \u00a31 billion of efficiency savings for full-year 2024; half of which will be driven by the structural cost actions we took in 2023, and half by prior and ongoing efficiency investments. We have achieved \u00a30.2 billion of this in Q1. These efficiencies have enabled us to offset inflation, regulatory and control spend and created capacity for investments. Turning now to impairment on Slide 12. The loan loss rate of 51 basis points for the quarter was within our through the cycle guidance of 50 to 60, and the impairment charge was broadly flat year-on-year at \u00a3513 million. The Barclays U.K. charge was \u00a358 million, equating to an 11 basis points loan loss rate. Starting from this low and stable base, we expect to track towards circa 35 basis points over time, as we complete the Tesco Bank acquisition and grow the balance sheet, as outlined at our Investor Update. The charge of \u00a3410 million in the U.S. Consumer Bank increased year-on-year, whilst the loan loss rate was 610 basis points, a slight decrease on the Q4 level. Slide 13 shows that our actual loss experience in the U.S. Consumer Bank remains low, although we have seen a sequential quarterly increase in write-offs, as delinquency rates have increased in line with the industry. As we said before, we expect write-offs to increase during the remainder of this year, which is why we have been building reserves. We expect the U.S. Consumer Bank impairment charge to remain elevated through the first half of 2024 and to improve in the second half, resulting in a lower full-year charge this year. And we continue to guide to loan loss rate trending down towards the long-term average of circa 400 basis points. Turning now to the businesses. As I mentioned, you can see Barclays U.K. financial highlights and targets on Slide 14, but I will talk to Slide 15. RoTE was 18.5% and total income was \u00a31.8 billion, down \u00a3135 million year-on-year, driven by the product dynamics in deposits and mortgages, lower cards income and the transfer of U.K. Wealth in Q2 2023. NII of \u00a31.5 billion was broadly stable on Q4 and we continue to target circa \u00a36.1 billion of NII for Barclays U.K. in 2024, supported by the strength of the structural hedge tailwind. The NII target excludes Tesco Bank, which we expect to contribute circa \u00a3400 million of additional annualized NII, following Q4 2024 completion. Non-NII was \u00a3277 million in the quarter, following the non-repeat of one-offs in Q4 last year. We expect a run rate greater than \u00a3250 million per quarter going forward, as we guided in Q4. Total costs were \u00a31.1 billion, down 3% due to efficiency savings, and the transfer of U.K. Wealth in Q2 last year, partially offset by an increase of \u00a354 million from the revised Bank of England levy scheme. Cost to income ratio was 58%. Moving onto the Barclays U.K. customer balance sheet on Slide 16. Normal Q1 seasonality was a contributor to the \u00a33.9 billion deposit reduction from Q4 to \u00a3237 billion. Underlying deposit trends were as expected and broadly consistent with Q4. Deposit migration has continued to slow and pricing in the savings market has stabilized. On the lending side, lead indicators such as mortgage applications and card acquisition volumes, are largely positive, but will take time to flow into the balance sheet. Gross mortgage lending remained in line with 2023 trends, with balances of \u00a3163 billion. However, we grew our flow share in High Loan to Value mortgages, as per our stated ambition. U.K. Cards balances were stable at circa \u00a310 billion. Acquisition volumes are strong and consumer spending was in line with expectations, whilst repayment rates remained high. Moving onto the financial highlights for the U.K. Corporate Bank on Slide 17. This is new divisional disclosure since our re-segmentation, so the numbers may be less familiar. As a reminder, our U.K. Corporate Bank serves mid-sized U.K. corporate clients and has relationships with around 25% of the U.K. market, and includes our corporate card issuing business. As you can see on Slide 18, the U.K. Corporate Bank RoTE was 15.2%. Income was down 6% year-on-year at \u00a3434 million, primarily due to the interest rate and inflationary environment driving lower returns from the liquidity pool. Total costs increased by 20%, reflecting investment spend to support growth and the impact of the revised Bank of England levy scheme, which alone reduced RoTE by around 3 percentage points. Turning now to Private Banking and Wealth Management, which is another one of our newly re-segmented divisions, created following the combination of our Private Bank and U.K. Wealth businesses in Q2 last year. This is a high returning business with opportunities for growth going forward. Moving to Slide 20. RoTE was 28.7%, supported by growth in client assets and liabilities. Although we have not restated the historical financials prior to the U.K. Wealth transfer in Q2 last year, we have called out the RoTE impact of circa 3.4%. Income increased by around \u00a350 million year-on-year, driven by \u00a348 billion of balance growth, both from the U.K. Wealth transfer and an underlying \u00a319 billion increase, consistent with strong equity market levels. This was partially offset by continued, although slowing deposit migration. Costs increased year-on-year, mostly as a result of the transfer, but also due to ongoing investments in growing the business. Turning now to the Investment Bank on Slide 22. The Investment Bank delivered Q1 RoTE of 12%. Total income of \u00a33.3 billion was down 7% versus a strong year-on-year comparator. Total costs were down 2%, driven by non-repeat of last year's European levy, lower performance related costs, and included this quarter's Bank of England levy charge of \u00a333 million, resulting in a CIR of 60%. RWAs were up \u00a33 billion on Q4, reflecting normal seasonality. RWA productivity, measured by income over average RWAs, was 6.5%. The plan remains to improve Investment Bank RWA productivity, whilst keeping RWAs in the division broadly flat, as we set out in the investor update. Now looking at the specific income drivers for each business line in more detail on Slide 23. When we think about this business versus our peers, we use a U.S. dollar comparator, so that\u2019s what I will talk to here. Markets income was down 5% year-on-year. Within this, equities was up 30% and FICC was down 19%, with both comparisons impacted by specific items. Equities included a non-recurring gain on Visa B shares of \u00a3125 million and was up 11% excluding this with good performance in cash, prime and equity derivatives, one of our focus businesses from the investor update. FICC performance in Q1 last year included inflation-linked gains which we called out at the time, with income down 14% excluding this, driven by industry-wide lower activity in macro. We can do better here. We have work to do to regain market share in European rates, another of our focus businesses. Conversely, the market for Securitized Products, our third focus business, has been favorable and given the investments made, we have been able to monetize this more than we would have done in the past. Excluding the inflation-linked gains last year, financing income across FICC and equities remained around \u00a3700 million, providing the more stable income stream to markets that we have focused on. Investment Banking fee income was up 6% year-on-year in dollar terms. DCM delivered improved performance across both investment grade and leverage finance, and ECM also showed encouraging signs of recovery. Advisory income was lower against a strong comparator, but we have a healthy pipeline of announced deals, which will add to revenue on completion. As with the U.K. Corporate Bank, International Corporate Bank income was impacted year-on-year by the changing rate and inflationary environment on deposits and liquidity pool returns. Turning now to the U.S. Consumer Bank on Slide 25. The U.S. Consumer Bank generated RoTE of 5.3%, reflecting higher impairment versus the prior year, which more than offset higher income and lower costs. Income growth of 4% included an increase in NII on higher cards balances year-on-year. Total costs were down by 9%, reflecting efficiency savings and lower marketing spend, driving a cost to income ratio of 46%. End net receivables reduced in line with normal seasonal trends in Q1 versus Q4, and also included the sale of $1.1 billion of own-brand credit card receivables to Blackstone, ending the quarter at just over $30 billion. As a reminder, this transaction reduced RWAs through the derecognition of these receivables, which we continue to service for a fee. The late fees legislation once it comes into effect later this year will be a headwind to fee income, but we expect to mitigate this through actions to drive higher NII, including from revised pricing, although there will be a lag while these actions are introduced. We are looking to increase the proportion of core deposits in our funding mix in this business to around 75% by 2026. At 67%, the mix was broadly unchanged on last year, but up sequentially from year-end levels. Turning now to the Head Office on Slide 26. Head Office income was up 22% year-on-year at \u00a3194 million, driven by a gain on disposal of a legacy investment and increased German cards income, partially offset by lower payments income, hedge accounting and treasury items. The sale of our performing Italian retail mortgage book is expected to complete in Q2, generating a pre-tax loss of circa \u00a3225 million whilst reducing RWAs by circa \u00a30.8 billion. The transaction will have a negative 2024 RoTE impact of circa 45 basis points, but is broadly neutral to capital. We are also in discussions with respect to the disposals of the remaining non-performing and Swiss-Franc linked portfolios. We expect these disposals to generate a small pre-tax loss, but again be broadly neutral to capital. Turning now to the balance sheet, starting with capital on Slide 27. The CET1 ratio was 13.5% at the end of Q1, where we expected it to be, in the middle of our target range and down 30 basis points on year-end. This reflected seasonally higher capital usage in Q1 and the ongoing \u00a31 billion full-year 2023 buyback that comes off the CET1 ratio post year-end. Our capital distribution plans remain unchanged: to return at least \u00a310 billion of capital to shareholders between 2024 and 2026, with this year's total broadly in line with the 2023 level of \u00a33 billion. Moving onto Risk Weighted Assets on Slide 28. RWAs increased by around \u00a37 billion in line with our expectations, driven by normal seasonal trends versus Q4 in the Investment Bank. There were also some regulatory model changes in Barclays U.K., which we expect to be partially offset over the course of this year. Our guidance remains for regulatory driven RWA inflation to be at the lower end of 5% to 10% of December 2023 Group RWAs, as we reiterated in February. As I noted earlier, TNAV per share grew to 335 pence, up 34 pence year-on-year, driven by attributable profit and the reduced cash flow hedge reserve drag on shareholders' equity. Additionally, share repurchases reduced our share count by 4% over the same timeframe, driving TNAV accretion of 7 pence per share. I won't dwell on this slide, but we continue to maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet, with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. In summary, we are focused on disciplined execution. This quarter is the first step in delivering the targets we laid out in February and which we are reiterating today. Thank you for listening. Moving now to Q&A. And as usual, please could you stick to a maximum of two questions, so we can get around to everyone in good time."

        "text": "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just had a question on the -- a couple of questions on the U.K. business, and then the U.S. business. Just in terms of the U.K. balance sheet versus the NII performance, and I note that the NIM, which I'm glad we're not talking about as much anymore, was up 2 bps. And it looks like separately, the current account mix shift is starting to settle now with \u00a359 billion of current account balances versus \u00a360 billion last quarter. So do you think that we have kind of arrested the mix away from current accounts? I mean, clearly, the Bank of England data shows some flow into noninterest-bearing accounts, at least for the first two months of the year. So just wondering what the outlook there is because it seems like that you can easily deliver on your target for this year on the NII guide there. So any comment around those moving parts would be helpful. And then in the U.S., I guess how do we get the trajectory on the credit loss number? I mean, how should we think about that from the 610 basis points in Q1 to 400 basis points by 2026, given that, I suppose, unemployment could deteriorate in the U.S. or what have you. But clearly, part of the mix is also going to be coming from the GAAP portfolio. So I'm just wondering what's the confidence in the moving parts to go from 610 to around to circa 400 basis points. And on the U.S., could you also just confirm that the fee -- late fee matter is embedded already reflected within the guidance that you've given for that unit at the update in February? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thanks for the questions. I think just on the U.K. question, I think it's worth just reflecting on Slide 16, where we've shown you the balance sheet progression as a deposit matter. And I think you're right, we are seeing some stabilization in underlying deposits. And the way I read that is partly through the current account movement, but it's also -- whilst you continue to see some movement towards time deposits, that rate of change is definitely sold down. And what we see in Q1 is a mixture of those deposit trends continuing, but at a slower pace and what I would describe as normal seasonality. So in Q1, people pay the tax bills they also sort of pay off credit card bills, et cetera. And you also see that a little bit in business banking. So I think it's as we expected to see. From here on in, I think now in Q2 and beyond, you get almost beyond the [indiscernible], which can cause a bit of noise in the U.K. I think we'd expect those deposit trends to continue. So that's how I'd characterize those changes in the U.K. As far as the U.S. is concerned, I think worth looking at Page 13, which is a replication of the slide that we gave you at the year-end. And what that shows is we expected write-off to increase in the U.S. because delinquencies had been rising through last year, in line with the industry, and as the standard required us to re-reserve in advance. So what you see in Q1 is really a switch around in the balance between reserving actual write-offs, so write-offs have gone up, and reserving is now starting to settle back down. So for 2024 we expect higher impairment charges in the first half, lower in the second half and for the year as a whole to be lower than 2023. And in terms of the longer term trends in this business, I mean you're right in terms of one of our objectives is to have a higher proportion of retail. But actually, our GAAP portfolio is very high quality. And the FICO balance that we've got in the book now is no different to what it was pre-GAAP. And as we grow that retail proportion in time, what we also see is a roll-off of the legacy slightly lower FICO portfolio such that the mix remains broadly similar to what it is today. So that's why we're guiding to this longer-term position of 400, and that's what gives us confidence. And just to confirm on your final piece, yes, we did include late fees. The late fee matter in our RoTE projections. We'd expect those to come in -- I mean, obviously, planning for May. They may be slightly later than that. We have offsets to come in the plan, but they slightly lag the imposition of the legislation. So you'll see a bit of a gap there, but that's what we expected."

Can you just give us some more color on what's left to do there? Is that investments in people or infrastructure or both? And when do you think we'll start seeing some progress for that product line? And then secondly, your -- sorry, NIM was up in the quarter by 2 basis points, but NII was slightly down by about 2%.

So I would expect -- so hiring people. We've already got today a very strong presence in the primary markets in Europe, in DCM and especially with government bond trading. And what we are doing is supplementing the skills that we have on the trading desk. And I would expect, not in months, but in quarters, to start seeing some of the improvement. Of course, it's a function of market environment as well but it's mostly an investment to people."
      },

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thanks, Ben. On your second question, I think it's worth looking at the new disclosure that we've given you around the NII movement in the U.K., which is on the bottom right of Page 15. And what we're seeing here in the quarter is more stability in margin than we saw throughout 2023. And you can see there that there's still some product margin dilution, which is coming from mortgages and it's also coming from those deposit changes, but largely offset by that continued strength in the structural hedge. And what's really going on here is balance sheet movement. So the reduction in deposits that I talked about before, also just more of a broader market-wide movement in terms of reduction in mortgage balances, so we continue to guide to 6.1 -- or circa \u00a36.1 billion for the full-year. Still confident in that guidance. And I'd just reflect perhaps on the NII across the group more broadly, which was stable year-on-year. And we do think, not taking into account -- not just the U.K., but the corporate bank, Private Banking and Wealth as well and indeed, our U.S. Cards business. So we're pleased with that, as a result. And that's a good position from which we can grow. The only other thing I would call out is, of course, that circa \u00a36.1 billion is ex-Tesco, and we now expect Tesco to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. Okay, thank you, Ben. Next question, please."

        "text": "Good morning. A couple of questions. One on the IB and another one -- a follow-up on provisions in the U.S. On the IB, there's a few moving parts that you've called out. But I also note your U.S. competitors, they've been -- there's been a bit of a mix sort of messages on the pipeline. So I just wanted to pick your thoughts on the seasonality you see during this year considering the one-offs we've seen in the quarter, what seasonality could we expect in markets? And also in DCM, maybe the number is obviously up, but according to Dealogic and other NPAs, it could have been up more. Or do -- how do you see the pipeline there? Because, as I said, some of your peers were a bit more cautious. And on the U.S. cards, noted your comments, Anna, around the reserve build. But in your modeling, you obviously -- the 400 basis points -- to trend towards 400 basis points. Based on that, when would you expect the delinquencies to peak? Because conscious that typically, the seasonality provisions is the provisions tend to be higher in the second half. So just looking for data points that we could look out for to confirm that 400 basis points in particular, the peak and delinquencies? Thank you."

        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "It's Venkat. So let me begin on the first one on the IB. So on seasonality, I think in markets with one provider, which I'll say in a second, you should expect the normal seasonality that you see, which is a little quieter in the summer and then picking up in the fourth quarter. And so far, the second quarter is behaving like second quarters, generally do in seasonality sensors. The thought on DCM and the proviso I will make on overall fixed income markets is there is an assumption there about when volatility comes. And obviously, that's very, very hard to predict. We've seen, since the 1st of November, a round trip of about 90 basis points in 10-year gilts and approximately the same, slightly less than 10-year treasury. And so the question really is based on rate expectations, do they stabilize at this level or there's further opportunity, I don't know the answer. And -- but in part, that answer affects the next question, which is on DCM. And I think there are two parts to this. One is, obviously, rates are much higher than people might have thought six months ago. But at the same time, or at the same -- three months ago. At the same time, spreads are much tighter. And so I think the tightness of spreads is going to be one important factor in the thinking of issuers on actually what they bring out to the market. So I'm expecting that you will continue to see people tempted by the lower spreads."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay, Alvaro, I'll take the second question. So in terms of modeling, what we expect is for U.S. unemployment to go up from its current position. And you can see that in our IFRS 9 assumptions. What that would tell us is that we should continue to see some increase in delinquency. That said, a couple of things, our expectations of that peak of unemployment have actually come down quarter-on-quarter. So we've seen an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, we believe for the U.S. And actually, that economy remains robust. So whilst we expect to see a continuation of delinquency, we are content that we have very robust coverage. You'll see that our coverage is now over 11% on an IFRS 9 basis. It's 8.5% on a CECL basis, so we're well covered. Where we had concerns, probably, at the lower end of the FICO scores, we've taken action on credit lines. So we feel like we're preparing well both in terms of provisioning and indeed, our credit actions, if you like. But it is progressing as we expected to and given the IFRS 9 forecast we have for unemployment. Thanks for the question. Next question, please."

        "text": "Hi, good morning. Thank you. I had a couple on revenues, please. The first one's just coming to the Investment Bank, where revenue performance is well below peers even after adjusting for the one-offs that you flagged, and that's particularly the case for FICC and fees and even equities is off quite a low Q1 2023 base. So thanks very much for the color that you've given us in terms of kind of the product narrative. I was just wondering, because you target a lot of market share gain and quite a lot of improvement in return on risk-weighted assets, I'm just wondering when we should think about that from a timing perspective? Is that a similar sort of time frame to what Venkat was talking about in terms of the euro rate benefits coming through. So thinking about seeing those market share and RWA benefits over the coming quarters, is that realistic for the IB as a whole? And then the second one is just back on Barclays U.K. actually. Anna talked about mortgage flows being in line with 2022. I just wanted to clarify what you were talk about there. Is that sort of gross lending? Or is it approval because I think approvals particularly are up year-on-year significantly. Thank you."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thanks, Rohith. I'll take both of those questions, and I'll start the first, Venkat might wish to add. So you're right. There are two particular quirks, if you like, in both equities and our FICC numbers. In equities, there's a one-off in the current quarter, which we've called out, actually, excluding that, but business is up 11% in dollar terms, which we actually believe compares very favorably to our U.S. peers and demonstrates that we're making progress, and we called our cash, and we all called out prime, and we called equity derivatives, which of course, is one of our vacant areas. FICC, on the other hand, you might recall this time last year, we were talking about some inflation-specific income in there, that does color the comparisons a little bit. But even after we split that out, it's down 14% in dollar terms, which we don't believe lines up too favorably against our U.S. peers. There's a few things going on in there. We are pleased with the progress in securitized products. And in previous quarters, we would have said we're small in that business, we still are. But we've been able to monetize it much more effectively because of the investments that we've put in. And then across banking, I mean Venkat's covered that, but it feels like quarter-on-quarter progress. When we stand back from it all, this is one quarter in a 12-quarter plan. And we do believe that we have the right plans to grow this business, but we're not going to see the results after one quarter. So I won't give you a time frame, but hopefully, we'll be able to show you regularly how we are making progress. That's one of the reasons why we set up the reporting that we have so that we're not seeing a huge change in that revenue over RWA number yet, but it's important to us, and therefore, we're just showing you that. And on BUK, you're right to call me out on this. So let me be very specific. I was talking about gross flows. Apps are up 22% for the market in the first quarter. And interestingly, what we're seeing is the purchase market coming back in the U.K., which is really good after '23 being very much remortgage dominated. So that's really good. We think that helps for us, although it will take time for that to flow into the balance sheet. One thing I would call out is we feel like we've taken share in higher loan-to-value mortgages, which again, was one of the areas we were seeking to do. But just to be really clear, this is going to take time to flow into the balance sheet. But thank you for the question. Can we have the next question, please?"

I think it's Q3. I think we had \u00a316 billion. I'm not sure if that was my number or your number, but additional risk-weighted assets which I guess if you put on a pro forma now, that takes you really down to \u00a313 billion or a little bit below. So I guess the first question is, is that still the right sort of number? And then the second question is, I sort of thought that the German consumer disposal would sort of pay for some of that, if that makes sense. And therefore, you still have plenty of capital in the second half. But it sounds like that's not going to be so likely now. So am I right about that? Should we really be thinking that Q3 is going to be sort of low point for capital really? And how should we think about that in terms of capital in the second half? Thanks very much."

There's some seasonality in RWAs, which will obviously move as the year goes on. And typically, we would expect Q1 to be in the middle of the range, or maybe even slightly below the middle of our range because of that. You've then got inorganic actions. And I'm not going to comment on the specific timing of the German card disposal, but I would say it continues to progress. And then you've got business mitigants. So I'd call out the Blackstone transaction, and you can imagine that we continue to work hard on RWA efficiency across the group more broadly. So in terms of sort of capital generation and distribution, our plans remain as they were on the 20th of February in terms of both the priority, clarity, first, reg; second shareholder distribution; third investment in the business, and we are still planning to distribute greater than \u00a310 billion across '24 to '26, and we're still expecting to deliver broadly what we did last year, so around \u00a33 billion in the current year. So capital-wise, we're on track to where we expect it to be."

        "text": "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. One on Box U.K. and then one on U.S. cards. Yes, thanks for the new disclosure on Slide 15 on the NII bridge as it were. Just looking forward, some of dynamics look quite encouraging, but still the guidance implies a slight headwind versus the Q1 run rate on NII. So I guess I would have thought the hedge and the product margin dynamics are pretty neutral from sort of Q2, perhaps even slight benefit beyond that as we think about the hedge benefit and support from higher LTV lending perhaps outweighing some of the headwinds. So I'm just trying to understand what is the headwind from it? Is the deposit volume component still being a drag even post the season effects that you called out in Q1? And then on U.S. Cards, you highlighted the increase in core deposits percentage balance. I just wondered how much of that is a sort of dollar increase or how much has that been impacted by the fall in lending balances and perhaps a reduction in other funding? And sort of how are you going to grow the growth -- drive that growth in core deposits as we look forward? Is it really about the changes in providing deposit proposition the same at or some of the lending? Or is it pricing? If I can just squeeze in a follow-up on U.S. cards. You talked about mitigating the late payment fees. I just wondered how much of what's embedded in the plan is sort of the market reacting to that versus what's more in your control? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thank you, Guy. So just reflecting back on Slide 15. I mean I'd just reiterate what I said before, that really '24, we see about a bit more stabilization in the margin because of the factors you call out and the strength of that hedge. And then also, you've got continued deposit migration. So even though it's slowing down, we still expect it to be there. And in terms of the mortgage market, while we're seeing encouraging signs in terms of the market, it is going to take a while for that to start flowing into the balance sheet. So you see a balance sheet that contracts before it starts to expand, and that's really what underpins our circa \u00a36.1 billion. So it's playing out in the first quarter sort of as we expected it might. In terms of your question 2a on dollar deposits, it is exactly what you say. So we're expecting really, this is a product led and actually, the way we go to market with those dollar deposits reaching more directly to consumers. And again, this is the first quarter in a 12-quarter plan. It's going to move around a little bit. And actually, I've been looking for longer-term trends there really, but it's product propositionally driven. And then finally, just in terms of the market on late fees, I think we do see some price changes coming through, which is sort of what we anticipated and we would expect to participate in that which is why I said late fee legislation happens first, the pricing changes will drift through over time. The only other thing I would say is, of course, given the nature of our business, we are able to share the impact of those late fees with some of our partners. So you might expect the impact for us to be slightly less than it would be more market-wide. But overall, we considered all of that and included it in the RoTE sort of pathways and guidance that we gave you on the 20th of February. So no change."

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. One very quick one to follow-up on the last question, please. Could you just give us some quantification of the expected annualized impact around the late fee changes for your U.S. consumer business? I think it would be helpful to understand what the sort of initial impact you're expecting there is even if you expect some industry-wide and idiosyncratic mitigations over time. That would be the first question, please. Secondly, on NII, just conscious that you do have this \u00a3120 million Bank of England levy. You're indicating that there's a \u00a370 million offsetting revenues this year, I think, you said \u00a350 million net impact year 1. And I understand that's going to go through the NII line. And when I think about what swap markets have done since your guidance would have been struck at the full-year, I guess it's a bit more supportive, slightly higher average base rate for this year, slightly higher average swap rates than have \u00a370-or-so millions of benefit to come through relative to plan from this Bank of England funding adjustment. Why hasn't the NII guidance being nudged higher? Is that just prudence? Or is there something else going on in there, which is maybe a little bit worse than expected? And I guess related to that, what is your guidance around NII sensitivity to base rate at this point, please? You haven't given us anything in the slides quite some time. And given the relative size of your hedge versus peers and some of the commentary you gave at 2Q results last year, I do wonder actually whether in the very short term base rate not coming down as much as negative or very near-term NII trends? Thank you."

        "text": "Okay. Thanks, Chris. I will take those. So on the first one, we haven't quantified it publicly. However, on the 20th of February, we did include it in the flight path. You can see that it's actually a net negative over the period. So you can see it being a drag on the RoTE, but it is part of that. But I'd just reiterate, I would expect it to be slightly less than other market participants some are calling out just because of the impact from the partners. So in terms of NII more generally, we continue to guide to circa \u00a310.7 billion for the full business excluding the IB and head office and to circa \u00a36.1 billion for BUK. And you're right, there have been some movements in swap markets. But of course, they do move around a great deal. And what we did on the 20th of February was try and underpin our targets with prudent macroeconomic assumptions. Of course, we monitor those very regularly. We consider the impacts on the business, but we're not going to mark-to-market those targets on a quarterly basis. Just mathematically, you're right, we would expect some offsetting income from that Bank of England levy. I think we've called that out, around \u00a375 million. But one quarter end, we're not going to adjust the targets that we've given you. In terms of your specifics around the sensitivity, I would say, given the scale of our hedge, we are and always have been less sensitive to immediate changes in base rates. That remains true. The -- any sort of near-term change in rates is less important to us than just a mechanistic rolling of that hedged quarter in, quarter out. And there's nothing that I would call out as a negative in terms of rates being higher for longer. Of course, you might expect some benefit in liabilities, but there might be some offsetting matters in terms of asset formation, for example. So that's why at this stage, we're really happy with the \u00a36.1 billion and the \u00a310.7 billion. Okay, thank you, Chris. Perhaps, we can go to the next question, please."

        "text": "Good morning. Just two. Just to quickly follow-up on Chris. So just to confirm, the \u00a3300 million reduction in NII within BUK, that was set before the BOE levy kind of changes? I guess you are going to get probably about a \u00a350 million NII benefit within BUK. Just could clear that up. Second question, a much broader question. Obviously, you've got an RoTE target for this year of greater than 10%. I think consensus is currently around 8.8%. And when I look at the numbers, it looks like you need about \u00a31 billion revenue growth based on your 2024 RoTE bridge. And that's just not something at consensus or my own forecast currently have factored in. I think consensus has about \u00a3250 million of income growth. I guess a great disparity there must particularly be in the IB given you've given us fairly precise guidance on things like NII elsewhere. I'm just wondering if there's any kind of anything hardened -- you kind of point to and say, look, I think consensus is just wrong on this number when you look at our models? Any color there, that would be greatly appreciated."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thanks, Robin. So on the first one, our circa \u00a36.1 billion for BUK was struck for the 20th of February, which was before these BOE changes. They just mathematically, that is true. But we are in the first quarter, which is why I'd reiterate, we're happy with our progress thus far. In terms of your RoTE of greater than 10%, the 12.3% that we've delivered in the first quarter is exactly where we thought we would be. So -- and within that, the constituent parts are what I was looking for. So number one, real stability and income, particularly in NII and particularly in our financing businesses. They provide real balance to our income overall, the 63% of income in the quarter, and that's what we're focused on growing because it's a really good base for us to deploy the RWAs into the U.K. and to focus on those areas within the IB. The second thing I was looking for was delivery of cost and efficiency. We said \u00a31 billion for the full-year. We've delivered \u00a3200 million of that in the first quarter. So we're on track there. Third thing was continued good credit conditions. And again, we've seen that. So good credit performance at 51 basis points, really at the bottom end of our sort of through-the-cycle range, which again gives us a good base to grow from. And then finally, the capital position. So there's nothing different in our performance versus we expected when we spoke to you on the 12th -- on the 20th of February. However, there probably are some changes in shape relative to last year. So last year, we had an income -- sorry, we had an impairment profile that was very back-end loaded. This year, it's pulled forward, driven very much by the U.S. positioning. The second thing is we did see quite a sharp change in NII -- sorry, in NIM last year, driven by the deposit mechanics that really started to kick in, in the second and the third quarter. The third thing is we did see a drop-off last year driven by the cash flow hedge reserve and the way that was impacting the tangible equity of the group. And then finally, I'd also call out, in the current quarter, that Bank of England levy has a 70 basis points impact. Now we expect that to be not quite neutral, but nearly neutral over the year as a whole. So that is depressing the first quarter RoTE. Now of course, last year also, after a strong first quarter, we saw a dramatic force in IBCs in particular, to a decade low year for the whole market. And we're seeing more positive signs this year. So I think it's quite a nuanced question. But overall, we still believe that we can hit greater than 10% for the year, and we're exactly where we thought we'd be at this point."

        "text": "Good morning guys. A couple of questions. Back on the hedge and then a broader question [indiscernible]. On the hedge, I think you probably pushed on about a quarter of this hedge now since medium-term rates moved above 3%, yet the yield on it is still only 1.8%. And it sort of implies that the rest of the hedge, despite all the hedges earning closer to 1%. So I'm just trying to square that with a 1.5% maturity guidance -- yield guidance that you've given over the next few years. Is that just a prudent number you've thrown out there and actually the maturity yield on the hedges over the next few years is closer to 1% rather than 1.5%? Or is there actually a very decent tailwind expected into 2027 and '28 as well? The second question is not entirely unconnected. When I look at 2026 consensus RoTE, NII rebase for \u00a330 billion revenue number rather than where consensus is in the mid-28s you're getting to your target. So I assume on that basis, you recognize the consensus TNAV numbers out end of '25 and into 2026. And then there's a -- sorry, final question on this, maybe to the Venkat. The LTIP targets, incredibly commendable, but you don't get paid out in full unless you hit the 14% RoTE in 2026. But I'm just wondering what's your thinking there? It looks extremely aggressive, given consensus doesn't even believe you'll make the 12%. So why did you put a 14% RoTE target into that latest delta? Thank you so much."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Jonathan, thanks for the question. I think there are three. So let me deal with the first two, and then I'll pass the third one to Venkat. So on the hedge, no, it wasn't prudent. It's the actual number. So we do expect the average maturing yield to be 1.5%. We do expect \u00a3170 billion to roll '24 to '26, inclusive. We haven't talked about the tailwinds, '27 and '28. We talked about the tailwind for '26 which we said, given the assumption that we gave you or the indicative number rather that we gave you of 3.5% swap rate, that would add \u00a32 billion or around \u00a32 billion of income by 2026 relative to '23. And you can see the progress that we've made in the quarter. So for 2024 alone, when we were at the year-end, we locked in \u00a33.8 billion. Now we've locked in \u00a34 billion. And that compares to a total gross hedge income of \u00a33.6 billion last year. So there is a very powerful tailwind that comes from this hedge. To your second question, we do -- I won't specifically comment on the consensus numbers that far out, but we do expect an increase in the tailwind -- sorry, an increase in TNAV. We're seeing it grow as we expected, both because of the mechanics of the cash flow hedge reserve. And you might recall, we called that out specifically on the 20th of February. It was one of the moving parts as a headwind to RoTE, both in 2024 and beyond into 2026. So it's being driven by just the mechanics of the cash flow hedge reserve. It's being driven by AP accretion. And of course, it's being driven by the reduced share count over time. And that's really why we're seeing it move forward. And clearly, as a management team, we're most focused on the loss of those two, just noting that the cash flow hedge reserve can move around quite a bit. So it's AP accretion and really that buyback value creation that we're focused on. And Venkat?"

        "text": "Yes. I mean I would just say, and to pick up on that point on TNAV, this is a very important fundamental improvement in the bank when you just see the TNAV go up. And as Anna said, we emphasize the second two parts, which is AP accretion and share count. Coming back to the LTIP. Well, first of all, it should be clear, the LTIP targets and the composition and levels of compensation for both Anna and me are set by the Board. And normally, there is in the LTIP, it's aligned to, obviously, these financial targets, but there's always a little bit of stretch in them so that -- sort of incentivization of management. And that's all there is to it. So I think with that -- questions are over, if I may, I'd just like to say thank you very much for your time. As Anna and I have emphasized throughout, we are on track with the three-year plan which we laid out in February 2024.

    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome to Barclays Half Year 2024 Results Analyst and Investor Conference Call. I will now hand you over to C.S. Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive, before I hand over to Anna Cross, Group Finance Director.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Barclays' second quarter 2024 results call. At our investor update in February, we set out a three-year plan to deliver a better run, more strongly performing, and higher returning Barclays. We are continuing to execute in a disciplined way against this plan, and this is our second progress report. Our second quarter and first half performance keeps pace with our 2024 and 2026 financial targets, which are, first, grow returns with a target return on tangible equity of above 12% in 2026; second, distribute more capital to shareholders with a target of returning at least GBP10 billion between 2024 and 2026; and third, rebalance the bank with a target to reduce RWAs in the investment bank from 58% of Group RWAs at the end of 2023 to around 50% by 2026. Return on tangible equity was 9.9% in the second quarter and 11.1% in the first half of the year, on track for our target of above 10% in 2024. Total income for the second quarter was GBP6.3 billion, and it was GBP13.3 billion for the first half. And as you will hear from Anna, we continue to be focused on the quality and stability of our income mix. We are also increasing our net interest income guidance for 2024 from GBP10.7 billion to approximately GBP11 billion. We continue to control our costs trend and are seeing the benefit of the cost action, which we took in the fourth quarter of last year. Our cost-to-income ratio was 63% in the second quarter and 62% in the first half. We continue to manage our credit carefully. Impairment charges have improved in the U.S. Consumer Bank in line with our expectations, and our overall credit performance is strong, particularly in BUK. We remain well capitalized. Our CET1 ratio was 13.6%, comfortably within our 13% to 14% target range. This has enabled us to announce the first installment in our plan to return at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders by 2026. We have a total payout of GBP1.2 billion for the first half of 2024, including a GBP0.029 dividend per share and a GBP750 million buyback. Across the bank and within each of our five divisions, we are striving for an improved operational and financial performance. You see on this slide, Slide 4, the returns on tangible equity for each of our divisions and for the Group, alongside our 2026 target. Anna will take you through our financial performance in more detail shortly, after I've covered a few divisional highlights. Starting with our three UK-focused divisions, Barclays UK, BUK corporate Bank, and Private Bank & Wealth Management. We said in February that we plan to deploy an additional \u00a330 billion of RWAs into these higher-returning UK businesses by 2026. Barclays UK's return on tangible equity was 22.3% for the quarter. We are seeing stability in the balance sheet, with interest rates now expected to stay higher for longer. Deposits are stabilizing faster than we anticipated, with savings broadly flat quarter-on-quarter, given the pricing actions which we took earlier in this year. And we saw positive growth lending across products, as we managed the mortgage book well in a competitive environment. The announced acquisition of Tesco's retail banking business is progressing well, and we are on track for completion in November this year. This will represent around GBP8 billion of RWAs out of the GBP30 billion which we announced earlier. In the UK Corporate Bank, Matt Hammerstein presented our ambitions for this business in June, the first of our deep dives following the investor update. We have an opportunity to grow our share of lending in the UK Corporate market through deepening our client relationships and investing more in the client experience in order to make it easier for them to access more of our products and services. We delivered 18% RoTE in the UK Corporate Bank in the second quarter, and target continued high-teens returns in this business in 2026. Private Banking & Wealth Management delivered a RoTE of 30.8% in the second quarter, as client assets and liabilities grew by 14% year-on-year. With simpler pricing and service improvements, we have seen a meaningful increase in new customers signing on to our Smart Investor Digital Program over the first half of this year. In the investment Bank, RoTE for the quarter was 9.6%. We remain committed to delivering improved RWA and operational productivity to drive higher returns for this business, and you can see evidence of progress. In markets, fixed performance is relatively stable, with European rates improving year on year. While we continue to focus on expanding our overall market share, securitized products continue to perform well. Investment Banking fee income was up 45% year on year as the industry wallet grew and we increased our share overall. ECM had a strong quarter driven by our lead role in helping a long-standing corporate working client, National Grid, raise GBP7 billion in the landmark rights issue. The co-heads of investment banking, Cathal Deasy and Taylor Wright, will present a deep dive on their business on the October 1. Finally, the U.S. Consumer Bank delivered an improved RoTE of 9.2% for the quarter as we continue to grow and drive operational improvement and while impairment charges normalize. We took proactive actions to reduce credit lines last year and to build reserves early. And as a result, our impairment performance in the first half has played out as we expected. Overall, we remain execution-focused. One area in particular is cost discipline. We achieved a further GBP200 million of gross cost savings this quarter, taking the total for the first half of the year to GBP400 million, and this is on track for our targeted GBP1 billion for the full year of 2024. We also made progress with the non-strategic business disposal, which we talked about at our investor update. In this quarter, we completed the sale of our performing Italian mortgage portfolio and have announced the sale of our German consumer finance business. Finally, as I said, the GBP1.2 billion shareholder distribution is the first instalment of our greater than GBP10 billion capital return plan. I will now hand over to Anna to take you through the second quarter financials in greater detail.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 6, we have laid out Barclay's financial highlights for Q2 and H1, and you'll see the same throughout the presentation for each business. As before, I won't talk to these slides, but have included them for ease of reference. Turning to slide 7, the headline message is that Q2 remains in line with the plan we laid out in February. We delivered a statutory RoTE of 9.9% despite a circa 50 basis point headwind year on year from the cash flow hedge reserve. Excluding the loss on sales from the business disposals that Venkat mentioned, Q2 RoTE was higher than last year at 11.8%. First half statutory RoTE was 11.1%, and we continue to target above 10% in 2024, or around 10.5% on an underlying basis ex-disposal. Just like Q1, I was looking for four things in these results. Number one, income stability. Number two, cost discipline and progress on efficiency savings. Number three, credit performance. And number four, a robust capital position. Overall, we are where we expected to be, and I will cover these in more detail on subsequent slides. Starting with income on Slide 8, total income was up 1% year on year at $6.3 billion, and was impacted by the $240 million loss from the disposals. Excluding this, income was up 4%. At our investor update in February, we emphasized the quality and stability of our income, and how the more stable revenues that we generate from retail and corporate, as well as financing in the investment bank, provide a ballast to our income profile. Together, these businesses contributed 73% of Group income in Q2. Retail and corporate income included the loss on sale from disposals, and the underlying business income was broadly flat. Financing income was also stable year on year at GBP0.8 billion, despite the 2023 inflation-linked tailwinds that we have called out previously. And we saw year on year growth in both investment banking fees and intermediation. Turning to net interest income on Slide 9. As in Q1, NII, ex-investment bank and head office was broadly stable in Q2, at circa GBP2.7 billion. Structural hedge tailwinds continued to offset the pressure on NII from deposit migration. We observed more stable deposits in the second quarter than anticipated, and we expect this to continue into the second half. We have also updated our UK rate expectations for 2024, and now assume one base rate cut to 5% by the end of the year. Together, these trends mean that we have increased our 2024 guidance for Group NII, ex-investment bank and head office, to circa GBP11 billion for the full year, up from GBP10.7 billion. Within this, NII guidance for Barclays UK increased from $6.1 billion to circa $6.3 billion, excluding the Tesco Bank acquisition. A further UK rate cut to 4.75% towards the end of the year, which is currently assumed in the latest consensus, would not materially change NII this year. Moving on to the structural hedge on Slide 10. As a reminder, the structural hedge is designed to reduce volatility in NII and manage interest rate risk. As rates have risen, the hedge has dampened the growth in our NII, and in a falling rate environment, we will see the benefit from the protection that it gives us. The expected NII tailwind from the hedge is significant and predictable. GBP11.7 billion of aggregate gross income is now locked in over the three years to the end of 2026, up from GBP9.3 billion at Q1. We have around GBP170 billion of hedges maturing between 2024 and 2026 at an average yield of 1.5%. As we said in February, reinvesting around three quarters of this around 3.5% would compound over the next three years to increase the structural hedge income in 2026 by circa $2 billion versus 2023. In response to greater stability in customer and client deposit behavior, we have slightly increased the average duration. Given the high proportion of balances hedged and the programmatic approach we take, we are relatively insensitive to the short-term impact of potential rate cuts. We have provided a sensitivity table to illustrate this in the appendix on Slide 35. Moving on to my second focus area, cost discipline. Total costs in Q2 were up 1% at GBP4 billion, whilst operating costs were up 2% year-on-year. We delivered a further GBP0.2 billion of gross efficiency savings, bringing the total for H1 to GBP0.4 billion, and we remain on track to deliver GBP1 billion for the full year. These efficiencies have helped us to offset inflation and created capacity for investment. Our cost-to-income ratio was 63% in Q2, 62% for H1, and we still expect it to be around 63% for 2024. Turning now to my third focus area, impairment, which continues to trend positively. The impairment charge of $384 million equated to a loan loss rate of 38 basis points for the quarter, below our through-the-cycle guidance of 50 to 60. The Barclays UK charge was just $8 million, a loan loss rate of 1 basis point, which reflected continued benign credit conditions and an GBP18 million release of economic uncertainty PMAs. Our UK customers continue to act prudently, with little current signs of stress, evidenced by continued low and stable delinquency. Starting from this low base, we expect the Barclays UK to continue to grow and grow the balance sheet as outlined in our investor update. In the U.S. Consumer Bank, the charge increased year-on-year to $309 million and the loan loss rate to 438 basis points. On Slide 13, you can see the mix of reserve bills to write-offs within the impairment charge for the U.S. Consumer Bank, continue to evolve as we guided. We expected write-offs to increase during 2024 and as such took proactive action to reduce credit lines and build reserves early. In line with industry trends, there was a fall in delinquencies in Q2 versus Q1, which in part was due to seasonality and higher customer repayments. From here, we would expect future quarters to follow normal seasonality, with delinquencies rising towards the end of the year. We still expect the U.S. Consumer Bank impairment charge to improve in the second half compared to the first, resulting in a lower full-year charge in 2024 versus 2023. And we continue to guide to a loan loss rate trending towards the long-term average of 400 basis points. I will cover my fourth focus area, which is our capital position, after I have walked you through our business performance. As I mentioned, you can see Barclays UK financial highlights and targets on Slide 14, but I will talk to Slide 15. RoTE was a strong 22.3% and total income was GBP1.9 billion. Income was down GBP74 million on-year, driven by deposit and mortgage product dynamics and the transfer of UK Wealth in Q2 2023. NII of GBP1.6 billion was up \u00a348 million on Q1. NIM increased by 13 basis points to 3.22%, reflecting increased NII, but also lower asset levels, which we do expect to grow over time. As you can see on the chart, continued structural hedge momentum more than offset product margin pressures. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect the positive behavior to continue to stabilize and share an impact in mortgages to be neutral to marginally positive. As I mentioned earlier, we are now targeting circa GBP6.3 billion of NII for Barclays UK in 2024, excluding Tesco Bank, which is now expected to complete at the beginning of November. At Q3 results, we will provide more details on the expected financial impact. Non-NII was GBP290 million in Q2 and we continue to expect a run rate above GBP250 million per quarter going forward. Total costs were GBP1 billion, down 4% year-on-year due to efficiency savings and the transfer of UK Wealth in Q2 last year. The cost to income ratio was 55%. Moving on to the Barclays UK customer balance sheet on Slide 16. At Q1, we said we expected underlying deposit trends and loans to stabilize in the second half. Deposits have stabilized faster than we anticipated, with balances reducing by only GBP0.5 billion in the quarter. Whilst net lending remained negative, gross activity had increased across portfolios reflecting our focus on growth. Gross mortgage lending was just under 20% higher than Q1, however, this was more than offset by a high level of maturity. Application volumes were strong, with a more balanced high loan-to-value share, as per our stated ambition. UK card balances were stable at circa GBP10 billion. Acquisition volumes were strong, and we added GBP0.5 million new Barclay card accounts in Q1, in line with our UK growth plan. As we said previously, this will take time to flow into net balance sheet growth and interest-earning lending. Business banking growth lending also increased meaningfully, offset by paid owner of government-backed loans. This shape is as we expected, with a stabilization in net lending in the second half, and then growth from there over the planned period. Moving on to the corporate bank on slide 18. UK Corporate Bank delivered Q2 RoTE of 18%. Income was down 6% year-on-year at GBP443 million, as increased deposit income from higher interest rates was more than offset by lower liquidity pool income. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, as demand from corporate clients remained muted, as there was a seasonal pick-up in deposit balances post Q1. As we said at the Corporate Bank deep dive in June, we expect to generate lending growth within this business. You can see the early signs of this, if not yet in balances, in circa \u00a31 billion of RWA growth year-to-date, which reflects an increase in client facilities. Total costs increased by 10% year-on-year to GBP235 million, reflecting investment spend, which we expect to continue in support of our growth initiative. Turning now to Private Banking & Wealth Management. RoTE was 30.8%, supported by strong growth in client assets and liabilities, up around GBP10 billion on Q1, and around \u00a325 billion versus the prior year. The year-on-year increase in income was mostly attributable to the transfer of the UK Wealth business, which occurred in May last year. Underlying growth from higher balances and higher interest rates was offset by continued, although slowing, deposit migration. Costs increased GBP37 million year-on-year, mostly as a result of the transfer, but also due to ongoing investment in growing the business. We expect costs to be slightly higher in the second half versus the first, from our investments to grow our platform, hiring, and efficiency-related measures. Turning now to the Investment Bank on Slide 22. Q2 RoTE was 9.6%. Total income of GBP3 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in investment banking and markets. Total costs were up 5%, delivering 5% positive cost to income draws, despite higher structural cost actions linked to headcount actions in the second quarter. This resulted in a cost-to-income ratio of 63% for Q2, down three percentage points year-on-year. RWA productivity, measured by income over average RWAs, was 5.9%, 40 basis points better year-on-year, albeit down seasonally on the Q1 level. As we set out in the investor update, we are focused on improving this key metric from the 2023 level to drive higher investment bank returns. RWAs were GBP3 billion or 1.4% higher versus Q1 at GBP203 billion. This is within the bounds of normal client trading activity, driven largely by temporary factors. As you know, we are committed to keeping Investment Bank\u2019s RWAs broadly stable at year-end 2023 levels, reducing the proportion to circa 50% of the Group by 2026. Now looking at the specific income lines in more detail on Slide 23. Using the U.S. dollar figures as usual to help comparisons to our U.S. peers, markets income was up 6% year-on-year. Equities income was up 24%, again reflecting good performance across equity derivatives, prime and cash. FICC income was down 2% against a prior year quarter that we said included a circa GBP100 million benefit from inflation-linked positions. Excluding this, FICC was up 6% and this is the last quarter in which you will see a material impact. We continue to make progress in our three focus businesses and markets. Equity derivatives saw strong client activity and the market for securitized products remained favorable in Q2, allowing us to continue to monetize the investments we have made here. European rates improved, but we have more to do as we continue our focus on expanding share in this business. Financing income remained around GBP800 million, despite the positive inflation effect in the prior year, providing the more stable income stream to market that we have emphasized. This reflected strong growth in client balances, offsetting spread compression as we continue to scale the business and deliver on our GBP0.6 billion financing income growth target by 2026. Investment Banking fee income was up 45% year-on-year, with gains across all products. Our year-to-date banking fee share was 3.6%. We have increased share across most products in a rising industry wallet, but we still have work to sustainably improve this. DCM income was up 55%. Again, delivering improved performance across both investment grade and leveraged finance. ECM was up 76%, benefiting from the large transactions that Venkat mentioned, and the market is showing encouraging signs of recovery. Advisory income increased 7% year-on-year and our pipeline of announced deals looks healthy for the rest of the year. Finally, in the International Corporate Bank, our U.S. and European deposit balances increased in the quarter, which we see as a lead indicator of future client product take-up and fee income growth. These were offset by the impact of the changing rates and inflationary environment on deposits and liquidity pool returns year-on-year, taking income down by 5%. Turning now to the U.S. Consumer Bank on Slide 25. USCB generated RoTE of 9.2%, as income growth was offset by higher impairment versus the prior year, as we expected. Income grew 7%, as card balances were up by $1.7 billion year-on-year to $31.2 billion. From now on, we will report end net receivables on both a managed and a reported basis. Managed balances were GBP32.3 billion and include the receivables sold to Blackstone in Q1. As a reminder, in return, we are paid a fee and also continue to incur the cost of managing these balances. NIM reduced by 10.4% from 11.1% at Q1, driven largely by increased amortization of rewards paid to customers, which can be lumpy. We continue to target a NIM for this business of greater than 12% by 2026. The proportion of core deposits in our funding mix was 67%, as we target above 75% by 2026. Efficiency savings as a result of last year's structural cost actions offset inflation, resulting in broadly flat costs and a cost-to-income ratio of 50%. Costs increased versus Q1 due to higher partner spend and are expected to trend up modestly in half two as we continue to grow our book. We now expect migration to internal rating base or IRB models to be in Q1 2025, reflecting a refined approval and implementation timetable. This is a timing impact only and does not affect our 2026 target. Turning now to head office on Slide 26. Head office income was down GBP207 million year-on-year, mainly due to the loss on sale of our performing Italian mortgage book. This sale is expected to reduce Group's statutory ROCE for 2024 by circa 45 basis points, but have a broadly neutral capital impact. The announced sale of our German consumer business is not expected to complete until later this year or early next, but has a negligible ROCE impact. In completion, we expect the transaction to reduce head office RWAs by circa GBP3.4 billion, generating around 10 basis points of CET1 capital. Turning now to the balance sheet and starting with my fourth focus area, our robust capital position on Slide 27. The CET1 ratio was 13.6% at the end of Q2, comfortably within our target range, and we generated 35 basis points of capital from profits in the quarter. This supports our announced half-year distribution of GBP1.2 billion, comprising a GBP0.029 dividend and a GBP750 million buyback. We expect to begin the buyback soon, having completed the previous 1 billion buyback earlier this week. The half-one dividend in absolute terms is consistent with the prior year, but is GBP0.074 higher per share, driven by the share count reduction from the buyback. This year's total capital return is still expected to be broadly in line with the 2023 level of GBP3 billion, consistent with the capital distribution plan we laid out in February. Risk-weighted assets were GBP1.8 billion higher on Q1 at around GBP351 billion, as you can see in more detail on Slide 28. Our guidance remains for regulatory-driven RWA inflation to be at the lower end of 5% to 10% of December 2023 Group RWAs. This includes both expected Basel 3.1 and U.S. Consumer Bank IRB impacts, as we said in February. TNAV per share increased GBP0.05 in the quarter to GBP0.340 pence. Attributable profit added GBP0.08 pence, and the reduced cash flow hedge reserve drag on shareholders' equity added GBP0.02. Additionally, share buybacks reduced our share count by 2% over the same period, driving TNAV accretion of GBP0.03 per share. This was partially offset by dividends paid and other reserve movements. Year-on-year, TNAV is up GBP0.49, or 17%. Before I conclude, as usual, a brief word on capital and liquidity on Slide 30. We continue to maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. In summary, we remain focused on disciplined execution. This is the second quarter of progress against the targets we laid out in February, which we are reiterating today, and we remain on track. Thank you for listening. Moving now to Q&A. As usual, please could you keep to a maximum of two questions so we can get around to everyone in good time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAlvaro Serrano: Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning. One on costs, please. And in the roundtable, I think it was in May. You mentioned there would be structural costs in Q2. I haven't seen any many of them called out and it's been the second quarter now that you've done better than consensus. So just wondering what the underlying sort of run-rate cost ratio will be reducing the cost for the full year. That\u2019s the first one. And also UK in Investment Banking doing very well. I had a question on the revenue performance in U.S. cards. NII is down. You reached that 12% margin during your scripted comments I just wanted to see if you can give us any color around the path to that top 10 NIM over the next few quarters and how much of it is rate dependent. Thank you.\nAnna Cross : Okay. Thank you Alvaro. Good morning. Okay, first question. Just starting with one off cost. We did have a few structural cost actions within the IB. not really that significant. And certainly, over the full year, we don't expect to spend more on SBAs as than we have done historically, which we said was a GBP200 million to GBP300 million run rate. So for the full year, the thing that's really important here is the delivery of our growth efficiency savings. We've done another 0.2 in the quarter so it\u2019s 0.4 in the half year. We got really good line of sight to that GBP1 billion. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s underpinning the cost results that you're seeing. And I just to reiterate, our cost guidance for the year is circa 63%. The consensus of total cost is there or thereabouts. So that's how I'd guide you there. In terms of the U.S. Consumer Bank, you're right, NII has fallen off a little bit in the quarter. There's a few things going on in there. Firstly, remember we did the Blackstone deal in the first quarter. So you're going to see some switching out of and into non-NII. Secondly, I would say seasonally sometimes a little bit lower in the second quarter than the first, just because of the amount of customer repayment that we have. And thirdly, within that, there is a little bit of lumpiness in terms of customer reward monetization, that ultimately is a really good sign because it means we're growing the book, but the way it can sort of chunk itself to counter our revenues it can be bit lumpy. So that\u2019s all that's happening. So we haven\u2019t changed our charge rate to a 12% NIM. That\u2019s really around pricing optimization. It's around increasing our proportion of retail within the book and also really focus on our funding costs, and you'll note that our retail deposits are now 67%. We're really pushing that towards greater than 75% to deliver that 12% NIM. But thank you for the question.\nAlvaro Serrano: Thank you.\nAnna Cross : Can we go to the next one, please? Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joseph Dickerson from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Joseph. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Dickerson : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess my two would be, is there any follow-through in 2025 and 2026 from this upgraded UK NII? As you mentioned there's an implied GBP2 billion of structural hedge income growth, assuming that you reinvest 75% of the maturities, but it seems like your NII upgrade today is based in part on more stable deposits. So would it be unreasonable to assume there's some upside to that GBP2 billion based on greater than 75% of the maturities being reinvested? That's number one. And then number two, one of the issues that investors have with your 2026 targets is that the high single-digit revenue growth in the CIB is on the flat risk-weighted asset base. And it looks like in the quarter, you needed GBP3 billion of incremental risk-weighted assets to grow revenue. So I guess, how do we square the circle in terms of maintaining the RWA balances relatively flat on 2023. I mean, it was nice to see the revenue productivity picked up year-on-year, but still, we've had a few questions on that today. Thank you.\nAnna Cross : Okay. Thank you, Joe. I'll take both of those. So on the first point, what we've seen and observed over the last quarter is a real stabilization in our deposit position. And that really led us to upgrade our NII today for the UK and for the Group to circa GBP6.3 billion and to GBP11 billion. The way we think of that is really an underpin to what we are doing. This is a plan of many parts. We set out really detailed targets and plans in February of this year really to sort of guide you towards what was important to us and allow you to track our progress. So as we continue through the plan, we're pleased to see this progress. But as I said, a plan of many parts, and we have more things to deliver around our efficiencies and obviously around our capital allocation. So that's the reason really why we\u2019re not upgrading 2026 at this point in time. Of course in isolation, the movement in rates, you would expect to have some impact on that GBP2 billion number. But we're not going to mark to market our 2026 targets on a quarterly basis because we're just very, very focused internally on disciplined execution against the targets that we've given already.\nJoseph Dickerson : Thank you. [Indiscernible]\nAnna Cross : Yeah. Thank you. On the second one, in terms of RWA, I mean, there's nothing really to call out here, and that may not any change in intention. What we saw, particularly towards the end of the quarter was some increases in RWAs that we would say are largely temporary and certainly not an indication of a change of direction or intent. Our objective here is twofold. Firstly for home build RWAs, they are broadly flat. And again, you can see that and you called out the RWA productivity. We're pleased to see that go up year-on-year while also growing the other side of the balance sheet. So I would say largely temporary in nature and nothing really to call out specifically. But thank you for the question. Can we go to the next caller, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Benjamin Toms from RBC. Please go ahead, Benjamin. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Toms : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First one is on the RoTE is tracking slightly ahead of guidance for this year. I appreciate your guidance is not greater than to extent you are your plan [Technical Difficulty] I think portion would reconsider your cash dear years or should be whatever the. And then secondly, [Technical Difficulty]. Thank you.\nAnna Cross : Okay. Thank you very much, Ben. In RoTE terms and in terms of delivery of our plan, we are on track versus where we would expect to be at this stage after two quarters. So we're firmly in line with our plan, and therefore, it wouldn't cause us to change either our rate of guidance for this year or the longer term or indeed our capital distribution plans, and that's why we've reiterated them today. In terms of deposit trends, you're right, we've seen greater stability or that stability come a little faster than we expected. Perhaps that's how to think about it. And we do, however, expect the structural hedge notional to continue to fall broadly in line with broader deposit trends. Customers continue to seek yield even though they're doing so at a much sort of slower level of migration than before. But we reassessed that structural hedge very carefully with each passing month. We regard it as a key way in which we manage the interest rate risk in our income line. So we'll continue to monitor it and update as we go. But at this point, I wouldn't change the sort of overall pathway. Okay. Thank you, Ben. Perhaps we can go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Guy Stebbings from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead, Guy. Your line is now open.\nGuy Stebbings : Hi, good morning, all. I have some questions. And just some questions around Slide 10 and the hedge. Firstly could you confirm how much of the notional is attributed to the locked income component you referred to 4 in \u201825 and 3.2 in 2026? So presuming it's sort of an order make of 75% in 25% and 55% in '26, but any color there would be very helpful. And then in terms of the 1.5% maturing yield, which I think is consistent with prior disclosure, could you remind us sort of how that breaks down between each year? And just a sort of final one on this slide. Maybe I'm reading too much into dotted lines and sort of putting a rule context it, but it looks to me like it's near sort of 2.5% in 2026, the gross yield in that dark blue dotted line. I would have thought given prior disclosure and comments we might be near 3%. So can I just check I'm not reading too much? Maybe how about that line dotted cross. Thank you very much.\nAnna Cross : Okay, thanks, guy. And on your first question. We probably need to come back to you in relation to start. On the second question around the 1.5% maturing yield. So the way I think about this is that coverage, the sort of tenor that we've got here is between 2.5% and 3%. But there's actually a range of maturities within there, and that really reflects. How we think about the composition of our deposit book and the varying behavioral sort of trends that we see within there. So we haven't guided or given you any clarity consistent about how that actually breaks down between those tenors. But just to say, over the next few years, we expect that will mature near within our 1.5% which is consistent over that period. And then on the final question, which was around the gross yield. Again, we don't guide to gross yield. We've given you some mass in February, which is really how we expect that structural hedge income over time. What I would just say is you can see that it continues to grind higher and I think this slide shows us that well. So at Q1, we were at GBP9.3 billion of locked-in income. Now we're at GBP11.7 billion of locked in income. And obviously, in the current year, that is 4.5 locked in already by the half year versus the total we have for last year of 3.6. So that's really how we focus on it, less about the overall yield and more about how much are we locking in base as a combination of the notion of but also obviously the yield and hedge it fast. So that\u2019s how we think about that. We\u2019ll come back with a bit more color.\nGuy Stebbings : Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nAnna Cross : Okay. Thank you. Perhaps we can go to the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Goel from Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAmit Goel: Hi. Thank you. So my two questions. Maybe they follow on a little bit from Joe's but first one is, I think, consensus outside of the IB now already largely reflects the 26% target. So again, I'm just wondering how much hope there is to be both levels. I mean, especially in the UK where rates the better. And I guess by extending the duration of the hedge, I suppose that the point a bit more sticky. You're talking about stabilization. So the '25 again reduction in hedge size, I'm not sure if that does seem a bit too conservative. And then the second question is again just on the capital allocation. So I appreciate you commented that some of the RWA increase in IB has been a bit temporary in the quarter, but that is where we've seen most of the increase year-to-date and quarter today. So just curious when we'll start to see the allocation trend towards that 50% target, which could be important for seeing further re-raising. Thank you.\nAnna Cross : Okay, thanks Amit. In terms of the pathway on NII, not only for the UK Hey, but for the other parts of that core part of corporate banking, international corporate Banking and indeed, our private banking and wealth business. I mean, obviously, the trends that we're seeing around deposits and indeed rates are helpful, but we do see them as an underpin and hopefully an indication of our confidence in reaching those '26 numbers. And as it relates to the hedge as I said not on a mark-to-market hedge income on a quarterly basis. We gave you some moving parts and just to remind everybody, we've got 170 billion maturing over the three years. We've got a maturing yield of about 1.5%. We expect high to roll about 75% of that. And at the time of the investor update, when swap rates were around 3.5%, we though that would probably yield around GBP2 billion. Again, there are some movements in the yield curve that might in isolation, push that number up a bit. But this is a plan of many, many parts. So we're very focused on delivering the greater than greater than 12% RoTE in the round. On your second question around capital allocation, I want to reiterate, we think those are largely temporary and there's obviously also a natural seasonality to the RWA path within the IB. I think more fundamentally, though, what we're talking about here is the two-part strategy: firstly, holding that broadly flat. And secondly, growing elsewhere. So you're going to see this meaningfully change as a percentage really from the fourth quarter onwards. And that in the first part comes from the completion of Tesco, which we now expect to happen on the first of November. But also, but also really the organic progress that we're making in terms of the balance sheet. Now you can't see that yet coming through a strong balance sheet growth. That is what we expected. You might remember that in February, we said that we expected that the UK balance sheet would get smaller before it got bigger and that indeed is what's happening. But we're seeing good growth momentum. The mortgage market is up. We're taking a greater share of that. And we're also taking a good share of high loan-to-value mortgages. Our cards balances are up quarter-on-quarter and in corporate lending, whilst we haven't seen the balance sheet move yet, you can see the RWAs going up because we've extended balances to clients. So I think it's really sort of quarter four onwards that you're going to start to see this move meaningfully but just to reiterate on the RWAs and the IB our intention is still for this to be broadly flat and really for the work to be done elsewhere in moving that percentage But thank you for the question. Perhaps we could go to the next one, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Firth from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nEdward Firth : Good morning, everybody. I had two questions, please. The first one was U.S. consumer cards, credit quality. I think you said to see the provision charge has turned. But if I look at your non-performing loans in the quarter, they were up, I think, 7% or 8%. So just trying to get a sense as to where we are in that price and how we should expect that to progress from here if that's okay. And that\u2019s the first question. And then the second question I'm just trying to sort of square the BUK performance with some of your targets and with some of the revenue coming through from the hedge because you're making around a 20% return on equity in the first half and even if I normalize impairment but when you when you take your share of the hedge benefit it's going to go in there that's probably closer to 25 or even high 20s returns as of today. And yet in your target -- I think you said greater than 15% return on tangible by \u201826 and I know it's greater than 15% encompasses an awful lot but I guess mid to high 20s there's a long way ahead of that. So I'm just trying to think what should we be thinking about in terms of the difference between the greater than 15 and the mid to high 20s? And how do you think about a mid to high 20s return in a sort of we had to listen to the FTA talking about consumer duty yesterday. I mean should we be expecting some of this GBP2 billion hedge to actually go to depositors or are you we should be confident that we can hold the bulk of that thanks so much.\nAnna Cross : Thank you, Ed. I'll start on cards and Venkat might want to add something on USA quality also and then and then we'll go into the UK performance. Then really the U.S. CB and impediment pathways is panning out as we expected. The last year when we saw the macroeconomic variables particularly around unemployment start to increase what we expected was first delinquencies would increase, and secondly real if you like non-performance and write-offs would follow. And that's exactly what's happening here. And you can see it quite clearly in the charts which I think is on Slide 13. And so this time last year we got ahead of this in a couple of ways, the first was by building our reserve proactively. And so you can see that reserve build through the second half of last year and that was in anticipation of the write-offs and that movement of non-performing loans that you're now seeing. So from here what I expect is consistent with what we thought at the beginning of the year which is actually we'd expect impairments in the second half to be lower. Now the composition of that is going to still look a bit like what it does in Q2. You're going to have relatively high levels of write-offs and you can have lower levels of provisioning. And then overall for \u201924 it's going to be lower than \u201823. But we did take actions last year in credit lines also in anticipation of this. And that certainly helped. And just to remind you, this is a high-quality book. Venkat, anything to add?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yeah. I\u2019d add everything Anna said. And I think the other thing to look at is, in credit cards, as you know, one of the most important factors driving performance is employment or unemployment. The Fed's statement yesterday pointed, even though they didn't change rates, pointed to a balance in their concern shifting a little away from inflation into softness and employment. That is speaking to the thing that we put in and anticipated. And we've, as Anna said, tried to risk-manage the portfolio in advance of that. And so we hope we're prepared for what could be a softness. But the charges -- non-performing piece is exactly as Anna said. It's following upon a provision bill, which was earlier.\nAnna Cross : Okay. Then on your second point, just around BUK performance, we take confidence from the quality and the stability of the balance sheet. But that balance sheet is going to change from here. We are anticipating asset growth. So obviously we expect NII to grow over time, but I'm also expecting that the RWAs here are going to grow over time. And clearly we haven't seen growth in assets in BUK for a couple of years now. So that will moderate it. And it's just a reflection of, really, if you like, the emphasis moving from profit being in liabilities to really trying to grow the asset books for when the curve turns. So that's really what we're thinking about here. Think of it as an increase in equity rather than a reduction in returns. And that's really what's led to our RoTE thought process. Venkat, anything to add about that?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yeah. I completely agree. You have to look at this business, as Anna said, over a cycle. And the composition of the revenues shifts from liabilities to assets over that period. And as assets revenues increase, so does your equity. And that will have the effect of moderating the RoTE. And then impairment. Impairment has remained fairly low. And the UK, we'll see what the Bank of England does later today, but the UK employment picture has remained strong. There's really only one way this thing can go. And so you've got to be careful about where impairments go in the long run. And that would be the other moderating influence.\nAnna Cross : Yeah. And I think you sort of called that out in your remarks. So we're still expecting the sort of longer-term trends here. To your specific point on the FCA and the consumer duty, there is nothing specific in our RoTE guidance that relates to that at all. We feel we have the right ranges both across savings and indeed elsewhere, and they're in compliance with it. So there's nothing there that would mitigate or moderate that RoTE.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yeah. And look, this is an important protection measure for consumers. We fully support it. And I think it's important for the large financial institutions, all financial institutions, to be fully in conformance with the requirements of those practices. And they're good practices.\nEdward Firth : Great. Thanks so much.\nAnna Cross : Thank you. Can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Cant from Autonomous. Please go ahead, Chris. Your line is now open.\nChris Cant: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have one on the UK and one on consumer, please, the U.S. consumer. So on the UK, in your remarks, you referenced the stabilization in deposit books coming off the back of pricing actions that you've taken earlier in the year. I mean, you don't give us much disclosure around your deposit costs. But if I look at the interest expense you're disclosing in the UK financials, I think that's down half on half, i.e. lower overall interest expenses in the first half versus the second half of last year. So I just wanted to understand a little bit more what pricing actions you've taken, and if there is any color you could give us around the level of your average deposit rates, which some of your domestic peers do provide, that would be very welcome. And on consumer, obviously, income down, you've spoken to that in terms of the amortization and various other things, bits of lumpiness, I guess. How should we think about the progression of income for that segment from here? Should we be expecting growth to be coming through in the second half, or is more of the progression you're expecting to that 12% NIM back-end loaded within the plan? Thank you.\nAnna Cross : Okay. Thanks, Chris. So we don't disclose our deposit costs. Obviously, within the interest costs and the P&L, there are more things going on than savings within there. However, what I would say is we've made good progress around not only our range of savings, it's much broader than it was, but you can also see, and I think it's probably on Slide 16, the continued progression that the customer had towards yield. So fixed-term deposits continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. We have a lower proportion of fixed-term deposits than the industry more broadly, which is what you would expect, but still a significant change there. And I would just say, really, it's about range. It's about pricing consistently. It feels like we've performed well in the first quarter, sorry -- first and second quarter. The savings market overall has grown. And we initially lost share last year, but I would say that's very much stabilized this year as we've seen those benefits come through. And current account share has actually been flat throughout. So it feels like we've managed that well. In terms of consumer in the U.S., there is a bit of seasonality to U.S. cards. Typically, you see slightly higher income and slightly higher impairment in the fourth quarter, so we'd expect those trends to be the same this year. It's a bit the converse of what you see in the current quarter. There's a seasonal down in Q2, and you tend to see that go up again for holiday spend in Q4. So that's the seasonal element of it. More broadly than that, obviously, we do expect to grow. Cards growth takes a while, so you're going to see this happen over time. There are also some headwinds to NIM, an income that we called out, so specifically around late fees, although that appears to be delayed at this point in time. We'd expect to take some actions in response to that in terms of our optimization. We're continuing to build our deposits in the U.S. So I'd expect these to manifest themselves gradually over time, the implementation of that. But you're going to see some lumpiness from, for example, the implementation of that late fees whenever it comes.\nChris Cant: Thank you. On the UK deposit piece, I know you don't disclose, you don't give us a specific number. I guess the reason for the question is, when I look at data we do get for 2023, which we can at least see on an annual basis, Barclays in the UK was paying meaningfully lower rates than large incumbent peer banks in the UK. I guess off the back of that we saw deposit volumes compress for Barclays to a far greater degree than for those peers, so customers moved elsewhere because you weren't keeping up, I guess, with even the large incumbent banks. We've seen that stabilize in the first half. Is it just that the customers who were going to move have now moved and actually you've retained a meaningful pricing differential to large peers, or do you feel like you've substantially caught up with large peers in terms of your rates?\nAnna Cross : So as I said, we've seen that market share trend really stabilized in the second quarter. And what that tells me is that two things are going on. Firstly, our range and pricing performance is better, and secondly, there is some moderation there more broadly across the market, so I think it's both, Chris, actually.\nChris Cant: Okay, thank you.\nAnna Cross : Thank you, Chris. Perhaps we could go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robin Down from HSBC. Please go ahead, Robin, your line is now open.\nRobin Down: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple on the businesses being disposed of. With the German business, you've called out the kind of revenue contribution that that's making, but I don't think we've seen the cost and the impairment contribution. Is that business kind of a break-even business? I see most of the impairments in the head office relate to the German consumer finance business, so is the gap there just kind of costs for around GBP30 million, GBP40 million a quarter? Is that how we should be thinking about that? And the second question, I guess, is probably more for Venkat. I think you quoted on Bloomberg this morning saying that the sales and merchant acquiring unit is underway. I was just wondering if you could give us any kind of updates on that disposal. Thank you.\nAnna Cross : Thank you, Robin. So on German cards, I mean, you're broadly in the right ballpark. It's not a significant PBT contributor to the bank, and therefore, on sale, the meaningful difference that you're going to see in the P&L or balance sheet is actually the release of their RWAs, and that's really what drives that 10 basis points of CET1 accretion that will happen either in Q4 or Q1 is our expectation. So you're in the right ballpark. Venkat?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yeah. So I think, Robin, what I said earlier on a media call is that we had three acquisitions or three acquisitions and three disposals and to one acquisition stated for this year. The acquisition was Tesco, of course. The disposals were German cards and Italian mortgages, which have one been announced, German cards, Italian mortgages announced and completed. And then the last one was merchant acquiring. And on merchant acquiring, what I had said is in a way of all the things, it is the most complex one because of the technology involved, because of the kind of financial arrangement we would want and the kind of service we'd want. So that process is still ongoing. And what I said also on the call is that, we have nothing to say about it now. When we do, we'll tell you. But it is the most complex of that list of four.\nRobin Down: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you. Perhaps we can go to our next question, please.\nOperator: Our final question we have time for today comes from Andrew Coombs from CitiGroup. Please go ahead, Andrew. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of strategic ones, please. Firstly, on U.S. consumer, I've noted the delay in the IRB inflation until Q1. But we're now in an environment whereby it looks like for the U.S. banks, the delay in Basel 3.1 could potentially be much longer. I know when you gave your investor today, you talked about the risk rate density go from 100 to 160, and then through mitigation back to 145. And you thought that would be comparable to the U.S. banks post Basel 3. But in an environment where Basel 3 doesn't get introduced in the U.S., or Basel 3.1 -- sorry, in the US, how do you feel about the competitive positioning of that business? If a co-brand deal comes up for renewal, do you think you can still price competitively versus the U.S. peers given a higher risk rate density? And then second question, similar theme, strategy, but investment bank given, I know you said the IB RWA increase is temporary this quarter. But if somebody comes to you and says, I'd like an extra GBP100 million of RWAs, I think I can generate more than 12% RoTE on that from your investment bank. You've always said your North Star is the RoTE. So do you say, yeah, fine, please go ahead? Or is it a case of reducing the RWAs from 63% down to 50% a Group in the investment bank by holding them stable as a more of a priority? Thank you.\nAnna Cross : Okay, thank you, Andy. I'll start and then I'll hand over to Venkat. So on consumer, you're right, these regulatory models are complex to implement. We've just seen a movement over the quarter end really that takes us from Q4 to Q1. That has always been an acceleration of the Basel requirements for us. And we talked about that in February. So we always expected there to be a gap. Obviously, we'll have to see what happens to the U.S. rules. And it's very, very difficult for us to comment on that until we see both that and indeed the final UK rules. In the meantime, we're focused on the things that we can control. So we're focused on the commercial actions that we said we would take, which are really around improving the capital efficiency of the business through doing trades like the one that we've already done with Blackstone. We continue to work on the NIM, as I alluded to before, through pricing, through deposits, et cetera. We've got a big program here of efficiency and digitization. All of those things will improve the returns of the business. So we're really sort of focusing on execution of the piece here that we can control and which we have line of sight to.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yeah, I'll just add to what Anna is saying, which is that we will control what we can control. And we try to do that in a very efficient way. And we're doing things in capital management which try to alleviate what could be the impact of these changes. So more broadly speaking, of course, we have the view, which we've shared publicly, that we think the changes in the UK and the U.S. ideally should be similar and should happen at roughly the same time. That would be our wish. And then if I come to your point on the RWA and the increases, what I would say to you is the strategic ambition or goal of this bank is to keep IB RWAs roughly flat, absorbing some of the capital impacts we've spoken about, and then growing RWAs outside of the IB, and therefore shrinking the relative proportion of the IB. Now, if somebody comes with an interesting high RoTE trade, we would, of course, consider it. It would have to be shorter term, right? It's not something that can affect the broader strategy. So the broader strategy is that relative reduction. And if there are shorter term opportunities that we can take, of course, we would consider them, but at the secondary part of the broader strategy. All right?\nAnna Cross : And just to remind you, Andy, that the areas that we want to grow our RWAs in, so that GBP30 billion, they are in the areas of the bank where the returns are meaningfully higher than the Group average. So across BUK, across the corporate bank, and indeed across private banking and wealth, they are at least high teens, if not into the 20s. So that's the trade-off that we are really thinking about here as we consider the capital allocation for the firm. Okay. So I think that was our final question. Thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you for your continued interest in Barclays. We're pleased to give you the results today. We look forward very much to seeing some of you on the road over the next few weeks, or indeed, if you've got a holiday, we'll see you in September. But thank you very much and see you soon.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.",

        "text": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Barclays' second quarter 2024 results call. At our investor update in February, we set out a three-year plan to deliver a better run, more strongly performing, and higher returning Barclays. We are continuing to execute in a disciplined way against this plan, and this is our second progress report. Our second quarter and first half performance keeps pace with our 2024 and 2026 financial targets, which are, first, grow returns with a target return on tangible equity of above 12% in 2026; second, distribute more capital to shareholders with a target of returning at least GBP10 billion between 2024 and 2026; and third, rebalance the bank with a target to reduce RWAs in the investment bank from 58% of Group RWAs at the end of 2023 to around 50% by 2026. Return on tangible equity was 9.9% in the second quarter and 11.1% in the first half of the year, on track for our target of above 10% in 2024. Total income for the second quarter was GBP6.3 billion, and it was GBP13.3 billion for the first half. And as you will hear from Anna, we continue to be focused on the quality and stability of our income mix. We are also increasing our net interest income guidance for 2024 from GBP10.7 billion to approximately GBP11 billion. We continue to control our costs trend and are seeing the benefit of the cost action, which we took in the fourth quarter of last year. Our cost-to-income ratio was 63% in the second quarter and 62% in the first half. We continue to manage our credit carefully. Impairment charges have improved in the U.S. Consumer Bank in line with our expectations, and our overall credit performance is strong, particularly in BUK. We remain well capitalized. Our CET1 ratio was 13.6%, comfortably within our 13% to 14% target range. This has enabled us to announce the first installment in our plan to return at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders by 2026. We have a total payout of GBP1.2 billion for the first half of 2024, including a GBP0.029 dividend per share and a GBP750 million buyback. Across the bank and within each of our five divisions, we are striving for an improved operational and financial performance. You see on this slide, Slide 4, the returns on tangible equity for each of our divisions and for the Group, alongside our 2026 target. Anna will take you through our financial performance in more detail shortly, after I've covered a few divisional highlights. Starting with our three UK-focused divisions, Barclays UK, BUK corporate Bank, and Private Bank & Wealth Management. We said in February that we plan to deploy an additional \u00a330 billion of RWAs into these higher-returning UK businesses by 2026. Barclays UK's return on tangible equity was 22.3% for the quarter. We are seeing stability in the balance sheet, with interest rates now expected to stay higher for longer. Deposits are stabilizing faster than we anticipated, with savings broadly flat quarter-on-quarter, given the pricing actions which we took earlier in this year. And we saw positive growth lending across products, as we managed the mortgage book well in a competitive environment. The announced acquisition of Tesco's retail banking business is progressing well, and we are on track for completion in November this year. This will represent around GBP8 billion of RWAs out of the GBP30 billion which we announced earlier. In the UK Corporate Bank, Matt Hammerstein presented our ambitions for this business in June, the first of our deep dives following the investor update. We have an opportunity to grow our share of lending in the UK Corporate market through deepening our client relationships and investing more in the client experience in order to make it easier for them to access more of our products and services. We delivered 18% RoTE in the UK Corporate Bank in the second quarter, and target continued high-teens returns in this business in 2026. Private Banking & Wealth Management delivered a RoTE of 30.8% in the second quarter, as client assets and liabilities grew by 14% year-on-year. With simpler pricing and service improvements, we have seen a meaningful increase in new customers signing on to our Smart Investor Digital Program over the first half of this year. In the investment Bank, RoTE for the quarter was 9.6%. We remain committed to delivering improved RWA and operational productivity to drive higher returns for this business, and you can see evidence of progress. In markets, fixed performance is relatively stable, with European rates improving year on year. While we continue to focus on expanding our overall market share, securitized products continue to perform well. Investment Banking fee income was up 45% year on year as the industry wallet grew and we increased our share overall. ECM had a strong quarter driven by our lead role in helping a long-standing corporate working client, National Grid, raise GBP7 billion in the landmark rights issue. The co-heads of investment banking, Cathal Deasy and Taylor Wright, will present a deep dive on their business on the October 1. Finally, the U.S. Consumer Bank delivered an improved RoTE of 9.2% for the quarter as we continue to grow and drive operational improvement and while impairment charges normalize. We took proactive actions to reduce credit lines last year and to build reserves early. And as a result, our impairment performance in the first half has played out as we expected. Overall, we remain execution-focused. One area in particular is cost discipline. We achieved a further GBP200 million of gross cost savings this quarter, taking the total for the first half of the year to GBP400 million, and this is on track for our targeted GBP1 billion for the full year of 2024. We also made progress with the non-strategic business disposal, which we talked about at our investor update. In this quarter, we completed the sale of our performing Italian mortgage portfolio and have announced the sale of our German consumer finance business. Finally, as I said, the GBP1.2 billion shareholder distribution is the first instalment of our greater than GBP10 billion capital return plan. I will now hand over to Anna to take you through the second quarter financials in greater detail."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 6, we have laid out Barclay's financial highlights for Q2 and H1, and you'll see the same throughout the presentation for each business. As before, I won't talk to these slides, but have included them for ease of reference. Turning to slide 7, the headline message is that Q2 remains in line with the plan we laid out in February. We delivered a statutory RoTE of 9.9% despite a circa 50 basis point headwind year on year from the cash flow hedge reserve. Excluding the loss on sales from the business disposals that Venkat mentioned, Q2 RoTE was higher than last year at 11.8%. First half statutory RoTE was 11.1%, and we continue to target above 10% in 2024, or around 10.5% on an underlying basis ex-disposal. Just like Q1, I was looking for four things in these results. Number one, income stability. Number two, cost discipline and progress on efficiency savings. Number three, credit performance. And number four, a robust capital position. Overall, we are where we expected to be, and I will cover these in more detail on subsequent slides. Starting with income on Slide 8, total income was up 1% year on year at $6.3 billion, and was impacted by the $240 million loss from the disposals. Excluding this, income was up 4%. At our investor update in February, we emphasized the quality and stability of our income, and how the more stable revenues that we generate from retail and corporate, as well as financing in the investment bank, provide a ballast to our income profile. Together, these businesses contributed 73% of Group income in Q2. Retail and corporate income included the loss on sale from disposals, and the underlying business income was broadly flat. Financing income was also stable year on year at GBP0.8 billion, despite the 2023 inflation-linked tailwinds that we have called out previously. And we saw year on year growth in both investment banking fees and intermediation. Turning to net interest income on Slide 9. As in Q1, NII, ex-investment bank and head office was broadly stable in Q2, at circa GBP2.7 billion. Structural hedge tailwinds continued to offset the pressure on NII from deposit migration. We observed more stable deposits in the second quarter than anticipated, and we expect this to continue into the second half. We have also updated our UK rate expectations for 2024, and now assume one base rate cut to 5% by the end of the year. Together, these trends mean that we have increased our 2024 guidance for Group NII, ex-investment bank and head office, to circa GBP11 billion for the full year, up from GBP10.7 billion. Within this, NII guidance for Barclays UK increased from $6.1 billion to circa $6.3 billion, excluding the Tesco Bank acquisition. A further UK rate cut to 4.75% towards the end of the year, which is currently assumed in the latest consensus, would not materially change NII this year. Moving on to the structural hedge on Slide 10. As a reminder, the structural hedge is designed to reduce volatility in NII and manage interest rate risk. As rates have risen, the hedge has dampened the growth in our NII, and in a falling rate environment, we will see the benefit from the protection that it gives us. The expected NII tailwind from the hedge is significant and predictable. GBP11.7 billion of aggregate gross income is now locked in over the three years to the end of 2026, up from GBP9.3 billion at Q1. We have around GBP170 billion of hedges maturing between 2024 and 2026 at an average yield of 1.5%. As we said in February, reinvesting around three quarters of this around 3.5% would compound over the next three years to increase the structural hedge income in 2026 by circa $2 billion versus 2023. In response to greater stability in customer and client deposit behavior, we have slightly increased the average duration. Given the high proportion of balances hedged and the programmatic approach we take, we are relatively insensitive to the short-term impact of potential rate cuts. We have provided a sensitivity table to illustrate this in the appendix on Slide 35. Moving on to my second focus area, cost discipline. Total costs in Q2 were up 1% at GBP4 billion, whilst operating costs were up 2% year-on-year. We delivered a further GBP0.2 billion of gross efficiency savings, bringing the total for H1 to GBP0.4 billion, and we remain on track to deliver GBP1 billion for the full year. These efficiencies have helped us to offset inflation and created capacity for investment. Our cost-to-income ratio was 63% in Q2, 62% for H1, and we still expect it to be around 63% for 2024. Turning now to my third focus area, impairment, which continues to trend positively. The impairment charge of $384 million equated to a loan loss rate of 38 basis points for the quarter, below our through-the-cycle guidance of 50 to 60. The Barclays UK charge was just $8 million, a loan loss rate of 1 basis point, which reflected continued benign credit conditions and an GBP18 million release of economic uncertainty PMAs. Our UK customers continue to act prudently, with little current signs of stress, evidenced by continued low and stable delinquency. Starting from this low base, we expect the Barclays UK to continue to grow and grow the balance sheet as outlined in our investor update. In the U.S. Consumer Bank, the charge increased year-on-year to $309 million and the loan loss rate to 438 basis points. On Slide 13, you can see the mix of reserve bills to write-offs within the impairment charge for the U.S. Consumer Bank, continue to evolve as we guided. We expected write-offs to increase during 2024 and as such took proactive action to reduce credit lines and build reserves early. In line with industry trends, there was a fall in delinquencies in Q2 versus Q1, which in part was due to seasonality and higher customer repayments. From here, we would expect future quarters to follow normal seasonality, with delinquencies rising towards the end of the year. We still expect the U.S. Consumer Bank impairment charge to improve in the second half compared to the first, resulting in a lower full-year charge in 2024 versus 2023. And we continue to guide to a loan loss rate trending towards the long-term average of 400 basis points. I will cover my fourth focus area, which is our capital position, after I have walked you through our business performance. As I mentioned, you can see Barclays UK financial highlights and targets on Slide 14, but I will talk to Slide 15. RoTE was a strong 22.3% and total income was GBP1.9 billion. Income was down GBP74 million on-year, driven by deposit and mortgage product dynamics and the transfer of UK Wealth in Q2 2023. NII of GBP1.6 billion was up \u00a348 million on Q1. NIM increased by 13 basis points to 3.22%, reflecting increased NII, but also lower asset levels, which we do expect to grow over time. As you can see on the chart, continued structural hedge momentum more than offset product margin pressures. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect the positive behavior to continue to stabilize and share an impact in mortgages to be neutral to marginally positive. As I mentioned earlier, we are now targeting circa GBP6.3 billion of NII for Barclays UK in 2024, excluding Tesco Bank, which is now expected to complete at the beginning of November. At Q3 results, we will provide more details on the expected financial impact. Non-NII was GBP290 million in Q2 and we continue to expect a run rate above GBP250 million per quarter going forward. Total costs were GBP1 billion, down 4% year-on-year due to efficiency savings and the transfer of UK Wealth in Q2 last year. The cost to income ratio was 55%. Moving on to the Barclays UK customer balance sheet on Slide 16. At Q1, we said we expected underlying deposit trends and loans to stabilize in the second half. Deposits have stabilized faster than we anticipated, with balances reducing by only GBP0.5 billion in the quarter. Whilst net lending remained negative, gross activity had increased across portfolios reflecting our focus on growth. Gross mortgage lending was just under 20% higher than Q1, however, this was more than offset by a high level of maturity. Application volumes were strong, with a more balanced high loan-to-value share, as per our stated ambition. UK card balances were stable at circa GBP10 billion. Acquisition volumes were strong, and we added GBP0.5 million new Barclay card accounts in Q1, in line with our UK growth plan. As we said previously, this will take time to flow into net balance sheet growth and interest-earning lending. Business banking growth lending also increased meaningfully, offset by paid owner of government-backed loans. This shape is as we expected, with a stabilization in net lending in the second half, and then growth from there over the planned period. Moving on to the corporate bank on slide 18. UK Corporate Bank delivered Q2 RoTE of 18%. Income was down 6% year-on-year at GBP443 million, as increased deposit income from higher interest rates was more than offset by lower liquidity pool income. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, as demand from corporate clients remained muted, as there was a seasonal pick-up in deposit balances post Q1. As we said at the Corporate Bank deep dive in June, we expect to generate lending growth within this business. You can see the early signs of this, if not yet in balances, in circa \u00a31 billion of RWA growth year-to-date, which reflects an increase in client facilities. Total costs increased by 10% year-on-year to GBP235 million, reflecting investment spend, which we expect to continue in support of our growth initiative. Turning now to Private Banking & Wealth Management. RoTE was 30.8%, supported by strong growth in client assets and liabilities, up around GBP10 billion on Q1, and around \u00a325 billion versus the prior year. The year-on-year increase in income was mostly attributable to the transfer of the UK Wealth business, which occurred in May last year. Underlying growth from higher balances and higher interest rates was offset by continued, although slowing, deposit migration. Costs increased GBP37 million year-on-year, mostly as a result of the transfer, but also due to ongoing investment in growing the business. We expect costs to be slightly higher in the second half versus the first, from our investments to grow our platform, hiring, and efficiency-related measures. Turning now to the Investment Bank on Slide 22. Q2 RoTE was 9.6%. Total income of GBP3 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in investment banking and markets. Total costs were up 5%, delivering 5% positive cost to income draws, despite higher structural cost actions linked to headcount actions in the second quarter. This resulted in a cost-to-income ratio of 63% for Q2, down three percentage points year-on-year. RWA productivity, measured by income over average RWAs, was 5.9%, 40 basis points better year-on-year, albeit down seasonally on the Q1 level. As we set out in the investor update, we are focused on improving this key metric from the 2023 level to drive higher investment bank returns. RWAs were GBP3 billion or 1.4% higher versus Q1 at GBP203 billion. This is within the bounds of normal client trading activity, driven largely by temporary factors. As you know, we are committed to keeping Investment Bank\u2019s RWAs broadly stable at year-end 2023 levels, reducing the proportion to circa 50% of the Group by 2026. Now looking at the specific income lines in more detail on Slide 23. Using the U.S. dollar figures as usual to help comparisons to our U.S. peers, markets income was up 6% year-on-year. Equities income was up 24%, again reflecting good performance across equity derivatives, prime and cash. FICC income was down 2% against a prior year quarter that we said included a circa GBP100 million benefit from inflation-linked positions. Excluding this, FICC was up 6% and this is the last quarter in which you will see a material impact. We continue to make progress in our three focus businesses and markets. Equity derivatives saw strong client activity and the market for securitized products remained favorable in Q2, allowing us to continue to monetize the investments we have made here. European rates improved, but we have more to do as we continue our focus on expanding share in this business. Financing income remained around GBP800 million, despite the positive inflation effect in the prior year, providing the more stable income stream to market that we have emphasized. This reflected strong growth in client balances, offsetting spread compression as we continue to scale the business and deliver on our GBP0.6 billion financing income growth target by 2026. Investment Banking fee income was up 45% year-on-year, with gains across all products. Our year-to-date banking fee share was 3.6%. We have increased share across most products in a rising industry wallet, but we still have work to sustainably improve this. DCM income was up 55%. Again, delivering improved performance across both investment grade and leveraged finance. ECM was up 76%, benefiting from the large transactions that Venkat mentioned, and the market is showing encouraging signs of recovery. Advisory income increased 7% year-on-year and our pipeline of announced deals looks healthy for the rest of the year. Finally, in the International Corporate Bank, our U.S. and European deposit balances increased in the quarter, which we see as a lead indicator of future client product take-up and fee income growth. These were offset by the impact of the changing rates and inflationary environment on deposits and liquidity pool returns year-on-year, taking income down by 5%. Turning now to the U.S. Consumer Bank on Slide 25. USCB generated RoTE of 9.2%, as income growth was offset by higher impairment versus the prior year, as we expected. Income grew 7%, as card balances were up by $1.7 billion year-on-year to $31.2 billion. From now on, we will report end net receivables on both a managed and a reported basis. Managed balances were GBP32.3 billion and include the receivables sold to Blackstone in Q1. As a reminder, in return, we are paid a fee and also continue to incur the cost of managing these balances. NIM reduced by 10.4% from 11.1% at Q1, driven largely by increased amortization of rewards paid to customers, which can be lumpy. We continue to target a NIM for this business of greater than 12% by 2026. The proportion of core deposits in our funding mix was 67%, as we target above 75% by 2026. Efficiency savings as a result of last year's structural cost actions offset inflation, resulting in broadly flat costs and a cost-to-income ratio of 50%. Costs increased versus Q1 due to higher partner spend and are expected to trend up modestly in half two as we continue to grow our book. We now expect migration to internal rating base or IRB models to be in Q1 2025, reflecting a refined approval and implementation timetable. This is a timing impact only and does not affect our 2026 target. Turning now to head office on Slide 26. Head office income was down GBP207 million year-on-year, mainly due to the loss on sale of our performing Italian mortgage book. This sale is expected to reduce Group's statutory ROCE for 2024 by circa 45 basis points, but have a broadly neutral capital impact. The announced sale of our German consumer business is not expected to complete until later this year or early next, but has a negligible ROCE impact. In completion, we expect the transaction to reduce head office RWAs by circa GBP3.4 billion, generating around 10 basis points of CET1 capital. Turning now to the balance sheet and starting with my fourth focus area, our robust capital position on Slide 27. The CET1 ratio was 13.6% at the end of Q2, comfortably within our target range, and we generated 35 basis points of capital from profits in the quarter. This supports our announced half-year distribution of GBP1.2 billion, comprising a GBP0.029 dividend and a GBP750 million buyback. We expect to begin the buyback soon, having completed the previous 1 billion buyback earlier this week. The half-one dividend in absolute terms is consistent with the prior year, but is GBP0.074 higher per share, driven by the share count reduction from the buyback. This year's total capital return is still expected to be broadly in line with the 2023 level of GBP3 billion, consistent with the capital distribution plan we laid out in February. Risk-weighted assets were GBP1.8 billion higher on Q1 at around GBP351 billion, as you can see in more detail on Slide 28. Our guidance remains for regulatory-driven RWA inflation to be at the lower end of 5% to 10% of December 2023 Group RWAs. This includes both expected Basel 3.1 and U.S. Consumer Bank IRB impacts, as we said in February. TNAV per share increased GBP0.05 in the quarter to GBP0.340 pence. Attributable profit added GBP0.08 pence, and the reduced cash flow hedge reserve drag on shareholders' equity added GBP0.02. Additionally, share buybacks reduced our share count by 2% over the same period, driving TNAV accretion of GBP0.03 per share. This was partially offset by dividends paid and other reserve movements. Year-on-year, TNAV is up GBP0.49, or 17%. Before I conclude, as usual, a brief word on capital and liquidity on Slide 30. We continue to maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. In summary, we remain focused on disciplined execution. This is the second quarter of progress against the targets we laid out in February, which we are reiterating today, and we remain on track. Thank you for listening. Moving now to Q&A. As usual, please could you keep to a maximum of two questions so we can get around to everyone in good time."

I haven't seen any many of them called out and it's been the second quarter now that you've done better than consensus. So just wondering what the underlying sort of run-rate cost ratio will be reducing the cost for the full year. That\u2019s the first one. And also UK in Investment Banking doing very well. I had a question on the revenue performance in U.S. cards. NII is down. You reached that 12% margin during your scripted comments I just wanted to see if you can give us any color around the path to that top 10 NIM over the next few quarters and how much of it is rate dependent. Thank you."

        "text": "Okay. Thank you Alvaro. Good morning. Okay, first question. Just starting with one off cost. We did have a few structural cost actions within the IB. not really that significant. And certainly, over the full year, we don't expect to spend more on SBAs as than we have done historically, which we said was a GBP200 million to GBP300 million run rate. So for the full year, the thing that's really important here is the delivery of our growth efficiency savings. We've done another 0.2 in the quarter so it\u2019s 0.4 in the half year. We got really good line of sight to that GBP1 billion. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s underpinning the cost results that you're seeing. And I just to reiterate, our cost guidance for the year is circa 63%. The consensus of total cost is there or thereabouts. So that's how I'd guide you there. In terms of the U.S. Consumer Bank, you're right, NII has fallen off a little bit in the quarter. There's a few things going on in there. Firstly, remember we did the Blackstone deal in the first quarter. So you're going to see some switching out of and into non-NII. Secondly, I would say seasonally sometimes a little bit lower in the second quarter than the first, just because of the amount of customer repayment that we have. And thirdly, within that, there is a little bit of lumpiness in terms of customer reward monetization, that ultimately is a really good sign because it means we're growing the book, but the way it can sort of chunk itself to counter our revenues it can be bit lumpy. So that\u2019s all that's happening. So we haven\u2019t changed our charge rate to a 12% NIM. That\u2019s really around pricing optimization. It's around increasing our proportion of retail within the book and also really focus on our funding costs, and you'll note that our retail deposits are now 67%. We're really pushing that towards greater than 75% to deliver that 12% NIM. But thank you for the question."

        "text": "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess my two would be, is there any follow-through in 2025 and 2026 from this upgraded UK NII? As you mentioned there's an implied GBP2 billion of structural hedge income growth, assuming that you reinvest 75% of the maturities, but it seems like your NII upgrade today is based in part on more stable deposits. So would it be unreasonable to assume there's some upside to that GBP2 billion based on greater than 75% of the maturities being reinvested? That's number one. And then number two, one of the issues that investors have with your 2026 targets is that the high single-digit revenue growth in the CIB is on the flat risk-weighted asset base. And it looks like in the quarter, you needed GBP3 billion of incremental risk-weighted assets to grow revenue. So I guess, how do we square the circle in terms of maintaining the RWA balances relatively flat on 2023. I mean, it was nice to see the revenue productivity picked up year-on-year, but still, we've had a few questions on that today. Thank you."

And that really led us to upgrade our NII today for the UK and for the Group to circa GBP6.3 billion and to GBP11 billion. The way we think of that is really an underpin to what we are doing. This is a plan of many parts. We set out really detailed targets and plans in February of this year really to sort of guide you towards what was important to us and allow you to track our progress. So as we continue through the plan, we're pleased to see this progress. But as I said, a plan of many parts, and we have more things to deliver around our efficiencies and obviously around our capital allocation. So that's the reason really why we\u2019re not upgrading 2026 at this point in time. Of course in isolation, the movement in rates, you would expect to have some impact on that GBP2 billion number. But we're not going to mark to market our 2026 targets on a quarterly basis because we're just very, very focused internally on disciplined execution against the targets that we've given already."

Our objective here is twofold. Firstly for home build RWAs, they are broadly flat. And again, you can see that and you called out the RWA productivity. We're pleased to see that go up year-on-year while also growing the other side of the balance sheet. So I would say largely temporary in nature and nothing really to call out specifically.

So we're firmly in line with our plan, and therefore, it wouldn't cause us to change either our rate of guidance for this year or the longer term or indeed our capital distribution plans, and that's why we've reiterated them today. In terms of deposit trends, you're right, we've seen greater stability or that stability come a little faster than we expected. Perhaps that's how to think about it. And we do, however, expect the structural hedge notional to continue to fall broadly in line with broader deposit trends. Customers continue to seek yield even though they're doing so at a much sort of slower level of migration than before. But we reassessed that structural hedge very carefully with each passing month. We regard it as a key way in which we manage the interest rate risk in our income line. So we'll continue to monitor it and update as we go. But at this point, I wouldn't change the sort of overall pathway. Okay. Thank you, Ben. Perhaps we can go to the next question, please."

Firstly could you confirm how much of the notional is attributed to the locked income component you referred to 4 in \u201825 and 3.2 in 2026? So presuming it's sort of an order make of 75% in 25% and 55% in '26, but any color there would be very helpful. And then in terms of the 1.5% maturing yield, which I think is consistent with prior disclosure, could you remind us sort of how that breaks down between each year? And just a sort of final one on this slide. Maybe I'm reading too much into dotted lines and sort of putting a rule context it, but it looks to me like it's near sort of 2.5% in 2026, the gross yield in that dark blue dotted line. I would have thought given prior disclosure and comments we might be near 3%. So can I just check I'm not reading too much? Maybe how about that line dotted cross. Thank you very much."

        "text": "Okay, thanks, guy. And on your first question. We probably need to come back to you in relation to start. On the second question around the 1.5% maturing yield. So the way I think about this is that coverage, the sort of tenor that we've got here is between 2.5% and 3%. But there's actually a range of maturities within there, and that really reflects. How we think about the composition of our deposit book and the varying behavioral sort of trends that we see within there. So we haven't guided or given you any clarity consistent about how that actually breaks down between those tenors. But just to say, over the next few years, we expect that will mature near within our 1.5% which is consistent over that period. And then on the final question, which was around the gross yield. Again, we don't guide to gross yield. We've given you some mass in February, which is really how we expect that structural hedge income over time. What I would just say is you can see that it continues to grind higher and I think this slide shows us that well. So at Q1, we were at GBP9.3 billion of locked-in income. Now we're at GBP11.7 billion of locked in income. And obviously, in the current year, that is 4.5 locked in already by the half year versus the total we have for last year of 3.6. So that's really how we focus on it, less about the overall yield and more about how much are we locking in base as a combination of the notion of but also obviously the yield and hedge it fast. So that\u2019s how we think about that. We\u2019ll come back with a bit more color."

So again, I'm just wondering how much hope there is to be both levels. I mean, especially in the UK where rates the better. And I guess by extending the duration of the hedge, I suppose that the point a bit more sticky. You're talking about stabilization. So the '25 again reduction in hedge size, I'm not sure if that does seem a bit too conservative. And then the second question is again just on the capital allocation. So I appreciate you commented that some of the RWA increase in IB has been a bit temporary in the quarter, but that is where we've seen most of the increase year-to-date and quarter today. So just curious when we'll start to see the allocation trend towards that 50% target, which could be important for seeing further re-raising. Thank you."
      },

        "speaker": "Anna Cross ",
        "text": "Okay, thanks Amit. In terms of the pathway on NII, not only for the UK Hey, but for the other parts of that core part of corporate banking, international corporate Banking and indeed, our private banking and wealth business. I mean, obviously, the trends that we're seeing around deposits and indeed rates are helpful, but we do see them as an underpin and hopefully an indication of our confidence in reaching those '26 numbers. And as it relates to the hedge as I said not on a mark-to-market hedge income on a quarterly basis. We gave you some moving parts and just to remind everybody, we've got 170 billion maturing over the three years. We've got a maturing yield of about 1.5%. We expect high to roll about 75% of that. And at the time of the investor update, when swap rates were around 3.5%, we though that would probably yield around GBP2 billion. Again, there are some movements in the yield curve that might in isolation, push that number up a bit. But this is a plan of many, many parts. So we're very focused on delivering the greater than greater than 12% RoTE in the round. On your second question around capital allocation, I want to reiterate, we think those are largely temporary and there's obviously also a natural seasonality to the RWA path within the IB. I think more fundamentally, though, what we're talking about here is the two-part strategy: firstly, holding that broadly flat. And secondly, growing elsewhere. So you're going to see this meaningfully change as a percentage really from the fourth quarter onwards. And that in the first part comes from the completion of Tesco, which we now expect to happen on the first of November. But also, but also really the organic progress that we're making in terms of the balance sheet. Now you can't see that yet coming through a strong balance sheet growth. That is what we expected. You might remember that in February, we said that we expected that the UK balance sheet would get smaller before it got bigger and that indeed is what's happening. But we're seeing good growth momentum. The mortgage market is up. We're taking a greater share of that. And we're also taking a good share of high loan-to-value mortgages. Our cards balances are up quarter-on-quarter and in corporate lending, whilst we haven't seen the balance sheet move yet, you can see the RWAs going up because we've extended balances to clients. So I think it's really sort of quarter four onwards that you're going to start to see this move meaningfully but just to reiterate on the RWAs and the IB our intention is still for this to be broadly flat and really for the work to be done elsewhere in moving that percentage But thank you for the question. Perhaps we could go to the next one, please."

But if I look at your non-performing loans in the quarter, they were up, I think, 7% or 8%. So just trying to get a sense as to where we are in that price and how we should expect that to progress from here if that's okay. And that\u2019s the first question. And then the second question I'm just trying to sort of square the BUK performance with some of your targets and with some of the revenue coming through from the hedge because you're making around a 20% return on equity in the first half and even if I normalize impairment but when you when you take your share of the hedge benefit it's going to go in there that's probably closer to 25 or even high 20s returns as of today. And yet in your target -- I think you said greater than 15% return on tangible by \u201826 and I know it's greater than 15% encompasses an awful lot but I guess mid to high 20s there's a long way ahead of that. So I'm just trying to think what should we be thinking about in terms of the difference between the greater than 15 and the mid to high 20s? And how do you think about a mid to high 20s return in a sort of we had to listen to the FTA talking about consumer duty yesterday. I mean should we be expecting some of this GBP2 billion hedge to actually go to depositors or are you we should be confident that we can hold the bulk of that thanks so much."

Then really the U.S. CB and impediment pathways is panning out as we expected. The last year when we saw the macroeconomic variables particularly around unemployment start to increase what we expected was first delinquencies would increase, and secondly real if you like non-performance and write-offs would follow. And that's exactly what's happening here. And you can see it quite clearly in the charts which I think is on Slide 13. And so this time last year we got ahead of this in a couple of ways, the first was by building our reserve proactively. And so you can see that reserve build through the second half of last year and that was in anticipation of the write-offs and that movement of non-performing loans that you're now seeing. So from here what I expect is consistent with what we thought at the beginning of the year which is actually we'd expect impairments in the second half to be lower. Now the composition of that is going to still look a bit like what it does in Q2. You're going to have relatively high levels of write-offs and you can have lower levels of provisioning. And then overall for \u201924 it's going to be lower than \u201823. But we did take actions last year in credit lines also in anticipation of this. And that certainly helped.

The Fed's statement yesterday pointed, even though they didn't change rates, pointed to a balance in their concern shifting a little away from inflation into softness and employment. That is speaking to the thing that we put in and anticipated. And we've, as Anna said, tried to risk-manage the portfolio in advance of that. And so we hope we're prepared for what could be a softness. But the charges -- non-performing piece is exactly as Anna said. It's following upon a provision bill, which was earlier."

So obviously we expect NII to grow over time, but I'm also expecting that the RWAs here are going to grow over time. And clearly we haven't seen growth in assets in BUK for a couple of years now. So that will moderate it. And it's just a reflection of, really, if you like, the emphasis moving from profit being in liabilities to really trying to grow the asset books for when the curve turns. So that's really what we're thinking about here. Think of it as an increase in equity rather than a reduction in returns. And that's really what's led to our RoTE thought process.

And the UK, we'll see what the Bank of England does later today, but the UK employment picture has remained strong. There's really only one way this thing can go.

So on the UK, in your remarks, you referenced the stabilization in deposit books coming off the back of pricing actions that you've taken earlier in the year. I mean, you don't give us much disclosure around your deposit costs. But if I look at the interest expense you're disclosing in the UK financials, I think that's down half on half, i.e. lower overall interest expenses in the first half versus the second half of last year. So I just wanted to understand a little bit more what pricing actions you've taken, and if there is any color you could give us around the level of your average deposit rates, which some of your domestic peers do provide, that would be very welcome. And on consumer, obviously, income down, you've spoken to that in terms of the amortization and various other things, bits of lumpiness, I guess. How should we think about the progression of income for that segment from here? Should we be expecting growth to be coming through in the second half, or is more of the progression you're expecting to that 12% NIM back-end loaded within the plan? Thank you."

However, what I would say is we've made good progress around not only our range of savings, it's much broader than it was, but you can also see, and I think it's probably on Slide 16, the continued progression that the customer had towards yield. So fixed-term deposits continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. We have a lower proportion of fixed-term deposits than the industry more broadly, which is what you would expect, but still a significant change there. And I would just say, really, it's about range. It's about pricing consistently. It feels like we've performed well in the first quarter, sorry -- first and second quarter. The savings market overall has grown. And we initially lost share last year, but I would say that's very much stabilized this year as we've seen those benefits come through. And current account share has actually been flat throughout. So it feels like we've managed that well. In terms of consumer in the U.S., there is a bit of seasonality to U.S. cards. Typically, you see slightly higher income and slightly higher impairment in the fourth quarter, so we'd expect those trends to be the same this year. It's a bit the converse of what you see in the current quarter. There's a seasonal down in Q2, and you tend to see that go up again for holiday spend in Q4. So that's the seasonal element of it. More broadly than that, obviously, we do expect to grow. Cards growth takes a while, so you're going to see this happen over time. There are also some headwinds to NIM, an income that we called out, so specifically around late fees, although that appears to be delayed at this point in time. We'd expect to take some actions in response to that in terms of our optimization. We're continuing to build our deposits in the U.S. So I'd expect these to manifest themselves gradually over time, the implementation of that. But you're going to see some lumpiness from, for example, the implementation of that late fees whenever it comes."

        "text": "Thank you. On the UK deposit piece, I know you don't disclose, you don't give us a specific number. I guess the reason for the question is, when I look at data we do get for 2023, which we can at least see on an annual basis, Barclays in the UK was paying meaningfully lower rates than large incumbent peer banks in the UK. I guess off the back of that we saw deposit volumes compress for Barclays to a far greater degree than for those peers, so customers moved elsewhere because you weren't keeping up, I guess, with even the large incumbent banks. We've seen that stabilize in the first half. Is it just that the customers who were going to move have now moved and actually you've retained a meaningful pricing differential to large peers, or do you feel like you've substantially caught up with large peers in terms of your rates?"

With the German business, you've called out the kind of revenue contribution that that's making, but I don't think we've seen the cost and the impairment contribution. Is that business kind of a break-even business? I see most of the impairments in the head office relate to the German consumer finance business, so is the gap there just kind of costs for around GBP30 million, GBP40 million a quarter? Is that how we should be thinking about that? And the second question, I guess, is probably more for Venkat. I think you quoted on Bloomberg this morning saying that the sales and merchant acquiring unit is underway. I was just wondering if you could give us any kind of updates on that disposal. Thank you."

It's not a significant PBT contributor to the bank, and therefore, on sale, the meaningful difference that you're going to see in the P&L or balance sheet is actually the release of their RWAs, and that's really what drives that 10 basis points of CET1 accretion that will happen either in Q4 or Q1 is our expectation. So you're in the right ballpark. Venkat?"

The acquisition was Tesco, of course. The disposals were German cards and Italian mortgages, which have one been announced, German cards, Italian mortgages announced and completed. And then the last one was merchant acquiring. And on merchant acquiring, what I had said is in a way of all the things, it is the most complex one because of the technology involved, because of the kind of financial arrangement we would want and the kind of service we'd want. So that process is still ongoing. And what I said also on the call is that, we have nothing to say about it now. When we do, we'll tell you. But it is the most complex of that list of four."

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of strategic ones, please. Firstly, on U.S. consumer, I've noted the delay in the IRB inflation until Q1. But we're now in an environment whereby it looks like for the U.S. banks, the delay in Basel 3.1 could potentially be much longer. I know when you gave your investor today, you talked about the risk rate density go from 100 to 160, and then through mitigation back to 145. And you thought that would be comparable to the U.S. banks post Basel 3. But in an environment where Basel 3 doesn't get introduced in the U.S., or Basel 3.1 -- sorry, in the US, how do you feel about the competitive positioning of that business? If a co-brand deal comes up for renewal, do you think you can still price competitively versus the U.S. peers given a higher risk rate density? And then second question, similar theme, strategy, but investment bank given, I know you said the IB RWA increase is temporary this quarter. But if somebody comes to you and says, I'd like an extra GBP100 million of RWAs, I think I can generate more than 12% RoTE on that from your investment bank. You've always said your North Star is the RoTE. So do you say, yeah, fine, please go ahead? Or is it a case of reducing the RWAs from 63% down to 50% a Group in the investment bank by holding them stable as a more of a priority? Thank you."

        "text": "Okay, thank you, Andy. I'll start and then I'll hand over to Venkat. So on consumer, you're right, these regulatory models are complex to implement. We've just seen a movement over the quarter end really that takes us from Q4 to Q1. That has always been an acceleration of the Basel requirements for us. And we talked about that in February. So we always expected there to be a gap. Obviously, we'll have to see what happens to the U.S. rules. And it's very, very difficult for us to comment on that until we see both that and indeed the final UK rules. In the meantime, we're focused on the things that we can control. So we're focused on the commercial actions that we said we would take, which are really around improving the capital efficiency of the business through doing trades like the one that we've already done with Blackstone. We continue to work on the NIM, as I alluded to before, through pricing, through deposits, et cetera. We've got a big program here of efficiency and digitization. All of those things will improve the returns of the business. So we're really sort of focusing on execution of the piece here that we can control and which we have line of sight to."

        "text": "Yeah, I'll just add to what Anna is saying, which is that we will control what we can control. And we try to do that in a very efficient way. And we're doing things in capital management which try to alleviate what could be the impact of these changes. So more broadly speaking, of course, we have the view, which we've shared publicly, that we think the changes in the UK and the U.S. ideally should be similar and should happen at roughly the same time. That would be our wish. And then if I come to your point on the RWA and the increases, what I would say to you is the strategic ambition or goal of this bank is to keep IB RWAs roughly flat, absorbing some of the capital impacts we've spoken about, and then growing RWAs outside of the IB, and therefore shrinking the relative proportion of the IB. Now, if somebody comes with an interesting high RoTE trade, we would, of course, consider it. It would have to be shorter term, right? It's not something that can affect the broader strategy. So the broader strategy is that relative reduction. And if there are shorter term opportunities that we can take, of course, we would consider them, but at the secondary part of the broader strategy. All right?"

        "speaker": "Anna Cross ",
        "text": "And just to remind you, Andy, that the areas that we want to grow our RWAs in, so that GBP30 billion, they are in the areas of the bank where the returns are meaningfully higher than the Group average. So across BUK, across the corporate bank, and indeed across private banking and wealth, they are at least high teens, if not into the 20s. So that's the trade-off that we are really thinking about here as we consider the capital allocation for the firm. Okay. So I think that was our final question. Thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you for your continued interest in Barclays. We're pleased to give you the results today. We look forward very much to seeing some of you on the road over the next few weeks, or indeed, if you've got a holiday, we'll see you in September. But thank you very much and see you soon."

    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome to Barclays Q3 2024 Results Analyst and Investor Conference Call. I will now hand over to C.S. Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive before I hand over to Anna Cross, Group Finance Director.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Barclays at Third Quarter 2024 Results Call. As a reminder, at our investor update in February, we set out a 3-year plan to deliver a better run, more strongly performing and higher return in Barclays. I'm encouraged by our progress to you then. We are continuing to execute in a disciplined way against this plan and are on track to achieve our 2024 as well as our 2025 target. Return on tangible equity was 12.3% in the third quarter and 11.5% year-to-date. We achieved this even as we grew tangible book value by 0.35p per share year-on-year to 3.51p at the end of the quarter. This resulted from strong organic capital generation and the meaningful impact of buybacks in reducing our share count. Total income for Q3 was \u00a36.5 billion and is \u00a319.8 billion year-to-date with a continued focus on the quality and stability of our income mix. Given the ongoing healthy support from our structural hedge, we remain confident on the strength of the income profile of our business in its falling rate environment. These factors lead to our upgrading Barclays U.K. as well as group NII targets today. We continue to control costs well and are seeing the benefit of the cost actions, which we took in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our cost-to-income ratio was 61%, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. Impairment charges have improved in the U.S. consumer bank in line with our expectations, and our overall credit performance was strong, particularly in the U.K. with a group loan loss rate of 42 basis points year-to-date and 37 basis points in the quarter. Importantly, we also remain well capitalized, ending the quarter with a 13.8% CET1 ratio comfortably within our target range of 13% to 14%. Across the bank and within each of our 5 divisions, we are focused on delivering an improved operational and financial performance. Anna will take you through our financial performance division by division shortly, but let me cover first a few highlights. Barclays U.K. delivered a return on tangible equity of 23.4% for the quarter and over 20% year-to-date. We have seen a continued stabilization in deposit balances and gross lending trends are encouraging. We are on track to complete the acquisition of Tesco Bank on the first of November this year. This strategic relationship with the U.K.'s largest retailer, forms part of our commitment to invest in our home market, where Barclays has a crucial role to play in mobilizing the finance and investment which is required to deliver growth. Our partnership with Tesco will help create new distribution channels for our unsecured lending and deposit businesses. And our expertise in partnership cards developed over decades in the U.S. will further enhance the well-established Tesco Club Card Loyalty scheme. In the investment bank, we are committed to delivering improved RWA and operational productivity to drive higher returns. RoTE for Q3 was 8.8%. Year-on-year, the Investment Bank has delivered positive cost-to-income jaws and improved market share in investment banking. And the U.S. Consumer Bank delivered an improved ROTE performance at 10.9% as we continue to grow the business and drive operational improvements, while impairment charges reduced against the background of subdued inflation and a strong labor market. Overall, as an organization, we remain execution focused. We achieved a further \u00a3300 million of gross cost savings this quarter, taking the total for the first 9 months to \u00a3700 million, on track for our targeted \u00a31 billion for the full year 2024. Simplifying the bank has been an important part of our strategy. We continue to make progress with the nonstrategic business disposal that we spoke about at our investor update. Earlier this week, we announced the sale of our nonperforming Italian mortgage portfolio. Finally, we are about 2/3 of the way through executing the \u00a3750 million share buyback and which we announced in the first half of the year, which, together with the first half dividend is the first step towards achieving our target of greater than \u00a310 billion of capital return by 2026. I will now hand over to Anna to take you through our third quarter financials.\nAngela Cross: Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 6, we have laid out Barclays financial highlights for the third quarter as well as year-to-date. Profit before tax was \u00a32.2 billion up 18% from \u00a31.9 billion in Q3 '23. Before going into the detail, I would just note that the quarterly performance was impacted by a weaker U.S. dollar which is a headwind to income and profit, but positively impact costs, impairment and RWAs. I'll call these out where appropriate. Turning to Slide 7. Q3 performance is in line with the plan we laid out in February. We delivered a statutory ROTE of 12.3%, up on last year's 11%. And the year-to-date ROTE of 11.5% leaves us on track for our statutory ROTE target for 2024 of greater than 10%. We continue to target a 2024 ROTE, excluding inorganic activity of circa 10.5%. We now expect that the impact of all inorganic activity in 2024, including Tesco Bank will be broadly neutral. So I don't anticipate a material difference between the 2 measures. As in the first half of the year, I was looking for 4 things in our performance, income stability, cost discipline and progress on efficiency savings, credit performance and a robust capital position. On all 4, we are where we expected to be and I'll cover these in more detail on the subsequent slides. Starting with income on Slide 8. Total income was up 5% year-on-year at \u00a36.5 billion. Excluding FX income was up 7% year-on-year. Since our investor update in February, we have been emphasizing continued stability in our income streams. Revenues from retail and corporate as well as financing in the Investment Bank provided bust to our income profile and together contributed 74% of income in Q3. Turning to net interest income on Slide 9. Group NII, excluding investment bank and head office was stable year-on-year at circa \u00a32.8 billion. We now expect our full year group NII to be greater than \u00a311 billion. Within this, we have increased NII guidance for Barclays U.K. to circa \u00a36.5 billion having previously guided to circa 6.3. Both numbers exclude the impact of the Tesco Bank acquisition. We also now assume a U.K. bank rate of 4.5% by the end of the year or a total of 325 basis point cut in 2024 and compared to the 5 we had assumed in February. Deposits continue to stabilize and increased structural hedge income continued to provide a strong tailwind and as you can see on Slide 10. As a reminder, the structural hedge is designed to reduce volatility in NII and manage interest rate risk. As rates have risen, the hedge has dampened the growth in our NII and in a falling rate environment, we will see the benefit from the protection that it gives us. The expected NII tailwind from the hedge is significant and predictable. \u00a312.4 billion of aggregate gross income is now locked in over the 3 years to the end of 2026, up from \u00a311.7 billion at Q2. We have around \u00a3170 billion of hedges maturing between '24 and '26 at an average yield of 1.5%. As we said in February, reinvesting around 3/4 of this at around 3.5% would compound over the next 3 years to increase structural hedge income in 2026 and by circa \u00a32 billion versus 2023. Given the high proportion of balances hedged and the programmatic approach we take we are relatively insensitive to the short-term impact of potential rate cuts. Please note that we have added additional disclosure on Slide 38 in the appendix on the split of the structural hedge income allocation across our 5 divisions. Moving on to costs on Slide 11. I Total costs in Q3 were flat year-on-year at \u00a34 billion. Excluding FX, costs were up 2% in the same period. We delivered a further \u00a30.3 billion of gross efficiency savings, bringing the total for the 9 months to \u00a30.7 billion. These efficiencies have helped us to more than offset inflation and created capacity for investments. We remain on track to deliver \u00a31 billion for the year and continue to expect a further \u00a31 billion of efficiency savings across 2025 and 2026. Our cost-to-income ratio was 61% in Q3 and for the 9 months year-to-date. We remain on track for our full year target of around 63%. Turning now to impairment, where credit conditions continue to trend positively and in line with our expectations. The Q3 impairment charge of \u00a3374 million equated to a loan loss rate of 37 basis points. The U.S. consumer bank charge reduced \u00a3276 million, a loan loss rate of 411 basis points, which benefited from methodology enhancements in the quarter. Our U.K. customers continue to act prudently with few current signs of stress, evidenced by continued low and stable delinquencies. The Barclays U.K. charge was just \u00a316 million a loan loss rate of 3 basis points, and this included a post-model adjustment release of around \u00a350 million. I'd remind you that under IFRS 9 accounting, we expect to incur a day 1 impairment charge for the Tesco unsecured lending balances on completion in Q4. As we said in February, the Tesco Bank acquisition alongside our broader U.K. balance sheet growth plan are factored into our guidance for the Barclays U.K. loan loss rate to track towards 35 basis points over the life of our 3-year plan. All in all, we reiterate our through-the-cycle guidance of 50 to 60 basis points for the group and expect FY '24 to be at the bottom of this range inclusive of the estimated day 1 impact of Tesco Bank. Excluding the impact of Tesco Bank, we would expect to be below this range as we are seeing limited signs of stress in our U.K. customer base. And our guidance for the U.S. Consumer Bank impairment charge to improve overall in the second half remains unchanged. Looking now in more detail at the U.S. Consumer Bank charge on Slide 13. The mix of reserve build to write-off within the impairment charge for the U.S. Consumer Bank continues to trend as we guided. We expected write-offs to increase during 2024, which you can see is the case from the light blue bars on this page. 30 and 90-day delinquencies are broadly stable, and we expect them to follow seasonal trends. There is no change to our impairment guidance. As mentioned, we still expect the U.S. Consumer Bank impairment charge to improve overall in the second half, resulting in a lower full year charge in 2024 versus 2023. We and we continue to guide to a loan loss rate trending towards the long-term average of 400 basis points. Our coverage ratios remained strong. Our IFRS 9 coverage ratio reduced 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 10.3%, primarily driven by a debt sale whilst our CECL coverage ratio increased 20 basis points to 8.1%. Before going into individual business performance, let me say a few words on the lending trends that we are seeing. Gross lending activity is encouraging across our portfolios, reflecting our focus on growth in the U.K. In mortgages, we are seeing a pickup in gross lending with increased flow in higher loan-to-value lending and customer confidence is also returning with strong purchase activity with first-time buyers and home movers. In a similar vein, U.K. card acquisition volumes remained strong. we ever added around 800,000 new Barclay Card customers this year consistent with our strategy to regain market share in unsecured lending. In the U.K. Corporate Bank, we have extended client lending facilities by deploying around 1.2 billion additional RWAs this year which we expect to drive lending balance growth as customers draw down, and we have seen some evidence of this in Q3. Turning now to Barclays U.K. You can see Barclays U.K. financial highlights and targets on Slide 15, but I will talk to Slide 16. ROTE was 23.4% in the quarter and total income was \u00a31.9 billion, up \u00a373 million year-on-year or 4%. NII of \u00a31.7 billion was up \u00a369 million on an as NIM increased by 12 basis points to 3.34%. As you can see on the bottom chart, we saw continued structural hedge momentum and small tailwinds and from product margin and lending volumes. We have updated our 2024 the U.K. NII guidance to circa \u00a36.5 billion from circa \u00a36.3 billion, excluding Tesco Bank, reflecting balance sheet trends turning more positive earlier than expected. Non-NII was \u00a3280 million in Q3, and we continue to expect a run rate above \u00a3250 million per quarter going forward. Although we expect the securitization that we announced earlier in the week to have a modest negative impact on non-NII in Q4. Total costs were circa \u00a31 billion, down 4% year-on-year and versus Q2. demonstrating continued progress on delivering efficiency savings from the ongoing U.K. transformation. The cost-to-income ratio improved to 52% this quarter. Moving on to the Barclays U.K. customer balance sheet on Slide 17. The stabilization in deposit trends that we called out at Q2 has continued in Q3. Deposit balances reduced by \u00a30.5 billion in the quarter, a similar quantum to Q2. Net lending was broadly flat in the quarter at \u00a3199 billion. Within this, we saw growth in mortgages, cards and unsecured personal lending, offset by continued paydown of runoff portfolios notably government-backed lending in business banking. As Venkat mentioned, we have made good progress on the acquisition of Tesco Bank. Following the court process last week, we will complete the acquisition on first of November with estimated financials to be confirmed at full year '24 results. The current estimated day 1 financial impact is a circa \u00a30.3 billion net positive profit before tax, driven by an income gain resulting from consideration paid being below fair value, which is partially offset by our day 1 impairment charge. The impaired charge assumes all balances are required as Stage 1 loans, reflecting 12-month expected losses with subsequent impairment builds required in future years. The profit before tax benefit Statutory group ROTE in 2024 by about 50 basis points. Overall, and including the circa $7 billion RWAs, we expect to see around a 20 basis point negative impact to the group CET1 ratio, which is lower than the circa 30 basis points previously guided. Moving on to the U.K. Corporate Bank. U.K. Corporate Bank delivered Q3 ROTE of 18.8%. Income grew 1% year-on-year to \u00a3445 million. Non-NII was flat year-on-year, but down in the quarter, mainly due to a lower income from transactional products. This line can be variable due to the inclusion of non-product items such as liquidity pool income. However, we do expect non-NII to increase over time as we invest in our digital and lending proposition. Total costs were flat year-on-year at \u00a3222 million, with future investment spend expected as we continue to support our growth initiatives. Lending balances decreased by \u00a30.9 billion in the quarter as underlying growth was more than offset by a circa \u00a32 billion reduction due to refinements to the perimeter with the International Corporate Bank. This same adjustment also impacted deposit balances. Turning now to private banking and Wealth Management on Slide 22. Q3 ROTE was 29% and supported by strong growth in client assets and liabilities, up around \u00a33 billion on Q2 and around \u00a323 billion versus the prior year. Income reduced 3% year-on-year, driven by lower NII from the nonrepeat of a timing-related one-off in Q3 '23, which offset growth from increased client assets and liabilities. Versus Q2, NII was up 1%, driven by increased client balances overall. Costs were up 3% year-on-year as we continued to invest in this business, including in growing platform, hiring and efficiency-related measures. Turning now to the Investment Bank. ROE was 8.8%, up 0.8% year-on-year. Total income of $2.9 billion was up 6% year-on-year, and total costs up 4%, delivering positive cost to income jaws. Excluding FX, total income was up 9% year-on-year and costs up 7% year-on-year. RWA productivity measured by income over average RWAs was 5.7% in the quarter, 30 basis points better year-on-year with year-to-date RWA productivity at 6%. Period-end RWAs were $9.1 billion lower versus Q2 at \u00a3194 billion with FX accounting for around \u00a36 billion of the move. At Q2, we had an uptick in RWAs, which I said was temporary in nature the reduction we've seen this quarter, excluding FX, is a reversal of that. Now looking at the specific income line in more detail on Slide 25. Using the U.S. dollar figures as usual to help comparison to our U.S. peers. Markets income was up 7% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 7%, driven by a strong performance in credit, securitized products and fixed income financing. Equities income was up 7% and aided by strong performance in cash equities and equity derivatives as we help clients through market volatility in August. Financing income was up 6% year-on-year reflecting increased client flows and balances with this business delivering more than \u00a3750 million in 4 of the last 7 quarters. Investment Banking fee income in dollars was up 67% year-on-year with gains across all products, in particular, a strong quarter in advisory, which was up 146% on was up 55%, delivering improved performance across both investment-grade and leveraged finance was up 9% against a wallet that was down 6%. Our year-to-date banking fee share was 3.5%. We have increased share across most products in a rising industry wallet, but we still have work to do to sustainably improve this. Finally, in the international corporate bank, transaction banking was up 5%. We continue to grow U.S. deposit balances, which we see as a lead indicator of future client product take-up and fee income growth. This was more than offset by an \u00a385 million impact from fair value losses on leveraged finance lending, which are reported in corporate lending, resulting in total ICB income being down 21% year-on-year. Turning now to the U.S. consumer bank. U.S. Consumer Bank generated a ROTE of 10.9%, up from 0.4% in Q3 last year. mainly due to the lower impairment charge following a higher provision build in the second half of 2023. Income fell 2% year-on-year, driven by a weaker U.S. dollar. Excluding FX, income was up 2%, driven by an increase in card balances, which were up \u00a31.4 billion year-on-year on a reported basis to \u00a331.6 billion. NIM was stable on Q2 at 10.4%, but down from 10.9% in the prior year, reflecting higher rewards earned by customers through increased spend. In Q4, these impacts are expected to be less of a headwind, and we continue to target a NIM for this business of greater than 12% by 2026. In terms of the funding mix of the business, the proportion of core deposits was broadly stable versus Q2 at 66% as we target above 75% by 2026. We Costs were down 3% on the prior year as efficiency savings and the FX tailwind offset inflation and growth, driving a cost-to-income ratio of 50%. Excluding FX, costs were up 1%. We still expect costs to trend up modestly in Q4 as marketing spend during the holiday season will support continued growth in the business. Turning now to Slide 28 and the summary of the financial impact from inorganic activity announced in 2024. As a reminder, at our Q2 results, we announced the disposal of our performing Italian mortgage portfolio and the German cards business. Earlier this week, we announced the disposal of our nonperforming Italian mortgage portfolio, which is expected to complete in Q4 '24. These disposals, along with the Tesco Bank acquisition, have a broadly neutral impact on statutory 2024 group RoTE whilst causing a circa 10 basis point drag to the CET1 ratio. These transactions are a key component of reshaping the bank to be more focused in areas we have competitive strength, enabling us to deliver higher future returns. Turning now to the balance sheet and starting with our capital position. The CET1 ratio was 13.8% at the end of Q3 up 24 basis points versus Q2 and comfortably within our target range. This includes the impact of the ongoing \u00a3750 million half year buyback and that came off capital post the Q2 quarter end, 46 basis points of capital generated from profits in the quarter and a \u00a34 billion reduction in RWAs, excluding FX. We continue to expect this year's total capital return to be broadly in line with the 2023 level of \u00a33 billion, consistent with the capital distribution plan we laid out in February. Let me turn briefly to our regulatory capital and the upcoming changes under Basel 3.1 as well as the U.S. cards model migration. The combined expected RWA impact of \u00a319 billion to \u00a326 billion is in line with previous guidance of the lower end of 5% to 10% of group RWAs as at the end of 2023. However, the timing has changed for both items. You will have seen that the PRA's Basel 3.1 implementation date moved to 1 January 2026, and the impact is expected to be between billion post mitigation. The IRB migration of our U.S. cards portfolio has also moved from our prior expectation of Q1 2025 and will now take place after Basel III implementation, for which we are building a Basel-compliant model. The total impact to RWAs from the IRB migration still done at circa \u00a316 billion, of which around \u00a35 billion will be reflected at the time Basel 3.1 is implemented and is now included in our Basel 3.1 impact estimate. The remaining \u00a311 million relating to the IRB model will come after Basel 3.1 implementation at a date to be determined and is subject to model builds and portfolio changes over time. Specific to this, there is likely to be a modest increase in Pillar 2A applicable at some point in 2025 and until the model is implemented, reflecting the difference between modeled and the current standardized risk weighting acknowledging we already hold Pillar 2A capital against the majority of this risk. As previously noted, the total impact of Basel 3.1 will also depend on further guidance from the PRA on the approach to Pillar 2A, where we expect some offsets for risk now to be capitalized under Pillar 1. Risk-weighted assets decreased by \u00a311 billion from Q2 to \u00a3340.4 billion, as you can see in more detail on Slide 31. FX drove around \u00a37 billion of the reduction with lower investment bank and head office RWAs also contributing. As usual, a brief word on capital and liquidity on Slide 32. And we maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. Turning now to NAV. NAV per share increased 11p in the quarter and 35p year-on-year to 351p. Of the elements we controlled attributable profit added 11p per share in the quarter and the share buyback, which reduced our share count by 2% added 2p per share. We have seen further unwind of the negative movements in the cash flow hedge reserve in 2022 to 2023, which caused a drag on shareholders' equity and this added 9p in the quarter. These positive moves were partially offset by dividends paid and other reserve movements. In summary, we remain focused on disciplined execution. This is the third quarter of progress against the targets that we laid out in February, which we are either reiterating today or upgrading. Thank you for listening. Moving now to Q&A. As usual, please could you keep to a maximum of 2 questions so we can get around to everyone in good time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Napier from UBS.\nJason Napier: Two questions on Slide 16, please, which is the Barclays U.K. margin and NII walk. Just first, and I appreciate the reiteration of guidance around hedge tailwinds into next year. But I just noticed that the quarter-on-quarter tailwind there is -- it's down about 1/3, and it looks to us like maturing swaps and incoming stop should have been fairly stable, down about 30 basis points each in the period. And so I just wonder how you think about the sort of quarter-to-quarter volatility around this component of NII trying to avoid a situation where we worry unduly about nearer-term dynamics from that? And then secondly, on the same chart, quite surprising to see the product margin as a net positive. Can I just confirm, please, that includes whatever the leads and lags on depository pricing there are? There's some feedback in the investment community that perhaps Barclays hasn't been able to cut deposit rates as others have done as rate cuts began. I just wonder whether you could talk about what you're seeing on deposit pass-through as rates start to decline. I just confirm that I'm looking at the right block when I look to track that going forward.\nAngela Cross: Thanks, Jason. Thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll take back those. So just looking at Slide 16, I can see why you\u2019re asking the question. The structural hedge impact is lower than the previous quarter. Last quarter, the product dynamic was negative, now it\u2019s positive. So I\u2019ll pick those up in turn. I mean last quarter, we did have a slightly higher swap rate, as you point out, but we also topped up the hedge a little bit, particularly around business banking. That\u2019s now obviously in a run rate. So it\u2019s no longer causing that sort of quarter-on-quarter impact. Sort of going forward from here, we\u2019re going to continue to see momentum from the structural hedge. You can see that from the other disclosures that we\u2019ve given you, for example, on Page 10. So I still expect it to be a net tailwind overall to this business and really supporting the NII growth that we\u2019re seeing. So nothing more really than that. On the product margin, you\u2019re right, that does include all product margins, so it\u2019s including assets and liabilities. I think important to point out that some of the drags that we\u2019ve seen historically are no longer there. So you\u2019re no longer seeing that really significant deposit drag from migration coming through. Actually, our mortgage position is broadly neutral from a churn perspective now. So you\u2019re no longer seeing that. What Iu are seeing Is some positive momentum from both mortgage and card margins, which is a little bit offset by deposit pricing, as you point out. But actually, I\u2019d expect given the kind of regulatory lag that we have in deposit pricing for that to be more meaningful, that lag impact to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter. So a bit a lot of small numbers here because it is only a quarter-on-quarter movement, and it is only 6%, but that\u2019s the things that I would call out. Okay. Perhaps we could go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Benjamin Toms from RBC.\nBenjamin Toms: The first one, thank you for the new disclosure around the structural hedge income around how that should be allocated to the group like me that's like Christmas came early. One of your peers this week implied they expect the structural hedge notional to be flattish from here. Based on your guidance for February and movements in the notional since year-end, I think you're actually expecting a 13% reduction in the notional from here. do you really expect to see such a big reduction going forward given you mentioned just previously, the stabilization in deposits? Or can we assume that, that assumption is now somewhat stale. And then secondly, just a chance my luck on 2025. One of your peers guided to a gradual increase in NIM in 2025 in the U.K. Should we expect a similar trend at Barclays?\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thank you, I\u2019ll take both of those. So yes, please put that disclosure in on Page 38, you haven\u2019t seen it. I mean we often talk about the structural hedge and the support that it gives to the U.K. I guess, in absolute percentage terms, that\u2019s where it is most meaningful, but it does provide support elsewhere in the group, particularly through the equity structural hedge. So you\u2019ll see perhaps surprising to many that it\u2019s providing some support into the IB and because we allocate that equity portion by RWAs. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. But the structural hedge notional I\u2019m not going to give you specific guidance spend, but what I would say is we\u2019d expect it to sort of trend broadly in line with where the deposits are going. When we spoke in February, that was less guidance, more sort of a framework to help you model it as time goes on. So we talked about I 170 billion of maturing and rolling about \u00be of that. But that was designed really to give you the math that you could that you could then update rather than a forecast itself. So clearly, as we look at the moment, there are some positives in there, but we will continue to update you as we go through. But I wouldn\u2019t call out anything more than we should expect it to move in line with deposits. On your second question, I\u2019m not going to talk about NIM then is going to be quite \u2013 it\u2019s going to move around quite a lot over the next few quarters. As you can imagine, we\u2019re about to onboard I 8 billion worth of unsecured lending. That\u2019s going to move the NIM materially. What I would really focus you on is actually the net interest income. So we\u2019ve upgraded our net interest income for the group and for the U.K. in the curre\u2019t year. So now we're expecting circa \u00a36.5 billion for the U.K. And if I take you back to what we said in February, we said we expected mid-single-digit growth in NII in the U.K. We still expect that. And what\u2019s driving that? Well, clearly, we\u2019ve got asset growth coming through what was a drag coming from deposits. We now see a stabilization. And hopefully, as deposits start to grow across the market, we would see the same. And whilst we\u2019ve got some uncertainty coming through from rate changes, I would offset that with the kind of momentum that we've got from the structural hedge. So we are expecting NII to be higher in '25 and in \u201826 than it has been in \u201824. And that\u2019s, obviously, we would be putting Tesco on top of that. Okay. Thanks, Ben. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Cant from Autonomous.\nChris Cant: I wanted to talk about the head office, please.\nAngela Cross: Gosh, Chris, we can't hear you, sorry. Could you start again, please? We picked up head office, but perhaps you could start the question again?\nChris Cant: Yes. Can you hear me now?\nAngela Cross: Yes, we can. Loud and clear. Thank you.\nChris Cant: Hello. Okay. Okay. Great. Yes. So head office, I wanted to ask about looking into '25, '26. Could you give us some color on what the sort of underlying group center numbers look like after the various mortgage books have gone and the German card books have gone. I think this is a source of significant dispersion within consensus how people are thinking about sort of the underlying head office, and it has been an area where historically, consensus has got a little bit out of kilt with your own expectations. So any color on once the transactions you've currently got in the pipeline are done what does that group center income cost run rate look like? And I appreciate that there's still the payments business in there, which may or may not go at some point. But sort of what's the sort of go-to run rate, how things stand for the transactions once the transactions you've got in train are done? And then on BUK NII, just a point of clarification. So it's mid-single-digit growth on the 2024 number, excluding Tesco and then we put Tesco on top. So take essentially the 6.5 that you're now guiding mid-single-digit growth on that and then \u00a3400 million on top is what you're saying for 2025?\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thanks, Chris. Let me pick up both of those. So the first one, look, I appreciate head office has been a bit volatile in the current year, both because it's housing or inorganic activity and those businesses before they actually flow out. So just to remind you, there's no inorganic activity in the current quarter. You can also get some volatility in there from educating. So we're seeing a bit of that in the quarter, but year-to-date, that is a 0 number, and we expect it to be timing only. It's a bit early to guide you to what that run rate is, Chris, but we will do that in time. But just to remind you, nothing in the current quarter and just appreciate it's very difficult to model at the moment. But once we get beyond that, we'll give you more guidance. On the BUK NII, let me just clarify for you. So ex Tesco, I expect some increase. the mid-single-digit guidance that we gave you for BUK did include Tesco because that was from '23 to '26. So we include Tesco, obviously, in our RWA bridge to \u00a330 billion, and it's included in the mid-single. So I would say, overall, we're expecting some organic ad test go on top to that. Is that clearer?\nChris Cant: Thank you.\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thank, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Firth from KBW.\nEdward Firth: Thanks for the questions. Sorry. Yes, I have 2 questions. One was just on the U.K. interest rate sensitivity. It's quite striking that you're not highlighting to get at all as an impact this quarter. I think you said it was minimal or marginal. I can't remember your exact words in terms of your sensitivity rates falling going forward. And I'm just trying to understand a commentary you could just help us understand why that is? Is that just like a temporary thing? And as the hedge rolls off, then you would expect some more sensitivity? Or is there something that you sort of structurally changed is obviously on the way up, we saw NII grow very strongly on the back of higher rates. So that's 1 question. And then the other question was on the U.S. the margin there. I get your comments about you're still targeting greater than 12%. And I think you said there was a lot of incentive programs or loyalty programs that you were running at the moment. And just again, any help you could give us to understand from a business perspective, how that works? Because I do obviously the U.S. loyalty program is a huge part of the business. It's a huge part of attracting volumes and customers, et cetera. And I'm just trying to think what is it you're expecting to change in the market more broadly? Or how is your offering going to change that's going to allow you to reduce those loyalty offerings but still maintain momentum in the business.\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thanks, Ed. I will take both of those. On the first one, we gave you some guidance on the interest rate sensitivity in the previous quarter, and that really shows for a 25 basis point parallel shift, it was Good morning. 50 million in the first year. And then what you saw was that build over time. And that build over time. The way I think about it, Ed, is in the first year, it\u2019s dominated by the lag effect. So the sort of 60-day regulatory lag that we have, particularly in the U.K. And then in the outer years, you see the impact of the h\u2019dge grinding lower in response to that parallel movement. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on there. If I go back to what I said in products for that product margin on Page 16, just to clarify, we\u2019ve got 2 offsetting impact in that. There is a negative movement from the delay in pricing or repricing the liabilities. But there is an offset, which is coming through from our asset margins, which are expanding. Now you might expect that in a downward movement. Sort of overall, we would expect that as a liability margin start to compress, you see asset margins widening out. And of course, we\u2019ve got specific actions around things like high loan-to-value mortgages that are perhaps driving that a little bit faster. And so it's not that it's not there. I\u2019's just that there are some offsets. And actually, I would expect a bit more of that lag just because of the way the months sort of pan out in. On your second question on U.S. margin, yes, the NIM is clearly lower than it was at the beginning of the year and indeed last year. But our expectation is that this is still a greater than 12% NIM business. And all of the actions that we are taking to underpin that are taking place. So in the current quarter, and if you look sort of sequentially across the last few quarters, there\u2019s a few things going on. There\u2019s natural seasonality in this business. So you see more purchase activity, more borrowing activity as you go into the holiday season, which is much more seasonal in the U.S. than it is in the U.K. So you\u2019ll see that natural shape. The second thing is, remember, we did that risk transfer in Q1. What that meant was we swapped out NII for fee income, but obviously, it\u2019s roti accretive overall. So you see some movement in the geography of the P&L and the balance sheet. And then thirdly, as we've called out, there are\u2019a couple of things that we\u2019re just observing as a customer master. Actually, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re unhelpful, but there are 2. The first is that customers are \u2013 they\u2019re managing their balance as well, they\u2019re repaying, perhaps a little bit faster than we expected. In the context of the broader discussions about the U.S. economy, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unhelpful and we see the other side of it in positive impairments. So we\u2019re not uncomfortable with that. The second point is that customers are using their awards not necessarily more, but faster than we would have previously expected. Again, long term, for the franchise whilst that puts a bit of a headwind into near-term NIM. It means they\u2019re really engaged with the [indiscernible]. They\u2019re really engaged with the brand program. So it\u2019s good news. So that kind of explains Q3. As I go beyond Q3 and think about that build to greater than 12. The deals that we talked about in February were our #1 repricing, that repricing action has actually taken place, it\u2019s complete. But what happens is customers have to actually purchase under the new terms and conditions. So it\u2019s going to drift through into NIM over time. The second action was really around the funding mix. So we are now around 7% of retail funding. We want to get that to around 75%. That\u2019s going to take a while for us to build. But we\u2019ve launched the tiered savings products that will underpin that, and you\u2019ll see more on that in time. So those things are really important. The last thing I would add is a key part of that move to 12 is how we start to morph this portfolio towards having a richer mix in retail. And you can see that we\u2019ve announced our new partnership with Good morning. That again, is another plank of the strategy. So we\u2019re not going to get to 12% or greater than 12% immediately. You\u2019re going to see it sort of emerge over the next few quarters. But greater than 12% is still our target, and we feel like we\u2019re on track. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Guy Stebbings from BNP Paribas.\nGuy Stebbings: I had one on capital and then 1 back to product margins in U.K. On Captain on Slide 30. Thanks a lot for clarifying the various timings. And clearly, some of the moves being pushed out in the U.S. consumer business. I'm just wondering if that changes how you manage capital in theory, it sort of frees up some capital in the next 12 months to perhaps distribute a little bit more early in the plan? Or should we think that you're more likely to run at the very top end of the 13% to 14% range, maybe even above it, especially if there's a Pillar 2A temporary uptick? Just thinking about how you think about that capital ratio during 2025 now as you have to wait for 26 for some of those come through. And then on the product margins, I just come back to that point in terms of the lag effects and saying it might be more meaningful in Q4 in deposits. I would have thought there'd be some sort of catch-up from the August rate cut, if you like, and you take the day 1 hit on the unhedged deposits and you have to wait to pass some of it back on the rate card. So I just checked that sort of thinking is correct. And your comment around the lag effect been greater in Q4 is maybe reflection of an assumption of 2 rate cuts. And then maybe if it was just 1 rate cut, it wouldn't be as more powerful versus what you saw in Q3.\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thanks, Guy. I\u2019ll take both of those. I\u2019m hoping Venkat\u2019s going to get a question at some point. But just on the first one, our own capital, Look, these regulatory movements that we set out for you on Page 30 are timing and timing only. And we\u2019d reiterate today our expectation about distributions here. So greater than I 10 billion for the 3 years of the plan. For the current year, we\u2019d expect it to be broadly similar to last year, so around I 3 billion. And we said in February that we would expect it to be progressive thereafter. And I\u2019d just say exactly the same today. Q4 is normally when we talk about distributions, and we\u2019ll do so then. But we see this really around timing and you would expect us to build capital as we head towards both Basel and the IRB implementation. Just on product margins. Really what I was referring to is you\u2019ve got sort of about a month\u2019s worth of that lag in Q3. You\u2019re going to see the remainder of it in Q4, and we are expecting because we use consensus. So consensus has got 3 rate cuts in the current year. We\u2019re expecting a couple of rate cuts in Q4. So you\u2019re going to see impacts in Q4 and actually into Q1 of next year. Okay. Thank you, guy, Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Goel from Mediobanca.\nAmit Goel: So two questions from me. So one, just related to the product margin. But essentially, just on the U.K. business, I kind of see the balance sheet still contracting a little bit in terms of total loan balances and deposit balances versus, I guess, some of your peers showing a little bit of growth now. So just kind of curious the interplay between the kind of the pricing, which goes into that product margin versus balance sheet growth? And when can we start to see a bit more organic growth and capital redeployment into the BUK business? And the second question just relating to the U.S. consumer business. I'm just curious how significant or not to the American Airlines partnership, if there's any color you can give there in terms of the contribution of that piece to the border business.\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thanks. I'll take the first of those and then hand to Venkat. So it's probably helpful if we start on the sort of leading indicators page that I that we've included this time. It's on Page 14. And if I take you back to February, what we said in February was we didn't expect significant change in the net balance sheet, particularly in the U.K. in the current year. And that was because of our expectation and the known maturities that we have, not just the mortgages, but for example, in business banking. What we did expect was the change in the gross production a comfort that we are driving that gross production. So in mortgages, it's relatively straightforward. It's actually our gross lending. You can see that stepping forward quarter-on-quarter. It's obviously helped by the fact that the mortgage market itself is strong and robust. But also the fact that we are broadening out our range within that market, and we're really putting Kensington to work now, which we've been unable to do over the last few years. The second point is on card acquisitions, and you can see that meaningful step-up in '24, but we've already started that journey in 2023. And actually, what you see over time is that those cars volumes will start to feed into interest-earning lending. And then finally, on U.S., U.K., CB, I know you're not asking about corporate here, but it's a bit more difficult there because clearly, what you do is you put out lines to clients which is shown here in terms of RWAs. And then those clients in time will draw down on them. So in terms of what happening in terms of lead indicators in the balance sheet, I'm happy we're going in the right direction. In BUK, specifically, we saw positive net lending in the businesses that we've got in focus. So we saw positive net lending in mortgages. We're seeing it in cards. What we've got offsetting that is some runoffs in portfolios, which are obviously no longer call is not the right word. But if I use the example of government lending within business banking, I don't think that's different, either in percentage terms or sort of in directional terms from our peers. You're hearing similar things there. So I think we're happy overall. And obviously, as we increase our card lending, you get a mix impact as we've increased the proportion of lending at higher loan to values, you get a mix impact, and that's really what's flowing into the product margin and giving that positive.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes. Look, Amit, on cards, obviously, we will not talk about any specific account until there is time to talk about the right time to talk about in the contract, we have something to say. We also do not talk about individual client profitability or financials. We announced a couple of days ago, and so we're speaking about that. And if there's news on any other clients, we'll tell you at the right time.\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thanks, Amit. Perhaps we can go to the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Hallam: So two for me as well. First, in the IB, if we think about the gradual rebalancing of that business, clearly, dynamics in the quarter for DCM were very strong, both for you and across the street. But given the organic reduction in RWAs you saw in the quarter in the IB and the improvement in asset productivity, year-over-year. Are you starting to make those selective decisions to deemphasize DCM? And where are you comfortable doing less, I guess. And when we think about reallocating those RWAs into the financing businesses, should we sort of assume \u00a3750 million as a floor for market financing revenues, assuming supportive markets? That's the first topic. And then second on Tesco. So thank you for the additional disclosure in the update today. So what steps are you planning to take over the next sort of 12 to 24 months to improve the product margins in Tesco Bank. If I look at asset productivity or NII versus RWAs, it's quite a bit lower in Tesco Bank than the rest of the U.K. business, looking at the \u00a3400 million and the \u00a37 billion. So how are you planning to scale NII faster than RWAs to optimize that capital resourcing question?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Right. So Chris, let me take the IB and then Anna will talk about Tesco. On the IB, first of all, big picture, we're looking to keep RWAs in absolute terms, relatively flat to their current number of around 200 billion. The relative reduction in RWAs as a percentage of the group happens because the rest of the group growth. Second, in the Anderson Bank [indiscernible] came down by about \u00a39 billion this quarter compared to the previous one, but about \u00a36 billion of that was due to FX and 3 was actual action. And 1% up and down or 1.5% up and down in the quarter is normal business mix. Third, we are not looking to deal the CCM. What we are looking to do is within the investment bank, be prudent in assigning capital to clients, looking at the totality of their relationship, and that relationship is not just DCM, but it includes M&A and equities and what corporate banking, we do with them. And that's the way to think about it. And lending is a part of it. Lending is not the only part of it, and we don't want lending to be the main part of it. And as far as revenue of \u00a3750 million from financing, look, we've been stable at that number. What I would say is while we have been gaining clients and gaining market share in that business, the actual revenue is a function of 2 things. It's a function of what happens in the composition of balances, fixed income and equity and so what the markets do as well as spreads within that. So I can't tell you that is going to stay at this level or not go up or down. It depends on that mix. What we do think we have is a diversified business between fixed income and equities, a competitive business in both but particularly strong fixed income business and a diversified business among the types of clients who use it regionally, product-wise and within fixed income asset class is, meaning spread versus govern. So that's what we think contributes to a good and stable mix, but I'm reluctant to put sort of floors and ceilings on numbers.\nAngela Cross: Thanks, Chris. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is if I take that \u00a3 9 billion reduction, \u00a3 6 billion was FX as Venkat said, the other \u00a3 3 billion was just the reversal of the client positioning that we saw that we said was temporary. So it just kind of brings us back to where we started at the beginning of the year. On Tesco, for the next year or so, for the next sort of 12 to 18 months, our focus is really on integration and our focus will be on customer service. So that is our primary focus as it would be in any partnership as it was in GAAP in the U.S. So this is just a replication of what we would do with any other partner across the firm. Over time, we would expect this to be rote accretive for a number of reasons, whether that be efficiency, whether that be funding benefits that you might expect to accrue. And obviously, we\u2019ll update you on that in sort of in the course of time. But really, our objective over the short term is going to be to integrate it well and really ensure that, that customer experience is foremost.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley.\nAlvaro de Tejada: A couple of questions on the Investment Bank for me, please. First of all, on the fee performance, obviously, very strong in the quarter. But similar to Q2 where you called out a large deal there, is there any lumpy deals that we should bear in mind is the performance sustainable? I'm guessing ultimately, I'm asking about the pipeline from here given the strong performance? And second is on the leveraged finance marks. It feels like it's a bit of a hard quarter to take those marks and with credit spreads actually very tight. So maybe could you give us a bit of color on what's driving that? Is it portfolio? Is it a single sort of ticket or are you looking to sell something in the mark? Or should we expect more of this in the coming quarters? Just a bit of color on this.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: I'll take the first question, and then Anna will take the last question. So on fee performance in Q3, nothing special to call out, look, we are part of certain larger deals, but I wouldn't say that unduly if there's anything I would call out. And as I've said elsewhere, we've obviously seen activity pick up over this year compared to the previous year. We expect it to continue to be relatively firm. Obviously, there are a couple of wild cuts out there in terms of what happens with the U.S. elections and economic policy and rent policy in the U.S. on M&A activity after that. But assuming no major surprises or changes, we expect to continue to see it to be firm.\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thanks, Venkat. So let me pick up that second one, Alvaro. I mean [indiscernible] is a really important part of our business. And you\u2019re right, in the current environment, what we see is that market overall performing really well. Deals are clearing quickly. Occasionally, we find that either some of those don\u2019t. That is episodic. It\u2019s a feature of our business. It\u2019s a feature of the market overall and not something that we would particularly call out. So it\u2019s normal. What we do at the end of every single quarter as we assess our balance sheet and we use prevailing market information in order to assess the fair value of that balance sheet. And where we feel we need to take more than we do, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in the current quarter. So it\u2019s very much BAU and as I say, it occasionally occurs it\u2019s episodic. I wouldn\u2019t comment on clients as we would never do. I would just remind you also that this is a book which have some hedging set against it. The cost of that hedging also flows through corporate lending. So we protect ourselves in that way. And I would say, overall, our exposures are probably, whilst they\u2019re higher than \u201823, they\u2019re lower than they have been historically. So it\u2019s a well risk-managed book. And really, this is sort of the kind of thing we see normally, but on an episodic basis. Thanks, Alvaro. Perhaps we could go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Pierce from Jefferies.\nJonathan Pierce: I've got two, please. The first is -- I'm sorry, it's back on rate sensitivity. Thanks for the hedge allocation data, again, by the way, helps us a bit more precise in the tailwinds there in Barclays U.K. The piece that's sort of struggling with a bit is the rate sensitivity. But the \u00a350 million in year 1, I hear what you're saying about a lot of that being related to deposit back. But if this \u00a340 billion of hedge maturities a year as per guidance, you'd have thought a 25 basis point shift in the curve, would be knocking \u00a350 million out of the hedge income in year 1. So I'm not quite sure what's going on here. Are you saying that there is no impact on what we might call managed margin from a 25 basis point rate reduction at all, just simply because the structural hedge is now so large in the context of the deposit book. So it would be helpful just to understand why that is so low. I mean it's the lowest in the sector. quite difficult to triangulate. The second question -- sorry, this is just for the models really assets into year-end, there's 2 bits that like a bit of clarity on Barclays U.K. saw a \u00a34 billion increase in the early part of the year for methodology, policy changes. At the time you said that would partially reverse over the rest of the year. It doesn't seem like it has reversed yet. Is that coming in Q4? And then in the other direction, the year 1, I think, is pointing to about a \u00a32.5 billion of risk increase in the fourth quarter. Is that about the right number to be sticking in the spreadsheet?\nAngela Cross: Okay, Jonathan. Let me take the first one. So I would say we said \u00a3170 billion over 3 years, so I think you're probably closer to around \u00a360 billion of hedge maturing. And really, what's going on here is Remember, you've got that underlying maturing rate at around 1.5%. So even though rates are coming down, you're still getting a pickup from the structural hedge. And it's only really in the outer years when that grinds out that you're seeing that more meaningful difference. So I think it's nothing more than that, but we can talk you through that outside of here, if that's helpful. As it relates to our relative sensitivity, we talked about this quite a bit as rates went up because we were clearly less rate sensitive on the way up. So you'd expect us to be less sensitive on the way down. So that is exactly what's coming through right now. Perhaps we hedge a little bit more. We certainly hedge more proactively, we are looking forward and assessing that on a monthly basis and adjusting those hedges very, very actively as we go to reflect the detail of customer and client behavior. So I think it's a benefit of that approach that we're seeing and the fact that we've just done this very programmatically over a very long period of time. We're not seeking here to have any kind of view as to where rates will go. We're just lifting the hedge roll and we're reacting to we're reacting to customer behavior. And on the second question, I think we'll have to come back to you on that 1 on op risk. So let us do that. Venkat, do you want to [indiscernible]?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: I just want to emphasize the final point Anna made on structural hedging. This is programmatic. This is a hedge. We try to understand as best we can positive behavior, deposit balances, customer behavior affecting that and hedge it. And as Anna said, therefore, if it works very well, it should provide you with the protection, meaning you don't see the benefits as rates rise as much as you would otherwise. And you see -- you don't see the losses as rates fall, meaning that your NII remains more stable because of that. And that's what we are trying to do and what Anna said is perfectly right about that.\nJonathan Pierce: Yes. And sorry to just follow up on that. I mean, I'm fully behind the idea of hedging. That's not the issue. Just to check, though, Anna, I thought the rate sensitivity table ignored any sort of yield pickup on the hedge. I thought it was purely if the yield curve is 25 basis points lower, this is the impact on us, in which case, if you're reinvesting \u00a340 billion of hedge a year at 25 basis points less that's the entirety of average out over the year, the entirety of the \u00a350 million you're pointing to in year 1, which just implies everything else is nothing. Just checking that's the case.\nAngela Cross: Yes. It\u2019s just very small in year 1, Jonathan. Let us take it outside with you. We\u2019ll come back to you. All right. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robin Down from HSBC.\nRobin Down: And also thank you for the added disclosure on the structural hedge, that's very useful. Apologies, but I'm going to bring you back to the U.K. interest income issue. And I think it is important because it's the main topic of conversation amongst investors this morning. If we look at your \u00a36.5 billion guide for this year. It kind of implies a Q4 run rate ex Tescos of kind of \u00a36.8 billion, \u00a36.9 billion. If we add in kind of \u00a3400 million for Tesco is we're at kind of 7.3%, I think you're looking to grow next year. I think especially given the product hedge is in the U.K., but the structural hedge benefit is more than going to outweigh any kind of rate reduction impact. So why are you not going to end up materially above the 7.1% that consensus has penciled in next year. Is there something I'm missing some big kind of negative drag that you're anticipating.\nAngela Cross: So Robin, I'm not going to comment on consensus income for 2025 at this stage. But I'm just going to reiterate the fundamentals of what we're talking about here, which is U.K., we expect over the plan to have NIR growth of mid-single digit, Tesco is part of that. You can see that there is NII momentum in the business organically. We've called that out. You can see it over the last 2 quarters. It's coming from us at growth. It's coming from the momentum from the structural hedge. Now as I said before, we haven't really seen the full impact of the rate cuts yet, but we would still expect the net of all of that into 2025 to be positive. And then obviously, you're going to have Tesco [indiscernible].\nRobin Down: [indiscernible] interest income forecast would be U.K. for this year coming up from what an original kind of 6.1. can I put it slightly differently then? Is there any reason why I can't annualize Q4 at kind of \u00a36.9 million and add \u00a3400 million for Tesco's. And so I have a starting base of 7.3 when I look at 2025 numbers?\nAngela Cross: So Robin, you\u2019re right. We have upgraded our BUK guidance. So we did start at 6.1, and we\u2019re now around 6.5. And really what\u2019s happening here is, clearly, there is a change in our expectation of rates for the current year. We started in a position where \u2013 we started in a position where we had 5 rate cuts in February. Now we\u2019re expecting 3. And then the other 3, including the 1 we\u2019ve already had, so a further 2. And then the other thing that\u2019s happening here is clearly we\u2019ve seen a stabilization in that balance sheet earlier than we expected to. The beginning of the year, I said I expected the balance sheet to get smaller before it got bigger. We\u2019ve seen 2 quarters now, nearly 3 quarters of real stabilization in deposits, perhaps a bit earlier than we expected. And we\u2019ve seen the asset momentum turn perhaps a little bit earlier than we expected. I'\u2019 not going to comment on your numbers for 2025. I\u2019m really going to leave that to you, but just bring you back to our expectation that we expect NII for the U.K. to grow. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Perlie Mong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nPerlie Mong: So can I -- sorry, can I bring you back to the hedge. So Obviously, the hedge is a very large component of the way you manage the interest rate risk. So with the scale of the hedge, does that mean that your sensitivity to long rates would be higher than perhaps other banks or your peers? Or just all else equal, would you expect more sensitivity to the long rates? Because the reason I'm asking is because there's obviously been a lot of discussion around neutral rates in Europe and in the U.K. So I'm just wondering, is the reason why your sensitivity is a bit lower in a parallel shift to narrows because maybe there's a little bit of difference between a short end and the long end? And so that's the first part of the question. And the second part is that it sounds like the notional is more stable than you -- than we might have expected previously. And you previously assumed a reinvestment of 75% of the maturing hedges. I guess the question is, does it matter whether you reinvest or just simply let it roll off? Because obviously, you're reinvesting into a higher yield is a positive. But equally, if you runoff at a 1.5% hedge and then just sort of let it roll on to the variable rate that is removing negative and removing the drag. So does that matter whether you're reinvesting or not?\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thanks, Perlie. I will take both of those. The first is a tenor of what we\u2019re hedging is between 2 and 7. So I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re any more sensitive to the long end of the curve than others. We really try and reflect what we think the varying behavioral lives of the different pockets of deposits that we have. So I wouldn\u2019t call that out as a key difference. And then on your second point, just to bring everybody back to this, the I 75 million and the I 170 million was indicated to give you some math that you could then update as we go rather than a specific forecast from us. To the extent that the notional is more stable. I mean clearly, we have a choice every single quarter or every single month as it rolls. At the moment, you\u2019re right, we\u2019re getting a pickup from that maturity as it rolls off even if we just left it overnight. The difference that the structural hedge gives you is obviously secures it. So the structural hedge gives you certainty, which is why we do it programmatically, and why we\u2019re really focused on how much income are we locking in \u201825 and \u201826, which we\u2019ve shown you again on Page 10. So that locked-in number is now I 12.4 billion over the 3 years. So for us, it\u2019s really about the certainty and stability of NII rather than the opportunists kind of every month passing. And just to remind you, that equivalent number was 8.6 in February. Okay. Thank you, Perlie. I think we are going to our last question in the queue, please.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Andrew Coombs from Citi Group.\nAndrew Coombs: Two questions, 1 more precise on board. On the precise question, just Pillar 2 offset. You talked about the per 2 modest increase followed by a part offset of the later RWA inflation, it's probably too early, but anything you can provide in terms of quantum. And does that potentially even change your 13% to 14% core Tier 1 ratio target? So that's the first question. Second question, a much more broad-based question, but budget. Looking into the budget, thinking about both the U.K. business and the investment bank, I assume we don't get a bank tax. Is there anything else you're particularly looking at in terms of when you're thinking about future customer activity, be that CGT and the buy-to-let market be employers national insurance contributions and the SMEs, et cetera, et cetera.\nAngela Cross: Okay. Thank you, Andy. So really too early to say. What we called out here is that as you can imagine, in advance of implementing this model, -- we actually have been holding some Pillar 2A already. There may be some modest increase in that before we implement the model in full. So that's all we're calling out. It's difficult to give any specific guidance around quantum or exact timing, but you'll note that we said modest. And just reiterating, we are already holding Pillar 2A for this. And then the other point I'd make is that, obviously, we still await some Basel guidance from the PRA. So there is some expectation that we'll get some guidance around Pillar 2 offset where they're really trying to avoid double counting between Pillar 1 and Basel and Pillar 2A that exists currently. And really, we need to see all this put together holistically before we give you firmer guidance.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: And on budget, listen, obviously, we're a large U.K. bank, which operates across different sectors of the economy. So whether it's taxation, whether it's borrowing and financing by the government, whether it is private investment and helping with public investment, whether it's individual investment behavior that comes out of whatever the budget says, we would expect to see activity across everything which we do. I can't tell you where and how much and what the net of it is, but expect us to be actively engaged across all the different dimensions of it. With that, thank you, everybody.\nAngela Cross: Yes. Thank you very much, everybody. I really look forward to seeing some of you on the road, and we will see you at the sell-side breakfast in November. But thank you for your continued interest in Barclays. Have a great day.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

        "text": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Barclays at Third Quarter 2024 Results Call. As a reminder, at our investor update in February, we set out a 3-year plan to deliver a better run, more strongly performing and higher return in Barclays. I'm encouraged by our progress to you then. We are continuing to execute in a disciplined way against this plan and are on track to achieve our 2024 as well as our 2025 target. Return on tangible equity was 12.3% in the third quarter and 11.5% year-to-date. We achieved this even as we grew tangible book value by 0.35p per share year-on-year to 3.51p at the end of the quarter. This resulted from strong organic capital generation and the meaningful impact of buybacks in reducing our share count. Total income for Q3 was \u00a36.5 billion and is \u00a319.8 billion year-to-date with a continued focus on the quality and stability of our income mix. Given the ongoing healthy support from our structural hedge, we remain confident on the strength of the income profile of our business in its falling rate environment. These factors lead to our upgrading Barclays U.K. as well as group NII targets today. We continue to control costs well and are seeing the benefit of the cost actions, which we took in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our cost-to-income ratio was 61%, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. Impairment charges have improved in the U.S. consumer bank in line with our expectations, and our overall credit performance was strong, particularly in the U.K. with a group loan loss rate of 42 basis points year-to-date and 37 basis points in the quarter. Importantly, we also remain well capitalized, ending the quarter with a 13.8% CET1 ratio comfortably within our target range of 13% to 14%. Across the bank and within each of our 5 divisions, we are focused on delivering an improved operational and financial performance. Anna will take you through our financial performance division by division shortly, but let me cover first a few highlights. Barclays U.K. delivered a return on tangible equity of 23.4% for the quarter and over 20% year-to-date. We have seen a continued stabilization in deposit balances and gross lending trends are encouraging. We are on track to complete the acquisition of Tesco Bank on the first of November this year. This strategic relationship with the U.K.'s largest retailer, forms part of our commitment to invest in our home market, where Barclays has a crucial role to play in mobilizing the finance and investment which is required to deliver growth. Our partnership with Tesco will help create new distribution channels for our unsecured lending and deposit businesses. And our expertise in partnership cards developed over decades in the U.S. will further enhance the well-established Tesco Club Card Loyalty scheme. In the investment bank, we are committed to delivering improved RWA and operational productivity to drive higher returns. RoTE for Q3 was 8.8%. Year-on-year, the Investment Bank has delivered positive cost-to-income jaws and improved market share in investment banking. And the U.S. Consumer Bank delivered an improved ROTE performance at 10.9% as we continue to grow the business and drive operational improvements, while impairment charges reduced against the background of subdued inflation and a strong labor market. Overall, as an organization, we remain execution focused. We achieved a further \u00a3300 million of gross cost savings this quarter, taking the total for the first 9 months to \u00a3700 million, on track for our targeted \u00a31 billion for the full year 2024. Simplifying the bank has been an important part of our strategy. We continue to make progress with the nonstrategic business disposal that we spoke about at our investor update. Earlier this week, we announced the sale of our nonperforming Italian mortgage portfolio. Finally, we are about 2/3 of the way through executing the \u00a3750 million share buyback and which we announced in the first half of the year, which, together with the first half dividend is the first step towards achieving our target of greater than \u00a310 billion of capital return by 2026. I will now hand over to Anna to take you through our third quarter financials."

        "speaker": "Angela Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 6, we have laid out Barclays financial highlights for the third quarter as well as year-to-date. Profit before tax was \u00a32.2 billion up 18% from \u00a31.9 billion in Q3 '23. Before going into the detail, I would just note that the quarterly performance was impacted by a weaker U.S. dollar which is a headwind to income and profit, but positively impact costs, impairment and RWAs. I'll call these out where appropriate. Turning to Slide 7. Q3 performance is in line with the plan we laid out in February. We delivered a statutory ROTE of 12.3%, up on last year's 11%. And the year-to-date ROTE of 11.5% leaves us on track for our statutory ROTE target for 2024 of greater than 10%. We continue to target a 2024 ROTE, excluding inorganic activity of circa 10.5%. We now expect that the impact of all inorganic activity in 2024, including Tesco Bank will be broadly neutral. So I don't anticipate a material difference between the 2 measures. As in the first half of the year, I was looking for 4 things in our performance, income stability, cost discipline and progress on efficiency savings, credit performance and a robust capital position. On all 4, we are where we expected to be and I'll cover these in more detail on the subsequent slides. Starting with income on Slide 8. Total income was up 5% year-on-year at \u00a36.5 billion. Excluding FX income was up 7% year-on-year. Since our investor update in February, we have been emphasizing continued stability in our income streams. Revenues from retail and corporate as well as financing in the Investment Bank provided bust to our income profile and together contributed 74% of income in Q3. Turning to net interest income on Slide 9. Group NII, excluding investment bank and head office was stable year-on-year at circa \u00a32.8 billion. We now expect our full year group NII to be greater than \u00a311 billion. Within this, we have increased NII guidance for Barclays U.K. to circa \u00a36.5 billion having previously guided to circa 6.3. Both numbers exclude the impact of the Tesco Bank acquisition. We also now assume a U.K. bank rate of 4.5% by the end of the year or a total of 325 basis point cut in 2024 and compared to the 5 we had assumed in February. Deposits continue to stabilize and increased structural hedge income continued to provide a strong tailwind and as you can see on Slide 10. As a reminder, the structural hedge is designed to reduce volatility in NII and manage interest rate risk. As rates have risen, the hedge has dampened the growth in our NII and in a falling rate environment, we will see the benefit from the protection that it gives us. The expected NII tailwind from the hedge is significant and predictable. \u00a312.4 billion of aggregate gross income is now locked in over the 3 years to the end of 2026, up from \u00a311.7 billion at Q2. We have around \u00a3170 billion of hedges maturing between '24 and '26 at an average yield of 1.5%. As we said in February, reinvesting around 3/4 of this at around 3.5% would compound over the next 3 years to increase structural hedge income in 2026 and by circa \u00a32 billion versus 2023. Given the high proportion of balances hedged and the programmatic approach we take we are relatively insensitive to the short-term impact of potential rate cuts. Please note that we have added additional disclosure on Slide 38 in the appendix on the split of the structural hedge income allocation across our 5 divisions. Moving on to costs on Slide 11. I Total costs in Q3 were flat year-on-year at \u00a34 billion. Excluding FX, costs were up 2% in the same period. We delivered a further \u00a30.3 billion of gross efficiency savings, bringing the total for the 9 months to \u00a30.7 billion. These efficiencies have helped us to more than offset inflation and created capacity for investments. We remain on track to deliver \u00a31 billion for the year and continue to expect a further \u00a31 billion of efficiency savings across 2025 and 2026. Our cost-to-income ratio was 61% in Q3 and for the 9 months year-to-date. We remain on track for our full year target of around 63%. Turning now to impairment, where credit conditions continue to trend positively and in line with our expectations. The Q3 impairment charge of \u00a3374 million equated to a loan loss rate of 37 basis points. The U.S. consumer bank charge reduced \u00a3276 million, a loan loss rate of 411 basis points, which benefited from methodology enhancements in the quarter. Our U.K. customers continue to act prudently with few current signs of stress, evidenced by continued low and stable delinquencies. The Barclays U.K. charge was just \u00a316 million a loan loss rate of 3 basis points, and this included a post-model adjustment release of around \u00a350 million. I'd remind you that under IFRS 9 accounting, we expect to incur a day 1 impairment charge for the Tesco unsecured lending balances on completion in Q4. As we said in February, the Tesco Bank acquisition alongside our broader U.K. balance sheet growth plan are factored into our guidance for the Barclays U.K. loan loss rate to track towards 35 basis points over the life of our 3-year plan. All in all, we reiterate our through-the-cycle guidance of 50 to 60 basis points for the group and expect FY '24 to be at the bottom of this range inclusive of the estimated day 1 impact of Tesco Bank. Excluding the impact of Tesco Bank, we would expect to be below this range as we are seeing limited signs of stress in our U.K. customer base. And our guidance for the U.S. Consumer Bank impairment charge to improve overall in the second half remains unchanged. Looking now in more detail at the U.S. Consumer Bank charge on Slide 13. The mix of reserve build to write-off within the impairment charge for the U.S. Consumer Bank continues to trend as we guided. We expected write-offs to increase during 2024, which you can see is the case from the light blue bars on this page. 30 and 90-day delinquencies are broadly stable, and we expect them to follow seasonal trends. There is no change to our impairment guidance. As mentioned, we still expect the U.S. Consumer Bank impairment charge to improve overall in the second half, resulting in a lower full year charge in 2024 versus 2023. We and we continue to guide to a loan loss rate trending towards the long-term average of 400 basis points. Our coverage ratios remained strong. Our IFRS 9 coverage ratio reduced 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 10.3%, primarily driven by a debt sale whilst our CECL coverage ratio increased 20 basis points to 8.1%. Before going into individual business performance, let me say a few words on the lending trends that we are seeing. Gross lending activity is encouraging across our portfolios, reflecting our focus on growth in the U.K. In mortgages, we are seeing a pickup in gross lending with increased flow in higher loan-to-value lending and customer confidence is also returning with strong purchase activity with first-time buyers and home movers. In a similar vein, U.K. card acquisition volumes remained strong. we ever added around 800,000 new Barclay Card customers this year consistent with our strategy to regain market share in unsecured lending. In the U.K. Corporate Bank, we have extended client lending facilities by deploying around 1.2 billion additional RWAs this year which we expect to drive lending balance growth as customers draw down, and we have seen some evidence of this in Q3. Turning now to Barclays U.K. You can see Barclays U.K. financial highlights and targets on Slide 15, but I will talk to Slide 16. ROTE was 23.4% in the quarter and total income was \u00a31.9 billion, up \u00a373 million year-on-year or 4%. NII of \u00a31.7 billion was up \u00a369 million on an as NIM increased by 12 basis points to 3.34%. As you can see on the bottom chart, we saw continued structural hedge momentum and small tailwinds and from product margin and lending volumes. We have updated our 2024 the U.K. NII guidance to circa \u00a36.5 billion from circa \u00a36.3 billion, excluding Tesco Bank, reflecting balance sheet trends turning more positive earlier than expected. Non-NII was \u00a3280 million in Q3, and we continue to expect a run rate above \u00a3250 million per quarter going forward. Although we expect the securitization that we announced earlier in the week to have a modest negative impact on non-NII in Q4. Total costs were circa \u00a31 billion, down 4% year-on-year and versus Q2. demonstrating continued progress on delivering efficiency savings from the ongoing U.K. transformation. The cost-to-income ratio improved to 52% this quarter. Moving on to the Barclays U.K. customer balance sheet on Slide 17. The stabilization in deposit trends that we called out at Q2 has continued in Q3. Deposit balances reduced by \u00a30.5 billion in the quarter, a similar quantum to Q2. Net lending was broadly flat in the quarter at \u00a3199 billion. Within this, we saw growth in mortgages, cards and unsecured personal lending, offset by continued paydown of runoff portfolios notably government-backed lending in business banking. As Venkat mentioned, we have made good progress on the acquisition of Tesco Bank. Following the court process last week, we will complete the acquisition on first of November with estimated financials to be confirmed at full year '24 results. The current estimated day 1 financial impact is a circa \u00a30.3 billion net positive profit before tax, driven by an income gain resulting from consideration paid being below fair value, which is partially offset by our day 1 impairment charge. The impaired charge assumes all balances are required as Stage 1 loans, reflecting 12-month expected losses with subsequent impairment builds required in future years. The profit before tax benefit Statutory group ROTE in 2024 by about 50 basis points. Overall, and including the circa $7 billion RWAs, we expect to see around a 20 basis point negative impact to the group CET1 ratio, which is lower than the circa 30 basis points previously guided. Moving on to the U.K. Corporate Bank. U.K. Corporate Bank delivered Q3 ROTE of 18.8%. Income grew 1% year-on-year to \u00a3445 million. Non-NII was flat year-on-year, but down in the quarter, mainly due to a lower income from transactional products. This line can be variable due to the inclusion of non-product items such as liquidity pool income. However, we do expect non-NII to increase over time as we invest in our digital and lending proposition. Total costs were flat year-on-year at \u00a3222 million, with future investment spend expected as we continue to support our growth initiatives. Lending balances decreased by \u00a30.9 billion in the quarter as underlying growth was more than offset by a circa \u00a32 billion reduction due to refinements to the perimeter with the International Corporate Bank. This same adjustment also impacted deposit balances. Turning now to private banking and Wealth Management on Slide 22. Q3 ROTE was 29% and supported by strong growth in client assets and liabilities, up around \u00a33 billion on Q2 and around \u00a323 billion versus the prior year. Income reduced 3% year-on-year, driven by lower NII from the nonrepeat of a timing-related one-off in Q3 '23, which offset growth from increased client assets and liabilities. Versus Q2, NII was up 1%, driven by increased client balances overall. Costs were up 3% year-on-year as we continued to invest in this business, including in growing platform, hiring and efficiency-related measures. Turning now to the Investment Bank. ROE was 8.8%, up 0.8% year-on-year. Total income of $2.9 billion was up 6% year-on-year, and total costs up 4%, delivering positive cost to income jaws. Excluding FX, total income was up 9% year-on-year and costs up 7% year-on-year. RWA productivity measured by income over average RWAs was 5.7% in the quarter, 30 basis points better year-on-year with year-to-date RWA productivity at 6%. Period-end RWAs were $9.1 billion lower versus Q2 at \u00a3194 billion with FX accounting for around \u00a36 billion of the move. At Q2, we had an uptick in RWAs, which I said was temporary in nature the reduction we've seen this quarter, excluding FX, is a reversal of that. Now looking at the specific income line in more detail on Slide 25. Using the U.S. dollar figures as usual to help comparison to our U.S. peers. Markets income was up 7% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 7%, driven by a strong performance in credit, securitized products and fixed income financing. Equities income was up 7% and aided by strong performance in cash equities and equity derivatives as we help clients through market volatility in August. Financing income was up 6% year-on-year reflecting increased client flows and balances with this business delivering more than \u00a3750 million in 4 of the last 7 quarters. Investment Banking fee income in dollars was up 67% year-on-year with gains across all products, in particular, a strong quarter in advisory, which was up 146% on was up 55%, delivering improved performance across both investment-grade and leveraged finance was up 9% against a wallet that was down 6%. Our year-to-date banking fee share was 3.5%. We have increased share across most products in a rising industry wallet, but we still have work to do to sustainably improve this. Finally, in the international corporate bank, transaction banking was up 5%. We continue to grow U.S. deposit balances, which we see as a lead indicator of future client product take-up and fee income growth. This was more than offset by an \u00a385 million impact from fair value losses on leveraged finance lending, which are reported in corporate lending, resulting in total ICB income being down 21% year-on-year. Turning now to the U.S. consumer bank. U.S. Consumer Bank generated a ROTE of 10.9%, up from 0.4% in Q3 last year. mainly due to the lower impairment charge following a higher provision build in the second half of 2023. Income fell 2% year-on-year, driven by a weaker U.S. dollar. Excluding FX, income was up 2%, driven by an increase in card balances, which were up \u00a31.4 billion year-on-year on a reported basis to \u00a331.6 billion. NIM was stable on Q2 at 10.4%, but down from 10.9% in the prior year, reflecting higher rewards earned by customers through increased spend. In Q4, these impacts are expected to be less of a headwind, and we continue to target a NIM for this business of greater than 12% by 2026. In terms of the funding mix of the business, the proportion of core deposits was broadly stable versus Q2 at 66% as we target above 75% by 2026. We Costs were down 3% on the prior year as efficiency savings and the FX tailwind offset inflation and growth, driving a cost-to-income ratio of 50%. Excluding FX, costs were up 1%. We still expect costs to trend up modestly in Q4 as marketing spend during the holiday season will support continued growth in the business. Turning now to Slide 28 and the summary of the financial impact from inorganic activity announced in 2024. As a reminder, at our Q2 results, we announced the disposal of our performing Italian mortgage portfolio and the German cards business. Earlier this week, we announced the disposal of our nonperforming Italian mortgage portfolio, which is expected to complete in Q4 '24. These disposals, along with the Tesco Bank acquisition, have a broadly neutral impact on statutory 2024 group RoTE whilst causing a circa 10 basis point drag to the CET1 ratio. These transactions are a key component of reshaping the bank to be more focused in areas we have competitive strength, enabling us to deliver higher future returns. Turning now to the balance sheet and starting with our capital position. The CET1 ratio was 13.8% at the end of Q3 up 24 basis points versus Q2 and comfortably within our target range. This includes the impact of the ongoing \u00a3750 million half year buyback and that came off capital post the Q2 quarter end, 46 basis points of capital generated from profits in the quarter and a \u00a34 billion reduction in RWAs, excluding FX. We continue to expect this year's total capital return to be broadly in line with the 2023 level of \u00a33 billion, consistent with the capital distribution plan we laid out in February. Let me turn briefly to our regulatory capital and the upcoming changes under Basel 3.1 as well as the U.S. cards model migration. The combined expected RWA impact of \u00a319 billion to \u00a326 billion is in line with previous guidance of the lower end of 5% to 10% of group RWAs as at the end of 2023. However, the timing has changed for both items. You will have seen that the PRA's Basel 3.1 implementation date moved to 1 January 2026, and the impact is expected to be between billion post mitigation. The IRB migration of our U.S. cards portfolio has also moved from our prior expectation of Q1 2025 and will now take place after Basel III implementation, for which we are building a Basel-compliant model. The total impact to RWAs from the IRB migration still done at circa \u00a316 billion, of which around \u00a35 billion will be reflected at the time Basel 3.1 is implemented and is now included in our Basel 3.1 impact estimate. The remaining \u00a311 million relating to the IRB model will come after Basel 3.1 implementation at a date to be determined and is subject to model builds and portfolio changes over time. Specific to this, there is likely to be a modest increase in Pillar 2A applicable at some point in 2025 and until the model is implemented, reflecting the difference between modeled and the current standardized risk weighting acknowledging we already hold Pillar 2A capital against the majority of this risk. As previously noted, the total impact of Basel 3.1 will also depend on further guidance from the PRA on the approach to Pillar 2A, where we expect some offsets for risk now to be capitalized under Pillar 1. Risk-weighted assets decreased by \u00a311 billion from Q2 to \u00a3340.4 billion, as you can see in more detail on Slide 31. FX drove around \u00a37 billion of the reduction with lower investment bank and head office RWAs also contributing. As usual, a brief word on capital and liquidity on Slide 32. And we maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. Turning now to NAV. NAV per share increased 11p in the quarter and 35p year-on-year to 351p. Of the elements we controlled attributable profit added 11p per share in the quarter and the share buyback, which reduced our share count by 2% added 2p per share. We have seen further unwind of the negative movements in the cash flow hedge reserve in 2022 to 2023, which caused a drag on shareholders' equity and this added 9p in the quarter. These positive moves were partially offset by dividends paid and other reserve movements. In summary, we remain focused on disciplined execution. This is the third quarter of progress against the targets that we laid out in February, which we are either reiterating today or upgrading. Thank you for listening. Moving now to Q&A. As usual, please could you keep to a maximum of 2 questions so we can get around to everyone in good time."

        "text": "Two questions on Slide 16, please, which is the Barclays U.K. margin and NII walk. Just first, and I appreciate the reiteration of guidance around hedge tailwinds into next year. But I just noticed that the quarter-on-quarter tailwind there is -- it's down about 1/3, and it looks to us like maturing swaps and incoming stop should have been fairly stable, down about 30 basis points each in the period. And so I just wonder how you think about the sort of quarter-to-quarter volatility around this component of NII trying to avoid a situation where we worry unduly about nearer-term dynamics from that? And then secondly, on the same chart, quite surprising to see the product margin as a net positive. Can I just confirm, please, that includes whatever the leads and lags on depository pricing there are? There's some feedback in the investment community that perhaps Barclays hasn't been able to cut deposit rates as others have done as rate cuts began. I just wonder whether you could talk about what you're seeing on deposit pass-through as rates start to decline. I just confirm that I'm looking at the right block when I look to track that going forward."

        "text": "Thanks, Jason. Thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll take back those. So just looking at Slide 16, I can see why you\u2019re asking the question. The structural hedge impact is lower than the previous quarter. Last quarter, the product dynamic was negative, now it\u2019s positive. So I\u2019ll pick those up in turn. I mean last quarter, we did have a slightly higher swap rate, as you point out, but we also topped up the hedge a little bit, particularly around business banking. That\u2019s now obviously in a run rate. So it\u2019s no longer causing that sort of quarter-on-quarter impact. Sort of going forward from here, we\u2019re going to continue to see momentum from the structural hedge. You can see that from the other disclosures that we\u2019ve given you, for example, on Page 10. So I still expect it to be a net tailwind overall to this business and really supporting the NII growth that we\u2019re seeing. So nothing more really than that. On the product margin, you\u2019re right, that does include all product margins, so it\u2019s including assets and liabilities. I think important to point out that some of the drags that we\u2019ve seen historically are no longer there. So you\u2019re no longer seeing that really significant deposit drag from migration coming through. Actually, our mortgage position is broadly neutral from a churn perspective now. So you\u2019re no longer seeing that. What Iu are seeing Is some positive momentum from both mortgage and card margins, which is a little bit offset by deposit pricing, as you point out. But actually, I\u2019d expect given the kind of regulatory lag that we have in deposit pricing for that to be more meaningful, that lag impact to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter. So a bit a lot of small numbers here because it is only a quarter-on-quarter movement, and it is only 6%, but that\u2019s the things that I would call out. Okay. Perhaps we could go to the next question, please."

        "text": "The first one, thank you for the new disclosure around the structural hedge income around how that should be allocated to the group like me that's like Christmas came early. One of your peers this week implied they expect the structural hedge notional to be flattish from here. Based on your guidance for February and movements in the notional since year-end, I think you're actually expecting a 13% reduction in the notional from here. do you really expect to see such a big reduction going forward given you mentioned just previously, the stabilization in deposits? Or can we assume that, that assumption is now somewhat stale. And then secondly, just a chance my luck on 2025. One of your peers guided to a gradual increase in NIM in 2025 in the U.K. Should we expect a similar trend at Barclays?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Angela Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thank you, I\u2019ll take both of those. So yes, please put that disclosure in on Page 38, you haven\u2019t seen it. I mean we often talk about the structural hedge and the support that it gives to the U.K. I guess, in absolute percentage terms, that\u2019s where it is most meaningful, but it does provide support elsewhere in the group, particularly through the equity structural hedge. So you\u2019ll see perhaps surprising to many that it\u2019s providing some support into the IB and because we allocate that equity portion by RWAs. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. But the structural hedge notional I\u2019m not going to give you specific guidance spend, but what I would say is we\u2019d expect it to sort of trend broadly in line with where the deposits are going. When we spoke in February, that was less guidance, more sort of a framework to help you model it as time goes on. So we talked about I 170 billion of maturing and rolling about \u00be of that. But that was designed really to give you the math that you could that you could then update rather than a forecast itself. So clearly, as we look at the moment, there are some positives in there, but we will continue to update you as we go through. But I wouldn\u2019t call out anything more than we should expect it to move in line with deposits. On your second question, I\u2019m not going to talk about NIM then is going to be quite \u2013 it\u2019s going to move around quite a lot over the next few quarters. As you can imagine, we\u2019re about to onboard I 8 billion worth of unsecured lending. That\u2019s going to move the NIM materially. What I would really focus you on is actually the net interest income. So we\u2019ve upgraded our net interest income for the group and for the U.K. in the curre\u2019t year. So now we're expecting circa \u00a36.5 billion for the U.K. And if I take you back to what we said in February, we said we expected mid-single-digit growth in NII in the U.K. We still expect that. And what\u2019s driving that? Well, clearly, we\u2019ve got asset growth coming through what was a drag coming from deposits. We now see a stabilization. And hopefully, as deposits start to grow across the market, we would see the same. And whilst we\u2019ve got some uncertainty coming through from rate changes, I would offset that with the kind of momentum that we've got from the structural hedge. So we are expecting NII to be higher in '25 and in \u201826 than it has been in \u201824. And that\u2019s, obviously, we would be putting Tesco on top of that. Okay. Thanks, Ben.

Could you give us some color on what the sort of underlying group center numbers look like after the various mortgage books have gone and the German card books have gone. I think this is a source of significant dispersion within consensus how people are thinking about sort of the underlying head office, and it has been an area where historically, consensus has got a little bit out of kilt with your own expectations. So any color on once the transactions you've currently got in the pipeline are done what does that group center income cost run rate look like? And I appreciate that there's still the payments business in there, which may or may not go at some point. But sort of what's the sort of go-to run rate, how things stand for the transactions once the transactions you've got in train are done? And then on BUK NII, just a point of clarification. So it's mid-single-digit growth on the 2024 number, excluding Tesco and then we put Tesco on top. So take essentially the 6.5 that you're now guiding mid-single-digit growth on that and then \u00a3400 million on top is what you're saying for 2025?"

        "speaker": "Angela Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thanks, Chris. Let me pick up both of those. So the first one, look, I appreciate head office has been a bit volatile in the current year, both because it's housing or inorganic activity and those businesses before they actually flow out. So just to remind you, there's no inorganic activity in the current quarter. You can also get some volatility in there from educating. So we're seeing a bit of that in the quarter, but year-to-date, that is a 0 number, and we expect it to be timing only. It's a bit early to guide you to what that run rate is, Chris, but we will do that in time. But just to remind you, nothing in the current quarter and just appreciate it's very difficult to model at the moment. But once we get beyond that, we'll give you more guidance. On the BUK NII, let me just clarify for you. So ex Tesco, I expect some increase. the mid-single-digit guidance that we gave you for BUK did include Tesco because that was from '23 to '26. So we include Tesco, obviously, in our RWA bridge to \u00a330 billion, and it's included in the mid-single. So I would say, overall, we're expecting some organic ad test go on top to that.

        "text": "Thanks for the questions. Sorry. Yes, I have 2 questions. One was just on the U.K. interest rate sensitivity. It's quite striking that you're not highlighting to get at all as an impact this quarter. I think you said it was minimal or marginal. I can't remember your exact words in terms of your sensitivity rates falling going forward. And I'm just trying to understand a commentary you could just help us understand why that is? Is that just like a temporary thing? And as the hedge rolls off, then you would expect some more sensitivity? Or is there something that you sort of structurally changed is obviously on the way up, we saw NII grow very strongly on the back of higher rates. So that's 1 question. And then the other question was on the U.S. the margin there. I get your comments about you're still targeting greater than 12%. And I think you said there was a lot of incentive programs or loyalty programs that you were running at the moment. And just again, any help you could give us to understand from a business perspective, how that works? Because I do obviously the U.S. loyalty program is a huge part of the business. It's a huge part of attracting volumes and customers, et cetera. And I'm just trying to think what is it you're expecting to change in the market more broadly? Or how is your offering going to change that's going to allow you to reduce those loyalty offerings but still maintain momentum in the business."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Angela Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thanks, Ed. I will take both of those. On the first one, we gave you some guidance on the interest rate sensitivity in the previous quarter, and that really shows for a 25 basis point parallel shift, it was Good morning. 50 million in the first year. And then what you saw was that build over time. And that build over time. The way I think about it, Ed, is in the first year, it\u2019s dominated by the lag effect. So the sort of 60-day regulatory lag that we have, particularly in the U.K. And then in the outer years, you see the impact of the h\u2019dge grinding lower in response to that parallel movement. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on there. If I go back to what I said in products for that product margin on Page 16, just to clarify, we\u2019ve got 2 offsetting impact in that. There is a negative movement from the delay in pricing or repricing the liabilities. But there is an offset, which is coming through from our asset margins, which are expanding. Now you might expect that in a downward movement. Sort of overall, we would expect that as a liability margin start to compress, you see asset margins widening out. And of course, we\u2019ve got specific actions around things like high loan-to-value mortgages that are perhaps driving that a little bit faster. And so it's not that it's not there. I\u2019's just that there are some offsets. And actually, I would expect a bit more of that lag just because of the way the months sort of pan out in. On your second question on U.S. margin, yes, the NIM is clearly lower than it was at the beginning of the year and indeed last year. But our expectation is that this is still a greater than 12% NIM business. And all of the actions that we are taking to underpin that are taking place. So in the current quarter, and if you look sort of sequentially across the last few quarters, there\u2019s a few things going on. There\u2019s natural seasonality in this business. So you see more purchase activity, more borrowing activity as you go into the holiday season, which is much more seasonal in the U.S. than it is in the U.K. So you\u2019ll see that natural shape. The second thing is, remember, we did that risk transfer in Q1. What that meant was we swapped out NII for fee income, but obviously, it\u2019s roti accretive overall. So you see some movement in the geography of the P&L and the balance sheet. And then thirdly, as we've called out, there are\u2019a couple of things that we\u2019re just observing as a customer master. Actually, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re unhelpful, but there are 2. The first is that customers are \u2013 they\u2019re managing their balance as well, they\u2019re repaying, perhaps a little bit faster than we expected. In the context of the broader discussions about the U.S. economy, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unhelpful and we see the other side of it in positive impairments. So we\u2019re not uncomfortable with that. The second point is that customers are using their awards not necessarily more, but faster than we would have previously expected. Again, long term, for the franchise whilst that puts a bit of a headwind into near-term NIM. It means they\u2019re really engaged with the [indiscernible]. They\u2019re really engaged with the brand program. So it\u2019s good news. So that kind of explains Q3. As I go beyond Q3 and think about that build to greater than 12. The deals that we talked about in February were our #1 repricing, that repricing action has actually taken place, it\u2019s complete. But what happens is customers have to actually purchase under the new terms and conditions. So it\u2019s going to drift through into NIM over time. The second action was really around the funding mix. So we are now around 7% of retail funding. We want to get that to around 75%. That\u2019s going to take a while for us to build. But we\u2019ve launched the tiered savings products that will underpin that, and you\u2019ll see more on that in time. So those things are really important. The last thing I would add is a key part of that move to 12 is how we start to morph this portfolio towards having a richer mix in retail. And you can see that we\u2019ve announced our new partnership with Good morning. That again, is another plank of the strategy. So we\u2019re not going to get to 12% or greater than 12% immediately. You\u2019re going to see it sort of emerge over the next few quarters. But greater than 12% is still our target, and we feel like we\u2019re on track. Next question, please."

And clearly, some of the moves being pushed out in the U.S. consumer business. I'm just wondering if that changes how you manage capital in theory, it sort of frees up some capital in the next 12 months to perhaps distribute a little bit more early in the plan? Or should we think that you're more likely to run at the very top end of the 13% to 14% range, maybe even above it, especially if there's a Pillar 2A temporary uptick? Just thinking about how you think about that capital ratio during 2025 now as you have to wait for 26 for some of those come through. And then on the product margins, I just come back to that point in terms of the lag effects and saying it might be more meaningful in Q4 in deposits. I would have thought there'd be some sort of catch-up from the August rate cut, if you like, and you take the day 1 hit on the unhedged deposits and you have to wait to pass some of it back on the rate card. So I just checked that sort of thinking is correct. And your comment around the lag effect been greater in Q4 is maybe reflection of an assumption of 2 rate cuts. And then maybe if it was just 1 rate cut, it wouldn't be as more powerful versus what you saw in Q3."

And I\u2019d just say exactly the same today. Q4 is normally when we talk about distributions, and we\u2019ll do so then. But we see this really around timing and you would expect us to build capital as we head towards both Basel and the IRB implementation. Just on product margins. Really what I was referring to is you\u2019ve got sort of about a month\u2019s worth of that lag in Q3. You\u2019re going to see the remainder of it in Q4, and we are expecting because we use consensus. So consensus has got 3 rate cuts in the current year. We\u2019re expecting a couple of rate cuts in Q4. So you\u2019re going to see impacts in Q4 and actually into Q1 of next year. Okay. Thank you, guy, Next question, please."

But essentially, just on the U.K. business, I kind of see the balance sheet still contracting a little bit in terms of total loan balances and deposit balances versus, I guess, some of your peers showing a little bit of growth now. So just kind of curious the interplay between the kind of the pricing, which goes into that product margin versus balance sheet growth? And when can we start to see a bit more organic growth and capital redeployment into the BUK business? And the second question just relating to the U.S. consumer business. I'm just curious how significant or not to the American Airlines partnership, if there's any color you can give there in terms of the contribution of that piece to the border business."

        "text": "Okay. Thanks. I'll take the first of those and then hand to Venkat. So it's probably helpful if we start on the sort of leading indicators page that I that we've included this time. It's on Page 14. And if I take you back to February, what we said in February was we didn't expect significant change in the net balance sheet, particularly in the U.K. in the current year. And that was because of our expectation and the known maturities that we have, not just the mortgages, but for example, in business banking. What we did expect was the change in the gross production a comfort that we are driving that gross production. So in mortgages, it's relatively straightforward. It's actually our gross lending. You can see that stepping forward quarter-on-quarter. It's obviously helped by the fact that the mortgage market itself is strong and robust. But also the fact that we are broadening out our range within that market, and we're really putting Kensington to work now, which we've been unable to do over the last few years. The second point is on card acquisitions, and you can see that meaningful step-up in '24, but we've already started that journey in 2023. And actually, what you see over time is that those cars volumes will start to feed into interest-earning lending. And then finally, on U.S., U.K., CB, I know you're not asking about corporate here, but it's a bit more difficult there because clearly, what you do is you put out lines to clients which is shown here in terms of RWAs. And then those clients in time will draw down on them. So in terms of what happening in terms of lead indicators in the balance sheet, I'm happy we're going in the right direction. In BUK, specifically, we saw positive net lending in the businesses that we've got in focus. So we saw positive net lending in mortgages. We're seeing it in cards. What we've got offsetting that is some runoffs in portfolios, which are obviously no longer call is not the right word. But if I use the example of government lending within business banking, I don't think that's different, either in percentage terms or sort of in directional terms from our peers. You're hearing similar things there. So I think we're happy overall. And obviously, as we increase our card lending, you get a mix impact as we've increased the proportion of lending at higher loan to values, you get a mix impact, and that's really what's flowing into the product margin and giving that positive."

First, in the IB, if we think about the gradual rebalancing of that business, clearly, dynamics in the quarter for DCM were very strong, both for you and across the street. But given the organic reduction in RWAs you saw in the quarter in the IB and the improvement in asset productivity, year-over-year. Are you starting to make those selective decisions to deemphasize DCM? And where are you comfortable doing less, I guess. And when we think about reallocating those RWAs into the financing businesses, should we sort of assume \u00a3750 million as a floor for market financing revenues, assuming supportive markets? That's the first topic. And then second on Tesco. So thank you for the additional disclosure in the update today. So what steps are you planning to take over the next sort of 12 to 24 months to improve the product margins in Tesco Bank. If I look at asset productivity or NII versus RWAs, it's quite a bit lower in Tesco Bank than the rest of the U.K. business, looking at the \u00a3400 million and the \u00a37 billion. So how are you planning to scale NII faster than RWAs to optimize that capital resourcing question?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Right. So Chris, let me take the IB and then Anna will talk about Tesco. On the IB, first of all, big picture, we're looking to keep RWAs in absolute terms, relatively flat to their current number of around 200 billion. The relative reduction in RWAs as a percentage of the group happens because the rest of the group growth. Second, in the Anderson Bank [indiscernible] came down by about \u00a39 billion this quarter compared to the previous one, but about \u00a36 billion of that was due to FX and 3 was actual action. And 1% up and down or 1.5% up and down in the quarter is normal business mix. Third, we are not looking to deal the CCM. What we are looking to do is within the investment bank, be prudent in assigning capital to clients, looking at the totality of their relationship, and that relationship is not just DCM, but it includes M&A and equities and what corporate banking, we do with them. And that's the way to think about it. And lending is a part of it. Lending is not the only part of it, and we don't want lending to be the main part of it. And as far as revenue of \u00a3750 million from financing, look, we've been stable at that number. What I would say is while we have been gaining clients and gaining market share in that business, the actual revenue is a function of 2 things. It's a function of what happens in the composition of balances, fixed income and equity and so what the markets do as well as spreads within that. So I can't tell you that is going to stay at this level or not go up or down. It depends on that mix. What we do think we have is a diversified business between fixed income and equities, a competitive business in both but particularly strong fixed income business and a diversified business among the types of clients who use it regionally, product-wise and within fixed income asset class is, meaning spread versus govern. So that's what we think contributes to a good and stable mix, but I'm reluctant to put sort of floors and ceilings on numbers."

The only thing I\u2019d add to that is if I take that \u00a3 9 billion reduction, \u00a3 6 billion was FX as Venkat said, the other \u00a3 3 billion was just the reversal of the client positioning that we saw that we said was temporary. So it just kind of brings us back to where we started at the beginning of the year. On Tesco, for the next year or so, for the next sort of 12 to 18 months, our focus is really on integration and our focus will be on customer service. So that is our primary focus as it would be in any partnership as it was in GAAP in the U.S. So this is just a replication of what we would do with any other partner across the firm. Over time, we would expect this to be rote accretive for a number of reasons, whether that be efficiency, whether that be funding benefits that you might expect to accrue. And obviously, we\u2019ll update you on that in sort of in the course of time. But really, our objective over the short term is going to be to integrate it well and really ensure that, that customer experience is foremost."

But similar to Q2 where you called out a large deal there, is there any lumpy deals that we should bear in mind is the performance sustainable? I'm guessing ultimately, I'm asking about the pipeline from here given the strong performance? And second is on the leveraged finance marks. It feels like it's a bit of a hard quarter to take those marks and with credit spreads actually very tight. So maybe could you give us a bit of color on what's driving that? Is it portfolio? Is it a single sort of ticket or are you looking to sell something in the mark? Or should we expect more of this in the coming quarters? Just a bit of color on this."

And as I've said elsewhere, we've obviously seen activity pick up over this year compared to the previous year. We expect it to continue to be relatively firm. Obviously, there are a couple of wild cuts out there in terms of what happens with the U.S. elections and economic policy and rent policy in the U.S. on M&A activity after that. But assuming no major surprises or changes, we expect to continue to see it to be firm."

And you\u2019re right, in the current environment, what we see is that market overall performing really well. Deals are clearing quickly. Occasionally, we find that either some of those don\u2019t. That is episodic. It\u2019s a feature of our business. It\u2019s a feature of the market overall and not something that we would particularly call out. So it\u2019s normal. What we do at the end of every single quarter as we assess our balance sheet and we use prevailing market information in order to assess the fair value of that balance sheet. And where we feel we need to take more than we do, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in the current quarter. So it\u2019s very much BAU and as I say, it occasionally occurs it\u2019s episodic. I wouldn\u2019t comment on clients as we would never do. I would just remind you also that this is a book which have some hedging set against it. The cost of that hedging also flows through corporate lending. So we protect ourselves in that way. And I would say, overall, our exposures are probably, whilst they\u2019re higher than \u201823, they\u2019re lower than they have been historically. So it\u2019s a well risk-managed book. And really, this is sort of the kind of thing we see normally, but on an episodic basis. Thanks, Alvaro. Perhaps we could go to the next question, please."

      {
        "speaker": "Jonathan Pierce",
        "text": "I've got two, please. The first is -- I'm sorry, it's back on rate sensitivity. Thanks for the hedge allocation data, again, by the way, helps us a bit more precise in the tailwinds there in Barclays U.K. The piece that's sort of struggling with a bit is the rate sensitivity. But the \u00a350 million in year 1, I hear what you're saying about a lot of that being related to deposit back. But if this \u00a340 billion of hedge maturities a year as per guidance, you'd have thought a 25 basis point shift in the curve, would be knocking \u00a350 million out of the hedge income in year 1. So I'm not quite sure what's going on here. Are you saying that there is no impact on what we might call managed margin from a 25 basis point rate reduction at all, just simply because the structural hedge is now so large in the context of the deposit book. So it would be helpful just to understand why that is so low. I mean it's the lowest in the sector. quite difficult to triangulate. The second question -- sorry, this is just for the models really assets into year-end, there's 2 bits that like a bit of clarity on Barclays U.K. saw a \u00a34 billion increase in the early part of the year for methodology, policy changes. At the time you said that would partially reverse over the rest of the year. It doesn't seem like it has reversed yet. Is that coming in Q4? And then in the other direction, the year 1, I think, is pointing to about a \u00a32.5 billion of risk increase in the fourth quarter. Is that about the right number to be sticking in the spreadsheet?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Angela Cross",
        "text": "Okay, Jonathan. Let me take the first one. So I would say we said \u00a3170 billion over 3 years, so I think you're probably closer to around \u00a360 billion of hedge maturing. And really, what's going on here is Remember, you've got that underlying maturing rate at around 1.5%. So even though rates are coming down, you're still getting a pickup from the structural hedge. And it's only really in the outer years when that grinds out that you're seeing that more meaningful difference. So I think it's nothing more than that, but we can talk you through that outside of here, if that's helpful. As it relates to our relative sensitivity, we talked about this quite a bit as rates went up because we were clearly less rate sensitive on the way up. So you'd expect us to be less sensitive on the way down. So that is exactly what's coming through right now. Perhaps we hedge a little bit more. We certainly hedge more proactively, we are looking forward and assessing that on a monthly basis and adjusting those hedges very, very actively as we go to reflect the detail of customer and client behavior. So I think it's a benefit of that approach that we're seeing and the fact that we've just done this very programmatically over a very long period of time. We're not seeking here to have any kind of view as to where rates will go. We're just lifting the hedge roll and we're reacting to we're reacting to customer behavior. And on the second question, I think we'll have to come back to you on that 1 on op risk. So let us do that. Venkat, do you want to [indiscernible]?"

We try to understand as best we can positive behavior, deposit balances, customer behavior affecting that and hedge it. And as Anna said, therefore, if it works very well, it should provide you with the protection, meaning you don't see the benefits as rates rise as much as you would otherwise. And you see -- you don't see the losses as rates fall, meaning that your NII remains more stable because of that. And that's what we are trying to do and what Anna said is perfectly right about that."

Just to check, though, Anna, I thought the rate sensitivity table ignored any sort of yield pickup on the hedge. I thought it was purely if the yield curve is 25 basis points lower, this is the impact on us, in which case, if you're reinvesting \u00a340 billion of hedge a year at 25 basis points less that's the entirety of average out over the year, the entirety of the \u00a350 million you're pointing to in year 1, which just implies everything else is nothing.

And I think it is important because it's the main topic of conversation amongst investors this morning. If we look at your \u00a36.5 billion guide for this year. It kind of implies a Q4 run rate ex Tescos of kind of \u00a36.8 billion, \u00a36.9 billion. If we add in kind of \u00a3400 million for Tesco is we're at kind of 7.3%, I think you're looking to grow next year. I think especially given the product hedge is in the U.K., but the structural hedge benefit is more than going to outweigh any kind of rate reduction impact. So why are you not going to end up materially above the 7.1% that consensus has penciled in next year. Is there something I'm missing some big kind of negative drag that you're anticipating."

You can see that there is NII momentum in the business organically. We've called that out. You can see it over the last 2 quarters. It's coming from us at growth. It's coming from the momentum from the structural hedge. Now as I said before, we haven't really seen the full impact of the rate cuts yet, but we would still expect the net of all of that into 2025 to be positive.

We started in a position where \u2013 we started in a position where we had 5 rate cuts in February. Now we\u2019re expecting 3. And then the other 3, including the 1 we\u2019ve already had, so a further 2. And then the other thing that\u2019s happening here is clearly we\u2019ve seen a stabilization in that balance sheet earlier than we expected to. The beginning of the year, I said I expected the balance sheet to get smaller before it got bigger. We\u2019ve seen 2 quarters now, nearly 3 quarters of real stabilization in deposits, perhaps a bit earlier than we expected.

        "text": "So can I -- sorry, can I bring you back to the hedge. So Obviously, the hedge is a very large component of the way you manage the interest rate risk. So with the scale of the hedge, does that mean that your sensitivity to long rates would be higher than perhaps other banks or your peers? Or just all else equal, would you expect more sensitivity to the long rates? Because the reason I'm asking is because there's obviously been a lot of discussion around neutral rates in Europe and in the U.K. So I'm just wondering, is the reason why your sensitivity is a bit lower in a parallel shift to narrows because maybe there's a little bit of difference between a short end and the long end? And so that's the first part of the question. And the second part is that it sounds like the notional is more stable than you -- than we might have expected previously. And you previously assumed a reinvestment of 75% of the maturing hedges. I guess the question is, does it matter whether you reinvest or just simply let it roll off? Because obviously, you're reinvesting into a higher yield is a positive. But equally, if you runoff at a 1.5% hedge and then just sort of let it roll on to the variable rate that is removing negative and removing the drag. So does that matter whether you're reinvesting or not?"

        "speaker": "Angela Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thanks, Perlie. I will take both of those. The first is a tenor of what we\u2019re hedging is between 2 and 7. So I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re any more sensitive to the long end of the curve than others. We really try and reflect what we think the varying behavioral lives of the different pockets of deposits that we have. So I wouldn\u2019t call that out as a key difference. And then on your second point, just to bring everybody back to this, the I 75 million and the I 170 million was indicated to give you some math that you could then update as we go rather than a specific forecast from us. To the extent that the notional is more stable. I mean clearly, we have a choice every single quarter or every single month as it rolls. At the moment, you\u2019re right, we\u2019re getting a pickup from that maturity as it rolls off even if we just left it overnight. The difference that the structural hedge gives you is obviously secures it. So the structural hedge gives you certainty, which is why we do it programmatically, and why we\u2019re really focused on how much income are we locking in \u201825 and \u201826, which we\u2019ve shown you again on Page 10. So that locked-in number is now I 12.4 billion over the 3 years. So for us, it\u2019s really about the certainty and stability of NII rather than the opportunists kind of every month passing. And just to remind you, that equivalent number was 8.6 in February. Okay. Thank you, Perlie. I think we are going to our last question in the queue, please."

Looking into the budget, thinking about both the U.K. business and the investment bank, I assume we don't get a bank tax.

It's difficult to give any specific guidance around quantum or exact timing, but you'll note that we said modest. And just reiterating, we are already holding Pillar 2A for this. And then the other point I'd make is that, obviously, we still await some Basel guidance from the PRA. So there is some expectation that we'll get some guidance around Pillar 2 offset where they're really trying to avoid double counting between Pillar 1 and Basel and Pillar 2A that exists currently.

And as usual, there will be an opportunity for those in the room to ask questions at the end. Note, we also include an update on key operational developments for each of our five divisions as an annex to today's presentation. We won't talk to these slides, but have included them in the spirit of transparency and to help you understand how we are delivering our plan. So let me start with some performance highlights before handing over to Anna to take you through the financials. At our investor update last February, we set out a three year plan to deliver a better run, more strongly performing and higher returning Barclays. I'm encouraged by the progress which we have made during the first year. We are executing the plan in a disciplined way and have achieved all of our financial targets for 2024. And we are on track to achieve our 2026 targets. Last year, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 10.5%, in line with our target greater than 10%. We also announced \u00a33 billion of capital distributions, an important step towards our target to distribute at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders by 2026. This includes \u00a31.2 billion of dividends, enabling a 5% increase in our dividends per share to 8.4p. And also \u00a31.75 billion in buybacks, \u00a31 billion of which was announced today, and which we expect to initiate in the coming days. We have made progress on deploying \u00a330 billion of additional RWAs in our highest returning U.K. businesses, while keeping investment banking RWAs broadly stable. This has resulted in the investment bank falling from 58% to 56% of the group's RWAs on its way to our 2026 target of circa 50%. And we remain well capitalized, ending the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%, within our range of 13% to 14%. We are improving the quality of our income and the stability and durability of our returns. And we are making progress towards our approximately \u00a330 billion income target in 2026. Our top line grew by \u00a31.4 billion or 6% year-on-year during 2024. And we achieved our NII targets for the group and for Barclays U.K. Our structural hedge provides a predictable and highly visible source of net interest income growth over several years. And our cost-to-income ratio for the full-year '24 was 62%, better than our guidance of circa 63%. Our credit performance was also strong, particularly in the U.K. with a group loan loss rate of 46 basis points for the year, below our through-the-cycle 50 to 60 basis points target range. Across Barclays, we are focused on execution. We delivered \u00a3300 million of gross efficiency, cost efficiency savings in the fourth quarter, enabling us to achieve our \u00a31 billion target for all of 2024. We remain focused on improving our operational and financial performance across each of our five divisions. Anna will review our financial performance by division shortly, but let me first cover a few highlights. Barclays U.K. delivered a return on tangible equity of 23% for the year. And on the 1st of November, we completed the acquisition of Tesco Bank. Through this acquisition, we have gained a strategic relationship with the U.K.'s largest retailer, supporting growth in our home market. We plan to leverage our expertise in partnership credit cards developed over years, decades in the U.S. to drive further growth and customer engagement. Across the rest of Barclays U.K., deposit balances have continued to stabilize and lending trends are encouraging, resulting in organic balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter. U.K. Corporate and the Private Bank and Wealth Management divisions also contributed to the group's balance sheet expansion. In the investment bank, our objective is to improve returns by regaining market share and improving our RWA productivity and cost efficiency. I'm broadly satisfied with how we have fared against these metrics. And of course, I expect further significant progress in each of the next two years in order to deliver our targets. The 8.5% RoTE for the Investment Bank in 2024 is up 1.5% year-on-year, and it's a good step on our journey to deliver returns in line with the group by 2026. And we expect the Investment Bank to deliver further progress on RoTE in the year ahead. Returns in the U.S. consumer bank improved to 9% from 4% as impairment charges normalized as expected and as we proactively improved our operational performance. We've also made good progress to simplify the bank by divesting the non-strategic businesses that we outlined at our investor update. This included the Italian mortgage portfolios in 2024 and the German consumer finance business completed last month. Before I hand over to Anna, I would like to make two broad points. The first is about the composition and quality of our businesses and of our results. As I hope you see in our 2024 outcomes and in our 2025 outlook, we are aiming to construct a bank with a good mix of businesses, which performed well individually and collectively. We aim to achieve a healthy balance between consumer and wholesale activities, a sound revenue weighting among fees, interest and transactions. And the geographical mix, which takes advantage of the full scope of our presence in the U.K. the depth and breadth of our business in the U.S. and from both those locations, bridges to the important financial centers of the world. Through this, we aim to deliver robust and reliable performance across interest rate and credit cycles. That is the objective of the business strategy, which we presented last year and which we continue to prosecute. My second broad point is that, while Anna and I have the honor to present our results, this performance has been generated by over 90,000 colleagues at Barclays. They have helped to implement the strategy so far, and they are core to our achieving success over the next two years. And to further align their efforts with our shareholders as interest, our colleagues should be able to participate in the ultimate outcome of their work, which is the change in our share price. Therefore, we are announcing today a share grant of approximately \u00a3500 million each for the vast majority of our colleagues. Essentially, all employees across all locations outside of managing directors and what we call material risk takers. I have long felt that this kind of alignment between shareholders and employees through broad-based equity participation, strengthens business outcomes. In the U.K., sadly, broad-based equity ownership has been declining. This represents our effort towards arresting and correcting this trend. So with that, I'll hand over to Anna.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 summarizes our financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year. Profit before tax was \u00a38.1 billion and was up 24%. This included a Q4 profit before tax of \u00a31.7 billion, up from \u00a30.1 billion. Before going into the detail, as always, I would note that our results are affected by FX rates. The year-on-year performance in Q4 was impacted by a weaker U.S. dollars, which decreased our reported income, costs, and impairments. Conversely, the dollar strengthened from Q3 to Q4. And I'll call out these effects where appropriate. Group's statutory RoTE was 10.5% for 2024 versus our target of greater than 10%. This was against the previous year's RoTE of 9%, which was impacted by \u00a30.9 billion of structural cost actions in Q4. Much of the improvement in RoTE reflected higher income, particularly in the investment bank, Barclays U.K. and Private Bank and Wealth Management. This improvement occurred even as we grew tangible book value per share by 26p during the year to 357p. Throughout the year, as you know, I've been looking for four things in our performance. Income stability, cost discipline and progress on efficiency savings, credit performance and a robust capital position. We delivered on all four. I'll now cover these in more detail, starting with income on Slide 8. Our income growth continues to be supported by the structural hedge and is now complemented by balance sheet growth. Income in the Investment Bank, while seasonally lower in Q4 benefited from the execution of our initiatives to improve productivity and an increase in the industry wallet. Together, this resulted in a 6% increase in total group income for the year to \u00a326.8 billion. Excluding FX, income was up 7% year-on-year. More stable income streams from retail, corporate and financing grew 3% year-on-year and together contributed 74% of group income. Turning to NII. Our group net interest income increased for the third consecutive year by 3% in FY '24 to \u00a311.3 billion. Excluding Tesco, group NII increased 2% to \u00a311.2 billion. And within this, Barclays U.K. rose 1% to \u00a36.5 billion. Both were in line with our guidance at Q3 and more favorable than our February guidance. This reflected the benefit of higher-than-expected interest rates and faster deposit stabilization on our NII, including as a result of higher reinvestment income from the structural hedge. The structural hedge is designed to reduce income volatility and manage interest rate risk. The high proportion of balances hedged reduces our sensitivity to the short-term effect of rate cuts. NII from the hedge increased \u00a31.1 billion during the year to \u00a34.7 billion. Income provided by the hedge is significant and predictable. We've now locked in \u00a39.1 billion of gross income over the next two years up from \u00a37.8 billion at Q3 and \u00a34.8 billion a year ago. This income will continue to build as we reinvest maturing assets at higher yields. As consumer deposit behavior has stabilized, the average duration of the hedge has increased modestly to around three years. Moving on to costs. We achieved a cost-income ratio of 62% for the year below our circa 63% target. This included a \u00a390 million motor finance provision in Q4. In line with our plan, we delivered \u00a31 billion of gross efficiency savings during the year, including \u00a30.3 billion during Q4. These savings created capacity for investments and business growth. We also took proactive steps to accelerate structural cost actions in a number of our divisions given the strong performance in the year, whilst importantly, still delivering on our cost income ratio target. The costs of these measures, which will support our future returns and efficiency came to \u00a3110 million in the quarter, or \u00a3273 million in total for 2024, well within our normal annual range. Turning now to impairment. The Q4 -- sorry, the FY '24 impairment charge of \u00a32 billion equated to a loan loss rate of 46 basis points. This included a day one charge for Tesco Bank of \u00a3209 million where accounting rules require balances to be brought on to our books at Stage 1. The U.K. credit picture remains benign with low and stable delinquencies in our consumer books and wholesale loan loss rates below our through-the-cycle expectations. Specifically, the Barclays U.K. charge was \u00a3365 million, including day one effects from Tesco, resulting in a loan loss rate of 16 basis points for 2024. The U.S. consumer bank impairment charge was down 10% year-on-year at \u00a31.3 billion. Delinquencies in UCSB are developing in line with our expectations, with 30- and 90-day delinquencies stable. As guided, impairment charges in this business were lower in '24 versus the prior year, and H2 was also lower than H1. Coverage ratios remained strong. Looking ahead, we expect the loan loss rate in FY '25 to be similar to '24. This includes the lagged effect of hard delinquencies in the past 12 to 18 months and the anticipated day one effect of bringing the General Motors partnership on board in Q3 '25. I would also note that loan loss rates tend to be seasonally higher in Q1 given holiday spend in Q4. Turning now to our U.K. growth. This slide summarizes key aspects of our organic growth. Gross mortgage lending strengthened throughout the year, supported by a more active property market and higher loan-to-value lending. 15% of our mortgage lending was to higher LTV borrowers, up from 9% in 2023. We acquired 1 million new Barclaycard customers up 58% year-on-year as part of our strategy to regain market share in unsecured lending. And in the corporate bank, we deployed around \u00a33 billion of RWAs by extending client lending facilities to support future lending growth. Clients have now started to draw down on these facilities reflected in around \u00a31 billion of net U.K. corporate loan growth in Q4. Turning now to Barclays U.K. You can see financial highlights on Slide 15, but I will talk to Slide 16. The acquisition of Tesco Bank in November complicates comparisons for Q4. So let me start by unpacking the moving parts. First, there was a gain on acquisition of \u00a30.6 billion and a day one impairment charge of \u00a30.2 billion. Together, these created a one-off benefit to Barclays U.K. statutory RoTE, which was 28% in the quarter. Excluding these day one effect, Barclays U.K. RoTE was 19.1%. Second, comparisons are affected by the inclusion of Tesco Bank's underlying earnings for two months since November. This included \u00a3101 million of NII and around \u00a360 million of costs in line with our guidance for \u00a330 million run rate cost per month. We continue to expect circa \u00a3400 million of NII from Tesco in 2024, 2025. Whilst the Q4 run rate exceeded this level, we expect this to normalize in future quarters. The inclusion of higher NIM balances from Tesco also explains around 11 of the 19 basis points increase in BUK NIM versus Q3. Excluding Tesco Bank, Barclays NII increased \u00a348 million Q-on-Q. This reflected continued structural hedge momentum and a tailwind from balance sheet growth partially offset by product repricing lags. Non-NII was \u00a3244 million, the decline versus Q3 reflects the one-off effect of the Q4 securitization that we previously highlighted. Going forward, we continue to expect a run rate above \u00a3250 million per quarter. Q4 costs -- total costs increased by \u00a3209 million versus Q3 to \u00a31.2 billion. This included around \u00a360 million for Tesco Bank and a \u00a336 million bank levy. The remaining increase reflected investment to support growth and structural cost actions. Moving on to the Barclays U.K. balance sheet. In Q4, both loans and deposits grew organically. The acquisition of Tesco Bank added a further \u00a38 billion of loans and \u00a37 billion of deposits. On an organic basis, deposit balances grew by circa \u00a31 billion. Flows into savings accounts and current accounts were particularly strong ahead of the U.K. budget in October and customers have so far retained this liquidity. Looking ahead, tax payments during Q1 typically lead to a seasonal reduction in customer deposit balances. And as I discussed earlier, stronger activity in mortgages and Barclaycard led to a \u00a31 billion increase in Q4 lending before the effect of our securitization in the quarter. Moving on to the U.K. Corporate Bank. U.K. Corporate Bank delivered a Q4 RoTE of 12.3%. NII was up 31% year-on-year, reflecting deposit income growth and the non-repeat of adverse liquidity pool income in the prior year. Non-NII was down 9% year-on-year and broadly flat to Q3. Whilst this line can be volatile, we expect investments in our digital and lending propositions to drive non-NII growth over time. Investments to support this growth and to drive greater efficiency led to a 10% year-on-year increase in costs, excluding the structural cost actions we took in Q4 '23. And our full-year loan loss rate of 29 basis points was within our through-the-cycle guidance of circa 35 basis points. Turning now to Private Bank and Wealth Management. Q4 RoTE was 23.9%. Client assets and liabilities grew \u00a37 billion versus Q3 and \u00a326 billion versus the prior year. We also attracted net new assets under management of \u00a30.7 billion in Q4 and \u00a33.7 billion for the year. This is a new metric that we will disclose going forward. This growth in volumes as well as higher transactional activity led to a 12% year-on-year increase in income. Excluding Q4 '23 structural cost actions, costs were up 15% year-on-year as we took further actions this quarter to optimize headcount and drive business growth. As you heard at our deep dive in December, we will continue to prioritize investment in this business. Turning now to the Investment Bank. The Q4 RoTE was seasonally low at 3.4% with a full-year RoTE of 8.5%, both ahead of the prior year. Q4 total income was up 28% year-on-year, while total costs rose 11%, excluding the Q4 structural cost actions. This was the third consecutive quarter of positive jaws. Adjusted for FX, total income was up 31% year-on-year, and costs were up 12% year-on-year, excluding structural cost actions in the prior year. Part of the increase in our Q4 costs reflected actions we took to improve future efficiency. Period-end RWAs of \u00a3199 billion were \u00a35 billion higher versus Q3, with FX accounting for \u00a36 billion of the increase. Now looking at the Q4 income in more detail. Using the U.S. dollar figures as usual to help comparison to U.S. peers, markets income was up 36% year-on-year. Macroeconomic conditions supported a 32% increase in FICC income driven by financing, credit, rates and FX. Equities income was up 44%, aided by strong performance across cash, prime and derivatives. Investment banking fees rose 22%. For FY '24 as a whole, our share of banking fees increased by 30 basis points to 3.3%, but we have more work to do to build on this improvement. Within Q4, our ECM performance was strong, with income up 160% year-on-year. Advisory fees were also up 12% with good momentum and a robust pipeline headed into 2025. Whilst DCM was up 10% year-on-year, our performance was mixed. In leverage finance, we increased market share by 70 basis points to 4.7% in a strong market. This was offset by softer performance in investment grade, particularly in Q4, with a strong Asian wallet, which we did not participate in, given our limited presence in the region. In addition, we were less active in event financing in the quarter, and this represents an opportunity as we further improve our advisory capabilities. Importantly, we saw progress in areas of the investment bank that inherently have more stable revenues. Financing income was up 34% reflecting a strong increase in client balances and international corporate bank income was up 22%. U.S. deposit balances grew by circa 90% year-on-year which we see as a lead indicator of income growth. U.S. Consumer Bank RoTE was 11.2% in the quarter. The improvement versus the prior year reflected lower impairment charges following the reserve build in H2 '23. Income was down 1% year-on-year or up 1% excluding FX. This reflected a $0.9 billion increase in card balances to \u00a333.1 billion on a reported basis. From Q3 to Q4, NII increased 5%, supported by seasonally stronger balances, which also grew 5%. NIM rose 28 basis points partly reflecting the lagged benefit of our repricing actions earlier in the year. The successful launch of our new tiered retail savings product in Q3 led to a 17% year-on-year growth in retail deposit funding with a $2 billion increase in Q4. The proportion of core deposits rose 1% year-on-year to 64%, reflecting wholesale funding raised during Q4 to meet seasonal asset growth. As seasonal spending eases we should see a further increase in our share of funding from core deposits towards our target of 75% in 2026. Excluding Q4 2023 structural cost actions, total costs were up 8% as we continue to invest in the growth of the business, driving a cost-to-income ratio of 51%. Moving to capital. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%. This included around 140 basis points of capital generation from profits, excluding the day 1 P&L benefit of the Tesco Bank acquisition. We previously highlighted two inorganic transactions that would impact capital in the near term, both of which have now completed. The first was the circa 20 basis points of capital consumption from the acquisition of Tesco Bank in Q4. The second is the circa 10 basis points accretion from the sale of the German consumer finance business, which was completed last month and will benefit the CET1 ratio in Q1 '25. The \u00a31 billion share buyback we announced today will also lower the ratio by around 30 basis points in Q1. Looking ahead, we maintain our guidance for between \u00a319 billion and \u00a326 billion of regulatory-driven RWA inflation. The U.K. regulator's decision to postpone the implementation of Basel 3.1 to January 2027 may, however, alter the mix and phasing of this change. Adopting IRB in the U.S. consumer bank is still expected to increase RWAs by circa \u00a316 billion. Whilst uncertainty around the size and the mix of the portfolio at the time of implementation has increased, this remains our best estimate for now. In the meantime, there are a few changes in the regulatory landscape. Prior to implementing IRB for U.S. cards, our Pillar 2A requirement will increase by 0.1% from Q1 2025. We expect this Pillar 2A capital to be removed when the IRB model is implemented in 2026 or 2027, when this \u00a316 billion RWA increase is reflected in Pillar 1. Consequently, our maximum distributable amount ratio or MDA is expected to rise to 12.2% from Q1 '25. We previously expected that this would reduce following the implementation of Basel 3 in January 2026, but this will now be delayed to January 2027. Reflecting this, you should continue to expect us to operate towards the upper half of our 13% to 14% target CET1 range as we have been doing. Naturally, our distribution expectations remain unchanged. Turning now to recent RWA developments. RWAs increased \u00a318 billion from Q3 to \u00a3358 billion. Tesco Bank added \u00a37 billion and a further \u00a37 billion was driven by FX in the Investment Bank and the U.S. Consumer Bank. As usual, a brief word on our overall capital and liquidity on Slide 30. We maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding, and a significant excess of deposits over loans. TNAV per share increased by 6p in the quarter and by 26p during 2024 to 357p. Attributable profit added 6p per share during Q4, whilst our share buyback and other movements added 1p and 3p, respectively. These were partially offset by a more negative cash flow hedge reserve, which reduced TNAV by 4p per share. This is the fourth quarter in the 12-quarter plan we laid out in February. Today, we are reiterating our group targets for 2026 and providing additional guidance for 2025, including a further improvement in group RoTE to around 11%. I'll come back to discuss the building blocks of this guidance in more detail with you. But first, I would like to hand back to Venkat to take you through some reflections on progress during the first year of our plan.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you, Anna. So almost a year ago today, we set three key priorities for Barclays by 2026, to improve our returns, to distribute more to shareholders and to rebalance our RWAs. We also set 2020 -- interim milestones for 2024, which we have delivered. Our plan was set on realistic assumptions, which together with our diversified business model, allowed us effectively to navigate market, macro and regulatory conditions throughout the year. So what were these? U.K. deposits have stabilized faster and the investment banking wallet has been stronger than we expected. Fixed income, FICC, which is traditionally an area of strength for us, performed slightly weaker than we had expected in 2024, but our strong performance in equities where we have taken market share, partially compensated for this, rebalancing our overall markets business. And the economic environment has been more supportive with interest rates remaining higher alongside more benign unemployment and inflation in our main U.K. and U.S. markets. Last year, I described the important reset of our financial performance and shareholder returns since 2021. I also told you that this improvement was not sufficient and that our shareholder experience needed to be better. We are making progress on our plan and we are generating growth. Notably, we have achieved our fifth consecutive year of TNAV per share growth of 8% during 2024, and 7% annually since 2019. This positive outcome reflects improvements in our returns and growth of our earnings per share, including by 30% year-on-year during 2024 to the highest level in decade. This enabled a 5% increase in total distributions, including progressive growth in our dividend per share. For the group as a whole, we look to generate higher returns in two ways. First, by allocating more capital to our higher returning U.K. businesses, which I'll come on to discuss. And second, by improving returns in the lower returning businesses, namely the investment bank and the U.S. consumer bank. That was true last year when we set out our strategy, and it remains true today. We are making progress, including in target growth areas of the Investment Bank, but further improvements are needed to achieve our RoTE target of greater than 12%. And in the U.S. Consumer Bank, too, we remain focused on rebuilding returns towards the mid-teens RoTE beyond 2026. A reduction of impairments in line with our expectations as well as other operational improvements enabled a 9% RoTE in 2024 versus 4% in 2023. Let me now discuss the allocation of capital to high-return divisions in more detail. At our investor update, we outlined the plan to create a more balanced group. To do this, we plan to allocate \u00a330 billion of additional RWAs to our three highest returning businesses, Barclays U.K., the U.K. Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth Management. As we expected, actions that we took during the year began to generate organic balance sheet growth due towards the end of the year. And including the acquisition of Tesco Bank, RWA is in our highest returning U.K. businesses, increased by \u00a313 billion due to business growth and by \u00a315 billion overall in 2024. And as Anna has discussed earlier, lead indicators of growth across our U.K. businesses are encouraging. Given this, we expect a step-up in our organic RWA deployment during the year with further momentum in 2026. We are committed to keeping Investment Bank RWAs relatively stable at 2023 levels. And this is the third consecutive year in which this division has operated with this level of capital. We continue to expect investment banking RWAs to fall proportionately to about 50% of the group by 2026 from 56% today as we grow the three U.K. businesses. Taking a closer look at the Tesco Bank acquisition, which we are thinking about in three stages: acquire, integrate and improve. The first stage was completed on the 1st of November '24. The acquisition has added \u00a38 million to our unsecured balances, moving our weighting in credit cards and personal loans towards our 2019 position. And the profile of Tesco Bank's customers is attractive. As we show in our operational data pack on Slide 57, Tesco Bank's customers have a higher spend per card than the market average. Tesco's position as the U.K.'s largest retailer with strong customer satisfaction and more than 20 million Tesco Clubcard holders provides a significant customer growth opportunity. We've also gained an additional brand to operate with and an open market lending capability. The second stage is to integrate Tesco Bank, which we intend to do during 2025 and '26 and this involves onboarding Tesco customers to Barclays' platform in 2026 to reduce duplication of systems and processes while maintaining a strong customer experience. The integration will require some upfront investment, but the realization of synergies will reduce the run rate costs. These actions are factored into our plan, and we continue to target a circa 50% cost to income ratio for Barclays U.K. in 2026, following an increase in '25 given the costs associated with the Tesco Bank. The third stage is to improve the business which we expect to gain momentum after 2027. This will involve further growing customer balances supported by better access to funding and to capital. This increased scale will enable greater efficiency as fixed costs are spread over a larger customer base. Turning now to the U.S. consumer bank. We made meaningful progress in 2024, improving RoTE to 9% from 4% and achieving cost-to-income ratio of 49%. We also announced that our American Airlines partnership will not be renewed beyond 2026. American Airlines has been a card partner in our business for seven years as part of a dual issuer model and we valued our long relationship with them. We knew that the partnership could transition to a single issuer model. That happened last year, and we chose not to participate on that basis. The ending of our partnership provides a short-term gain on sale in 2026 and releases capital that we intend to use to diversify the business. We expect the overall credit mix of the portfolio to change, still prime, but with less weighting to super prime balances. And all things being equal, this will lead to a higher net interest margin and loan loss rate and a higher risk-adjusted margin for the portfolio. Our 2026 targets are unchanged, including an RoTE of greater than 12% in line with the group as the gain on sale offsets lower profitability due to the loss of the receivables. We are confident in our ability to grow card balances to achieve necessary scale in the U.S. consumer bank. In line with our broader group strategy, the plan is organic. And organic growth has driven around 85% of our increase -- of the increase in our net card receivables since 2011. And looking ahead, will drive two-thirds of our planned growth. We have a strong foundation for such growth given that over 80% of our card receivables are under contract at least until 2029. Our success in accelerating balance growth for partners also translates into significant loyalty with a historical partnership renewal rate of around 90%. In 2024, notable renewals included Hawaiian and RCI. And at the start of 2025, we have also renewed our partnership with Wyndham. In addition to being a long-standing top five partner for us, Wyndham is also a long-term investment banking client. This provides a good demonstration of how collaboration across the Barclays Group can drive successful outcomes. While organic growth is at the heart of the plan, opportunities for inorganic growth in the market are also significant. For instance, 15 relevant deals [Technical Difficulty] in dollars of balances were tendered annually on average in the market during the past five years. We remain confident in our ability to win new partners given the strength of our offering and our ability to increase customer engagement and balances. And this was evidenced by recent wins, including Breeze in 2023 and General Motors in 2024. The General Motors card portfolio, which we will onboard in the third quarter of '25 will offset about a quarter of the balances we expect to lose from American Airlines. Overall, we remain focused on achieving scale beyond 2026 and driving improved efficiency to deliver mid-teens RoTE for this business. Turning now to the Investment Bank. Last year, we shared our plan to increase returns in the investment bank to greater than 12% by 2026, in line with our group target. While competitive and industry dynamics are creating opportunities and challenges for individual businesses, our overall progress is as expected, and we continue to run our own race. Our objective is to generate higher and more stable income and returns by improving RWA productivity and rebalancing resources in the business, while only modestly increasing costs. We delivered 7% year-on-year income growth in 2024, broadly on track with our high single-digit annualized growth target from '23 to '26. And as a reminder, more than half of our planned growth in the investment bank comes from initiatives, which we control with the remainder coming from growth in the industry wallet. So we expect these initiatives to add \u00a31.8 billion to our income by 2026. And in the first year of our plan, we achieved around a third of this planned improvement. In Investment Banking, we've increased share across most products. This included strong performance in ECM where we increased fee share by about 100 basis points. And in leveraged finance, where we increased share by 70 basis points. And across the three focus businesses in market, we've made progress within equity derivatives and securitized products. And while progress in European rates has been slower, we saw a recovery in the fourth quarter. Across our markets business, we now rank top five with 56 of our top 100 clients, up seven from a year ago and versus our target of 70 by the end of 2026. Our capital productivity has also improved, with income to RWAs increasing by 30 basis points year-on-year to 5.8%. And we achieved positive jaws, with income up 7% from '23 versus a four year -- 4% increase in costs. And this enabled a year-on-year improvement in our cost-to-income ratio to 67%. And we are focused on making further progress on this cost income ratio in 2025 towards our delivery -- towards delivery of our high 50s target for 2026 full-year. I'd like to highlight two areas of progress during the past year that helped to position the investment bank to perform in a range of scenarios. First, as Anna said, we continue to prioritize growth in stable income during 2024, particularly within financing. Growing financing income enhances the durability of our returns, and we now have financing relationships with 98 of our top 100 clients. Second, our banking fee share has increased by 30 basis points year-on-year to 3.3% with the wallet also higher. And we remain particularly positioned -- well positioned to benefit from stronger activity in the U.S. where we generate 68% of our total banking fees. At the same time, our market share in global markets declined 20 basis points in the year reflecting lower share in fixed income, the larger of our markets businesses. And so while we are pleased with our direction of travel, we recognize that there's further work to do to deliver the full extent of our ambition. Let me now hand over to Anna for the final installment of today's update.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Venkat. At our investor update last February, we outlined a plan to deliver ambitious financial targets and meaningfully higher shareholder distributions. We are confident that we can deliver consistent returns in a range of scenarios underpinning our ambition. I'll now go through what supports these targets. The diversification of our business model by income, by geography helps supports return in a range of economic environments. This has contributed to more stable returns in the last four years. As Venkat mentioned, the external environment in 2024 was generally more supportive than we expected. But in executing our plan, we remain focused on what we can control. Our plan continues to be based on realistic assumptions. These include four U.K. base rate cuts during 2025 and a bank rate of 3.5% by the end of 2026. We also assume a five year swap rate of around 3.5% for the purpose of our structural hedge reinvestment, although I acknowledge that current market rates are higher. And we are not relying on a recovery in the investment banking wallet to deliver our plan with our assumptions unchanged from those we outlined last year. The next few slides describe how our drive towards higher and more predictable returns come together for our shareholders. Our 2026 targets are unchanged, including our North Star of a RoTE above 12%. Our foundation is strong, having delivered 10.5% last year, and we expect further improvement in 2025 to around 11%. Crucially, we expect income growth to provide a RoTE tailwind in 2025 with NII accounting for more than half of this. We will maintain cost discipline as we grow. We expect our cost income ratio to fall in 2025, and we expect further cost efficiency savings and income momentum into 2026. This combination will support a RoTE of more than 12%. I'll now explain the drivers of our income and costs in turn. We continue to target around \u00a330 billion of income in 2026. This means a further \u00a33 billion of income growth over the next two years, having delivered \u00a31.4 billion in 2024. The drivers of our growth are within our control. First, the strong NII tailwind. For 2025, we expect a \u00a30.9 billion increase in group NII, of which \u00a30.8 million is from Barclays U.K. Our confidence in delivering this reflects the predictable tailwind from the structural hedge underpinned by realistic assumptions about rates and reinvestment yields. And this tailwind lasts beyond '25 with the structural hedge driving around half of our expected increase in total group income over the next two years. In addition, we expect balance sheet and earnings momentum from the deployment of RWAs in our three high returning U.K. businesses. This momentum was apparent in Q4 and we expect it to continue and to be visible in our 2025 performance. Second, non-NII, mainly coming from the investment bank. We expect to deliver a high single-digit CAGR income growth over the life of our three year plan and are broadly on track, having delivered 7% in '24. Overall year-on-year growth of \u00a30.8 billion in the IB included \u00a30.2 billion from wallet growth. Importantly, the biggest share of this increase of \u00a30.6 billion came from the execution of our management initiatives or a third of the \u00a31.8 billion total we expect by 2026. This leaves a further \u00a31.2 billion of growth from management actions over the next two years. As with the case last year, we are not relying on wallet growth to meet our target. In fact, our assumptions are unchanged from a year ago with a lower banking wallet in both '25 and '26 versus '24. And should the recovery continue, our business is strongly positioned to participate in a rebound in deal activity, particularly in the U.S., where we generate around two-thirds of our banking fees. Moving on to costs. Managing cost is at the heart of what we can control. We showed this in 2024 achieving a 62% cost-to-income ratio. This improvement versus 2023 was supported by the delivery of \u00a31 billion of gross efficiency savings in the year. These savings reflected targeted actions in respect to people, property, and infrastructure. For example, in the past year, we decommissioned around 200 legacy applications as part of our plan to exit between 450 and 500 by 2026. We increased our digitally active customers in Barclays U.K. by 700,000 and rationalized our branch network by more than 25%. And in markets, our actions during the last two years have driven a 20% reduction in the number of trade capture and risk pricing systems supporting our efficiency and operational resilience. Looking forward, there are three drivers of cost change in 2025 and 2026. First, efficiency savings. We expect a further \u00a31 billion in gross efficiency savings split broadly evenly across the next two years. Around one-third of these savings come from plans to simplify customer journeys with the rest driven by actions to streamline businesses, including the optimization of people and technology. Second, inflation which we expect to be more meaningful in '25 versus '26. This is because inflation impacts on us on a lagged basis, so '25 reflects some of the headline inflation pressure we've observed recently. It also includes a \u00a350 million increase in national insurance contributions following the U.K. budget. And third, greater investment in our highest returning businesses in 2025. Specifically, I would call out the annualization of investment costs, which have increased during 2024 and additional Tesco Bank costs, including integration. In 2025, incremental investment and inflation are expected to exceed efficiency savings, resulting in an increase in our costs. In 2026, we expect costs to be broadly stable, if not down a little year-on-year, as incremental investment and inflation moderate and are offset by efficiency savings. Given this cost profile and planned income growth, we expect our cost-to-income ratio to fall by 1% in 2025 to circa 61% and to fall more significantly to our high 50s percent in 2026. Given our 2026 income target of \u00a330 billion, our high 50s cost-to-income target would be consistent with around \u00a317 billion of costs. We will drive further efficiency beyond that in each of our businesses and for the group as a whole. Barclays U.K. and Investment Bank represents some 70% of our planned cost efficiency savings, work to reduce duplicate systems and processes for Tesco Bank should reduce the cost run rate from circa \u00a330 million per month currently synergies are realized. And across Barclays U.K., we remain focused on streamlining and digitizing the business to improve our efficiency. And in the Investment Bank, we invested significantly between 2021 and '23 to sustain and grow future income. In markets that investment centered around technology, whilst the focus in investment banking was more on people. We expect these actions to result in greater productivity and a high 50s cost-to-income ratio in the investment bank by 2026, with further efficiencies expected beyond. Put differently, 2026 does not represent the full extent of our ambition. Turning now to capital and capital generation. As we grow returns in line with our plan, we expect to generate around 170 basis points of capital during 2025, rising to more than 200 basis points in 2026. We have a clear hierarchy for capital allocation in order of priority, first, to hold a prudent level of capital with an expectation that we will continue to operate towards the upper half of our 13% to 14% CET1 target range, taking into account regulatory requirements. By doing this, we deliver for our investors, customers, clients, and colleagues regardless of the environment; second, to distribute capital to our shareholders; and third, to invest selectively in our highest returning divisions, resulting in a more profitable RWA mix and a better bank for all our stakeholders. We set a high bar for investment returns given the importance we place on shareholder distributions overall. We announced \u00a33 billion of capital distributions in respect of FY '24. These distributions represent an important step in our target to return at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders during the life of our plan. We expect a progressive increase in our total payout during 2025. And as a reminder, we plan to keep the total dividend broadly stable at \u00a31.2 billion per year, growing our dividend per share progressively through lower share count. Bringing this together, we are reiterating our group targets for 2026 and are providing additional guidance for 2025. This includes 2025 RoTE guidance of circa 11% and a progressive increase in our total payout versus \u00a33 billion per year in the past two years. The expected increase in RoTE will be supported by group NII growth to around \u00a312.2 billion including an increase in Barclays U.K. to around \u00a37.4 billion. We expect to improve the cost -- group cost income ratio to circa 61%. Our progress during 2024 provides a solid foundation for these milestones. We continue to deliver against our plan to achieve a RoTE greater than 12% by focusing on structural actions that are within our control to improve income and efficiency. Over to Venkat for final remarks.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thanks again, Anna. So one year into the three year plan. We are pleased with our progress, but we recognize that there's still work to be done to deliver our 2026 targets. And we are working hard to deliver sustainable operational and financial improvement across our businesses. And this, in turn, we expect will drive higher group returns and shareholder distributions.\nA - C.S. Venkatakrishnan: I'll now open to question-and-answers. Please limit yourself to two questions per person so that we can get around as many of you as possible, I will begin Alvaro with you.\nAlvaro Serrano: Thank you. Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Two questions, please. One on your income assumptions. I've noted that you expect wallet share -- the size of wallet to come down, but I'll focus on BUK, because I guess we'll have a view on that. On BUK, the guidance for 2025 looks my numbers for an underlying 2% growth versus the run rate in Q4, which sounds quite conservative given the volume growth and given the hedge contribution should be increasing. Are you just being conservative? Or are we missing any moving parts around more competition in asset product like mortgage? Is there anything we're missing there? I just been out of conservatism? And the second question on capital. If we take out, obviously, the buyback and German cards will come down and you want to operate at the higher end of the 13% to 14%. Do you have any sort of RWA efficiency measures that you can call out? And I'm thinking, obviously, there's been a Twitter sale. It sounds like a couple of blocks there, and these are very high risk-weighted sort of kind of positions over to 50% from -- if memory serve me right, will that have a significant impact that will help you sort of reallocate the capital to growth areas? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Alvaro. I'll take both of those. So let me start with the question that you didn't ask, but you sort of asked, which was about the banking wallet. So I want to be really clear here. We are assuming or we have an assumption that the banking wallet remains as we had it last year. You shouldn't take from that, that if the opportunities are greater in the market that we would seek to monetize those as we have done in Q4 and indeed all the way through 2024. So I'll just call out that distinction. Relating to Barclays U.K., we're guiding to NII next year or in '25 of \u00a37.4 billion. As I think about that number, I reflect back on 2024. And actually, what we've seen in successive quarters is strong NII growth. And we expect that to continue in 2025 and into 2026. BUK NII is not near its peak. As I take the 7.4%, I think of it in a number of building blocks. So the first is take the Q4 run rate ex-Tesco multiply that by 4. Then add on \u00a3400 million for Tesco, add on the impact of maturing structural hedge this year. Now we are assuming a reinvestment rate of 3.5% in that calculation, and then take off the impact of four base rate reductions in the year. As I put those building blocks together, you will get to around \u00a37.4 billion. In addition to that, there's two further things for you to consider. The first, as you note, we have got good momentum in the business, and you can see that in Q4. You can see that in cards and in mortgages, we expect that to continue. In our calculation, what we're assuming here is that there is some offset in margin. I wouldn't call anything out in particular. I would just say particularly in liability margins, we expect a continuation of migration. Nothing more than we've seen. So I'm not expecting it to accelerate, but I'm just assuming that those two things are somewhat offsetting within the year. You may have different expectations for those macro assumptions or indeed the swap rate. But we're trying to route this plan within factors that we can control, and we believe that we've made realistic assumptions that underpin that number. But I'd just highlight, we're expecting continued income momentum in BUK into '25 and beyond. In terms of your capital number, I mean, I'm not going to speak about any client positions as you would expect. Our focus here is on executing the plan as it is elsewhere. We'd expect the investment bank to operate within the framework we've given it for RWAs. So you should expect those RWAs to be broadly flat. The thing that you didn't call out actually was organic capital generation. That's what we're confident in here. So throughout Q1, remember, Q1 is a seasonally strong quarter for us. We deploy RWAs into the business, but seasonally, it is very strong for us in terms of investment banking and markets activity. And as we've called out in the presentation, our expectation is that organic capital generation will continue to develop, both in '25 and in '26 and the kind of capital range that we talked about today is no different from where you've seen us operate actually over the last two to three years.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: So I'll come to you in a second, early, but just if I may emphasize one thing, which is behind the spirit of what we did last year and what we're doing this year is given you our slides, we've given an operational data pack. We've been very clear with our assumptions. Right. And I think not just on NII, but other aspects. I think that's our approach, which is to tell you what we think structurally we are trying to achieve. Our cyclical assumptions or our macro assumptions and allow you, therefore to impose your view, if you'd like, right.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hello, thank you, Venkat. Thank you, Anna for taking my question. So I guess the first one is on '26 targets. And I guess a share price reaction this morning, maybe reflects the fact that people were expecting a little bit more. And as you noted that -- well, the environment is probably better than what you were sitting on a year ago when you put out the targets for the first time across every metric you could think of pretty much. So I guess, why did you not upgrade '26 targets a bit more. I mean, I know it's greater than 12%. So -- but would you, for example like invite us to put more focus on the greater than, for example, and any color you could give on that would be really helpful. Just if you were to come up with a plan today, wouldn't you be more optimistic than you were a year ago? I guess that's the first question. And the second question is on U.S. cards. Just the direction of the business as the AA book phases out. So do you still see it as a growth business? Because a few years ago, that was an area of growth that we all looked at? And then I guess more operationally, what does the exit of AA mean? So what I'm thinking is that, well, maybe receivables growth will be a bit slower in the next couple of years as the bill comes to an end. And then as you take on new books, well, there will be more J-curve impact and more day 1 impairments, et cetera. So how is that going to impact the RoTE because I know that you haven't changed the guidance on that either.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: I'll let Anna take the first part and then I'll comment for the second part.\nAnna Cross: Yes, sure. So our focus is management, Pearly [ph]. What you should expect us to do is to execute the operational plan and deliver the financials without surprises. That is our objective. And so our focus is on executing the plan that we've given you. And I would emphasize the greater than 12 and the -- at least \u00a310 billion. But our primary focus really is on executing that plan. We're pleased with the progress that we've made in 2024. We've hit all of the targets and guidance that we gave you, and we feel we've set the business up really well for momentum in '25 and '26. And I'll just call out that difference that I highlighted before. We are planning on realistic assumptions because we want as much of this plan within our control as is possible. However, if the market environment allows whether that be interest rates, swap rates or the banking wallet, you should expect us to monetize that opportunity. Venkat?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes. Look, I'll emphasize that as well, which is that it's a realistic plan. It's a confident plan, right? It's a confident plan, which is based on strong structural progress across the things which we can control and then taking advantage of cyclical opportunities as we did last year, and we expect to, as they come up. On the U.S. cards business, we remain confident for a couple of reasons. First of all, we gave you the statistic of the number of accounts and the volume of receivables that come up for bid. Second, which is \u00a340 billion in this thing. Second is that we have a, locked up around 90% of our -- 85% of our net receivables outside of American through to 2029. And third, we have a retention rate of 90% renewal rate. We operate in a very specialized place with midsized companies for whom we have a particular skill at managing their partnership portfolio and able to grow their balances and increased customer engagement. And so just like General Motors came in this year, we will continue to look for these opportunities. I'm fairly confident we'll land them because when we participate in these, we know what we provide very valuably into the market. And then on the operational side, we will continue -- to come back to your point on J-curve, first of all, if a lot of the book, 85% of the book is locked through 2029, yes, there will be a J-curve for new things, right? But as a proportion of the business, it's smaller. Would you add anything?\nAnna Cross: Yes. I'll just reflect back on the plan that we set out last year. It's a plan of many parts. It's an executional plan that actually goes all the way through the P&L and the balance sheet. Clearly, revenue growth is important, but it's not the only thing that we're working on to improve the RoTE of the business. So we're working very hard on mitigating the impacts of regulatory headwinds. So you saw that transaction in Q1 of this year. We're working very hard in terms of the cost efficiency of this business. The cost income ratio is now below 50% in this business. It's fallen for the last consecutive four years. And remember, we're targeting to get it to mid-40s. So there's a big digitization push in this business. The third thing is we continue to work on the net interest margin of the business. We spoke again about that last year and that there are two parts. The first was repricing. We completed that repricing in 2024. And you're going to see it start to accumulate in the NIM over time. And the second thing is really reducing our funding cost by driving up the proportion of retail deposits. Again, I spoke about that in my prepared remarks. So Venkat is absolutely right, there are there are opportunities here to grow volume, but our RoTE delivery is volume, capital efficiency, cost efficiency and NIM.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Go ahead, please.\nBenjamin Toms: Yes. Ben Toms from RBC. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. There's been a lot of discussion over the last month around the government going softer on regulation. For example, changes in LTV restrictions. Do any of the changes that have been put forward actually have the potential to be material tailwinds? And if -- how you put a beat to Barclays if there was a leveling of the playing field on ring fencing so you could use the first \u00a335 billion of your deposits to fund other parts of the group. And I guess, tied to this, does the messaging around risk attitude for M&A in the U.K. have the potential to cause you to rethink your low tolerance to material transactions? Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Good questions, both. So look, I think we are at the early stages of a regulatory debate in the U.K., which go both to what might happen on prudential regulation as well as consumer regulation. We do think that, obviously, regulation is very important, and it's important to the city of London. We also think it's important to have a balanced regulatory outlook and one that is commensurate across the globe. So in the U.S., you're seeing a rethinking on Basel, on the base of Basel as well as stress testing. And the PRA has postponed its own decisions till 2027. We would always want. We've always advocated for consistency in total capital requirements. That means base capital in Basel as well as stress testing. And that's what we'd like to see, but it's too soon for me to say one way or the other what the results are going to be. So you've seen the plan that we've given you with the assumptions we have. On the consumer side, obviously, there has been volatility that's come in because of impact of regulations, impact of court cases, worries about retrospective application of these things. And you've seen it in the charges that people have taken and we took a provision on Motor Finance. What I'm very happy about on that is that we were small in the business, and we exited the business in 2019, right? And so you've got to risk manage this situation, you should always expect us to do that. And then as far as M&A, look, this is an organic plan, right? And what you're seeing us do is to present what we aim to do for this bank in an organic way. And that is what we intend to be absolutely focused on.\nAnna Cross: I might just add on -- because I think you asked about mortgages also, Ben. There are three things, I think, being talked about. The first is some reduction in the restrictions around loan to income and also sort of affordability stress testing. I think our perception would be the second is probably more meaningful in the current environment just because of the interest rate environment, that affordability test is probably the one that restrains the market a little bit more. And then the third thing is around potentially reducing RWA weightings in higher loan-to-value mortgages. We're an IRB bank. So any change to the standardization -- standardized rules wouldn't impact Barclays. They would impact Kensington, but not the Barclays lending, not the larger part of the group.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes, Andy.\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. If I could just start with costs. Thank you for Slide 47. I'm just going to rephrase the slide, I guess, essentially, \u00a316.7 billion of costs in 2024 if we're thinking about this in absolute cost terms rather than cost income, given that you've got the U.K., Tesco double run investment in corporate and PBWM, you've got FX translation. Presumably what you're essentially saying is you're expecting the cost base to grow to in excess of \u00a317 billion in 2025 before them fading back to around \u00a317 million in 2026, but just wanted to make sure that understanding was correct. And then the second question on the U.S. Consumer Bank. You've specifically drawn out on Slide 39 that there is going to be a gain on the sale of the AA portfolio, and that seems to be included within the target. So does that mean that come 2027, the RoTE fades again before it then recovers thereafter within that division.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Go ahead.\nAnna Cross: Yes, I'll go ahead. So let's just look at Slide 47, please. The answer is yes. So we're expecting our costs to go up in 2025 because of the annualization of Tesco because of the integration costs of Tesco and because of those inflation headwinds that I talked about in my prepared remarks. But underneath all of this, you've got a continued focus in gross efficiency. So that's going to be continuing. In '25, inflation and investment outweigh the efficiency. In '26, it's the other way around. So actually, I'm expecting costs to go above \u00a317 billion actually. I think consensus is not in a bad place and then drop back. So that's my expectation. In terms of U.S. Consumer Bank, in 2026, you're going to have those two offsetting effects, as Venkat said, you're going to have a gain on sale and you're going to have a more immediate impact from loss of volume. I'm not going to guide you to a 2027 RoTE at this point. I would just make a few points. Firstly, we're confident in our ability to regain volume both organically and inorganically. Secondly, I'd just remind you of what Venkat said in his remarks where he talked about American Airline was an incredibly important partner for us. But in terms of risk-adjusted returns, it's a lower part of our portfolio. And we will continue to really focus on the things that I talked about in terms of cost efficiency, in terms of capital efficiency, in terms of NIM. So let me give you an example on cost efficiency. So the digitization, if you like, of U.S. cards. So as customers interact with us in a retail business, clearly, we want a large portion of that to be digital. In U.S. cards, that's low 90s. If I compare that to either BUK or indeed the German cards business that we've just sold, that was high 90s. So we do feel we've got good opportunities here to continue to streamline the business.\nJason Napier: Jason Napier from UBS. Two questions on. Firstly, on cards and then secondly, on the Tesco Bank acquisition. There's a lot of focus on cards and whether Barclays is the right owner for the asset given the differential in capital loading that you are going to be having at some point. So one of the benefits is that the IB carries less capital because of the stress losses that the card business helps protect the unit from. Can you give us some concrete sense as to how much of a saving that is? I think it's a really important part of the debate, helped not only by what it means for you, but also by the excitement about easier stress tests in the U.S. at some point, we'll see how that goes. Secondly, on Tesco Bank, it came in at about a 90% indicated cost-income ratio. And it looks like from Slide 47, if I'm reading it correctly, it doesn't actually contribute to a lower cost income ratio to the end of '26. Is that right? Or is that part of the efficiency gains? And maybe you could just talk about how much pre-provision profit do you think it can make -- there was a deployment of capital, it felt like a cost takeout story in the beginning. It's no longer that. If you could just talk about how much profit do you think it might generate once you're done? Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: I'll take the first one, let Anna take the second one. So I think the easiest way for you to see it. Obviously, it's under current rules is to look at the CCAR results of the top banks in the U.S. and look both at our initial level of capital, which we keep and look at the drawdown and compare it to banks who don't have that kind of a credit card or a retail consumer portfolio in the mix. Now scenarios vary from year-to-year and so on. So you have to look at it for a few years, but you will get a sense of the benefit. And I think it is an important regulatory benefit for us to have it in the stress test. It's under current rules, right? Anna?\nAnna Cross: Thanks, Jason. I'll take the second one. So you're right. Tesco has got a high cost income ratio around 90%. And I think that reflects in and of itself, it's lack of scale as a stand-alone business. And so I think our view is as follows. This is -- it actually still is a cost take-out story, but this is a complex integration. It's not like a portfolio and asset runoff. It's a growing business; an active business and credit cards have a daily and digital interaction with the customers. So actually, it's quite a complex piece of work. But we are confident that we can do it, and we can -- we're confident that we can execute it well. But it doesn't happen as quickly as if, for example, we bought a mortgage portfolio. And that's really what you're seeing here. Our expectation that this is RoTE accretive to BUK and indeed, the group hasn't changed. Typically, I would expect the cost income ratio of an unsecured business to be relatively low, certainly lower than BUK as a whole. And if you want a good indication, look at where we're trying to get the USCB business too. So hopefully, that gives you some indication. But you're going to see an increase in '25, both from the operational cost, if you like, that you'll running some investment in integration, you'll start to see some efficiencies flow through in 2026. But as Venkat said, the real scaling and the real unlocking of that value will come somewhat beyond '26. But that's included in all of the targets that we have given you for BUK and for the group.\nJason Napier: Thanks.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes, Ken [ph]?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, two questions. The first one is regarding the fixed income business. You discussed around the market share gains in equities. And I just want to understand a little bit where are you on the market share gains on fixed income. If you can talk a little bit about what has to happen for that to come through? And then secondly, just getting back to Tesco Bank. I mean for me, what's more interesting is actually the customers that you gain. So can you talk a little bit about the 3 million roughly active customers in terms of overlap, but also the 20 million club card customers, what is really the opportunity in terms of data that you're getting in the long term?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes. Let me take the first one, and Anna can take the second one. So within fixed income, we've had three focus -- we've had two focus areas. One is securitized products and the other was European rates. And I think it's fair to say securitized products did well through the year. Credit, which has been a historical great strength of ours. It was a smaller part of the overall wallet last year as spreads remained both subdued and tight. And then the third thing is that European rates started picking up only later in the year as did macro overall. So when we look and we give you the market share, there are two ways we look at it. One is the market share number, which we give, which is we take us on the top nine other banks, 10 banks total and look at what our proportion was. And that's always a little bit of noise in it because we are not in commodities. That's part of the number. There are certain regional exposures we don't have, especially in Asia. But the other number which we look at is our penetration of our top 100 clients. So we are #6 markets business and #6 investment bank. So we ask off that top 100, how many of them are we #5 with, right? So one step higher. And in that, that number, which we began at 49 in '23 and want to be at 70 by '26, we've moved from 49 to 56. So I take comfort from looking at that data with those clients in the things we do. But of course, I want to see a broader improvement in fixed income. I'm confident, as I said earlier, because I think this is our strength. And we have strong structural presence and cyclicality when it comes place towards trends will help us.\nAnna Cross: On Tesco, I think we'd agree with you. It's an exciting opportunity. And I think that comes in a number of parts. When we look at the customers, obviously, with 20 million Clubcard customers, that's broadly the scale that we have in our U.K. retail bank it's inevitable, given the population of the U.K. that there will be some overlap between them. That said, we see the opportunity to build and grow this business. And what's interesting here is our ability to use more than one brand in these markets that we haven't previously done to target different demographics and launch different products. So we're very thoughtful of that. But I'd encourage you to think about Tesco a bit more holistically than just those customers and what we can do with them, because it speaks to a much bigger part of the BUK strategy, which is one, which is more multi-brands, more partnership led. So we talked when we bought Tesco about leveraging the capability that we have from U.S. cards and bringing it to the U.K. you're now seeing that both in terms of Avios and Tesco and Amazon. So more of a partnership focus in the U.K. that really helps us grow and diversify that Cards business, but also more broadly across the bank, we've always operated as a single brand. Now we've got Kensington, now we've got Tesco, et cetera, et cetera. So it's much more holistic. The other thing I would say is that in buying Tesco, we've actually acquired some very good capability that we can take back into the core BUK business. And one of the things I'd really call out there is an open market loans capability that we didn't really have. And actually, Tesco does extremely well. So there are multiple points of leverage here.\nJonathan Pierce: Yes, good morning both. It's Jonathan Pierce from Jefferies. Can I ask two questions, maybe one for each of you. Anna, the base rate sensitivity table on Slide 71 is helpful. Thank you for splitting out the impact of base rate cuts or moves in the curve more generally, sorry, into swaps and manage margin. The managed margin piece though is extremely small. I mean I think we could work that out from the previous disclosure. Year one at \u00a330 million, I'm assuming that's \u00a320 million of gaping negative. But then we moved to \u00a310 million as a sort of ongoing hit from a 25 basis point rate cut. Why is it so small? And maybe you could tell us what the pass-through assumption is behind that \u00a310 million. That would be question one. Question two, slightly longer-term one for Venkat. Where do you see the return on tangible equity going in this business in the medium term? I know it's in the report in accounts today that the second year on the trough, we've got a 14% RoTE target to hit the top end of your LTIP awards, that's now average across 26, 27. Is that where you sort of see this business potentially going in the medium term? And sorry, a part two to question two, the dividend -- your dividend has been sub-10 for nearly two decades now. The payout ratio on your targets next year is going to be sub 20%. Are we looking at a dramatic increase in the dividend payout ratio into 2027, please? Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: You want to take the first and the third, and I'll come back in the middle.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Can we go to Slide 71, please. Okay. So just for those of you who don't go that far in the pack, we've split out, and I hope it is helpful. The impact of a 25 basis point parallel shift in the curve between two imparts, the top is the swap rates for that, I think the impact in structural hedge. That's why it builds over many years. And then the bottom is the base rates. And there, what you have is two impacts. In year one, you have a timing impact. And then on a longer-term basis, you have a pass-through impact, which is what Jonathan is asking about. The reason that the numbers on the bottom there are so small is because of the proportion that we hedge. And actually, if you compare this version to the version that we had earlier in the year, you'll see that our sensitivity has increased. And the reason it's increased is obviously because we've reduced the scale of the hedge as the year has progressed. So that is increasing our relative -- or absolute sensitivity, but we think that we are still relatively insensitive just because of the proportion that we hedge. Now what we don't call out is a pass-through assumption, but I would guide you that by using this assumption and by using the split that we've given you on BUK deposits, so you could probably come up with a reasonable approximation. Venkat?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Dividend?\nAnna Cross: No, you go next and I'll come back to dividend.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Okay. I'll go. Okay. Fine. All right. Okay. So first of all, I think, as we've said, on 2026, is not an endpoint. It's a sort of a way point on the journey. So when you look at the business beyond 2026, what I would hope is that if we've got the businesses, the lower returning businesses, such as the investment bank and the U.S. cards business to at 12%. And we maintain the higher return businesses at their roughly 20%-ish range for Barclays U.K. and the corporate banks, a little less private banking. There's a little more. And we continue to grow them, that proportionate mix would have a play into ultimately what the RoTE of the business should be, which I would hope is higher not just because it would allow me to get more of my compensation plan, as you mentioned, but because I think that takes advantage of the full potential of the business. It's a calculation which we will have to come back to because right now, we are focused on 2026, right? But I do think, and I would hope that what we are building is a bank that's much more strongly performing well beyond 2026, that this is not a limit of our ambition. Our ambition grows and for what we achieve for ourselves, for our customers and for you our shareholders.\nAnna Cross: So let me take the third point. I think -- I mean, I'll start by just reiterating what Venkat said at the beginning, which is how important we realize shareholder return is and you should just reflect on our capital priorities, which are regulation first, distribution second, investment in our businesses third. The way we think about it and the conversations that we certainly had with our shareholders are really about total return, and that's our current focus. We're pleased to see that total return go up by 5% year-on-year. As you can imagine, we do have conversations with our investors about this, and we're committed to the greater than 10%. But at this point in time, it feels like the right formulation.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes, in the center.\nChris Cant: Good morning. It's Chris Cant from Autonomous. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple on RWAs, please, and then one on head office. So on Slide 45, you present your RoTE bridge and you gave us the similar slide last year. You've got a 1.3% headwind in there over the two year period from RWA growth, but obviously, some of the regulatory impacts have been pushed back your American Airlines card book is coming out? And essentially, I think you're probably going to undershoot your RWA growth target for U.S. cards. Why hasn't that RWA headwind come down relative to where you were last year? So in the equivalent bridge '24 to '26 a year ago, you said greater than 1% headwind from RWAs, now you're saying less than -- I think it's less than 1.3% if I add those together. So it seems to have gone up despite the fact the RWA growth outlook looks better, what's going on there? Are we missing something? Because the reg headwinds have been pushed further into the future. So it's now a 1.3% reduction here from RWAs in the RoTE bridge. And it was greater than 1% a year ago. So it looks like it's got worse despite the fact the RWA growth should be less. So if you could speak to that and sort of related on the deregulatory point, FRTB, I don't think you've ever given us a number, a lot of your wholesale banking peers in Europe to give us a number now. Obviously, that's an area that may never happen. So if you could give us a sense of that that would be helpful to understand the RWA trajectory. And then the general one is head office. It's been incredibly difficult to model because there's been so much going on. It feels like it's a bit cleaner this year. I think it's a big driver of the range we see in your consensus. Could you give us an indication of what you think that looks like? And I completely appreciate. It's always a mess because there's always odds and sods in there. But putting those to one side, what do you think sort of underlying head office income and costs are to help us corral consensus on to something more sensible? Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Shall I do FRTB and you do the rest? But you can start.\nAnna Cross: Okay. So on your RWA points, our expectation is no different really around RWAs. There's a timing point clearly in terms of the timing of Basel. But this chart is based on our plans to deploy \u00a330 billion of RWAs in the U.K. and hold the investment bank flat. So I think if there are more technical questions, we can come back to you on it, and I'll ask Marina to pick up after the event. Venkat, FRTB?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes. Look, you're right that there are some people who have given it. We are looking at either U.K. implementation, what we think we have already done in market risk capital calculations. And so we don't have the specific information right now to be able to make judgment. But we think, as we've said for '24 to '26, overall, we are keeping investment banking RWAs flat. In that, we said last year that there would be an absorption of about \u00a315 billion to \u00a316 billion of RWAs that came from a variety of things, including FRTB, right? We are not changing from that view.\nChris Cant: I think it's gone off back. In terms of the \u00a33 billion to \u00a310 billion range on Basel 3.1, is that \u00a37 billion, FRTB is a big chunk of that variance FRTB? Or is that residual uncertainty? Because I would have thought you've now got final rules in the U.K. So what drives the range?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: So you've got final rules in the U.K. You don't have a date yet, of course. But it's also -- there's a little bit of modeling uncertainty and just -- and implementation on the portfolio. So I wouldn't say all of it is FRTB.\nAnna Cross: Yes. Don't assume that the \u00a37 billion is FRTB in or out variance. As Venkat said, it's much more reflective of we continue to refine our model increase. So at this point in time, we're reacting to the rules that we have and expect to implement them in full in the three to 10 reflects that. Just coming back to head office. So I recognize the fact it's been very difficult to interpret and model as we've gone through 2025 -- 2024. I mean you've had German cards coming out well going in and then coming out, same with Italian mortgages. So it has been very complex. I appreciate that. I won't give you a number for going forward, but let me tell you how I think about it. There's going to be a few things which will be stable in during evergreen, at least for the foreseeable future. So within there, you've got the costs that truly relate to the group, and you've got some costs that relate to some legacy treasury funding. For the moment, we also have our merchant acquiring business in there. Those three things are going to be relatively stable throughout the period. Then there are things in there which are inherently more volatile and in part, that's why they're there. So the first of those is hedge accounting. So that's essentially where we're offsetting the fair value of a hedged item with the fair value of the hedge itself. Sometimes they don't entirely offset and where there's leakage, it goes to P&L. Actually, that was quite significant in Q4, and it probably explains the income swing between Q3 and Q4. It's broadly neutral over time. It's just timing, but it can be volatile. The second thing that you do see in there is where we've got any marks on our principal investments. That tends to be a bit smaller. And then the third thing in there will be if we are carrying any litigation or conduct that relates to a business that we are no longer active in. So that's why Meta finances in there. So as this settles down, Chris, we'll talk to you more about it. But at the moment, that's the sort of broad guidance I would give you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Any more? Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's [indiscernible]. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got two both on IB numbers, if that's okay. So first is risk weighted assets, which decreased to 56% of the group from 58%, and that includes Tesco acquisition. So in terms of the target, how should we think about the evolution to 50% by the end of '26? And what exactly is the step down here? And then just in terms of modeling, is the \u00a3199 billion the new level of numbers we should be using going forward? Or are we expecting it back to, say, '23 level, which is \u00a3197 billion and that's my first question, just with two parts. And second is on RoTE. So to hit the RoTE expectation, which is in line with the group more than 12%, it needs to improve earnings by about 23% without more capital. I'm just wondering how exactly are you going to achieve that? And I know you mentioned more stabilized revenue and disciplined costs. But are there any other areas that you're focused on that we should be aware of? Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Do you want to take the first one, I'll take the second one.\nAnna Cross: Yes. And I can answer the second one, if you wish. So on the capital number, so getting to 50% is as we set out last year release. So we expect the IB to be broadly stable. I would say FX is going to move that around, as you've seen from Q2 to Q3 to Q4, but broadly stable around that \u00a3200 billion mark. Remember that about 50% to 60% of our IB revenues are in U.S. dollars. So FX does make that number move around. But just to remind you, you then got earnings and RWAs moving together. So even though those RWAs are going up and down with FX, I wouldn't expect that to have an impact on capital generation. So that would be the first piece. In terms of the overall sort of trajectory to 50%, it's holding that piece stable and continuing to grow in those three focused U.K. businesses. I mean you've seen us come out of 2024 with some degree of acceleration, you should expect that to accelerate over the period. So you might see slightly more in '26 than you see in '25. But we will report to you as we have done along the way with the equivalent of Slide 14, so you can see that progression. Why don't I start with some maths and then I'll hand over to Venkat. Just in terms of the IB RoTE, I mean, simplistically, it's gone from 7 to 8.5, it's gone up by 1.5. We recognize the 3.5 at least to go. So we're very conscious of that and that comes in a number of parts. The first is clearly revenue and Venkat talked about having delivered \u00a30.6 billion of our \u00a31.8 billion around our focused businesses. So revenue growth is important here, and we're very focused on the things that we can control, and those areas are focused not only within markets, but the IB. The second is revenue stability. And the reason this is important is we won an IB here, which can deliver in lots of different environments. So we think of financing and we think of the ICB as balanced within our investment banking revenue. So that's also important. If you take those two together, the third thing that's important is capital discipline. So for the third year in a row, we've got broadly flat RWAs in the IB. So we're generating revenue consistently. We're holding that capital flat consistently, and that's why the revenue over RWA has gone up. And then the thing that is most in our control, and I'm talking about it last, but it's not least is costs and cost efficiency. So the IB CIR is down by 3 percentage points year-on-year. It's delivered positive jaws in three quarters out of the last four. It needs to continue to do so. It's not going to do so every quarter, but you'd expect it to do it more often than not because we want to get this business to a high 50s cost income ratio. But even then, even in '26, it's not going to be top quartile. So we'll have more opportunity in terms of efficiency from that point. Venkat?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: I cannot improve on that answer. I'll just say one thing, which is that I said last year that this is the hardest part of our journey, what we do with the Investment Bank. Because, as you said, what we are trying to do is increase revenue, reduce costs, improved capital efficiency, while keeping capital roughly flat, right? That we have done it in 2024, we are very pleased about, and it gives us the confidence to continue to do it. And that confidence is what Anna stated in her numbers. I think that was it.\nAnna Cross: Amit, right at the back.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Sorry, I didn't see you, Amit.\nAmit Goel: Hi, thank you. It's Amit Goel here from Mediobanca. So two questions. One, again, just coming back to broader strategy. But I guess just thinking about the world as it is today versus how it was maybe 12 months ago when you were putting the plan together and the kind of opportunity set that you see, it looks like there's perhaps a bit more opportunity in the U.S. Maybe regulation is a bit slower discussion about growth in the U.K. relative. So I appreciate you're executing against the plan that you've laid out just around 12 months ago. But curious if you were to rethink about or think about where you would position capital, if you're looking at it today, if there are any changes or anything else you would consider or think about? And then secondly, maybe a bit more kind of detail. But I think on the RoTE the group delivered for the year this year, the 10.5%. I think Q3, that was kind of guided to. So I think the environment was a bit better in Q4 from an FX and IB trading standpoint, maybe a slightly bigger gain on Tesco. So just curious if there are any other factors that worked slightly in the other way that you saw? Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: So let me cover the U.S. first and then Anna can cover the second part on RoTE. So you're right. We -- there is a lot of opportunity potentially in the U.S. We certainly have it in trading, and we could have it in banking. We've had some through the last year, and it may continue. So two things. First of all, as we've said, we have a fairly big U.S. presence. The firm itself makes about 40% of its revenue in U.S. dollars. The investment banking side makes about two-thirds of its revenue, 68% in the U.S. So we've got a huge presence there. There is enough willingness and capital availability and flexibility within the investment bank and for U.S. cards to be able to deploy it in those attractive opportunities. And in fact, if you take U.S. cards to begin with, we've already said that what American, the nonrenewal out of American. And what it does is that it gives us capital, which we look to employ for higher risk returning businesses and to diversify our portfolio. The similar opportunity exists inside the investment bank, and you've seen it in the deals we've taken in the U.S. as well as the strength of our Equities franchise, which is very heavily U.S.-based as well. So we'll deploy it and we'll adjust.\nAnna Cross: On your second question in terms of RoTE, as you would expect, we manage a number of puts and takes in the delivery of our financials. So you're right. There are a number of these things that were certainly better. I'd call out rates, obviously, better than our assumptions. The investment banking wallet was better. We performed well in equities, deposits stabilized faster. So all of those things gave us a tailwind. But we talked about some of the headwinds here, too, some of which were quite evident in the fourth quarter. Venkat talked about FICC. We saw some improvement in Q4, but it's definitely been weaker in the year. And that's important because it's a big business for us. We also saw some unforeseen inflation, not just in the fourth quarter but throughout the year. I'd call out the Bank of England levy in Q1. I'd call out Motor Finance in Q4. And of course, in the fourth quarter, as I said in my remarks, we actively, deliberately took some actions in Q4 to manage within the guidance that we've given you to actually accelerate some of our efficiency plans to really secure those costs in the outer years. So from our perspective, we're encouraged by what we delivered. We're managing actively within the plan to deliver it with no surprises.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Well, thank you very much, everybody. We appreciate your time, your engagement, your questions, and we welcome this participation. So thank you again for joining us. I think there might still be coffee outside and we'll come and see you outside. Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you.",

        "text": "Good morning. It's good to see you all this year. Thank you for coming, and welcome to the -- our first -- our Full-Year 2024 Results and Progress Update Presentation. You can see the agenda for the morning on this slide. We'll go straight into results before turning to review progress in the first year of our three year plan. And as usual, there will be an opportunity for those in the room to ask questions at the end. Note, we also include an update on key operational developments for each of our five divisions as an annex to today's presentation. We won't talk to these slides, but have included them in the spirit of transparency and to help you understand how we are delivering our plan. So let me start with some performance highlights before handing over to Anna to take you through the financials. At our investor update last February, we set out a three year plan to deliver a better run, more strongly performing and higher returning Barclays. I'm encouraged by the progress which we have made during the first year. We are executing the plan in a disciplined way and have achieved all of our financial targets for 2024. And we are on track to achieve our 2026 targets. Last year, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 10.5%, in line with our target greater than 10%. We also announced \u00a33 billion of capital distributions, an important step towards our target to distribute at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders by 2026. This includes \u00a31.2 billion of dividends, enabling a 5% increase in our dividends per share to 8.4p. And also \u00a31.75 billion in buybacks, \u00a31 billion of which was announced today, and which we expect to initiate in the coming days. We have made progress on deploying \u00a330 billion of additional RWAs in our highest returning U.K. businesses, while keeping investment banking RWAs broadly stable. This has resulted in the investment bank falling from 58% to 56% of the group's RWAs on its way to our 2026 target of circa 50%. And we remain well capitalized, ending the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%, within our range of 13% to 14%. We are improving the quality of our income and the stability and durability of our returns. And we are making progress towards our approximately \u00a330 billion income target in 2026. Our top line grew by \u00a31.4 billion or 6% year-on-year during 2024. And we achieved our NII targets for the group and for Barclays U.K. Our structural hedge provides a predictable and highly visible source of net interest income growth over several years. And our cost-to-income ratio for the full-year '24 was 62%, better than our guidance of circa 63%. Our credit performance was also strong, particularly in the U.K. with a group loan loss rate of 46 basis points for the year, below our through-the-cycle 50 to 60 basis points target range. Across Barclays, we are focused on execution. We delivered \u00a3300 million of gross efficiency, cost efficiency savings in the fourth quarter, enabling us to achieve our \u00a31 billion target for all of 2024. We remain focused on improving our operational and financial performance across each of our five divisions. Anna will review our financial performance by division shortly, but let me first cover a few highlights. Barclays U.K. delivered a return on tangible equity of 23% for the year. And on the 1st of November, we completed the acquisition of Tesco Bank. Through this acquisition, we have gained a strategic relationship with the U.K.'s largest retailer, supporting growth in our home market. We plan to leverage our expertise in partnership credit cards developed over years, decades in the U.S. to drive further growth and customer engagement. Across the rest of Barclays U.K., deposit balances have continued to stabilize and lending trends are encouraging, resulting in organic balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter. U.K. Corporate and the Private Bank and Wealth Management divisions also contributed to the group's balance sheet expansion. In the investment bank, our objective is to improve returns by regaining market share and improving our RWA productivity and cost efficiency. I'm broadly satisfied with how we have fared against these metrics. And of course, I expect further significant progress in each of the next two years in order to deliver our targets. The 8.5% RoTE for the Investment Bank in 2024 is up 1.5% year-on-year, and it's a good step on our journey to deliver returns in line with the group by 2026. And we expect the Investment Bank to deliver further progress on RoTE in the year ahead. Returns in the U.S. consumer bank improved to 9% from 4% as impairment charges normalized as expected and as we proactively improved our operational performance. We've also made good progress to simplify the bank by divesting the non-strategic businesses that we outlined at our investor update. This included the Italian mortgage portfolios in 2024 and the German consumer finance business completed last month. Before I hand over to Anna, I would like to make two broad points. The first is about the composition and quality of our businesses and of our results. As I hope you see in our 2024 outcomes and in our 2025 outlook, we are aiming to construct a bank with a good mix of businesses, which performed well individually and collectively. We aim to achieve a healthy balance between consumer and wholesale activities, a sound revenue weighting among fees, interest and transactions. And the geographical mix, which takes advantage of the full scope of our presence in the U.K. the depth and breadth of our business in the U.S. and from both those locations, bridges to the important financial centers of the world. Through this, we aim to deliver robust and reliable performance across interest rate and credit cycles. That is the objective of the business strategy, which we presented last year and which we continue to prosecute. My second broad point is that, while Anna and I have the honor to present our results, this performance has been generated by over 90,000 colleagues at Barclays. They have helped to implement the strategy so far, and they are core to our achieving success over the next two years. And to further align their efforts with our shareholders as interest, our colleagues should be able to participate in the ultimate outcome of their work, which is the change in our share price. Therefore, we are announcing today a share grant of approximately \u00a3500 million each for the vast majority of our colleagues. Essentially, all employees across all locations outside of managing directors and what we call material risk takers. I have long felt that this kind of alignment between shareholders and employees through broad-based equity participation, strengthens business outcomes. In the U.K., sadly, broad-based equity ownership has been declining. This represents our effort towards arresting and correcting this trend. So with that, I'll hand over to Anna."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 summarizes our financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year. Profit before tax was \u00a38.1 billion and was up 24%. This included a Q4 profit before tax of \u00a31.7 billion, up from \u00a30.1 billion. Before going into the detail, as always, I would note that our results are affected by FX rates. The year-on-year performance in Q4 was impacted by a weaker U.S. dollars, which decreased our reported income, costs, and impairments. Conversely, the dollar strengthened from Q3 to Q4. And I'll call out these effects where appropriate. Group's statutory RoTE was 10.5% for 2024 versus our target of greater than 10%. This was against the previous year's RoTE of 9%, which was impacted by \u00a30.9 billion of structural cost actions in Q4. Much of the improvement in RoTE reflected higher income, particularly in the investment bank, Barclays U.K. and Private Bank and Wealth Management. This improvement occurred even as we grew tangible book value per share by 26p during the year to 357p. Throughout the year, as you know, I've been looking for four things in our performance. Income stability, cost discipline and progress on efficiency savings, credit performance and a robust capital position. We delivered on all four. I'll now cover these in more detail, starting with income on Slide 8. Our income growth continues to be supported by the structural hedge and is now complemented by balance sheet growth. Income in the Investment Bank, while seasonally lower in Q4 benefited from the execution of our initiatives to improve productivity and an increase in the industry wallet. Together, this resulted in a 6% increase in total group income for the year to \u00a326.8 billion. Excluding FX, income was up 7% year-on-year. More stable income streams from retail, corporate and financing grew 3% year-on-year and together contributed 74% of group income. Turning to NII. Our group net interest income increased for the third consecutive year by 3% in FY '24 to \u00a311.3 billion. Excluding Tesco, group NII increased 2% to \u00a311.2 billion. And within this, Barclays U.K. rose 1% to \u00a36.5 billion. Both were in line with our guidance at Q3 and more favorable than our February guidance. This reflected the benefit of higher-than-expected interest rates and faster deposit stabilization on our NII, including as a result of higher reinvestment income from the structural hedge. The structural hedge is designed to reduce income volatility and manage interest rate risk. The high proportion of balances hedged reduces our sensitivity to the short-term effect of rate cuts. NII from the hedge increased \u00a31.1 billion during the year to \u00a34.7 billion. Income provided by the hedge is significant and predictable. We've now locked in \u00a39.1 billion of gross income over the next two years up from \u00a37.8 billion at Q3 and \u00a34.8 billion a year ago. This income will continue to build as we reinvest maturing assets at higher yields. As consumer deposit behavior has stabilized, the average duration of the hedge has increased modestly to around three years. Moving on to costs. We achieved a cost-income ratio of 62% for the year below our circa 63% target. This included a \u00a390 million motor finance provision in Q4. In line with our plan, we delivered \u00a31 billion of gross efficiency savings during the year, including \u00a30.3 billion during Q4. These savings created capacity for investments and business growth. We also took proactive steps to accelerate structural cost actions in a number of our divisions given the strong performance in the year, whilst importantly, still delivering on our cost income ratio target. The costs of these measures, which will support our future returns and efficiency came to \u00a3110 million in the quarter, or \u00a3273 million in total for 2024, well within our normal annual range. Turning now to impairment. The Q4 -- sorry, the FY '24 impairment charge of \u00a32 billion equated to a loan loss rate of 46 basis points. This included a day one charge for Tesco Bank of \u00a3209 million where accounting rules require balances to be brought on to our books at Stage 1. The U.K. credit picture remains benign with low and stable delinquencies in our consumer books and wholesale loan loss rates below our through-the-cycle expectations. Specifically, the Barclays U.K. charge was \u00a3365 million, including day one effects from Tesco, resulting in a loan loss rate of 16 basis points for 2024. The U.S. consumer bank impairment charge was down 10% year-on-year at \u00a31.3 billion. Delinquencies in UCSB are developing in line with our expectations, with 30- and 90-day delinquencies stable. As guided, impairment charges in this business were lower in '24 versus the prior year, and H2 was also lower than H1. Coverage ratios remained strong. Looking ahead, we expect the loan loss rate in FY '25 to be similar to '24. This includes the lagged effect of hard delinquencies in the past 12 to 18 months and the anticipated day one effect of bringing the General Motors partnership on board in Q3 '25. I would also note that loan loss rates tend to be seasonally higher in Q1 given holiday spend in Q4. Turning now to our U.K. growth. This slide summarizes key aspects of our organic growth. Gross mortgage lending strengthened throughout the year, supported by a more active property market and higher loan-to-value lending. 15% of our mortgage lending was to higher LTV borrowers, up from 9% in 2023. We acquired 1 million new Barclaycard customers up 58% year-on-year as part of our strategy to regain market share in unsecured lending. And in the corporate bank, we deployed around \u00a33 billion of RWAs by extending client lending facilities to support future lending growth. Clients have now started to draw down on these facilities reflected in around \u00a31 billion of net U.K. corporate loan growth in Q4. Turning now to Barclays U.K. You can see financial highlights on Slide 15, but I will talk to Slide 16. The acquisition of Tesco Bank in November complicates comparisons for Q4. So let me start by unpacking the moving parts. First, there was a gain on acquisition of \u00a30.6 billion and a day one impairment charge of \u00a30.2 billion. Together, these created a one-off benefit to Barclays U.K. statutory RoTE, which was 28% in the quarter. Excluding these day one effect, Barclays U.K. RoTE was 19.1%. Second, comparisons are affected by the inclusion of Tesco Bank's underlying earnings for two months since November. This included \u00a3101 million of NII and around \u00a360 million of costs in line with our guidance for \u00a330 million run rate cost per month. We continue to expect circa \u00a3400 million of NII from Tesco in 2024, 2025. Whilst the Q4 run rate exceeded this level, we expect this to normalize in future quarters. The inclusion of higher NIM balances from Tesco also explains around 11 of the 19 basis points increase in BUK NIM versus Q3. Excluding Tesco Bank, Barclays NII increased \u00a348 million Q-on-Q. This reflected continued structural hedge momentum and a tailwind from balance sheet growth partially offset by product repricing lags. Non-NII was \u00a3244 million, the decline versus Q3 reflects the one-off effect of the Q4 securitization that we previously highlighted. Going forward, we continue to expect a run rate above \u00a3250 million per quarter. Q4 costs -- total costs increased by \u00a3209 million versus Q3 to \u00a31.2 billion. This included around \u00a360 million for Tesco Bank and a \u00a336 million bank levy. The remaining increase reflected investment to support growth and structural cost actions. Moving on to the Barclays U.K. balance sheet. In Q4, both loans and deposits grew organically. The acquisition of Tesco Bank added a further \u00a38 billion of loans and \u00a37 billion of deposits. On an organic basis, deposit balances grew by circa \u00a31 billion. Flows into savings accounts and current accounts were particularly strong ahead of the U.K. budget in October and customers have so far retained this liquidity. Looking ahead, tax payments during Q1 typically lead to a seasonal reduction in customer deposit balances. And as I discussed earlier, stronger activity in mortgages and Barclaycard led to a \u00a31 billion increase in Q4 lending before the effect of our securitization in the quarter. Moving on to the U.K. Corporate Bank. U.K. Corporate Bank delivered a Q4 RoTE of 12.3%. NII was up 31% year-on-year, reflecting deposit income growth and the non-repeat of adverse liquidity pool income in the prior year. Non-NII was down 9% year-on-year and broadly flat to Q3. Whilst this line can be volatile, we expect investments in our digital and lending propositions to drive non-NII growth over time. Investments to support this growth and to drive greater efficiency led to a 10% year-on-year increase in costs, excluding the structural cost actions we took in Q4 '23. And our full-year loan loss rate of 29 basis points was within our through-the-cycle guidance of circa 35 basis points. Turning now to Private Bank and Wealth Management. Q4 RoTE was 23.9%. Client assets and liabilities grew \u00a37 billion versus Q3 and \u00a326 billion versus the prior year. We also attracted net new assets under management of \u00a30.7 billion in Q4 and \u00a33.7 billion for the year. This is a new metric that we will disclose going forward. This growth in volumes as well as higher transactional activity led to a 12% year-on-year increase in income. Excluding Q4 '23 structural cost actions, costs were up 15% year-on-year as we took further actions this quarter to optimize headcount and drive business growth. As you heard at our deep dive in December, we will continue to prioritize investment in this business. Turning now to the Investment Bank. The Q4 RoTE was seasonally low at 3.4% with a full-year RoTE of 8.5%, both ahead of the prior year. Q4 total income was up 28% year-on-year, while total costs rose 11%, excluding the Q4 structural cost actions. This was the third consecutive quarter of positive jaws. Adjusted for FX, total income was up 31% year-on-year, and costs were up 12% year-on-year, excluding structural cost actions in the prior year. Part of the increase in our Q4 costs reflected actions we took to improve future efficiency. Period-end RWAs of \u00a3199 billion were \u00a35 billion higher versus Q3, with FX accounting for \u00a36 billion of the increase. Now looking at the Q4 income in more detail. Using the U.S. dollar figures as usual to help comparison to U.S. peers, markets income was up 36% year-on-year. Macroeconomic conditions supported a 32% increase in FICC income driven by financing, credit, rates and FX. Equities income was up 44%, aided by strong performance across cash, prime and derivatives. Investment banking fees rose 22%. For FY '24 as a whole, our share of banking fees increased by 30 basis points to 3.3%, but we have more work to do to build on this improvement. Within Q4, our ECM performance was strong, with income up 160% year-on-year. Advisory fees were also up 12% with good momentum and a robust pipeline headed into 2025. Whilst DCM was up 10% year-on-year, our performance was mixed. In leverage finance, we increased market share by 70 basis points to 4.7% in a strong market. This was offset by softer performance in investment grade, particularly in Q4, with a strong Asian wallet, which we did not participate in, given our limited presence in the region. In addition, we were less active in event financing in the quarter, and this represents an opportunity as we further improve our advisory capabilities. Importantly, we saw progress in areas of the investment bank that inherently have more stable revenues. Financing income was up 34% reflecting a strong increase in client balances and international corporate bank income was up 22%. U.S. deposit balances grew by circa 90% year-on-year which we see as a lead indicator of income growth. U.S. Consumer Bank RoTE was 11.2% in the quarter. The improvement versus the prior year reflected lower impairment charges following the reserve build in H2 '23. Income was down 1% year-on-year or up 1% excluding FX. This reflected a $0.9 billion increase in card balances to \u00a333.1 billion on a reported basis. From Q3 to Q4, NII increased 5%, supported by seasonally stronger balances, which also grew 5%. NIM rose 28 basis points partly reflecting the lagged benefit of our repricing actions earlier in the year. The successful launch of our new tiered retail savings product in Q3 led to a 17% year-on-year growth in retail deposit funding with a $2 billion increase in Q4. The proportion of core deposits rose 1% year-on-year to 64%, reflecting wholesale funding raised during Q4 to meet seasonal asset growth. As seasonal spending eases we should see a further increase in our share of funding from core deposits towards our target of 75% in 2026. Excluding Q4 2023 structural cost actions, total costs were up 8% as we continue to invest in the growth of the business, driving a cost-to-income ratio of 51%. Moving to capital. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%. This included around 140 basis points of capital generation from profits, excluding the day 1 P&L benefit of the Tesco Bank acquisition. We previously highlighted two inorganic transactions that would impact capital in the near term, both of which have now completed. The first was the circa 20 basis points of capital consumption from the acquisition of Tesco Bank in Q4. The second is the circa 10 basis points accretion from the sale of the German consumer finance business, which was completed last month and will benefit the CET1 ratio in Q1 '25. The \u00a31 billion share buyback we announced today will also lower the ratio by around 30 basis points in Q1. Looking ahead, we maintain our guidance for between \u00a319 billion and \u00a326 billion of regulatory-driven RWA inflation. The U.K. regulator's decision to postpone the implementation of Basel 3.1 to January 2027 may, however, alter the mix and phasing of this change. Adopting IRB in the U.S. consumer bank is still expected to increase RWAs by circa \u00a316 billion. Whilst uncertainty around the size and the mix of the portfolio at the time of implementation has increased, this remains our best estimate for now. In the meantime, there are a few changes in the regulatory landscape. Prior to implementing IRB for U.S. cards, our Pillar 2A requirement will increase by 0.1% from Q1 2025. We expect this Pillar 2A capital to be removed when the IRB model is implemented in 2026 or 2027, when this \u00a316 billion RWA increase is reflected in Pillar 1. Consequently, our maximum distributable amount ratio or MDA is expected to rise to 12.2% from Q1 '25. We previously expected that this would reduce following the implementation of Basel 3 in January 2026, but this will now be delayed to January 2027. Reflecting this, you should continue to expect us to operate towards the upper half of our 13% to 14% target CET1 range as we have been doing. Naturally, our distribution expectations remain unchanged. Turning now to recent RWA developments. RWAs increased \u00a318 billion from Q3 to \u00a3358 billion. Tesco Bank added \u00a37 billion and a further \u00a37 billion was driven by FX in the Investment Bank and the U.S. Consumer Bank. As usual, a brief word on our overall capital and liquidity on Slide 30. We maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding, and a significant excess of deposits over loans. TNAV per share increased by 6p in the quarter and by 26p during 2024 to 357p. Attributable profit added 6p per share during Q4, whilst our share buyback and other movements added 1p and 3p, respectively. These were partially offset by a more negative cash flow hedge reserve, which reduced TNAV by 4p per share. This is the fourth quarter in the 12-quarter plan we laid out in February. Today, we are reiterating our group targets for 2026 and providing additional guidance for 2025, including a further improvement in group RoTE to around 11%. I'll come back to discuss the building blocks of this guidance in more detail with you. But first, I would like to hand back to Venkat to take you through some reflections on progress during the first year of our plan."

        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Thank you, Anna. So almost a year ago today, we set three key priorities for Barclays by 2026, to improve our returns, to distribute more to shareholders and to rebalance our RWAs. We also set 2020 -- interim milestones for 2024, which we have delivered. Our plan was set on realistic assumptions, which together with our diversified business model, allowed us effectively to navigate market, macro and regulatory conditions throughout the year. So what were these? U.K. deposits have stabilized faster and the investment banking wallet has been stronger than we expected. Fixed income, FICC, which is traditionally an area of strength for us, performed slightly weaker than we had expected in 2024, but our strong performance in equities where we have taken market share, partially compensated for this, rebalancing our overall markets business. And the economic environment has been more supportive with interest rates remaining higher alongside more benign unemployment and inflation in our main U.K. and U.S. markets. Last year, I described the important reset of our financial performance and shareholder returns since 2021. I also told you that this improvement was not sufficient and that our shareholder experience needed to be better. We are making progress on our plan and we are generating growth. Notably, we have achieved our fifth consecutive year of TNAV per share growth of 8% during 2024, and 7% annually since 2019. This positive outcome reflects improvements in our returns and growth of our earnings per share, including by 30% year-on-year during 2024 to the highest level in decade. This enabled a 5% increase in total distributions, including progressive growth in our dividend per share. For the group as a whole, we look to generate higher returns in two ways. First, by allocating more capital to our higher returning U.K. businesses, which I'll come on to discuss. And second, by improving returns in the lower returning businesses, namely the investment bank and the U.S. consumer bank. That was true last year when we set out our strategy, and it remains true today. We are making progress, including in target growth areas of the Investment Bank, but further improvements are needed to achieve our RoTE target of greater than 12%. And in the U.S. Consumer Bank, too, we remain focused on rebuilding returns towards the mid-teens RoTE beyond 2026. A reduction of impairments in line with our expectations as well as other operational improvements enabled a 9% RoTE in 2024 versus 4% in 2023. Let me now discuss the allocation of capital to high-return divisions in more detail. At our investor update, we outlined the plan to create a more balanced group. To do this, we plan to allocate \u00a330 billion of additional RWAs to our three highest returning businesses, Barclays U.K., the U.K. Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth Management. As we expected, actions that we took during the year began to generate organic balance sheet growth due towards the end of the year. And including the acquisition of Tesco Bank, RWA is in our highest returning U.K. businesses, increased by \u00a313 billion due to business growth and by \u00a315 billion overall in 2024. And as Anna has discussed earlier, lead indicators of growth across our U.K. businesses are encouraging. Given this, we expect a step-up in our organic RWA deployment during the year with further momentum in 2026. We are committed to keeping Investment Bank RWAs relatively stable at 2023 levels. And this is the third consecutive year in which this division has operated with this level of capital. We continue to expect investment banking RWAs to fall proportionately to about 50% of the group by 2026 from 56% today as we grow the three U.K. businesses. Taking a closer look at the Tesco Bank acquisition, which we are thinking about in three stages: acquire, integrate and improve. The first stage was completed on the 1st of November '24. The acquisition has added \u00a38 million to our unsecured balances, moving our weighting in credit cards and personal loans towards our 2019 position. And the profile of Tesco Bank's customers is attractive. As we show in our operational data pack on Slide 57, Tesco Bank's customers have a higher spend per card than the market average. Tesco's position as the U.K.'s largest retailer with strong customer satisfaction and more than 20 million Tesco Clubcard holders provides a significant customer growth opportunity. We've also gained an additional brand to operate with and an open market lending capability. The second stage is to integrate Tesco Bank, which we intend to do during 2025 and '26 and this involves onboarding Tesco customers to Barclays' platform in 2026 to reduce duplication of systems and processes while maintaining a strong customer experience. The integration will require some upfront investment, but the realization of synergies will reduce the run rate costs. These actions are factored into our plan, and we continue to target a circa 50% cost to income ratio for Barclays U.K. in 2026, following an increase in '25 given the costs associated with the Tesco Bank. The third stage is to improve the business which we expect to gain momentum after 2027. This will involve further growing customer balances supported by better access to funding and to capital. This increased scale will enable greater efficiency as fixed costs are spread over a larger customer base. Turning now to the U.S. consumer bank. We made meaningful progress in 2024, improving RoTE to 9% from 4% and achieving cost-to-income ratio of 49%. We also announced that our American Airlines partnership will not be renewed beyond 2026. American Airlines has been a card partner in our business for seven years as part of a dual issuer model and we valued our long relationship with them. We knew that the partnership could transition to a single issuer model. That happened last year, and we chose not to participate on that basis. The ending of our partnership provides a short-term gain on sale in 2026 and releases capital that we intend to use to diversify the business. We expect the overall credit mix of the portfolio to change, still prime, but with less weighting to super prime balances. And all things being equal, this will lead to a higher net interest margin and loan loss rate and a higher risk-adjusted margin for the portfolio. Our 2026 targets are unchanged, including an RoTE of greater than 12% in line with the group as the gain on sale offsets lower profitability due to the loss of the receivables. We are confident in our ability to grow card balances to achieve necessary scale in the U.S. consumer bank. In line with our broader group strategy, the plan is organic. And organic growth has driven around 85% of our increase -- of the increase in our net card receivables since 2011. And looking ahead, will drive two-thirds of our planned growth. We have a strong foundation for such growth given that over 80% of our card receivables are under contract at least until 2029. Our success in accelerating balance growth for partners also translates into significant loyalty with a historical partnership renewal rate of around 90%. In 2024, notable renewals included Hawaiian and RCI. And at the start of 2025, we have also renewed our partnership with Wyndham. In addition to being a long-standing top five partner for us, Wyndham is also a long-term investment banking client. This provides a good demonstration of how collaboration across the Barclays Group can drive successful outcomes. While organic growth is at the heart of the plan, opportunities for inorganic growth in the market are also significant. For instance, 15 relevant deals [Technical Difficulty] in dollars of balances were tendered annually on average in the market during the past five years. We remain confident in our ability to win new partners given the strength of our offering and our ability to increase customer engagement and balances. And this was evidenced by recent wins, including Breeze in 2023 and General Motors in 2024. The General Motors card portfolio, which we will onboard in the third quarter of '25 will offset about a quarter of the balances we expect to lose from American Airlines. Overall, we remain focused on achieving scale beyond 2026 and driving improved efficiency to deliver mid-teens RoTE for this business. Turning now to the Investment Bank. Last year, we shared our plan to increase returns in the investment bank to greater than 12% by 2026, in line with our group target. While competitive and industry dynamics are creating opportunities and challenges for individual businesses, our overall progress is as expected, and we continue to run our own race. Our objective is to generate higher and more stable income and returns by improving RWA productivity and rebalancing resources in the business, while only modestly increasing costs. We delivered 7% year-on-year income growth in 2024, broadly on track with our high single-digit annualized growth target from '23 to '26. And as a reminder, more than half of our planned growth in the investment bank comes from initiatives, which we control with the remainder coming from growth in the industry wallet. So we expect these initiatives to add \u00a31.8 billion to our income by 2026. And in the first year of our plan, we achieved around a third of this planned improvement. In Investment Banking, we've increased share across most products. This included strong performance in ECM where we increased fee share by about 100 basis points. And in leveraged finance, where we increased share by 70 basis points. And across the three focus businesses in market, we've made progress within equity derivatives and securitized products. And while progress in European rates has been slower, we saw a recovery in the fourth quarter. Across our markets business, we now rank top five with 56 of our top 100 clients, up seven from a year ago and versus our target of 70 by the end of 2026. Our capital productivity has also improved, with income to RWAs increasing by 30 basis points year-on-year to 5.8%. And we achieved positive jaws, with income up 7% from '23 versus a four year -- 4% increase in costs. And this enabled a year-on-year improvement in our cost-to-income ratio to 67%. And we are focused on making further progress on this cost income ratio in 2025 towards our delivery -- towards delivery of our high 50s target for 2026 full-year. I'd like to highlight two areas of progress during the past year that helped to position the investment bank to perform in a range of scenarios. First, as Anna said, we continue to prioritize growth in stable income during 2024, particularly within financing. Growing financing income enhances the durability of our returns, and we now have financing relationships with 98 of our top 100 clients. Second, our banking fee share has increased by 30 basis points year-on-year to 3.3% with the wallet also higher. And we remain particularly positioned -- well positioned to benefit from stronger activity in the U.S. where we generate 68% of our total banking fees. At the same time, our market share in global markets declined 20 basis points in the year reflecting lower share in fixed income, the larger of our markets businesses. And so while we are pleased with our direction of travel, we recognize that there's further work to do to deliver the full extent of our ambition. Let me now hand over to Anna for the final installment of today's update."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat. At our investor update last February, we outlined a plan to deliver ambitious financial targets and meaningfully higher shareholder distributions. We are confident that we can deliver consistent returns in a range of scenarios underpinning our ambition. I'll now go through what supports these targets. The diversification of our business model by income, by geography helps supports return in a range of economic environments. This has contributed to more stable returns in the last four years. As Venkat mentioned, the external environment in 2024 was generally more supportive than we expected. But in executing our plan, we remain focused on what we can control. Our plan continues to be based on realistic assumptions. These include four U.K. base rate cuts during 2025 and a bank rate of 3.5% by the end of 2026. We also assume a five year swap rate of around 3.5% for the purpose of our structural hedge reinvestment, although I acknowledge that current market rates are higher. And we are not relying on a recovery in the investment banking wallet to deliver our plan with our assumptions unchanged from those we outlined last year. The next few slides describe how our drive towards higher and more predictable returns come together for our shareholders. Our 2026 targets are unchanged, including our North Star of a RoTE above 12%. Our foundation is strong, having delivered 10.5% last year, and we expect further improvement in 2025 to around 11%. Crucially, we expect income growth to provide a RoTE tailwind in 2025 with NII accounting for more than half of this. We will maintain cost discipline as we grow. We expect our cost income ratio to fall in 2025, and we expect further cost efficiency savings and income momentum into 2026. This combination will support a RoTE of more than 12%. I'll now explain the drivers of our income and costs in turn. We continue to target around \u00a330 billion of income in 2026. This means a further \u00a33 billion of income growth over the next two years, having delivered \u00a31.4 billion in 2024. The drivers of our growth are within our control. First, the strong NII tailwind. For 2025, we expect a \u00a30.9 billion increase in group NII, of which \u00a30.8 million is from Barclays U.K. Our confidence in delivering this reflects the predictable tailwind from the structural hedge underpinned by realistic assumptions about rates and reinvestment yields. And this tailwind lasts beyond '25 with the structural hedge driving around half of our expected increase in total group income over the next two years. In addition, we expect balance sheet and earnings momentum from the deployment of RWAs in our three high returning U.K. businesses. This momentum was apparent in Q4 and we expect it to continue and to be visible in our 2025 performance. Second, non-NII, mainly coming from the investment bank. We expect to deliver a high single-digit CAGR income growth over the life of our three year plan and are broadly on track, having delivered 7% in '24. Overall year-on-year growth of \u00a30.8 billion in the IB included \u00a30.2 billion from wallet growth. Importantly, the biggest share of this increase of \u00a30.6 billion came from the execution of our management initiatives or a third of the \u00a31.8 billion total we expect by 2026. This leaves a further \u00a31.2 billion of growth from management actions over the next two years. As with the case last year, we are not relying on wallet growth to meet our target. In fact, our assumptions are unchanged from a year ago with a lower banking wallet in both '25 and '26 versus '24. And should the recovery continue, our business is strongly positioned to participate in a rebound in deal activity, particularly in the U.S., where we generate around two-thirds of our banking fees. Moving on to costs. Managing cost is at the heart of what we can control. We showed this in 2024 achieving a 62% cost-to-income ratio. This improvement versus 2023 was supported by the delivery of \u00a31 billion of gross efficiency savings in the year. These savings reflected targeted actions in respect to people, property, and infrastructure. For example, in the past year, we decommissioned around 200 legacy applications as part of our plan to exit between 450 and 500 by 2026. We increased our digitally active customers in Barclays U.K. by 700,000 and rationalized our branch network by more than 25%. And in markets, our actions during the last two years have driven a 20% reduction in the number of trade capture and risk pricing systems supporting our efficiency and operational resilience. Looking forward, there are three drivers of cost change in 2025 and 2026. First, efficiency savings. We expect a further \u00a31 billion in gross efficiency savings split broadly evenly across the next two years. Around one-third of these savings come from plans to simplify customer journeys with the rest driven by actions to streamline businesses, including the optimization of people and technology. Second, inflation which we expect to be more meaningful in '25 versus '26. This is because inflation impacts on us on a lagged basis, so '25 reflects some of the headline inflation pressure we've observed recently. It also includes a \u00a350 million increase in national insurance contributions following the U.K. budget. And third, greater investment in our highest returning businesses in 2025. Specifically, I would call out the annualization of investment costs, which have increased during 2024 and additional Tesco Bank costs, including integration. In 2025, incremental investment and inflation are expected to exceed efficiency savings, resulting in an increase in our costs. In 2026, we expect costs to be broadly stable, if not down a little year-on-year, as incremental investment and inflation moderate and are offset by efficiency savings. Given this cost profile and planned income growth, we expect our cost-to-income ratio to fall by 1% in 2025 to circa 61% and to fall more significantly to our high 50s percent in 2026. Given our 2026 income target of \u00a330 billion, our high 50s cost-to-income target would be consistent with around \u00a317 billion of costs. We will drive further efficiency beyond that in each of our businesses and for the group as a whole. Barclays U.K. and Investment Bank represents some 70% of our planned cost efficiency savings, work to reduce duplicate systems and processes for Tesco Bank should reduce the cost run rate from circa \u00a330 million per month currently synergies are realized. And across Barclays U.K., we remain focused on streamlining and digitizing the business to improve our efficiency. And in the Investment Bank, we invested significantly between 2021 and '23 to sustain and grow future income. In markets that investment centered around technology, whilst the focus in investment banking was more on people. We expect these actions to result in greater productivity and a high 50s cost-to-income ratio in the investment bank by 2026, with further efficiencies expected beyond. Put differently, 2026 does not represent the full extent of our ambition. Turning now to capital and capital generation. As we grow returns in line with our plan, we expect to generate around 170 basis points of capital during 2025, rising to more than 200 basis points in 2026. We have a clear hierarchy for capital allocation in order of priority, first, to hold a prudent level of capital with an expectation that we will continue to operate towards the upper half of our 13% to 14% CET1 target range, taking into account regulatory requirements. By doing this, we deliver for our investors, customers, clients, and colleagues regardless of the environment; second, to distribute capital to our shareholders; and third, to invest selectively in our highest returning divisions, resulting in a more profitable RWA mix and a better bank for all our stakeholders. We set a high bar for investment returns given the importance we place on shareholder distributions overall. We announced \u00a33 billion of capital distributions in respect of FY '24. These distributions represent an important step in our target to return at least \u00a310 billion to shareholders during the life of our plan. We expect a progressive increase in our total payout during 2025. And as a reminder, we plan to keep the total dividend broadly stable at \u00a31.2 billion per year, growing our dividend per share progressively through lower share count. Bringing this together, we are reiterating our group targets for 2026 and are providing additional guidance for 2025. This includes 2025 RoTE guidance of circa 11% and a progressive increase in our total payout versus \u00a33 billion per year in the past two years. The expected increase in RoTE will be supported by group NII growth to around \u00a312.2 billion including an increase in Barclays U.K. to around \u00a37.4 billion. We expect to improve the cost -- group cost income ratio to circa 61%. Our progress during 2024 provides a solid foundation for these milestones. We continue to deliver against our plan to achieve a RoTE greater than 12% by focusing on structural actions that are within our control to improve income and efficiency. Over to Venkat for final remarks."

        "text": "Thank you. Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Two questions, please. One on your income assumptions. I've noted that you expect wallet share -- the size of wallet to come down, but I'll focus on BUK, because I guess we'll have a view on that. On BUK, the guidance for 2025 looks my numbers for an underlying 2% growth versus the run rate in Q4, which sounds quite conservative given the volume growth and given the hedge contribution should be increasing. Are you just being conservative? Or are we missing any moving parts around more competition in asset product like mortgage? Is there anything we're missing there? I just been out of conservatism? And the second question on capital. If we take out, obviously, the buyback and German cards will come down and you want to operate at the higher end of the 13% to 14%. Do you have any sort of RWA efficiency measures that you can call out? And I'm thinking, obviously, there's been a Twitter sale. It sounds like a couple of blocks there, and these are very high risk-weighted sort of kind of positions over to 50% from -- if memory serve me right, will that have a significant impact that will help you sort of reallocate the capital to growth areas? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Alvaro. I'll take both of those. So let me start with the question that you didn't ask, but you sort of asked, which was about the banking wallet. So I want to be really clear here. We are assuming or we have an assumption that the banking wallet remains as we had it last year. You shouldn't take from that, that if the opportunities are greater in the market that we would seek to monetize those as we have done in Q4 and indeed all the way through 2024. So I'll just call out that distinction. Relating to Barclays U.K., we're guiding to NII next year or in '25 of \u00a37.4 billion. As I think about that number, I reflect back on 2024. And actually, what we've seen in successive quarters is strong NII growth. And we expect that to continue in 2025 and into 2026. BUK NII is not near its peak. As I take the 7.4%, I think of it in a number of building blocks. So the first is take the Q4 run rate ex-Tesco multiply that by 4. Then add on \u00a3400 million for Tesco, add on the impact of maturing structural hedge this year. Now we are assuming a reinvestment rate of 3.5% in that calculation, and then take off the impact of four base rate reductions in the year. As I put those building blocks together, you will get to around \u00a37.4 billion. In addition to that, there's two further things for you to consider. The first, as you note, we have got good momentum in the business, and you can see that in Q4. You can see that in cards and in mortgages, we expect that to continue. In our calculation, what we're assuming here is that there is some offset in margin. I wouldn't call anything out in particular. I would just say particularly in liability margins, we expect a continuation of migration. Nothing more than we've seen. So I'm not expecting it to accelerate, but I'm just assuming that those two things are somewhat offsetting within the year. You may have different expectations for those macro assumptions or indeed the swap rate. But we're trying to route this plan within factors that we can control, and we believe that we've made realistic assumptions that underpin that number. But I'd just highlight, we're expecting continued income momentum in BUK into '25 and beyond. In terms of your capital number, I mean, I'm not going to speak about any client positions as you would expect. Our focus here is on executing the plan as it is elsewhere. We'd expect the investment bank to operate within the framework we've given it for RWAs. So you should expect those RWAs to be broadly flat. The thing that you didn't call out actually was organic capital generation. That's what we're confident in here. So throughout Q1, remember, Q1 is a seasonally strong quarter for us. We deploy RWAs into the business, but seasonally, it is very strong for us in terms of investment banking and markets activity. And as we've called out in the presentation, our expectation is that organic capital generation will continue to develop, both in '25 and in '26 and the kind of capital range that we talked about today is no different from where you've seen us operate actually over the last two to three years."

I think that's our approach, which is to tell you what we think structurally we are trying to achieve.

And I guess a share price reaction this morning, maybe reflects the fact that people were expecting a little bit more. And as you noted that -- well, the environment is probably better than what you were sitting on a year ago when you put out the targets for the first time across every metric you could think of pretty much. So I guess, why did you not upgrade '26 targets a bit more. I mean, I know it's greater than 12%. So -- but would you, for example like invite us to put more focus on the greater than, for example, and any color you could give on that would be really helpful. Just if you were to come up with a plan today, wouldn't you be more optimistic than you were a year ago? I guess that's the first question. And the second question is on U.S. cards. Just the direction of the business as the AA book phases out. So do you still see it as a growth business? Because a few years ago, that was an area of growth that we all looked at? And then I guess more operationally, what does the exit of AA mean? So what I'm thinking is that, well, maybe receivables growth will be a bit slower in the next couple of years as the bill comes to an end. And then as you take on new books, well, there will be more J-curve impact and more day 1 impairments, et cetera. So how is that going to impact the RoTE because I know that you haven't changed the guidance on that either."

But our primary focus really is on executing that plan. We're pleased with the progress that we've made in 2024. We've hit all of the targets and guidance that we gave you, and we feel we've set the business up really well for momentum in '25 and '26. And I'll just call out that difference that I highlighted before. We are planning on realistic assumptions because we want as much of this plan within our control as is possible. However, if the market environment allows whether that be interest rates, swap rates or the banking wallet, you should expect us to monetize that opportunity. Venkat?"

        "text": "Yes. Look, I'll emphasize that as well, which is that it's a realistic plan. It's a confident plan, right? It's a confident plan, which is based on strong structural progress across the things which we can control and then taking advantage of cyclical opportunities as we did last year, and we expect to, as they come up. On the U.S. cards business, we remain confident for a couple of reasons. First of all, we gave you the statistic of the number of accounts and the volume of receivables that come up for bid. Second, which is \u00a340 billion in this thing. Second is that we have a, locked up around 90% of our -- 85% of our net receivables outside of American through to 2029. And third, we have a retention rate of 90% renewal rate. We operate in a very specialized place with midsized companies for whom we have a particular skill at managing their partnership portfolio and able to grow their balances and increased customer engagement. And so just like General Motors came in this year, we will continue to look for these opportunities. I'm fairly confident we'll land them because when we participate in these, we know what we provide very valuably into the market. And then on the operational side, we will continue -- to come back to your point on J-curve, first of all, if a lot of the book, 85% of the book is locked through 2029, yes, there will be a J-curve for new things, right? But as a proportion of the business, it's smaller. Would you add anything?"

It's an executional plan that actually goes all the way through the P&L and the balance sheet. Clearly, revenue growth is important, but it's not the only thing that we're working on to improve the RoTE of the business. So we're working very hard on mitigating the impacts of regulatory headwinds. So you saw that transaction in Q1 of this year. We're working very hard in terms of the cost efficiency of this business. The cost income ratio is now below 50% in this business. It's fallen for the last consecutive four years. And remember, we're targeting to get it to mid-40s. So there's a big digitization push in this business. The third thing is we continue to work on the net interest margin of the business. We spoke again about that last year and that there are two parts. The first was repricing. We completed that repricing in 2024. And you're going to see it start to accumulate in the NIM over time. And the second thing is really reducing our funding cost by driving up the proportion of retail deposits. Again, I spoke about that in my prepared remarks. So Venkat is absolutely right, there are there are opportunities here to grow volume, but our RoTE delivery is volume, capital efficiency, cost efficiency and NIM."

And if -- how you put a beat to Barclays if there was a leveling of the playing field on ring fencing so you could use the first \u00a335 billion of your deposits to fund other parts of the group.

So look, I think we are at the early stages of a regulatory debate in the U.K., which go both to what might happen on prudential regulation as well as consumer regulation. We do think that, obviously, regulation is very important, and it's important to the city of London. We also think it's important to have a balanced regulatory outlook and one that is commensurate across the globe. So in the U.S., you're seeing a rethinking on Basel, on the base of Basel as well as stress testing. And the PRA has postponed its own decisions till 2027. We would always want. We've always advocated for consistency in total capital requirements. That means base capital in Basel as well as stress testing. And that's what we'd like to see, but it's too soon for me to say one way or the other what the results are going to be. So you've seen the plan that we've given you with the assumptions we have. On the consumer side, obviously, there has been volatility that's come in because of impact of regulations, impact of court cases, worries about retrospective application of these things. And you've seen it in the charges that people have taken and we took a provision on Motor Finance. What I'm very happy about on that is that we were small in the business, and we exited the business in 2019, right? And so you've got to risk manage this situation, you should always expect us to do that. And then as far as M&A, look, this is an organic plan, right? And what you're seeing us do is to present what we aim to do for this bank in an organic way. And that is what we intend to be absolutely focused on."

The first is some reduction in the restrictions around loan to income and also sort of affordability stress testing. I think our perception would be the second is probably more meaningful in the current environment just because of the interest rate environment, that affordability test is probably the one that restrains the market a little bit more. And then the third thing is around potentially reducing RWA weightings in higher loan-to-value mortgages. We're an IRB bank. So any change to the standardization -- standardized rules wouldn't impact Barclays. They would impact Kensington, but not the Barclays lending, not the larger part of the group."

I'm just going to rephrase the slide, I guess, essentially, \u00a316.7 billion of costs in 2024 if we're thinking about this in absolute cost terms rather than cost income, given that you've got the U.K., Tesco double run investment in corporate and PBWM, you've got FX translation. Presumably what you're essentially saying is you're expecting the cost base to grow to in excess of \u00a317 billion in 2025 before them fading back to around \u00a317 million in 2026, but just wanted to make sure that understanding was correct. And then the second question on the U.S. Consumer Bank. You've specifically drawn out on Slide 39 that there is going to be a gain on the sale of the AA portfolio, and that seems to be included within the target. So does that mean that come 2027, the RoTE fades again before it then recovers thereafter within that division."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Yes, I'll go ahead. So let's just look at Slide 47, please. The answer is yes. So we're expecting our costs to go up in 2025 because of the annualization of Tesco because of the integration costs of Tesco and because of those inflation headwinds that I talked about in my prepared remarks. But underneath all of this, you've got a continued focus in gross efficiency. So that's going to be continuing. In '25, inflation and investment outweigh the efficiency. In '26, it's the other way around. So actually, I'm expecting costs to go above \u00a317 billion actually. I think consensus is not in a bad place and then drop back. So that's my expectation. In terms of U.S. Consumer Bank, in 2026, you're going to have those two offsetting effects, as Venkat said, you're going to have a gain on sale and you're going to have a more immediate impact from loss of volume. I'm not going to guide you to a 2027 RoTE at this point. I would just make a few points. Firstly, we're confident in our ability to regain volume both organically and inorganically. Secondly, I'd just remind you of what Venkat said in his remarks where he talked about American Airline was an incredibly important partner for us. But in terms of risk-adjusted returns, it's a lower part of our portfolio. And we will continue to really focus on the things that I talked about in terms of cost efficiency, in terms of capital efficiency, in terms of NIM. So let me give you an example on cost efficiency. So the digitization, if you like, of U.S. cards. So as customers interact with us in a retail business, clearly, we want a large portion of that to be digital. In U.S. cards, that's low 90s. If I compare that to either BUK or indeed the German cards business that we've just sold, that was high 90s. So we do feel we've got good opportunities here to continue to streamline the business."

There's a lot of focus on cards and whether Barclays is the right owner for the asset given the differential in capital loading that you are going to be having at some point. So one of the benefits is that the IB carries less capital because of the stress losses that the card business helps protect the unit from. Can you give us some concrete sense as to how much of a saving that is? I think it's a really important part of the debate, helped not only by what it means for you, but also by the excitement about easier stress tests in the U.S. at some point, we'll see how that goes. Secondly, on Tesco Bank, it came in at about a 90% indicated cost-income ratio. And it looks like from Slide 47, if I'm reading it correctly, it doesn't actually contribute to a lower cost income ratio to the end of '26. Is that right? Or is that part of the efficiency gains? And maybe you could just talk about how much pre-provision profit do you think it can make -- there was a deployment of capital, it felt like a cost takeout story in the beginning. It's no longer that. If you could just talk about how much profit do you think it might generate once you're done? Thank you."

Obviously, it's under current rules is to look at the CCAR results of the top banks in the U.S. and look both at our initial level of capital, which we keep and look at the drawdown and compare it to banks who don't have that kind of a credit card or a retail consumer portfolio in the mix. Now scenarios vary from year-to-year and so on. So you have to look at it for a few years, but you will get a sense of the benefit. And I think it is an important regulatory benefit for us to have it in the stress test. It's under current rules, right? Anna?"

And I think that reflects in and of itself, it's lack of scale as a stand-alone business. And so I think our view is as follows. This is -- it actually still is a cost take-out story, but this is a complex integration. It's not like a portfolio and asset runoff. It's a growing business; an active business and credit cards have a daily and digital interaction with the customers. So actually, it's quite a complex piece of work. But we are confident that we can do it, and we can -- we're confident that we can execute it well. But it doesn't happen as quickly as if, for example, we bought a mortgage portfolio. And that's really what you're seeing here. Our expectation that this is RoTE accretive to BUK and indeed, the group hasn't changed. Typically, I would expect the cost income ratio of an unsecured business to be relatively low, certainly lower than BUK as a whole. And if you want a good indication, look at where we're trying to get the USCB business too. So hopefully, that gives you some indication. But you're going to see an increase in '25, both from the operational cost, if you like, that you'll running some investment in integration, you'll start to see some efficiencies flow through in 2026. But as Venkat said, the real scaling and the real unlocking of that value will come somewhat beyond '26. But that's included in all of the targets that we have given you for BUK and for the group."

And I just want to understand a little bit where are you on the market share gains on fixed income. If you can talk a little bit about what has to happen for that to come through? And then secondly, just getting back to Tesco Bank. I mean for me, what's more interesting is actually the customers that you gain. So can you talk a little bit about the 3 million roughly active customers in terms of overlap, but also the 20 million club card customers, what is really the opportunity in terms of data that you're getting in the long term?"

      {
        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Yes. Let me take the first one, and Anna can take the second one. So within fixed income, we've had three focus -- we've had two focus areas. One is securitized products and the other was European rates. And I think it's fair to say securitized products did well through the year. Credit, which has been a historical great strength of ours. It was a smaller part of the overall wallet last year as spreads remained both subdued and tight. And then the third thing is that European rates started picking up only later in the year as did macro overall. So when we look and we give you the market share, there are two ways we look at it. One is the market share number, which we give, which is we take us on the top nine other banks, 10 banks total and look at what our proportion was. And that's always a little bit of noise in it because we are not in commodities. That's part of the number. There are certain regional exposures we don't have, especially in Asia. But the other number which we look at is our penetration of our top 100 clients. So we are #6 markets business and #6 investment bank. So we ask off that top 100, how many of them are we #5 with, right? So one step higher. And in that, that number, which we began at 49 in '23 and want to be at 70 by '26, we've moved from 49 to 56. So I take comfort from looking at that data with those clients in the things we do. But of course, I want to see a broader improvement in fixed income. I'm confident, as I said earlier, because I think this is our strength. And we have strong structural presence and cyclicality when it comes place towards trends will help us."

        "text": "On Tesco, I think we'd agree with you. It's an exciting opportunity. And I think that comes in a number of parts. When we look at the customers, obviously, with 20 million Clubcard customers, that's broadly the scale that we have in our U.K. retail bank it's inevitable, given the population of the U.K. that there will be some overlap between them. That said, we see the opportunity to build and grow this business. And what's interesting here is our ability to use more than one brand in these markets that we haven't previously done to target different demographics and launch different products. So we're very thoughtful of that. But I'd encourage you to think about Tesco a bit more holistically than just those customers and what we can do with them, because it speaks to a much bigger part of the BUK strategy, which is one, which is more multi-brands, more partnership led. So we talked when we bought Tesco about leveraging the capability that we have from U.S. cards and bringing it to the U.K. you're now seeing that both in terms of Avios and Tesco and Amazon. So more of a partnership focus in the U.K. that really helps us grow and diversify that Cards business, but also more broadly across the bank, we've always operated as a single brand. Now we've got Kensington, now we've got Tesco, et cetera, et cetera. So it's much more holistic. The other thing I would say is that in buying Tesco, we've actually acquired some very good capability that we can take back into the core BUK business. And one of the things I'd really call out there is an open market loans capability that we didn't really have. And actually, Tesco does extremely well. So there are multiple points of leverage here."

        "text": "Yes, good morning both. It's Jonathan Pierce from Jefferies. Can I ask two questions, maybe one for each of you. Anna, the base rate sensitivity table on Slide 71 is helpful. Thank you for splitting out the impact of base rate cuts or moves in the curve more generally, sorry, into swaps and manage margin. The managed margin piece though is extremely small. I mean I think we could work that out from the previous disclosure. Year one at \u00a330 million, I'm assuming that's \u00a320 million of gaping negative. But then we moved to \u00a310 million as a sort of ongoing hit from a 25 basis point rate cut. Why is it so small? And maybe you could tell us what the pass-through assumption is behind that \u00a310 million. That would be question one. Question two, slightly longer-term one for Venkat. Where do you see the return on tangible equity going in this business in the medium term? I know it's in the report in accounts today that the second year on the trough, we've got a 14% RoTE target to hit the top end of your LTIP awards, that's now average across 26, 27. Is that where you sort of see this business potentially going in the medium term? And sorry, a part two to question two, the dividend -- your dividend has been sub-10 for nearly two decades now. The payout ratio on your targets next year is going to be sub 20%. Are we looking at a dramatic increase in the dividend payout ratio into 2027, please? Thank you."

        "text": "Okay. Can we go to Slide 71, please. Okay. So just for those of you who don't go that far in the pack, we've split out, and I hope it is helpful. The impact of a 25 basis point parallel shift in the curve between two imparts, the top is the swap rates for that, I think the impact in structural hedge. That's why it builds over many years. And then the bottom is the base rates. And there, what you have is two impacts. In year one, you have a timing impact. And then on a longer-term basis, you have a pass-through impact, which is what Jonathan is asking about. The reason that the numbers on the bottom there are so small is because of the proportion that we hedge. And actually, if you compare this version to the version that we had earlier in the year, you'll see that our sensitivity has increased. And the reason it's increased is obviously because we've reduced the scale of the hedge as the year has progressed. So that is increasing our relative -- or absolute sensitivity, but we think that we are still relatively insensitive just because of the proportion that we hedge. Now what we don't call out is a pass-through assumption, but I would guide you that by using this assumption and by using the split that we've given you on BUK deposits, so you could probably come up with a reasonable approximation.

So when you look at the business beyond 2026, what I would hope is that if we've got the businesses, the lower returning businesses, such as the investment bank and the U.S. cards business to at 12%. And we maintain the higher return businesses at their roughly 20%-ish range for Barclays U.K. and the corporate banks, a little less private banking. There's a little more. And we continue to grow them, that proportionate mix would have a play into ultimately what the RoTE of the business should be, which I would hope is higher not just because it would allow me to get more of my compensation plan, as you mentioned, but because I think that takes advantage of the full potential of the business. It's a calculation which we will have to come back to because right now, we are focused on 2026, right? But I do think, and I would hope that what we are building is a bank that's much more strongly performing well beyond 2026, that this is not a limit of our ambition. Our ambition grows and for what we achieve for ourselves, for our customers and for you our shareholders."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "So let me take the third point. I think -- I mean, I'll start by just reiterating what Venkat said at the beginning, which is how important we realize shareholder return is and you should just reflect on our capital priorities, which are regulation first, distribution second, investment in our businesses third. The way we think about it and the conversations that we certainly had with our shareholders are really about total return, and that's our current focus. We're pleased to see that total return go up by 5% year-on-year. As you can imagine, we do have conversations with our investors about this, and we're committed to the greater than 10%. But at this point in time, it feels like the right formulation."

        "speaker": "Chris Cant",
        "text": "Good morning. It's Chris Cant from Autonomous. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple on RWAs, please, and then one on head office. So on Slide 45, you present your RoTE bridge and you gave us the similar slide last year. You've got a 1.3% headwind in there over the two year period from RWA growth, but obviously, some of the regulatory impacts have been pushed back your American Airlines card book is coming out? And essentially, I think you're probably going to undershoot your RWA growth target for U.S. cards. Why hasn't that RWA headwind come down relative to where you were last year? So in the equivalent bridge '24 to '26 a year ago, you said greater than 1% headwind from RWAs, now you're saying less than -- I think it's less than 1.3% if I add those together. So it seems to have gone up despite the fact the RWA growth outlook looks better, what's going on there? Are we missing something? Because the reg headwinds have been pushed further into the future. So it's now a 1.3% reduction here from RWAs in the RoTE bridge. And it was greater than 1% a year ago. So it looks like it's got worse despite the fact the RWA growth should be less. So if you could speak to that and sort of related on the deregulatory point, FRTB, I don't think you've ever given us a number, a lot of your wholesale banking peers in Europe to give us a number now. Obviously, that's an area that may never happen. So if you could give us a sense of that that would be helpful to understand the RWA trajectory. And then the general one is head office. It's been incredibly difficult to model because there's been so much going on. It feels like it's a bit cleaner this year. I think it's a big driver of the range we see in your consensus. Could you give us an indication of what you think that looks like? And I completely appreciate. It's always a mess because there's always odds and sods in there. But putting those to one side, what do you think sort of underlying head office income and costs are to help us corral consensus on to something more sensible? Thank you."

But this chart is based on our plans to deploy \u00a330 billion of RWAs in the U.K. and hold the investment bank flat. So I think if there are more technical questions, we can come back to you on it, and I'll ask Marina to pick up after the event. Venkat, FRTB?"

And so we don't have the specific information right now to be able to make judgment. But we think, as we've said for '24 to '26, overall, we are keeping investment banking RWAs flat. In that, we said last year that there would be an absorption of about \u00a315 billion to \u00a316 billion of RWAs that came from a variety of things, including FRTB, right?

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Yes. Don't assume that the \u00a37 billion is FRTB in or out variance. As Venkat said, it's much more reflective of we continue to refine our model increase. So at this point in time, we're reacting to the rules that we have and expect to implement them in full in the three to 10 reflects that. Just coming back to head office. So I recognize the fact it's been very difficult to interpret and model as we've gone through 2025 -- 2024. I mean you've had German cards coming out well going in and then coming out, same with Italian mortgages. So it has been very complex. I appreciate that. I won't give you a number for going forward, but let me tell you how I think about it. There's going to be a few things which will be stable in during evergreen, at least for the foreseeable future. So within there, you've got the costs that truly relate to the group, and you've got some costs that relate to some legacy treasury funding. For the moment, we also have our merchant acquiring business in there. Those three things are going to be relatively stable throughout the period. Then there are things in there which are inherently more volatile and in part, that's why they're there. So the first of those is hedge accounting. So that's essentially where we're offsetting the fair value of a hedged item with the fair value of the hedge itself. Sometimes they don't entirely offset and where there's leakage, it goes to P&L. Actually, that was quite significant in Q4, and it probably explains the income swing between Q3 and Q4. It's broadly neutral over time. It's just timing, but it can be volatile. The second thing that you do see in there is where we've got any marks on our principal investments. That tends to be a bit smaller. And then the third thing in there will be if we are carrying any litigation or conduct that relates to a business that we are no longer active in. So that's why Meta finances in there. So as this settles down, Chris, we'll talk to you more about it. But at the moment, that's the sort of broad guidance I would give you."

        "text": "It's [indiscernible]. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got two both on IB numbers, if that's okay. So first is risk weighted assets, which decreased to 56% of the group from 58%, and that includes Tesco acquisition. So in terms of the target, how should we think about the evolution to 50% by the end of '26? And what exactly is the step down here? And then just in terms of modeling, is the \u00a3199 billion the new level of numbers we should be using going forward? Or are we expecting it back to, say, '23 level, which is \u00a3197 billion and that's my first question, just with two parts. And second is on RoTE. So to hit the RoTE expectation, which is in line with the group more than 12%, it needs to improve earnings by about 23% without more capital. I'm just wondering how exactly are you going to achieve that? And I know you mentioned more stabilized revenue and disciplined costs. But are there any other areas that you're focused on that we should be aware of? Thank you."

      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Yes. And I can answer the second one, if you wish. So on the capital number, so getting to 50% is as we set out last year release. So we expect the IB to be broadly stable. I would say FX is going to move that around, as you've seen from Q2 to Q3 to Q4, but broadly stable around that \u00a3200 billion mark. Remember that about 50% to 60% of our IB revenues are in U.S. dollars. So FX does make that number move around. But just to remind you, you then got earnings and RWAs moving together. So even though those RWAs are going up and down with FX, I wouldn't expect that to have an impact on capital generation. So that would be the first piece. In terms of the overall sort of trajectory to 50%, it's holding that piece stable and continuing to grow in those three focused U.K. businesses. I mean you've seen us come out of 2024 with some degree of acceleration, you should expect that to accelerate over the period. So you might see slightly more in '26 than you see in '25. But we will report to you as we have done along the way with the equivalent of Slide 14, so you can see that progression. Why don't I start with some maths and then I'll hand over to Venkat. Just in terms of the IB RoTE, I mean, simplistically, it's gone from 7 to 8.5, it's gone up by 1.5. We recognize the 3.5 at least to go. So we're very conscious of that and that comes in a number of parts. The first is clearly revenue and Venkat talked about having delivered \u00a30.6 billion of our \u00a31.8 billion around our focused businesses. So revenue growth is important here, and we're very focused on the things that we can control, and those areas are focused not only within markets, but the IB. The second is revenue stability. And the reason this is important is we won an IB here, which can deliver in lots of different environments. So we think of financing and we think of the ICB as balanced within our investment banking revenue. So that's also important. If you take those two together, the third thing that's important is capital discipline. So for the third year in a row, we've got broadly flat RWAs in the IB. So we're generating revenue consistently. We're holding that capital flat consistently, and that's why the revenue over RWA has gone up. And then the thing that is most in our control, and I'm talking about it last, but it's not least is costs and cost efficiency. So the IB CIR is down by 3 percentage points year-on-year. It's delivered positive jaws in three quarters out of the last four. It needs to continue to do so. It's not going to do so every quarter, but you'd expect it to do it more often than not because we want to get this business to a high 50s cost income ratio. But even then, even in '26, it's not going to be top quartile. So we'll have more opportunity in terms of efficiency from that point. Venkat?"

Because, as you said, what we are trying to do is increase revenue, reduce costs, improved capital efficiency, while keeping capital roughly flat, right? That we have done it in 2024, we are very pleased about, and it gives us the confidence to continue to do it. And that confidence is what Anna stated in her numbers. I think that was it."

But I guess just thinking about the world as it is today versus how it was maybe 12 months ago when you were putting the plan together and the kind of opportunity set that you see, it looks like there's perhaps a bit more opportunity in the U.S. Maybe regulation is a bit slower discussion about growth in the U.K. relative. So I appreciate you're executing against the plan that you've laid out just around 12 months ago. But curious if you were to rethink about or think about where you would position capital, if you're looking at it today, if there are any changes or anything else you would consider or think about? And then secondly, maybe a bit more kind of detail. But I think on the RoTE the group delivered for the year this year, the 10.5%. I think Q3, that was kind of guided to. So I think the environment was a bit better in Q4 from an FX and IB trading standpoint, maybe a slightly bigger gain on Tesco. So just curious if there are any other factors that worked slightly in the other way that you saw? Thank you."

        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",

We -- there is a lot of opportunity potentially in the U.S. We certainly have it in trading, and we could have it in banking. We've had some through the last year, and it may continue. So two things. First of all, as we've said, we have a fairly big U.S. presence. The firm itself makes about 40% of its revenue in U.S. dollars. The investment banking side makes about two-thirds of its revenue, 68% in the U.S. So we've got a huge presence there. There is enough willingness and capital availability and flexibility within the investment bank and for U.S. cards to be able to deploy it in those attractive opportunities. And in fact, if you take U.S. cards to begin with, we've already said that what American, the nonrenewal out of American. And what it does is that it gives us capital, which we look to employ for higher risk returning businesses and to diversify our portfolio. The similar opportunity exists inside the investment bank, and you've seen it in the deals we've taken in the U.S. as well as the strength of our Equities franchise, which is very heavily U.S.-based as well. So we'll deploy it and we'll adjust."

There are a number of these things that were certainly better. I'd call out rates, obviously, better than our assumptions. The investment banking wallet was better. We performed well in equities, deposits stabilized faster. So all of those things gave us a tailwind. But we talked about some of the headwinds here, too, some of which were quite evident in the fourth quarter. Venkat talked about FICC. We saw some improvement in Q4, but it's definitely been weaker in the year. And that's important because it's a big business for us. We also saw some unforeseen inflation, not just in the fourth quarter but throughout the year. I'd call out the Bank of England levy in Q1. I'd call out Motor Finance in Q4. And of course, in the fourth quarter, as I said in my remarks, we actively, deliberately took some actions in Q4 to manage within the guidance that we've given you to actually accelerate some of our efficiency plans to really secure those costs in the outer years. So from our perspective, we're encouraged by what we delivered. We're managing actively within the plan to deliver it with no surprises."

    "transcript": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan - Group Chief Executive:\nAnna Cross - Group Finance Director:\nOperator: Welcome to Barclays Q1 2025 Results, Analyst and Investor Conference Call. I will now hand over to C. S. Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive, before I hand over to Anna Cross, Group Finance Director.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining Barclays' first quarter 2025 results call. At our progress update 11 weeks ago, we outlined expectations for the second year of our three-year plan. These were to deliver a better run, a more strongly performing and higher return in Barclays. I'm pleased with our performance and progress to date, including in this, the first quarter of 2025. While the environment has certainly become more uncertain, we are firmly on track to achieve the full objectives of our plan, including approximately 11% return on tangible equity for 2025. Our confidence reflects the inherent diversification of our business, the careful and proactive approach which we adopt to managing risk, and our ongoing focus in delivery of operational efficiency. All of this is supported by a robust balance sheet, including a 13.9% CET1 ratio at the end of the first quarter. This is intentionally towards the top of our 13% to 14% target range. In addition, we are supported with very strong liquidity. In the first quarter, Barclays generated a return on tangible equity of 14%. This was achieved even as tangible book value grew 11% year-on-year to 372 pence. Total income for the first quarter was \u00a37.7 billion, and importantly, the quality and stability of our income continues to improve. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our income growth profile, and today we are upgrading 2025 NII guidance for Barclays UK and the group, reflecting favorable deposit volumes and mix. And we will amplify our top-line growth through positive operating leverage, as we did again during the first quarter, with 6% jaws delivering a 57% cost-income ratio in the quarter. Moving on to our Q1 performance, we are improving operational performance across the businesses to drive sustainably higher financial returns. Last quarter, we released around \u00a3150 million of the circa \u00a3500 million growth cost efficiency savings, which we expect during the year. These savings structurally improve our cost base and the level and consistency of our returns, including beyond 2026. We are generating higher returns in two ways. First, by allocating more capital to the highest-returning UK businesses, and second, by improving returns in the lower-returning businesses in the bank, namely the Investment Bank and the U.S. Consumer Bank. Across the three UK businesses, we continue to grow our risk-weighted assets in the quarter and deliver returns at or around the full year '26 target levels. Returns in the Investment Bank were supported by ongoing execution of management actions and strong activity in markets, in particular in fixed income and credit, where we monetized activity well and continued a disciplined approach to risk management. As you would expect in a period of uncertainty, weaker client confidence is delaying investment banking transactions, but for us, this has been more than offset by the benefits of the impact of volatility on trading revenues in markets. While RoTE in the U.S. Consumer Bank fell year-on-year to 4.5%, the operational performance of the business continues to progress as we expected. Finally, we are continuing to simplify our businesses. Two weeks ago, we announced a long-term partnership with Brookfield to transform our payment acceptance business. We are looking forward to working closely with our partner to enhance the client experience, drive long-term growth, and improve financial performance for this activity. Earlier in the quarter, we completed the sale of our German consumer finance business. So while we remain focused on executing our strategy and achieving our targets, we are obviously paying close attention to the recent market volatility and what it may imply for economic growth and business activity. And so before I hand over to Anna, let me offer some reflections on the current backdrop. I want to emphasize at the outset that our strategy has been designed to deliver in a range of economic and financial environments, and I reiterate our confidence in achieving the targets which we have set out financially and operationally for 2025 and 2026. Our role, as ever, is to help clients navigate the changes in the environment. We must do so while prudently managing our own risk. We are well-positioned to do this. We start with a business mix that is diversified geographically across hotel and retail and by product. And in fact, all of this is well-illustrated by the first quarter results which we are discussing. Last but not least, our customers start from a resilient position. In the U.K., household balance sheets are robust and spending trends have been stable. In our U.S. consumer businesses, our balances are skewed to prime and super prime customers. And spending and payment rates across our U.S. customer cohorts have remained stable, including among lower FICO customers. On the wholesale side, corporates are cautious about new borrowing and demonstrate a desire to maintain liquidity. Having said all that, the current environment and market volatility undoubtedly require attention and management. Looking ahead, we expect net interest income to grow further and for market revenues to be roughly commensurate with volatility. However, transactional and lending income could slow as companies and individuals become more cautious. This income mix provides a good measure of structural protection and stability. On top of this, we have to protect ourselves, as we always do, with active risk management. We have long-established programs to transfer and hedge risk, and we will continue to do so as warranted by this environment. Finally, we continue to provision prudently across all our portfolios. In conclusion, while we recognize the risks that are inherent in the current environment, we remain confident in our income outlook and are positioning ourselves carefully to navigate through this current circumstance. We remain committed to and confident in delivering our 2025 guidance and 2026 targets, including an approximately 11% RoTE and a progressive capital distribution this year. I will now hand over to Anna to take us through our first quarter financials.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 summarizes the financial highlights for the first quarter. Before going into the detail, I would remind you that we are focused, as ever, on what we can control. The plan and targets we called out at the investor update are based on realistic assumptions about the external environment. These are unchanged from the full year results and are shown in the appendix. The group's diversified business model by income and geography help support returns in a range of environments, delivering a Q1 ROTI of 14%. This was against the previous year's 12.3%, with much of the improvements reflecting income growth across all five divisions, particularly the Investment Bank and Barclays UK. Operating leverage is a key aspect of the plan to structurally improve group returns. Income rose by 11%, while costs rose by 5%, delivering 6% positive joules and driving a 19% increase in profit before tax to \u00a32.7 billion. This performance was further amplified by the effect of the share buybacks during the past year, leading to a 26% increase in earnings per share. I remain focused on four aspects of performance. Income stability, with an increased emphasis on growth. Cost discipline and progress on efficiency savings. Credit performance and a robust capital position. These underpin our aim to deliver higher returns on a sustainable, predictable and consistent basis. I'll now cover these in more detail, starting with income on Slide 6. Income in Q1 increased \u00a3700 million to \u00a37.7 billion. This growth was broad-based, including from stable income streams in retail, corporate and financing activities within markets. In the investment bank, we captured the benefit of greater market volatility during the quarter, supported by our investment across the business. And in Barclays UK, stronger than expected deposit trends are supporting higher NII, as shown on the next slide. Group net interest income increased 13% year-on-year to \u00a33 billion. In Barclays UK, we now expect more than \u00a37.6 billion of NII during FY '25, up from circa \u00a37.4 billion previously. Two changes have led to this improvement in our outlook. First, Q1 seasonal deposit volumes were higher than we expected, particularly in current accounts consistent with more normalized behavior. Second, the mix of savings has stabilized faster than we expected. This improvement in deposit mix supports our confidence in lowering Tesco Bank's post-acquisition funding costs. These developments and a strong start to the year across other businesses mean we now expect Group NII, excluding the IB and head office, to be more than \u00a312.5 billion for FY '25. Up from circa \u00a312.2 billion previously. The continued strength of deposits also supports greater longer-term income stability via the structural hedge. We have now locked in \u00a310.2 billion of gross structural hedge income over the next two years, up from \u00a39.1 billion last quarter. And this income will build further as we reinvest maturing hedges. We said in February that we expect to reinvest three quarters of maturing hedges at a 3.5% yield. In Q1, we were able to lock in hedges at a higher rate than our assumption, with a stable hedge notional. Continued deposit strength means we now expect to reinvest around 90% of maturing hedges during 2025 and 2026 versus 75% previously. Given this reinvestment profile and our planning assumptions for 3.5% swap rates, we expect the contribution from the structural hedge to continue well beyond 2026. Moving on to costs. The group cost to income ratio was 57% in Q1. This provides a strong foundation to deliver guidance of circa 61% in 2025 and the high 50s target in 2026, with scope to improve further thereafter. Total costs increased by \u00a3189 million year-on-year, with around half of this increase related to run rate costs for Tesco Bank. Q1 costs also included circa \u00a350 million for the employee share grant announced at the full year result. These and other investments in business growth and inflation were partially offset by around \u00a3150 million of gross efficiency savings as part of the \u00a3500 million we expect in 2025. Expenses associated with structural cost actions were modest in Q1 and are likely to be weighted towards the second half of 2025 and within the \u00a3200 million to \u00a3300 million normal annual range. Turning now to impairment. I know that development in the US in particular are a big focus, so we have included some additional color on the positioning of our U.S. card business in the appendix. Customer behavior does not reflect risks to the economic outlook and we start from a resilient position, including an IFRS 9 coverage ratio of 10.4% or 8.3% on a seasonal basis. Both 30 and 90-day delinquencies were stable in the quarter, as you can see from the two lines on this page. The USCB loan loss rate of 562 basis points increased versus Q4, reflecting reserves billed for higher seasonal balances and a post-model adjustment. I'll discuss this more on the next slide in the context of the group. The Q1 group impairment charge of \u00a30.6 billion equated to a loan loss rate of 61 basis points, modestly above our 50 to 60 basis points through the circa guidance. As a reminder, our impairment charge is based on consensus economic forecasts prevailing towards the end of the quarter. These forecasts were largely unchanged from FY '24 and so do not reflect elevated U.S. economic uncertainty. To address this and consistent with our approach to uncertainty in the past, we increased the probability weighting of downside scenarios in our IFRS 9 calculations for U.S. portfolios. This led to a net post-model adjustment of \u00a374 million, included within the US consumer bank and the investment bank. The impact for U.S. cards relates mainly to a change in the weighted average peak U.S. unemployment rate from 4.7% to 5.2%, resulting in a \u00a338 million adjustment. While in the investment bank, a reduction in the weighted average U.S. GDP growth from 1.6% to 0.8% led to a net \u00a336 million model adjustment. Outside of the U.S., the increase in the Barclays UK loan loss charge was mainly driven by the addition of Tesco Bank. This included a circa \u00a330 million charge for the post-acquisition stage migration of some Tesco Bank balances, which should diminish beyond Q1. Aside from Tesco Bank, the loan loss rate for Barclays UK increased modestly but remains low. You can see financial highlights for Barclays UK on Slide 12, but I will talk to Slide 13. RoTE was 17.4% in the quarter and total income rose 14% year-on-year to \u00a32.1 billion. The integration of Tesco Bank is progressing well, with the improved deposit mix providing greater confidence on lower post-acquisition funding costs. As a result, we now expect circa \u00a3500 million of NII from this business in FY '25 included within the updated NII guidance versus circa \u00a3400 million we expected previously. Stronger structural hedge income also supported greater NII versus Q4 and more than offset product margin headwinds. Non-NII of \u00a3252 million was due to seasonally lower customer spend, and we continue to expect a quarterly run rate above \u00a3250 million. Overall, income growth of 14% exceeded cost growth of 9%, enabling the cost-to-income ratio to fall to 56% despite higher investment and run rate costs for Tesco Bank. Moving on to the Barclays UK balance sheet. Deposits in the quarter were stronger than expected, with balances down only \u00a31.1 billion, consistent with a more normalized behavior. The mix of deposits continues to develop favorably, with customers choosing to retain liquidity through current accounts and instant access savings accounts. Loan growth also continued in Q1, with \u00a31.9 billion of net lending driven by mortgages, partially offset by lower business banking lending as clients continue to repay COVID-era loans. Indicators of future lending activity continue to improve as we pursue our strategy to deploy capital into the UK. The momentum and breadth of UK growth that we saw in the second half of 2024 continued in the first quarter. Gross mortgage lending remained strong, including among home leavers and first-time buyers, supporting net lending of \u00a32.2 billion. We acquired 386 new credit card customers as part of our strategy to regain market share in unsecured lending. This should support future growth in balances as customers' appetite to borrow normalizes. And we saw continued deployment of risk-weighted assets in the UK corporate bank, supporting \u00a31.3 billion loan growth as clients continue to draw down lending facilities. Moving on to Slide 17. UK corporate banks delivered a Q1 rating of 17.1%, income growth of 12%, exceeded cost growth of 3%, leading to an improved cost-to-income ratio of 53%. NII was up 23% year-on-year, reflecting higher average lending and deposit balances, while non-NII fell 10%. While this line can be volatile, we expect investments in our digital and lending propositions to drive non-NII growth over time. Impairments remain low and stable, decreasing quarter-on-quarter with lower single-name charges. Turning now to private bank and wealth management. Q1 rating was 34.5%. Client assets and liabilities grew versus Q4, including net new assets under management of \u00a31 billion, and income growth of 12% exceeded cost growth of 9%, leading to a cost-to-income ratio reduction to 68%. As previously guided, you should expect an increase in investment costs in the quarters to come to support advisor growth, product development, and digital capabilities. Turning now to the Investment Bank. Q1 RoTE of 16.2% was supported by income growth across most areas of the IB. Total income was up 16% year-on-year, while total costs rose 5%, resulting in positive joules and a cost-to-income ratio of 54%. Capital productivity, measured by income over average RWAs, was 7.7%, or 120 basis points better year-on-year. More now on income by business on Slide 22. Using the U.S. dollar figures as usual to help comparisons to U.S. peers, markets' income was up 16% year-on-year. FICC rose 21%, with particular strength in macro products across rates and FX and in securitized products. Equity's income was up 9%, or by 27%, excluding the prior period's one-off gains on Visa B shares. Financing and equity derivatives were particularly strong. Investment banking fees rose 4%. Our fee share was 3.5%, including an improvement in ECM and advisory. While clients are waiting for a more stable market environment before transacting, pipelines remain strong. In transaction banking, income increased 8% percent, as we continue to implement our treasury coverage model. This also contributed to U.S. deposit balance growth of around 50% year-on-year, which we see as a lead indicator of transaction banking income growth. And corporate lending income increased strongly year-on-year, reflecting gains on leveraged finance positions. The investment bank is on a multi-year journey to generate higher and more consistent returns. Volatility creates opportunities in markets where we generate around two-thirds of investment bank income. Investments we have made into this business allowed us to monetize these opportunities well during Q1. We did this while prudently managing risk with stable VaR and no lost days in our trading book. And in banking, we entered into the most recent period of volatility with limited exposure to risk, including in the last spin. We are also making good progress in our management actions, including in our three focus businesses, equity derivatives, European rates, and securitized products, all while growing the more stable income streams within the investment bank, including financing. Turning now to the U.S. consumer bank. U.S. consumer bank RoTE was 4.5% in the quarter, including the \u00a338 million post-model adjustment I mentioned earlier. Total income was up 1% year-on-year, as lower NII was offset by higher non-NII. NII was then 1% with NIM of 10.5%, driven by a full quarter impact of rate cuts in Q4 '24, which drove spread compression with deposits taking longer to reprice than assets. This interest rate risk is hedged with the offsetting benefit reflected in non-NII, which increased 9% year-on-year. We remain confident in achieving NIM of greater than 12% by 2026, and expect meaningful progression during 2025, as the impact of our repricing actions take hold in the portfolio. Total costs were up 5% due to an increase in partner-related expense, which is mostly offset in higher non-interest income. We continue to make good progress in increasing digital adoption and driving efficiency. End net receivables increased 4% year-on-year to $33 billion on a managed basis, all from organic growth. We continue to see strong retail deposit growth, including $2 billion quarter-on-quarter and $4 billion year-on-year, driven by the tiered savings product that we launched in Q3 2024. The percentage of total funding coming from core deposits now stands at 68%, and we expect this to increase going forward in line with our target of greater than 75% in 2026. Moving to the main developments impacting head office. Earlier this month, we announced a long-term partnership with Brookfield for our payment acceptance business, previously referred to as merchant acquiring. This business is strategically important, but has become less able to compete in recent years, given technology changes in the sector and, absent investments, financial performance was expected to deteriorate. Through the partnership, Barclays will invest circa \u00a3400 million, mostly in the next three years, to enhance the range of services, improve efficiency, and support growth. This will begin in Q2 and has no material impact on our current financial targets or guidance. Over time, we expect the partnership to improve the financial performance of the business as part of Barclays Group. If Brookfield choose to increase their ownership interest after three years, our investment will be fully recovered and we will retain an interest of around 20%. Moving to capital. We ended the quarter at the top end of our 13% to 14% target range, with a CET1 capital ratio of 13.9%. This included 53 bps of capital generation from profits and a 12 bps benefit from the sale of German consumer finance, partially offset by the 28 bps impact of the \u00a31 billion share buyback announced at FY '24 results. RWA decreased around \u00a37 billion from Q4 to \u00a3351 billion, with FX accounting for circa \u00a33 billion of the move. The sale of the German consumer finance business reduced head office RWAs by \u00a33.3 billion, while Barclays UK and the UK Corporate Bank saw a combined RWA increase of \u00a30.8 billion. Investment bank RWAs were 56% of the overall group and broadly flat from Q4, excluding Essex, despite the higher income and usual Q1 seasonality. As usual, a word on our overall liquidity and funding on Slide 29. We have strong and diverse funding, including a 73% LDR and an NSFR of 136%, and we are highly liquid across currencies with an LCR of 175%. These measures reflect purposeful and prudent management of our balance sheet and risk, delivering resilience and capacity to support customers in a range of economic environments. TNAV per share increased \u00a30.15 in the quarter and \u00a30.37 year-on-year to \u00a30.372. Attributable profit added \u00a30.12 per share during Q1, and the unwind of the cash flow hedge reserve added \u00a30.04. We expect the majority of the cash flow hedge reserve to unwind by the end of 2026. This unwind, combined with earnings growth and buybacks, give us confidence that TNAV will continue to grow consistently, as it has done for the last seven quarters, and to a greater degree than current consensus expectations. So, to summarize, we are pleased with the strong performance of the bank in Q1, which sets us up well to deliver on all our 2025 guidance as we build towards our 2026 target. Over to you, Venkat, for concluding remarks.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you, Anna. Five quarters into the three-year plan, we remain on track to deliver our goals. We are working hard to deliver sustainable operational and financial improvement across our businesses. This, in turn, we expect will drive higher group returns and shareholder distributions. I will now open the Q&A. As ever, please limit yourselves to two questions per person so we can get around as many of you as possible. And as always, please introduce yourself as you ask your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Guy Stebbings from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nGuy Stebbings : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking questions and a good set of results today. I did want to focus on the area which, as you rightly said, gets quite a lot of attention, which is the U.S. consumer. And thanks for the extra disclosure. I was hoping you could help us think about the book and the strategy as we look forward. So firstly, on the impairment charge, I guess for the quarter, \u00a3399 million, the actual write-offs themselves were flattish and sort of in line with the last four quarters. You've taken the PMA and increased the coverage. So could you talk to the drivers of the increase in the reserve bill that goes above and beyond the PMA this quarter, perhaps? And in terms of the growth, as we look forward, the strategy is predicated on very much growth in the business. But I think a lot of people would understand you being a little bit more circumspect if delinquency trends looked like they were deteriorating. So my question really is sort of how wedded are you to growing the book meaningfully as planned and into higher margin, but slightly higher risk segments? And how easy would it be to pause that growth, if you like? Presumably you sort of still feel good in the long term outlook and don't want to exit partnerships. So trying to understand how you weigh up balancing that strategic outlook with the current uncertainty. Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Guy. Thank you for the question. So I will take the first one and then I'll pass the second one to Venkat. So as we look at our U.S. consumer business right now, we have given you additional disclosure. I'm glad that's helpful. That's on Page 38. And it's a bit more of a holistic view of what's going on in the U.S. market generally, but also in our book. But really what's happened in Q1 is as a BAU matter, you've got a slight seasonal elevation in the impairment charge. We normally see that in Q1 and it's just reflective of the high levels of consumer spend that we see in Q4 through the holiday season. Typically, what then happens is you start to see that reverse in Q2 and beyond. So far, very straightforward. In terms of the PMA, it's worth stepping back and thinking about what we consider when we book impairment. And we're looking at two things. The first is consumer behavior. And the second is what we expect to happen in the macroeconomic environment. On the first, in consumer behavior, we see no change. And you can see that clearly on the charts. Delinquencies are relatively low and stable. Actually, we see no change on the second. So U.S. economic consensus forecasts are actually relatively static and that they're very similar to where they were at the full year. But we think that's likely a timing issue. And therefore, it's reasonable for us to assume that they will change in the coming weeks and months. And therefore, we're trying to get ahead of that. So we're being thoughtful and methodical. So what we've done is essentially skew the downside bias in the impairment charge to accelerate a bit of coverage here. But just as we step back, the performance of the book itself is extremely robust. Venkat?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes. So I think I've said in the past, when I look at the book overall, there's about 20 corporate clients, 20 million underlying customers. And I look at the risk or we look at the risk of this portfolio in four dimensions. The first dimension is who is the partner and what business they are in and so on. The second is related to that, what's the industry? We've had a bias towards travel and we've been looking to diversify out of travel. We added GAAP, we added General Motors, and we chose not to renew Americans or our share of Americans. The third is the size and renewal rate. So we like to have a mix that is relatively smaller to our overall portfolio and not a lot of renewals coming in at the same time. And the last one is the actual underlying credit card, creditworthiness of the borrower. And through this combination, we like to create a business with a stable risk and high risk adjusted return. So when you take all of this together, we are continuing to want to grow this business. We do think the opportunities are great. Obviously, we will factor in the consumer environment when we do the actual risk selection of customers and look to get risk adjusted returns. And that risk selection is who do you open an account for and how do you manage credit lines. But we will continue to seek good partners that diversify our book and bring us opportunity.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Guy. Can we go to the next question, please? Operator, could we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Of course. The next question comes from Benjamin Toms from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Toms: Good morning, both. Thank you for taking my question. Both are really around regulations. Barclays has been a market leader on SRT transactions. And in April, the regulator wrote to all UK banks highlighting concerns in this area. Is there any headwinds capital that we should be considering as a result of implementing any relevant changes that are identified in that letter? And secondly, some of your peers have written to the government asking for a softening in the ring fencing regime. How material could a change in regulation be here for you? From the outside, it feels like you'd be one of the large beneficiaries of any change here. Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Ben, and good morning. Again, I'll take the first and then hand to Venkat for the second. So on SRT, the DCFO letter that we and others received recently did deal with SRT, but it was actually more focused on the financing of SRT. And to be really clear, we do not finance our own SRT programs. So we're not extending financing to investors who are then ongoing investors in our SRT. So we think that's the focus. From our perspective, we've run our Colonnade program since 2016. We share the details of each tranche of that with the regulator in order to get capital relief and we manage the reinvestment risk around that very, very carefully, as we've, you know, outlined before. So we're comfortable with our position and wouldn't envisage any capital consequences. Venkat?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes, so on ring fencing, I think you know that of the major UK banks, we have been opposed to any change and relaxation in the ring fencing regime. So while I agree with what others say that there is friction in the system, there was obviously a high cost to set up the ring fence. Let's call it a sunk cost now. And there's a little bit of trapped capital and liquidity. And if you release that in the short term, it would be good for banks. And let's argue for some customers. But I think in the long term, it weakens the system because it weakens deposit protection. I think the ring fence is an extremely strong and secure form of deposit protection in the UK. And while it might be short term attractive, I think in the long term, it weakens the system and weakens the participants in the system. And that includes Barclays. That's why on balance, I do not think we should change the ring fence regime. And I'm a strong supporter of it in its current form.\nAnna Cross: Thank you very much. Perhaps we can go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Cant from Autonomous. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nChris Cant : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, please. First on RWA, how should we think about RWA developments into 2Qs, specifically thinking about market risk here, given the volatility? Obviously, 1Q was a somewhat unusual quarter where IB RWAs were down on a constant FX basis, didn't seem to demonstrate the usual seasonality. So any color you could give us on how to think about Q-on-Q RWA developments into 2Q for the IB would be helpful, please. And as I think out to sort of targets, the 2026 targets that you've given us previously, and the circa \u00a350 billion of RWA growth you expected by the end of 2026, obviously Basel 3 is being delayed, Card IRB transition, I guess, is probably going to be a '27 event. I know you've said it's sort of ambiguous, but that's not necessarily going to hit you. With the weaker dollar, I guess that's also going to reduce the RWA growth. How should we be thinking now about where you expect to land in 2026 for group RWAs relative to that previous \u00a350 billion growth expectation? I also just wanted to add one on the U.S. So thank you again for reconfirming the FX splits for group and IB income and costs. I think that's helpful for us in thinking about the weaker dollar. But in the event that the U.S. administration applied some Section 899 taxes to UK companies, for instance, due to digital service tax proposals, how would we be best thinking about the possible impact of that for Barclays? Would it simply be a case of taking the country by country disclosures you give us and multiplying that percentage of PBT by the relevant incremental tax top up? Or is there something more nuanced we need to do in terms of subsidiary financials and that sort of thing? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Chris. I think there were at least three questions there, so I will attempt to deal with them in order. So on the IB RWAs, we remain fairly clear that the business should operate within the third circa \u00a3200 billion of RWAs that we've allocated to it. And you can see us doing that very, very consistently actually since '23. So we were doing it for some time before we even did the investor update. This period is no different really. And you can see that nimbleness in RWA deployment in the first quarter. So if you look in the disclosures, you'll see that credit risk RWAs are down, market risk RWAs are up, and counterparty credit risk RWAs are up. So our intention is to manage it nimbly within the framework that we have given them. And sort of to your second part of the question, which is really around the RWA shape from here. The way we think about it, Chris, is that there is some uncertainty around the timing and the quantum of the regulatory impact. And we've given you our best view that may happen at the beginning of '27, as opposed to the end of '26. But we don't feel that it undermines the fundamental objective of the plan. And the fundamental objective of the plan is to hold our RWAs and the IB broadly flat, as I said, and to deploy RWA growth into our highest returning UK businesses. And that part of the plan, which is, if you like, is the most strategic part, remains intact. I think as the regulatory environment becomes clearer and those timings become clearer, we can give you sort of exact splits and impacts of that. And then on the final part of your question. So what would a U.S. tax change mean for Barclays? Well, there are obviously short term and long term differences. So in the short term, what we would see for a rise in U.S. tax rates, for example, would be an increase in deferred tax assets. So you'd see a short term boost to capital and then obviously you'd have a longer term drag from any higher rate. It's a bit too early to give you precise guidance. We're expecting an initial U.S. tax bill in Q2. And some of the discussion that's happened around higher rates for non-U.S. firms, I mean, clearly hasn't been confirmed or firmed up into any kind of regulation yet. And I just remind you that the IHC is actually a U.S. firm. BB PLC branch isn't. So there is some nuances. You're exactly right within this that we'd have to guide to nearer the time. So I think it's not quite as simple as looking at the country by country reporting, unfortunately. Okay, thank you. Perhaps we can go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Goel from Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAmit Goel : Hi, thank you. And thanks for that extra disclosure on USCB. I just want to check, I mean, obviously, the UK NII is being guided up and the IB Q1 performance has been strong. So just thinking about the 11% RoTE guidance for this year, which has remained the same. So just curious, is that to reflect perhaps a bit more uncertainty in the environment? Or is it just a case of just not changing it at this point? Or a bit more risk on that USCB part of the business? So number one, just curious why the 11% hasn't changed. As well. And then secondly, in terms of the hedge benefit beyond 2026, I think you're commenting, obviously, that it remains quite a strong tailwind. So just wanted to double check the kind of roll-off yield that you're anticipating, say, in 2027. We have about 2.5%. Just wanted to check whether it's in the right kind of ballpark or whether you think actually the roll-off yield is a bit lower or a bit higher than that? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thanks, Amit. I'll take both of those. So we've obviously seen a strong Q1 and that's coming through not only in the income line, but all the way through the P&L. So we've got good operating leverage and we're pleased with that performance. But it's only the first quarter of the year. So all we've done is we've repeated our circa 11% guidance and I'm not signaling anything by repeating that guidance, whether that be in income costs or impairments. So I'm merely repeating it. On the second question around the hedge benefit, we have said today that we expect the hedge momentum to continue beyond 2026. Why have we said that? Well, if I take you back to deposits and the stability of deposits, what that means now is that we expect the hedge notion to be broadly stable from here. And that actually takes one of the variables off the table. So all we're doing now is we are comparing, if you like, the prevailing swap with the yield on the hedge, whether that be the average yield or indeed the maturing yield. We haven't given any disclosure on maturing yield beyond 2026. But I think if you do this simple math, which I know many of you have done, and just take our planning assumption of 3.5 and push that through the maturing elements of '25 and '26, you will find that the average hedge yield in 2027 is below 3.5% so that's really what we are signaling here and obviously as we get closer we'll talk a bit more about maturing yields but just a bit too far out for that. Hopefully that's helpful. Okay thank you. Can we go to the next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nAlvaro Serrano : Good morning and apologies if you've already touched on this because I joined a bit late because of multitasking. On U.S. cards, you have the \u00a340 billion receivables target you've maintained for 2026 and I just wonder with the sort of broader discussions around the U.S. cycle, you obviously need to signup new clients, new JVs to get to that. Is it the right time? Do you feel there's enough visibility to take on significant portfolios to achieve that \u00a340 billion or would you need to wait just to think about that sort of medium term target? Then another one on the IP and general activity. Could you maybe give us a bit of color on how the investment bank has done during the quarter or maybe even April or by region? What I'm trying to get to is obviously Q1 is very good but if volatility comes down are we suddenly going to see a very quiet sort of performance and how much of the activity you think, how much visibility you have for the rest of the year? It's a difficult question but any hand holding or color would be much appreciated. Thank you.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Alvaro, hi. I'll start with cards and we've covered a little bit of this but I'll go over it again and then Anna will talk about the investment bank. So on the U.S. cards portfolio, the growth is going to come in net receivables from three things. One is organic growth in our existing portfolio. The second is how we choose to flex the lever that we have used of risk transfers. We can do more or less and if we do less the receivables are up there on our book. And then the third thing is portfolio changes which is new accounts or accounts leaving. So on the first one which is organic growth we're fairly comfortable that we continue to see organic growth and we have a very high credit quality portfolio. We're looking to diversify it among certain sectors but it's a high credit quality portfolio. On the second one which is risk transfer there's always a question at the time of what capital benefit we get, what's the price at which we sell it and whether it suits our risk management. As you say given that we've chosen not to bid for our portion for a renewal of our portion of American all else equal we would want to keep things on our balance sheet. Third is acquisitions or the other disposals. We've renewed a bunch of our other accounts through 2024. I think we've mentioned that in our previous full year earnings. And then we continue to look in this environment even in this environment especially in this environment at good quality portfolios that we think rounds out our business. These things are very long term decisions. A typical portfolio takes two to three years to decide to bid and to come to you and then it's there with you for hopefully seven years. So these are long term decisions and I wouldn't let the short term stuff in the market affect that decision making. Anna?\nAnna Cross: Thanks Venkat. Alvara the only thing I'd add to that is that achieving the plan and the returns that we want in USCB is not just only volume either. We're working very hard on margins. We're working very hard on cost and digitization of the business and also the capital efficiency as Venkat said. So a plan of many parts. Let me talk about the IB sort of generally in the quarter and then I'll pass across to Venkat who might want to add at the end. If you think about what should have happened to our IB in the quarter given the volatility that we've seen, we should see strong markets revenues in the more subdued banking environment and that's exactly you know the shape of our results very much in line with the market more broadly. As I look at Q1 in particular we've been investing in this business for some time and investing to create a franchise that allows us to perform in a range of environments and you see that. So the FICC results very strong and I think that reflects our investment in securitized products. It reflects our investments in our rates businesses and equities is strong. Actually you'll recall there was a one-off last year but you know our equities position has been very much driven by the investments that we've made in equity derivatives. So we feel like we're facing the market with a much more complete franchise and of course our financing business adds stability and is probably less impacted by volatility but you can see good growth in there that's obviously also underpinning FICC and equities. I said we would have expected the IB to be a bit softer and of course or investment banking to be a bit softer in Q1 and of course it has been we feel that in line with the street and in fact we've seen share gains across advisory ECM DCM and for the complex overall albeit in a smaller market and I just remind you that that our planning assumption was for this market to be 10% down year on year and that's broadly what we see in Q1. All of this has been underpinned by us being a bit more nimble in RWAs in the IB as I've said but we're really focused all the way through the P&L and the performance of the IB so you see good cost control and you'll also see very, very good risk control. We've disclosed today for the first time consistently both our bar progression and indeed our lost days and you can see we're not taking outsized risk. I should have actually mentioned also a very good performance within the ICB, the International Corporate Bank within banking so financing and the ICB are both less sort of impacted by volatility. Venkat do you want to comment?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes, I'll re-emphasize what Anna said at the beginning which is that if you see the first quarter results you see the performance you would expect to see in the places you would expect to see them and obviously we can't talk about the second quarter. We don't. We're about a month into it but again re-emphasize what Anna said on the market side. You know when there's volatility we aim to put our clients first and to do intermediation and risk management for our clients. That is what we strive to do and it can be profitable as long as you manage your own risks well which is what we strive to do and Anna gave you the data on the first quarter results of that. So that's what we strive to do every day and on banking activity you know people will wait for clarity until they resume. It could happen sooner than we think. But the overall business is pretty well diversified whether you look at the investment bank and you look at deposit growth in the International Corporate Bank, you look at the International Corporate Bank, you look at market or even the whole bank as a whole.\nAnna Cross: Thank you, Alvaro. And perhaps we could go to the next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nChris Hallam : Yes, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones. So given the conservative banking wallet already embedded in your planning assumptions which I guess you just referenced, are there any initiatives either on the cost side or the investment side that you would need to either undertake or delay should 2025 sort of indeed play out as per those wallet assumptions is the first question. And then second, you mentioned the substantial increase in transaction banking deposits in the U.S. How has that trended post quarter end? So if companies are maybe building liquidity, delaying some investment spend, are you seeing that show up in your deposit volumes? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay, thanks. Thanks Chris. Thanks for the questions. I'll take the first one and then I'll hand across to Venkat. As I said, that was our assumption for banking and actually what we're seeing here is the diversification of income working really well across the bank both in terms of more than offset by markets activity and also the strength that we're seeing coming through in the UK and the UK complex more generally across deposits that's underpinned our upgrade today. So, you know, the revenue line appears to be very robust and we have confidence in it. That said, that does not undermine our focus on costs. You know, it's what we're doing every day. It's a key part of the strategy. You can see that all the way through the P&L today, income up by 11%, profits up by 19%. The plan is to create operating leverage, not just at the group, but across every single business within the group. Overall, I still expect what I expected at the year end, which is for incremental investment to underpin the longer term growth of the plan and investment -- I'm sorry, inflation to outweigh our gross efficiencies for the year and for us to see an uptick in costs. All of that is contained within the most important cost metric, which is cost income ratio at 61%. That is the number that we are most focused on. It's likely that we'll see some movement in absolute cost. I'm happy with consensus as it currently starts, but it is FX sensitive and it is performance and volume sensitive. And therefore, I'd really urge you to focus on the cost income ratio target that we've given. We feel like 57% in Q1 is a good down payment against that and should show you how focused we are on operating leverage. Venkat, transaction banking?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: So, transaction banking has been an area of great emphasis for us in the last few years. We spoke about it last year, we've spoken about it at our year-end earnings. People choose us and the quantum of deposits is based on two factors. One is the growth in our overall transaction banking business or relationships generally, people's choice of us as a counterparty, which is increasing. And then ultimately, their needs for cash and their use of cash. In this period, we continue to see happily people choosing us as a counterparty newly, and that's good. And that's improving again. And then I think on cash, what you're seeing is growth in deposits, in part, what you would expect when people are being cautious on the deploying of cash for transactions. So, you're seeing deposit growth whether it's individuals or it's institutions. It's all what you would normally expect in this environment.\nAnna Cross: Okay, thank you. Thanks, Chris. Can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question today comes from Perlie Mong from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nPerlie Mong : Hello. Hi, Anna. So, just a couple of questions. One, just quickly touching on the U.S. card margin. So, obviously, that's been down. But you've talked about some of the drivers, some of the time lags between deposit pricing and asset pricing. And I know you've mentioned that the interest rate risk is already hedged. But I guess the market is pricing in faster and more rate cuts on the U.S. side for the rest of the year, maybe three or four rate cuts. So, if that were to happen, I guess, is it already in your planning assumption? And if that were to happen, would you still expect the meaningful progression during 2025, as you've just talked about? So, I guess that's number one. Number two, I guess, more broadly on the full year '26, greater than 12% returns target. So, consensus has just got to about 12% taken a year to get there. I guess the operating environment is arguably a little bit more challenging. Certainly, impairment looks like it is possible that it will go up given economic indicators coming down maybe a little bit. And I suppose in general, U.S. dollar weakening is probably not super helpful either. So, where do you see a gap between your planning assumption and where consensus is? Because you've reiterated guidance. So, presumably, that you see maybe some positive to where consensus is currently, notwithstanding maybe a little bit of worsening in credit quality and maybe some FX impact as well. So, just it would be helpful to understand where you think people might be too pessimistic.\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thank you, Perlie. So, let me deal with the U.S. cards margin first. We've given you our macroeconomic variable assumptions. I think they're on Slide 35. So, you can have a look at those. Obviously, we are expecting further downward pressure on Fed rates. You can see that from there. What I would just remind you, though, is that that matter is hedged. So, we've got floating rate assets. We've got largely fixed rate deposits. So, you can see that we would have a timing difference in a downward rate environment. We do hedge that interest rate risk. But the nature of those hedges is different from the ones that we have in the UK. And therefore, the accounting geography is different. So, you do see an income offset, but it manifests itself on non-interest income. So, if you look year on year, you're going to see non-interest income. So, I'm not concerned about the income overall, but you might see a bit of a split geography between the margin compression and the hedge benefit, which obviously you wouldn't see in the UK. And then, if I step back and look at FY '26, we've reiterated and reaffirmed our targets today. We feel like we've got momentum in the business and we are delivering our plan. What you should expect us to do is execute the operational plan and deliver the numbers with no surprises. And that's no different in the current environment than it is last year or the year before. So, we're 100% focused on that. We've clearly got good income growth that comes from the diversification of the business. There's clearly a bit of a weak spot in investment banking, but markets, as Venkat's been through, benefits from periods of volatility. And very importantly, we are seeing a strong underpin here from the upgrade of NII that we've given you, not just for BUK, but for the group as a whole. And that's coming from the strength of deposits in the UK. Our costs are well controlled. Again, you can see we're focused on operating leverage. And whilst there's more uncertainty in the impairment line, I would not see that uncertainty taking us out with the 50 to 60 basis point range that we've given you for loan loss rate. So, we are confident in the delivery of our circa 11 this year and also the targets that we've given you for next year. And that's the case for the financial targets and the distribution targets. Okay, perhaps we can go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Coombs : Good morning. So, perhaps I just have a couple of follow-ups, especially on the fixed income result. It's very strong relative to peers. So, any reason why there might be episodic revenues in that or any additional seasonality compared to your peers? And if you could help us think about the breakdown between credit, securitized products, rates and effects, any color you can shed would be helpful. And then the second question, just on mortgage balances in the UK, obviously you've been struggling to grow that for a while, but you've actually seen a very good result this quarter, about \u00a33 billion Q-on-Q. How sustainable do you think that is versus how much is that just a pull forward of activity in light of stamp duty changes? Thank you.\nAnna Cross: Okay, Andy, I will start. Venkat may want to add on FICC. I mean, nothing much more than I would call out from before, just a strong performance across the board reflects our investment in the business, both in intermediation and in financing. You know, I've called out rates, I've called out securitized products. There are no one-offs in there. And so, you know, where we take remarks on lead-thin positions, they are not in FICC. They are on our corporate lending line. And we've called that out separately. So, I wouldn't call out any one-offs. So, it's a good performance. On mortgages, you know, the mortgage market was robust in Q1. As a market matter, approvals were up by 15%. Notably, within that, house purchases up by 20%. And that's not just house purchase, but first-time buyers as well. We think both of those two are really good lead indicators. Sorry, my voice is going. Let me take a drink of water. They're good indicators for the health of the mortgage market overall. If you step back, you've got rates that are broadly on the downward trend. You've got robust and stable house price inflation, and you've got real wage growth. So, there may be a bit of pull forward in Q1, but honestly, the market as a whole is performing well. Okay. Perhaps we can go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Edward Firth from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nEdward Firth: Good morning, everybody. Thanks very much. Yes, I just have two questions. Number one, UK fees look very weak. They're down about 9% year on year, and they're certainly annualizing at no more than about a \u00a31 billion, I guess, that's in the UK business. So, could you tell us a little bit about what's going on there and how we should expect that going forward? Is the sort of 250 like the run rate we should be thinking about, or is there something that was in there that means it might pick up as the rest of the year progresses? So, I guess that's my first question. The second question is just coming back to risk-weighted assets, because you talked about how IB was broadly performing as you might expect in terms of trends in the first quarter. I would agree with that completely, except for risk-weighted assets, which have always been up very strongly in the first quarter. With all the volatility, you would have expected them to be up even more, I guess, or I might have done. And yet, they were down and down, down quite, and I know there's an effect in there, but even if you strip all that out, I think they were flat to down. So, could you just tell us a little bit more about why that was, and is there potential to further reduce that going forward? And can I ask you, you might have told us this, so I apologize if I missed it, but I think you told us in one of the backslides, you said you've done \u00a357 billion, I think, of risk transfers at full year '24. Could you update us where we are on that? Is that where that number is now? Is some of this about increasing risk transfers, et cetera, and how that might progress? Thanks very much.\nAnna Cross: Okay, Ed, there was a lot in that, so let's try and answer it. I'll start and then I'll hand to Venkat. So, on UK non-NII, we've given you guidance previously for greater than to \u00a350 million. I'd just repeat that guidance. This number can be a bit lumpy. There is no story within the Q1 beyond the fact that Q1 can sometimes be a bit light just because of lower transactional activity, and honestly, there's nothing more in there to read into. So, I'd stick to the guidance of greater than 250. On RWAs, you're right, there's a bit of FX in there that's taking it downwards. We haven't elevated the SRT. We've said before that the Colonnade Program, which is the one that impacts the IB, is mature, and we do not expect to extend it. Venkat, do you want to comment on that?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Yes, I mean, look, I think, you know, we've targeted a level of stability in the investment banks RWAs. You've got to expect quarter on quarter, and I've said this before, that there'll be some volatility, right? A couple of billion up does not mean that we're loosening the spigots. A couple of billion down does not mean we're tightening it up, right? There is natural client activity. There's volatility in that activity. There are positions that get taken off. There are positions that get added or don't get added. As you might imagine in this environment, you know, the marginal benefit of the marginal allocation is more in markets than in banking based on activity, and that's what you saw in the first quarter.\nEdward Firth: Great. So, just to follow on from that then, so, I mean, your Tier one's now at 13.9%. You've obviously arrived at the top end of your range. You're going to generate more capital, I guess, in the next quarter. I mean, there's no reason why you shouldn't be doing buybacks bigger than you've done in the past, is there, just to clarify that?\nAnna Cross: So, our capital is at 13.9%, so it's towards the top end of our range. We did indicate at the full year that we did expect to operate towards the top half, and that was simply because we did expect an increase in the MDA, which has now come through. That said, why are we there? We're there because the strategy is working and we're seeing very good capital generation from the business. That is the strategy, and if we keep executing the strategy, as we keep executing the strategy, it's not inconceivable that we might go through the top end of that range. But, you know, that's a good thing. We've given you guidance that we would expect distributions to be progressive this year, and, you know, we haven't changed our guidance that distributions will be at least 10 billion over the period of the plan.\nEdward Firth: Okay, thanks so much.\nAnna Cross: Okay, thank you. Perhaps we can go to the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Jonathan Price from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJonathan Price : Hello, good morning, both. I've got a couple of questions. The first is a follow-up on Ed's question on capital. You came into this year at 13.6% equity Tier 1 ratio, 13.3% adjusting for the buyback. It does sound increasingly like you want to operate close to the 14% moving forwards. Can I just confirm that that is how we should be thinking about it? I'm just wondering whether there's an element of this relating to the fact that UK RWA growth, your target for end of next year, looks increasingly stretching and maybe, you know, you're thinking about some sort of inorganic bolt-on, which obviously would consume some capital in a one-off sense there. So that's the first question. The second question is on sensitivity again, particularly in the U.S. card book. If I look at your full year downside scenarios, even on downside two, which has got GDP falling over one percentage point this year and next year, unemployment moving to above 7%, the models are telling you that your required stage 1 and 2 ECL build would only be about \u00a3177 million, which feels very low given that set of macroeconomic assumptions. I mean, I guess the models are, you know, telling us what the models are telling us, but how robust do you think the models are? I guess in the COVID, IFRS 9 was quite news, a bit wet behind the ears. We're seven to eight years in now and this obviously applies across the group as well because the sensitivity to downside one and two scenarios is very limited given the severity of those. So comment on that would be useful. Thanks.\nAnna Cross: Okay, thanks Jonathan. Okay, so let me start with capital. Venkat may want to comment on this also. You're right, we're generating a lot of capital, but as I said previously, that is an outcome of the plan and it is intentional, it is deliberate and it's what you should expect going forward. We did indicate at the full year that you should expect us to operate towards the top half and, you know, I'll just reiterate that as our formal guidance, but just reflecting on the fact that we are generating a lot of capital. Just on the utilization of that capital, you know, we're very focused on deploying \u00a330 billion in the UK, that plan is intact. As I look at where we are now, we've deployed \u00a314 billion of that, recognizing, of course, that a large part of that has come from Tesco, but you can see good loan growth in the quarter, both from the UK and from the UK corporate bank. If I look at the specifics of lending, you know, the consumer preference at the moment is for secured versus unsecured lending. That's very clear, that's okay, and then as I look at the lending as it's developing in the corporate bank and private banking and wealth management, actually it's very high quality and that's reflective of our portfolios. So, key one, you know, if I look at that in isolation, the lending's happening, maybe the RWA waiting is a little light, but over the period of the plan, that plan is intact and I particularly point you to the momentum that we've got both around mortgages and cars on the leading indicators on slide 15. We're going through that J-curve in cards, you're going to see interest earning lending and RWAs growing cards from the back end of '25 with all of that maturing through. Venkat, do you want to comment more on RWAs?\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: No, look, I think Anna's covered it all. I also remind you of the environment in which we are. You would expect us to be on the generous side of prudent in our capital.\nAnna Cross: Yes, absolutely, and then on the second point, you know, I would take the disclosures on IFRS 9 as a sensitivity. They're not predictive. They essentially say what happens if I take my current static balance sheet and I push through a different set of macroeconomic variables. What it doesn't take into account is clearly the kind of stage migration that you would see into Stage 3. It doesn't take into account any, you know, increases of exposure at default, so the fact that customers may draw down as they become more financially pressed. But also, the other thing that it doesn't take into account is credit actions that we might take in order to manage that position. So I wouldn't think of it as a scenario. I would think of it as a sensitivity, and it's quite, you know, it's quite a straightforward sensitivity. I don't think it's intended to be predictive. The same is true of the PMA that we've taken. That's really just a downside bias at this stage. Hopefully that's helpful. Okay, thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Robin Down from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRobin Down : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quickies for me. I think you kind of touched on this a little bit, Anna, in your last answer, but the Barclay card Consumer UK revenue line doesn't really seem to have made a great deal of progress over the last 12 months, despite the kind of the big pickup in card acquisition numbers. Is that just a kind of lead lag effect? Does it kind of take 12 months for the revenues to come through? Or is there some other kind of trend in there when you might expect to see kind of proper revenue growth in that line? And then the second question is more of clarification. I think slide 8 talks about a 90% reinvestment rate on the structural hedge. But I think you mentioned earlier that you expect the structural hedge to be stable. Is that 90% unstable? Is that just kind of a very broad definition of stable? Or how should we read that?\nAnna Cross: Okay. Thank you, Robin. Let me deal with those. So on the Barclaycard line, I mean, we step back into the credit card market in 2023. So all you are seeing here really is a production line of those cards acquisitions, then maturing into interest earning lending. Actually, if you think about the structure of the market, it tends to be slightly longer dated than 12 months. So you're going to see some pickup in interest earning lending towards the back end of 2025. But the bulk of this is actually going to be in 2026. So it is a lead lag effect, as you suggest. And then on the second question, we've given you a planning assumption of circa 90%. But you can see, given where deposits have been in the first quarter that the notion has been stable. And we would expect it to be broadly stable. But just for your planning math, that's why we've said circa 90%. Nothing more to read into it than that. Okay, so I think that brings us to the end of questions for today. And I'd like to thank you for those questions. Thank you for your continued interest in Barclays in what I know is a very busy day. And we will see you either on the road or at the Analyst Breakfast in a couple of weeks.\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan: Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you.

        "text": "Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining Barclays' first quarter 2025 results call. At our progress update 11 weeks ago, we outlined expectations for the second year of our three-year plan. These were to deliver a better run, a more strongly performing and higher return in Barclays. I'm pleased with our performance and progress to date, including in this, the first quarter of 2025. While the environment has certainly become more uncertain, we are firmly on track to achieve the full objectives of our plan, including approximately 11% return on tangible equity for 2025. Our confidence reflects the inherent diversification of our business, the careful and proactive approach which we adopt to managing risk, and our ongoing focus in delivery of operational efficiency. All of this is supported by a robust balance sheet, including a 13.9% CET1 ratio at the end of the first quarter. This is intentionally towards the top of our 13% to 14% target range. In addition, we are supported with very strong liquidity. In the first quarter, Barclays generated a return on tangible equity of 14%. This was achieved even as tangible book value grew 11% year-on-year to 372 pence. Total income for the first quarter was \u00a37.7 billion, and importantly, the quality and stability of our income continues to improve. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our income growth profile, and today we are upgrading 2025 NII guidance for Barclays UK and the group, reflecting favorable deposit volumes and mix. And we will amplify our top-line growth through positive operating leverage, as we did again during the first quarter, with 6% jaws delivering a 57% cost-income ratio in the quarter. Moving on to our Q1 performance, we are improving operational performance across the businesses to drive sustainably higher financial returns. Last quarter, we released around \u00a3150 million of the circa \u00a3500 million growth cost efficiency savings, which we expect during the year. These savings structurally improve our cost base and the level and consistency of our returns, including beyond 2026. We are generating higher returns in two ways. First, by allocating more capital to the highest-returning UK businesses, and second, by improving returns in the lower-returning businesses in the bank, namely the Investment Bank and the U.S. Consumer Bank. Across the three UK businesses, we continue to grow our risk-weighted assets in the quarter and deliver returns at or around the full year '26 target levels. Returns in the Investment Bank were supported by ongoing execution of management actions and strong activity in markets, in particular in fixed income and credit, where we monetized activity well and continued a disciplined approach to risk management. As you would expect in a period of uncertainty, weaker client confidence is delaying investment banking transactions, but for us, this has been more than offset by the benefits of the impact of volatility on trading revenues in markets. While RoTE in the U.S. Consumer Bank fell year-on-year to 4.5%, the operational performance of the business continues to progress as we expected. Finally, we are continuing to simplify our businesses. Two weeks ago, we announced a long-term partnership with Brookfield to transform our payment acceptance business. We are looking forward to working closely with our partner to enhance the client experience, drive long-term growth, and improve financial performance for this activity. Earlier in the quarter, we completed the sale of our German consumer finance business. So while we remain focused on executing our strategy and achieving our targets, we are obviously paying close attention to the recent market volatility and what it may imply for economic growth and business activity. And so before I hand over to Anna, let me offer some reflections on the current backdrop. I want to emphasize at the outset that our strategy has been designed to deliver in a range of economic and financial environments, and I reiterate our confidence in achieving the targets which we have set out financially and operationally for 2025 and 2026. Our role, as ever, is to help clients navigate the changes in the environment. We must do so while prudently managing our own risk. We are well-positioned to do this. We start with a business mix that is diversified geographically across hotel and retail and by product. And in fact, all of this is well-illustrated by the first quarter results which we are discussing. Last but not least, our customers start from a resilient position. In the U.K., household balance sheets are robust and spending trends have been stable. In our U.S. consumer businesses, our balances are skewed to prime and super prime customers. And spending and payment rates across our U.S. customer cohorts have remained stable, including among lower FICO customers. On the wholesale side, corporates are cautious about new borrowing and demonstrate a desire to maintain liquidity. Having said all that, the current environment and market volatility undoubtedly require attention and management. Looking ahead, we expect net interest income to grow further and for market revenues to be roughly commensurate with volatility. However, transactional and lending income could slow as companies and individuals become more cautious. This income mix provides a good measure of structural protection and stability. On top of this, we have to protect ourselves, as we always do, with active risk management. We have long-established programs to transfer and hedge risk, and we will continue to do so as warranted by this environment. Finally, we continue to provision prudently across all our portfolios. In conclusion, while we recognize the risks that are inherent in the current environment, we remain confident in our income outlook and are positioning ourselves carefully to navigate through this current circumstance. We remain committed to and confident in delivering our 2025 guidance and 2026 targets, including an approximately 11% RoTE and a progressive capital distribution this year. I will now hand over to Anna to take us through our first quarter financials."

        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 summarizes the financial highlights for the first quarter. Before going into the detail, I would remind you that we are focused, as ever, on what we can control. The plan and targets we called out at the investor update are based on realistic assumptions about the external environment. These are unchanged from the full year results and are shown in the appendix. The group's diversified business model by income and geography help support returns in a range of environments, delivering a Q1 ROTI of 14%. This was against the previous year's 12.3%, with much of the improvements reflecting income growth across all five divisions, particularly the Investment Bank and Barclays UK. Operating leverage is a key aspect of the plan to structurally improve group returns. Income rose by 11%, while costs rose by 5%, delivering 6% positive joules and driving a 19% increase in profit before tax to \u00a32.7 billion. This performance was further amplified by the effect of the share buybacks during the past year, leading to a 26% increase in earnings per share. I remain focused on four aspects of performance. Income stability, with an increased emphasis on growth. Cost discipline and progress on efficiency savings. Credit performance and a robust capital position. These underpin our aim to deliver higher returns on a sustainable, predictable and consistent basis. I'll now cover these in more detail, starting with income on Slide 6. Income in Q1 increased \u00a3700 million to \u00a37.7 billion. This growth was broad-based, including from stable income streams in retail, corporate and financing activities within markets. In the investment bank, we captured the benefit of greater market volatility during the quarter, supported by our investment across the business. And in Barclays UK, stronger than expected deposit trends are supporting higher NII, as shown on the next slide. Group net interest income increased 13% year-on-year to \u00a33 billion. In Barclays UK, we now expect more than \u00a37.6 billion of NII during FY '25, up from circa \u00a37.4 billion previously. Two changes have led to this improvement in our outlook. First, Q1 seasonal deposit volumes were higher than we expected, particularly in current accounts consistent with more normalized behavior. Second, the mix of savings has stabilized faster than we expected. This improvement in deposit mix supports our confidence in lowering Tesco Bank's post-acquisition funding costs. These developments and a strong start to the year across other businesses mean we now expect Group NII, excluding the IB and head office, to be more than \u00a312.5 billion for FY '25. Up from circa \u00a312.2 billion previously. The continued strength of deposits also supports greater longer-term income stability via the structural hedge. We have now locked in \u00a310.2 billion of gross structural hedge income over the next two years, up from \u00a39.1 billion last quarter. And this income will build further as we reinvest maturing hedges. We said in February that we expect to reinvest three quarters of maturing hedges at a 3.5% yield. In Q1, we were able to lock in hedges at a higher rate than our assumption, with a stable hedge notional. Continued deposit strength means we now expect to reinvest around 90% of maturing hedges during 2025 and 2026 versus 75% previously. Given this reinvestment profile and our planning assumptions for 3.5% swap rates, we expect the contribution from the structural hedge to continue well beyond 2026. Moving on to costs. The group cost to income ratio was 57% in Q1. This provides a strong foundation to deliver guidance of circa 61% in 2025 and the high 50s target in 2026, with scope to improve further thereafter. Total costs increased by \u00a3189 million year-on-year, with around half of this increase related to run rate costs for Tesco Bank. Q1 costs also included circa \u00a350 million for the employee share grant announced at the full year result. These and other investments in business growth and inflation were partially offset by around \u00a3150 million of gross efficiency savings as part of the \u00a3500 million we expect in 2025. Expenses associated with structural cost actions were modest in Q1 and are likely to be weighted towards the second half of 2025 and within the \u00a3200 million to \u00a3300 million normal annual range. Turning now to impairment. I know that development in the US in particular are a big focus, so we have included some additional color on the positioning of our U.S. card business in the appendix. Customer behavior does not reflect risks to the economic outlook and we start from a resilient position, including an IFRS 9 coverage ratio of 10.4% or 8.3% on a seasonal basis. Both 30 and 90-day delinquencies were stable in the quarter, as you can see from the two lines on this page. The USCB loan loss rate of 562 basis points increased versus Q4, reflecting reserves billed for higher seasonal balances and a post-model adjustment. I'll discuss this more on the next slide in the context of the group. The Q1 group impairment charge of \u00a30.6 billion equated to a loan loss rate of 61 basis points, modestly above our 50 to 60 basis points through the circa guidance. As a reminder, our impairment charge is based on consensus economic forecasts prevailing towards the end of the quarter. These forecasts were largely unchanged from FY '24 and so do not reflect elevated U.S. economic uncertainty. To address this and consistent with our approach to uncertainty in the past, we increased the probability weighting of downside scenarios in our IFRS 9 calculations for U.S. portfolios. This led to a net post-model adjustment of \u00a374 million, included within the US consumer bank and the investment bank. The impact for U.S. cards relates mainly to a change in the weighted average peak U.S. unemployment rate from 4.7% to 5.2%, resulting in a \u00a338 million adjustment. While in the investment bank, a reduction in the weighted average U.S. GDP growth from 1.6% to 0.8% led to a net \u00a336 million model adjustment. Outside of the U.S., the increase in the Barclays UK loan loss charge was mainly driven by the addition of Tesco Bank. This included a circa \u00a330 million charge for the post-acquisition stage migration of some Tesco Bank balances, which should diminish beyond Q1. Aside from Tesco Bank, the loan loss rate for Barclays UK increased modestly but remains low. You can see financial highlights for Barclays UK on Slide 12, but I will talk to Slide 13. RoTE was 17.4% in the quarter and total income rose 14% year-on-year to \u00a32.1 billion. The integration of Tesco Bank is progressing well, with the improved deposit mix providing greater confidence on lower post-acquisition funding costs. As a result, we now expect circa \u00a3500 million of NII from this business in FY '25 included within the updated NII guidance versus circa \u00a3400 million we expected previously. Stronger structural hedge income also supported greater NII versus Q4 and more than offset product margin headwinds. Non-NII of \u00a3252 million was due to seasonally lower customer spend, and we continue to expect a quarterly run rate above \u00a3250 million. Overall, income growth of 14% exceeded cost growth of 9%, enabling the cost-to-income ratio to fall to 56% despite higher investment and run rate costs for Tesco Bank. Moving on to the Barclays UK balance sheet. Deposits in the quarter were stronger than expected, with balances down only \u00a31.1 billion, consistent with a more normalized behavior. The mix of deposits continues to develop favorably, with customers choosing to retain liquidity through current accounts and instant access savings accounts. Loan growth also continued in Q1, with \u00a31.9 billion of net lending driven by mortgages, partially offset by lower business banking lending as clients continue to repay COVID-era loans. Indicators of future lending activity continue to improve as we pursue our strategy to deploy capital into the UK. The momentum and breadth of UK growth that we saw in the second half of 2024 continued in the first quarter. Gross mortgage lending remained strong, including among home leavers and first-time buyers, supporting net lending of \u00a32.2 billion. We acquired 386 new credit card customers as part of our strategy to regain market share in unsecured lending. This should support future growth in balances as customers' appetite to borrow normalizes. And we saw continued deployment of risk-weighted assets in the UK corporate bank, supporting \u00a31.3 billion loan growth as clients continue to draw down lending facilities. Moving on to Slide 17. UK corporate banks delivered a Q1 rating of 17.1%, income growth of 12%, exceeded cost growth of 3%, leading to an improved cost-to-income ratio of 53%. NII was up 23% year-on-year, reflecting higher average lending and deposit balances, while non-NII fell 10%. While this line can be volatile, we expect investments in our digital and lending propositions to drive non-NII growth over time. Impairments remain low and stable, decreasing quarter-on-quarter with lower single-name charges. Turning now to private bank and wealth management. Q1 rating was 34.5%. Client assets and liabilities grew versus Q4, including net new assets under management of \u00a31 billion, and income growth of 12% exceeded cost growth of 9%, leading to a cost-to-income ratio reduction to 68%. As previously guided, you should expect an increase in investment costs in the quarters to come to support advisor growth, product development, and digital capabilities. Turning now to the Investment Bank. Q1 RoTE of 16.2% was supported by income growth across most areas of the IB. Total income was up 16% year-on-year, while total costs rose 5%, resulting in positive joules and a cost-to-income ratio of 54%. Capital productivity, measured by income over average RWAs, was 7.7%, or 120 basis points better year-on-year. More now on income by business on Slide 22. Using the U.S. dollar figures as usual to help comparisons to U.S. peers, markets' income was up 16% year-on-year. FICC rose 21%, with particular strength in macro products across rates and FX and in securitized products. Equity's income was up 9%, or by 27%, excluding the prior period's one-off gains on Visa B shares. Financing and equity derivatives were particularly strong. Investment banking fees rose 4%. Our fee share was 3.5%, including an improvement in ECM and advisory. While clients are waiting for a more stable market environment before transacting, pipelines remain strong. In transaction banking, income increased 8% percent, as we continue to implement our treasury coverage model. This also contributed to U.S. deposit balance growth of around 50% year-on-year, which we see as a lead indicator of transaction banking income growth. And corporate lending income increased strongly year-on-year, reflecting gains on leveraged finance positions. The investment bank is on a multi-year journey to generate higher and more consistent returns. Volatility creates opportunities in markets where we generate around two-thirds of investment bank income. Investments we have made into this business allowed us to monetize these opportunities well during Q1. We did this while prudently managing risk with stable VaR and no lost days in our trading book. And in banking, we entered into the most recent period of volatility with limited exposure to risk, including in the last spin. We are also making good progress in our management actions, including in our three focus businesses, equity derivatives, European rates, and securitized products, all while growing the more stable income streams within the investment bank, including financing. Turning now to the U.S. consumer bank. U.S. consumer bank RoTE was 4.5% in the quarter, including the \u00a338 million post-model adjustment I mentioned earlier. Total income was up 1% year-on-year, as lower NII was offset by higher non-NII. NII was then 1% with NIM of 10.5%, driven by a full quarter impact of rate cuts in Q4 '24, which drove spread compression with deposits taking longer to reprice than assets. This interest rate risk is hedged with the offsetting benefit reflected in non-NII, which increased 9% year-on-year. We remain confident in achieving NIM of greater than 12% by 2026, and expect meaningful progression during 2025, as the impact of our repricing actions take hold in the portfolio. Total costs were up 5% due to an increase in partner-related expense, which is mostly offset in higher non-interest income. We continue to make good progress in increasing digital adoption and driving efficiency. End net receivables increased 4% year-on-year to $33 billion on a managed basis, all from organic growth. We continue to see strong retail deposit growth, including $2 billion quarter-on-quarter and $4 billion year-on-year, driven by the tiered savings product that we launched in Q3 2024. The percentage of total funding coming from core deposits now stands at 68%, and we expect this to increase going forward in line with our target of greater than 75% in 2026. Moving to the main developments impacting head office. Earlier this month, we announced a long-term partnership with Brookfield for our payment acceptance business, previously referred to as merchant acquiring. This business is strategically important, but has become less able to compete in recent years, given technology changes in the sector and, absent investments, financial performance was expected to deteriorate. Through the partnership, Barclays will invest circa \u00a3400 million, mostly in the next three years, to enhance the range of services, improve efficiency, and support growth. This will begin in Q2 and has no material impact on our current financial targets or guidance. Over time, we expect the partnership to improve the financial performance of the business as part of Barclays Group. If Brookfield choose to increase their ownership interest after three years, our investment will be fully recovered and we will retain an interest of around 20%. Moving to capital. We ended the quarter at the top end of our 13% to 14% target range, with a CET1 capital ratio of 13.9%. This included 53 bps of capital generation from profits and a 12 bps benefit from the sale of German consumer finance, partially offset by the 28 bps impact of the \u00a31 billion share buyback announced at FY '24 results. RWA decreased around \u00a37 billion from Q4 to \u00a3351 billion, with FX accounting for circa \u00a33 billion of the move. The sale of the German consumer finance business reduced head office RWAs by \u00a33.3 billion, while Barclays UK and the UK Corporate Bank saw a combined RWA increase of \u00a30.8 billion. Investment bank RWAs were 56% of the overall group and broadly flat from Q4, excluding Essex, despite the higher income and usual Q1 seasonality. As usual, a word on our overall liquidity and funding on Slide 29. We have strong and diverse funding, including a 73% LDR and an NSFR of 136%, and we are highly liquid across currencies with an LCR of 175%. These measures reflect purposeful and prudent management of our balance sheet and risk, delivering resilience and capacity to support customers in a range of economic environments. TNAV per share increased \u00a30.15 in the quarter and \u00a30.37 year-on-year to \u00a30.372. Attributable profit added \u00a30.12 per share during Q1, and the unwind of the cash flow hedge reserve added \u00a30.04. We expect the majority of the cash flow hedge reserve to unwind by the end of 2026. This unwind, combined with earnings growth and buybacks, give us confidence that TNAV will continue to grow consistently, as it has done for the last seven quarters, and to a greater degree than current consensus expectations. So, to summarize, we are pleased with the strong performance of the bank in Q1, which sets us up well to deliver on all our 2025 guidance as we build towards our 2026 target. Over to you, Venkat, for concluding remarks."

        "text": "Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking questions and a good set of results today. I did want to focus on the area which, as you rightly said, gets quite a lot of attention, which is the U.S. consumer. And thanks for the extra disclosure. I was hoping you could help us think about the book and the strategy as we look forward. So firstly, on the impairment charge, I guess for the quarter, \u00a3399 million, the actual write-offs themselves were flattish and sort of in line with the last four quarters. You've taken the PMA and increased the coverage. So could you talk to the drivers of the increase in the reserve bill that goes above and beyond the PMA this quarter, perhaps? And in terms of the growth, as we look forward, the strategy is predicated on very much growth in the business. But I think a lot of people would understand you being a little bit more circumspect if delinquency trends looked like they were deteriorating. So my question really is sort of how wedded are you to growing the book meaningfully as planned and into higher margin, but slightly higher risk segments? And how easy would it be to pause that growth, if you like? Presumably you sort of still feel good in the long term outlook and don't want to exit partnerships. So trying to understand how you weigh up balancing that strategic outlook with the current uncertainty. Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Guy. Thank you for the question. So I will take the first one and then I'll pass the second one to Venkat. So as we look at our U.S. consumer business right now, we have given you additional disclosure. I'm glad that's helpful. That's on Page 38. And it's a bit more of a holistic view of what's going on in the U.S. market generally, but also in our book. But really what's happened in Q1 is as a BAU matter, you've got a slight seasonal elevation in the impairment charge. We normally see that in Q1 and it's just reflective of the high levels of consumer spend that we see in Q4 through the holiday season. Typically, what then happens is you start to see that reverse in Q2 and beyond. So far, very straightforward. In terms of the PMA, it's worth stepping back and thinking about what we consider when we book impairment. And we're looking at two things. The first is consumer behavior. And the second is what we expect to happen in the macroeconomic environment. On the first, in consumer behavior, we see no change. And you can see that clearly on the charts. Delinquencies are relatively low and stable. Actually, we see no change on the second. So U.S. economic consensus forecasts are actually relatively static and that they're very similar to where they were at the full year. But we think that's likely a timing issue. And therefore, it's reasonable for us to assume that they will change in the coming weeks and months. And therefore, we're trying to get ahead of that. So we're being thoughtful and methodical. So what we've done is essentially skew the downside bias in the impairment charge to accelerate a bit of coverage here. But just as we step back, the performance of the book itself is extremely robust. Venkat?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Yes. So I think I've said in the past, when I look at the book overall, there's about 20 corporate clients, 20 million underlying customers. And I look at the risk or we look at the risk of this portfolio in four dimensions. The first dimension is who is the partner and what business they are in and so on. The second is related to that, what's the industry? We've had a bias towards travel and we've been looking to diversify out of travel. We added GAAP, we added General Motors, and we chose not to renew Americans or our share of Americans. The third is the size and renewal rate. So we like to have a mix that is relatively smaller to our overall portfolio and not a lot of renewals coming in at the same time. And the last one is the actual underlying credit card, creditworthiness of the borrower. And through this combination, we like to create a business with a stable risk and high risk adjusted return. So when you take all of this together, we are continuing to want to grow this business. We do think the opportunities are great. Obviously, we will factor in the consumer environment when we do the actual risk selection of customers and look to get risk adjusted returns. And that risk selection is who do you open an account for and how do you manage credit lines. But we will continue to seek good partners that diversify our book and bring us opportunity."

Is there any headwinds capital that we should be considering as a result of implementing any relevant changes that are identified in that letter? And secondly, some of your peers have written to the government asking for a softening in the ring fencing regime. How material could a change in regulation be here for you? From the outside, it feels like you'd be one of the large beneficiaries of any change here. Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Ben, and good morning. Again, I'll take the first and then hand to Venkat for the second. So on SRT, the DCFO letter that we and others received recently did deal with SRT, but it was actually more focused on the financing of SRT. And to be really clear, we do not finance our own SRT programs. So we're not extending financing to investors who are then ongoing investors in our SRT. So we think that's the focus. From our perspective, we've run our Colonnade program since 2016. We share the details of each tranche of that with the regulator in order to get capital relief and we manage the reinvestment risk around that very, very carefully, as we've, you know, outlined before. So we're comfortable with our position and wouldn't envisage any capital consequences. Venkat?"

      {
        "speaker": "C.S. Venkatakrishnan",
        "text": "Yes, so on ring fencing, I think you know that of the major UK banks, we have been opposed to any change and relaxation in the ring fencing regime. So while I agree with what others say that there is friction in the system, there was obviously a high cost to set up the ring fence. Let's call it a sunk cost now. And there's a little bit of trapped capital and liquidity. And if you release that in the short term, it would be good for banks. And let's argue for some customers. But I think in the long term, it weakens the system because it weakens deposit protection. I think the ring fence is an extremely strong and secure form of deposit protection in the UK. And while it might be short term attractive, I think in the long term, it weakens the system and weakens the participants in the system. And that includes Barclays. That's why on balance, I do not think we should change the ring fence regime. And I'm a strong supporter of it in its current form."

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, please. First on RWA, how should we think about RWA developments into 2Qs, specifically thinking about market risk here, given the volatility? Obviously, 1Q was a somewhat unusual quarter where IB RWAs were down on a constant FX basis, didn't seem to demonstrate the usual seasonality. So any color you could give us on how to think about Q-on-Q RWA developments into 2Q for the IB would be helpful, please. And as I think out to sort of targets, the 2026 targets that you've given us previously, and the circa \u00a350 billion of RWA growth you expected by the end of 2026, obviously Basel 3 is being delayed, Card IRB transition, I guess, is probably going to be a '27 event. I know you've said it's sort of ambiguous, but that's not necessarily going to hit you. With the weaker dollar, I guess that's also going to reduce the RWA growth. How should we be thinking now about where you expect to land in 2026 for group RWAs relative to that previous \u00a350 billion growth expectation? I also just wanted to add one on the U.S. So thank you again for reconfirming the FX splits for group and IB income and costs. I think that's helpful for us in thinking about the weaker dollar. But in the event that the U.S. administration applied some Section 899 taxes to UK companies, for instance, due to digital service tax proposals, how would we be best thinking about the possible impact of that for Barclays? Would it simply be a case of taking the country by country disclosures you give us and multiplying that percentage of PBT by the relevant incremental tax top up? Or is there something more nuanced we need to do in terms of subsidiary financials and that sort of thing? Thank you."

      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Thank you, Chris. I think there were at least three questions there, so I will attempt to deal with them in order. So on the IB RWAs, we remain fairly clear that the business should operate within the third circa \u00a3200 billion of RWAs that we've allocated to it. And you can see us doing that very, very consistently actually since '23. So we were doing it for some time before we even did the investor update. This period is no different really. And you can see that nimbleness in RWA deployment in the first quarter. So if you look in the disclosures, you'll see that credit risk RWAs are down, market risk RWAs are up, and counterparty credit risk RWAs are up. So our intention is to manage it nimbly within the framework that we have given them. And sort of to your second part of the question, which is really around the RWA shape from here. The way we think about it, Chris, is that there is some uncertainty around the timing and the quantum of the regulatory impact. And we've given you our best view that may happen at the beginning of '27, as opposed to the end of '26. But we don't feel that it undermines the fundamental objective of the plan. And the fundamental objective of the plan is to hold our RWAs and the IB broadly flat, as I said, and to deploy RWA growth into our highest returning UK businesses. And that part of the plan, which is, if you like, is the most strategic part, remains intact. I think as the regulatory environment becomes clearer and those timings become clearer, we can give you sort of exact splits and impacts of that. And then on the final part of your question. So what would a U.S. tax change mean for Barclays? Well, there are obviously short term and long term differences. So in the short term, what we would see for a rise in U.S. tax rates, for example, would be an increase in deferred tax assets. So you'd see a short term boost to capital and then obviously you'd have a longer term drag from any higher rate. It's a bit too early to give you precise guidance. We're expecting an initial U.S. tax bill in Q2. And some of the discussion that's happened around higher rates for non-U.S. firms, I mean, clearly hasn't been confirmed or firmed up into any kind of regulation yet. And I just remind you that the IHC is actually a U.S. firm. BB PLC branch isn't. So there is some nuances. You're exactly right within this that we'd have to guide to nearer the time. So I think it's not quite as simple as looking at the country by country reporting, unfortunately. Okay, thank you. Perhaps we can go to the next question, please."

So just thinking about the 11% RoTE guidance for this year, which has remained the same. So just curious, is that to reflect perhaps a bit more uncertainty in the environment? Or is it just a case of just not changing it at this point? Or a bit more risk on that USCB part of the business? So number one, just curious why the 11% hasn't changed. As well. And then secondly, in terms of the hedge benefit beyond 2026, I think you're commenting, obviously, that it remains quite a strong tailwind. So just wanted to double check the kind of roll-off yield that you're anticipating, say, in 2027. We have about 2.5%. Just wanted to check whether it's in the right kind of ballpark or whether you think actually the roll-off yield is a bit lower or a bit higher than that? Thank you."

So we've got good operating leverage and we're pleased with that performance. But it's only the first quarter of the year. So all we've done is we've repeated our circa 11% guidance and I'm not signaling anything by repeating that guidance, whether that be in income costs or impairments. So I'm merely repeating it. On the second question around the hedge benefit, we have said today that we expect the hedge momentum to continue beyond 2026. Why have we said that? Well, if I take you back to deposits and the stability of deposits, what that means now is that we expect the hedge notion to be broadly stable from here. And that actually takes one of the variables off the table. So all we're doing now is we are comparing, if you like, the prevailing swap with the yield on the hedge, whether that be the average yield or indeed the maturing yield. We haven't given any disclosure on maturing yield beyond 2026. But I think if you do this simple math, which I know many of you have done, and just take our planning assumption of 3.5 and push that through the maturing elements of '25 and '26, you will find that the average hedge yield in 2027 is below 3.5% so that's really what we are signaling here and obviously as we get closer we'll talk a bit more about maturing yields but just a bit too far out for that. Hopefully that's helpful. Okay thank you. Can we go to the next question please?"

Then another one on the IP and general activity. Could you maybe give us a bit of color on how the investment bank has done during the quarter or maybe even April or by region? What I'm trying to get to is obviously Q1 is very good but if volatility comes down are we suddenly going to see a very quiet sort of performance and how much of the activity you think, how much visibility you have for the rest of the year? It's a difficult question but any hand holding or color would be much appreciated. Thank you."

        "text": "Alvaro, hi. I'll start with cards and we've covered a little bit of this but I'll go over it again and then Anna will talk about the investment bank. So on the U.S. cards portfolio, the growth is going to come in net receivables from three things. One is organic growth in our existing portfolio. The second is how we choose to flex the lever that we have used of risk transfers. We can do more or less and if we do less the receivables are up there on our book. And then the third thing is portfolio changes which is new accounts or accounts leaving. So on the first one which is organic growth we're fairly comfortable that we continue to see organic growth and we have a very high credit quality portfolio. We're looking to diversify it among certain sectors but it's a high credit quality portfolio. On the second one which is risk transfer there's always a question at the time of what capital benefit we get, what's the price at which we sell it and whether it suits our risk management. As you say given that we've chosen not to bid for our portion for a renewal of our portion of American all else equal we would want to keep things on our balance sheet. Third is acquisitions or the other disposals. We've renewed a bunch of our other accounts through 2024. I think we've mentioned that in our previous full year earnings. And then we continue to look in this environment even in this environment especially in this environment at good quality portfolios that we think rounds out our business. These things are very long term decisions. A typical portfolio takes two to three years to decide to bid and to come to you and then it's there with you for hopefully seven years. So these are long term decisions and I wouldn't let the short term stuff in the market affect that decision making. Anna?"

        "text": "Thanks Venkat. Alvara the only thing I'd add to that is that achieving the plan and the returns that we want in USCB is not just only volume either. We're working very hard on margins. We're working very hard on cost and digitization of the business and also the capital efficiency as Venkat said. So a plan of many parts. Let me talk about the IB sort of generally in the quarter and then I'll pass across to Venkat who might want to add at the end. If you think about what should have happened to our IB in the quarter given the volatility that we've seen, we should see strong markets revenues in the more subdued banking environment and that's exactly you know the shape of our results very much in line with the market more broadly. As I look at Q1 in particular we've been investing in this business for some time and investing to create a franchise that allows us to perform in a range of environments and you see that. So the FICC results very strong and I think that reflects our investment in securitized products. It reflects our investments in our rates businesses and equities is strong. Actually you'll recall there was a one-off last year but you know our equities position has been very much driven by the investments that we've made in equity derivatives. So we feel like we're facing the market with a much more complete franchise and of course our financing business adds stability and is probably less impacted by volatility but you can see good growth in there that's obviously also underpinning FICC and equities. I said we would have expected the IB to be a bit softer and of course or investment banking to be a bit softer in Q1 and of course it has been we feel that in line with the street and in fact we've seen share gains across advisory ECM DCM and for the complex overall albeit in a smaller market and I just remind you that that our planning assumption was for this market to be 10% down year on year and that's broadly what we see in Q1. All of this has been underpinned by us being a bit more nimble in RWAs in the IB as I've said but we're really focused all the way through the P&L and the performance of the IB so you see good cost control and you'll also see very, very good risk control. We've disclosed today for the first time consistently both our bar progression and indeed our lost days and you can see we're not taking outsized risk. I should have actually mentioned also a very good performance within the ICB, the International Corporate Bank within banking so financing and the ICB are both less sort of impacted by volatility. Venkat do you want to comment?"

We don't. We're about a month into it but again re-emphasize what Anna said on the market side. You know when there's volatility we aim to put our clients first and to do intermediation and risk management for our clients. That is what we strive to do and it can be profitable as long as you manage your own risks well which is what we strive to do and Anna gave you the data on the first quarter results of that. So that's what we strive to do every day and on banking activity you know people will wait for clarity until they resume. It could happen sooner than we think. But the overall business is pretty well diversified whether you look at the investment bank and you look at deposit growth in the International Corporate Bank, you look at the International Corporate Bank, you look at market or even the whole bank as a whole."

And then second, you mentioned the substantial increase in transaction banking deposits in the U.S. How has that trended post quarter end? So if companies are maybe building liquidity, delaying some investment spend, are you seeing that show up in your deposit volumes? Thank you."

        "text": "Okay, thanks. Thanks Chris. Thanks for the questions. I'll take the first one and then I'll hand across to Venkat. As I said, that was our assumption for banking and actually what we're seeing here is the diversification of income working really well across the bank both in terms of more than offset by markets activity and also the strength that we're seeing coming through in the UK and the UK complex more generally across deposits that's underpinned our upgrade today. So, you know, the revenue line appears to be very robust and we have confidence in it. That said, that does not undermine our focus on costs. You know, it's what we're doing every day. It's a key part of the strategy. You can see that all the way through the P&L today, income up by 11%, profits up by 19%. The plan is to create operating leverage, not just at the group, but across every single business within the group. Overall, I still expect what I expected at the year end, which is for incremental investment to underpin the longer term growth of the plan and investment -- I'm sorry, inflation to outweigh our gross efficiencies for the year and for us to see an uptick in costs. All of that is contained within the most important cost metric, which is cost income ratio at 61%. That is the number that we are most focused on. It's likely that we'll see some movement in absolute cost. I'm happy with consensus as it currently starts, but it is FX sensitive and it is performance and volume sensitive. And therefore, I'd really urge you to focus on the cost income ratio target that we've given. We feel like 57% in Q1 is a good down payment against that and should show you how focused we are on operating leverage. Venkat, transaction banking?"

        "text": "So, transaction banking has been an area of great emphasis for us in the last few years. We spoke about it last year, we've spoken about it at our year-end earnings. People choose us and the quantum of deposits is based on two factors. One is the growth in our overall transaction banking business or relationships generally, people's choice of us as a counterparty, which is increasing. And then ultimately, their needs for cash and their use of cash. In this period, we continue to see happily people choosing us as a counterparty newly, and that's good. And that's improving again. And then I think on cash, what you're seeing is growth in deposits, in part, what you would expect when people are being cautious on the deploying of cash for transactions. So, you're seeing deposit growth whether it's individuals or it's institutions. It's all what you would normally expect in this environment."

        "text": "Hello. Hi, Anna. So, just a couple of questions. One, just quickly touching on the U.S. card margin. So, obviously, that's been down. But you've talked about some of the drivers, some of the time lags between deposit pricing and asset pricing. And I know you've mentioned that the interest rate risk is already hedged. But I guess the market is pricing in faster and more rate cuts on the U.S. side for the rest of the year, maybe three or four rate cuts. So, if that were to happen, I guess, is it already in your planning assumption? And if that were to happen, would you still expect the meaningful progression during 2025, as you've just talked about? So, I guess that's number one. Number two, I guess, more broadly on the full year '26, greater than 12% returns target. So, consensus has just got to about 12% taken a year to get there. I guess the operating environment is arguably a little bit more challenging. Certainly, impairment looks like it is possible that it will go up given economic indicators coming down maybe a little bit. And I suppose in general, U.S. dollar weakening is probably not super helpful either. So, where do you see a gap between your planning assumption and where consensus is? Because you've reiterated guidance. So, presumably, that you see maybe some positive to where consensus is currently, notwithstanding maybe a little bit of worsening in credit quality and maybe some FX impact as well. So, just it would be helpful to understand where you think people might be too pessimistic."

      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay. Thank you, Perlie. So, let me deal with the U.S. cards margin first. We've given you our macroeconomic variable assumptions. I think they're on Slide 35. So, you can have a look at those. Obviously, we are expecting further downward pressure on Fed rates. You can see that from there. What I would just remind you, though, is that that matter is hedged. So, we've got floating rate assets. We've got largely fixed rate deposits. So, you can see that we would have a timing difference in a downward rate environment. We do hedge that interest rate risk. But the nature of those hedges is different from the ones that we have in the UK. And therefore, the accounting geography is different. So, you do see an income offset, but it manifests itself on non-interest income. So, if you look year on year, you're going to see non-interest income. So, I'm not concerned about the income overall, but you might see a bit of a split geography between the margin compression and the hedge benefit, which obviously you wouldn't see in the UK. And then, if I step back and look at FY '26, we've reiterated and reaffirmed our targets today. We feel like we've got momentum in the business and we are delivering our plan. What you should expect us to do is execute the operational plan and deliver the numbers with no surprises. And that's no different in the current environment than it is last year or the year before. So, we're 100% focused on that. We've clearly got good income growth that comes from the diversification of the business. There's clearly a bit of a weak spot in investment banking, but markets, as Venkat's been through, benefits from periods of volatility. And very importantly, we are seeing a strong underpin here from the upgrade of NII that we've given you, not just for BUK, but for the group as a whole. And that's coming from the strength of deposits in the UK. Our costs are well controlled. Again, you can see we're focused on operating leverage. And whilst there's more uncertainty in the impairment line, I would not see that uncertainty taking us out with the 50 to 60 basis point range that we've given you for loan loss rate. So, we are confident in the delivery of our circa 11 this year and also the targets that we've given you for next year. And that's the case for the financial targets and the distribution targets. Okay, perhaps we can go to the next question, please."

So, any reason why there might be episodic revenues in that or any additional seasonality compared to your peers?

And then the second question, just on mortgage balances in the UK, obviously you've been struggling to grow that for a while, but you've actually seen a very good result this quarter, about \u00a33 billion Q-on-Q. How sustainable do you think that is versus how much is that just a pull forward of activity in light of stamp duty changes? Thank you."

I mean, nothing much more than I would call out from before, just a strong performance across the board reflects our investment in the business, both in intermediation and in financing. You know, I've called out rates, I've called out securitized products. There are no one-offs in there. And so, you know, where we take remarks on lead-thin positions, they are not in FICC. They are on our corporate lending line. And we've called that out separately. So, I wouldn't call out any one-offs. So, it's a good performance. On mortgages, you know, the mortgage market was robust in Q1. As a market matter, approvals were up by 15%. Notably, within that, house purchases up by 20%. And that's not just house purchase, but first-time buyers as well. We think both of those two are really good lead indicators. Sorry, my voice is going. Let me take a drink of water. They're good indicators for the health of the mortgage market overall. If you step back, you've got rates that are broadly on the downward trend. You've got robust and stable house price inflation, and you've got real wage growth. So, there may be a bit of pull forward in Q1, but honestly, the market as a whole is performing well. Okay.

They're down about 9% year on year, and they're certainly annualizing at no more than about a \u00a31 billion, I guess, that's in the UK business. So, could you tell us a little bit about what's going on there and how we should expect that going forward? Is the sort of 250 like the run rate we should be thinking about, or is there something that was in there that means it might pick up as the rest of the year progresses? So, I guess that's my first question. The second question is just coming back to risk-weighted assets, because you talked about how IB was broadly performing as you might expect in terms of trends in the first quarter. I would agree with that completely, except for risk-weighted assets, which have always been up very strongly in the first quarter. With all the volatility, you would have expected them to be up even more, I guess, or I might have done. And yet, they were down and down, down quite, and I know there's an effect in there, but even if you strip all that out, I think they were flat to down. So, could you just tell us a little bit more about why that was, and is there potential to further reduce that going forward? And can I ask you, you might have told us this, so I apologize if I missed it, but I think you told us in one of the backslides, you said you've done \u00a357 billion, I think, of risk transfers at full year '24. Could you update us where we are on that? Is that where that number is now? Is some of this about increasing risk transfers, et cetera, and how that might progress? Thanks very much."

So, on UK non-NII, we've given you guidance previously for greater than to \u00a350 million. I'd just repeat that guidance. This number can be a bit lumpy. There is no story within the Q1 beyond the fact that Q1 can sometimes be a bit light just because of lower transactional activity, and honestly, there's nothing more in there to read into. So, I'd stick to the guidance of greater than 250. On RWAs, you're right, there's a bit of FX in there that's taking it downwards. We haven't elevated the SRT. We've said before that the Colonnade Program, which is the one that impacts the IB, is mature, and we do not expect to extend it. Venkat, do you want to comment on that?"

A couple of billion down does not mean we're tightening it up, right? There is natural client activity. There's volatility in that activity. There are positions that get taken off. There are positions that get added or don't get added. As you might imagine in this environment, you know, the marginal benefit of the marginal allocation is more in markets than in banking based on activity, and that's what you saw in the first quarter."

That said, why are we there? We're there because the strategy is working and we're seeing very good capital generation from the business. That is the strategy, and if we keep executing the strategy, as we keep executing the strategy, it's not inconceivable that we might go through the top end of that range.

        "text": "Hello, good morning, both. I've got a couple of questions. The first is a follow-up on Ed's question on capital. You came into this year at 13.6% equity Tier 1 ratio, 13.3% adjusting for the buyback. It does sound increasingly like you want to operate close to the 14% moving forwards. Can I just confirm that that is how we should be thinking about it? I'm just wondering whether there's an element of this relating to the fact that UK RWA growth, your target for end of next year, looks increasingly stretching and maybe, you know, you're thinking about some sort of inorganic bolt-on, which obviously would consume some capital in a one-off sense there. So that's the first question. The second question is on sensitivity again, particularly in the U.S. card book. If I look at your full year downside scenarios, even on downside two, which has got GDP falling over one percentage point this year and next year, unemployment moving to above 7%, the models are telling you that your required stage 1 and 2 ECL build would only be about \u00a3177 million, which feels very low given that set of macroeconomic assumptions. I mean, I guess the models are, you know, telling us what the models are telling us, but how robust do you think the models are? I guess in the COVID, IFRS 9 was quite news, a bit wet behind the ears. We're seven to eight years in now and this obviously applies across the group as well because the sensitivity to downside one and two scenarios is very limited given the severity of those. So comment on that would be useful. Thanks."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Anna Cross",
        "text": "Okay, thanks Jonathan. Okay, so let me start with capital. Venkat may want to comment on this also. You're right, we're generating a lot of capital, but as I said previously, that is an outcome of the plan and it is intentional, it is deliberate and it's what you should expect going forward. We did indicate at the full year that you should expect us to operate towards the top half and, you know, I'll just reiterate that as our formal guidance, but just reflecting on the fact that we are generating a lot of capital. Just on the utilization of that capital, you know, we're very focused on deploying \u00a330 billion in the UK, that plan is intact. As I look at where we are now, we've deployed \u00a314 billion of that, recognizing, of course, that a large part of that has come from Tesco, but you can see good loan growth in the quarter, both from the UK and from the UK corporate bank. If I look at the specifics of lending, you know, the consumer preference at the moment is for secured versus unsecured lending. That's very clear, that's okay, and then as I look at the lending as it's developing in the corporate bank and private banking and wealth management, actually it's very high quality and that's reflective of our portfolios. So, key one, you know, if I look at that in isolation, the lending's happening, maybe the RWA waiting is a little light, but over the period of the plan, that plan is intact and I particularly point you to the momentum that we've got both around mortgages and cars on the leading indicators on slide 15. We're going through that J-curve in cards, you're going to see interest earning lending and RWAs growing cards from the back end of '25 with all of that maturing through. Venkat, do you want to comment more on RWAs?"

They essentially say what happens if I take my current static balance sheet and I push through a different set of macroeconomic variables. What it doesn't take into account is clearly the kind of stage migration that you would see into Stage 3. It doesn't take into account any, you know, increases of exposure at default, so the fact that customers may draw down as they become more financially pressed. But also, the other thing that it doesn't take into account is credit actions that we might take in order to manage that position. So I wouldn't think of it as a scenario. I would think of it as a sensitivity, and it's quite, you know, it's quite a straightforward sensitivity. I don't think it's intended to be predictive. The same is true of the PMA that we've taken.

I think you kind of touched on this a little bit, Anna, in your last answer, but the Barclay card Consumer UK revenue line doesn't really seem to have made a great deal of progress over the last 12 months, despite the kind of the big pickup in card acquisition numbers. Is that just a kind of lead lag effect? Does it kind of take 12 months for the revenues to come through? Or is there some other kind of trend in there when you might expect to see kind of proper revenue growth in that line? And then the second question is more of clarification. I think slide 8 talks about a 90% reinvestment rate on the structural hedge. But I think you mentioned earlier that you expect the structural hedge to be stable. Is that 90% unstable? Is that just kind of a very broad definition of stable? Or how should we read that?"

So all you are seeing here really is a production line of those cards acquisitions, then maturing into interest earning lending. Actually, if you think about the structure of the market, it tends to be slightly longer dated than 12 months. So you're going to see some pickup in interest earning lending towards the back end of 2025. But the bulk of this is actually going to be in 2026. So it is a lead lag effect, as you suggest. And then on the second question, we've given you a planning assumption of circa 90%. But you can see, given where deposits have been in the first quarter that the notion has been stable. And we would expect it to be broadly stable. But just for your planning math, that's why we've said circa 90%. Nothing more to read into it than that. Okay, so I think that brings us to the end of questions for today. And I'd like to thank you for those questions. Thank you for your continued interest in Barclays in what I know is a very busy day.
