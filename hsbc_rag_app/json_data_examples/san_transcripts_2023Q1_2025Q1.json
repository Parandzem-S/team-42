    "transcript": "Operator:\nBegona Morenes: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Hector Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. Jose Garcia-Cantera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] With this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi. Hector, the floor is yours.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Begona. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me just share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results within the context of the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day. Jose will review our financial performance in greater detail. And finally, I will conclude with final remarks. Before we start, let me briefly remark that during the first quarter the financial system has experienced situations, we've confirmed that our strategy and unique business model are key factors that allow us to deliver solid and resilient results, even in times of market volatility as we have demonstrated today through our first quarter performance. As we announced at the Investor Day, we have entered a new phase of shareholder value creation. We are focused on maximizing value creation, aiming for the first time ever to deliver double-digit growth in tangible net asset value per share plus dividend per share with solid capital generation and efficient capital allocation that will allow us to improve our profitability and provide more returns to our shareholders. And we will achieve it, thanks to, first, our unique combination of local leadership and our global scale network that very few others can replicate. Our business model based on customer focus, scale and diversification, which provide us growth, cost and profitability, competitive advantages, which is underpinned by an ambitious transformation plan that is already making Santander a digital bank with branches. Today, we delivered a solid Q1 with great progress in all our strategic objectives. TNAVps plus DPS improved 5% in the quarter. A strong capital generation increased our fully loaded CET1 ratio to 12.2%, and disciplined capital allocation improved the percentage of RWAs that create value and return on tangible equity reached an extraordinary 14.4%. In a difficult environment, we are growing customers and volumes. The deposits increased 6% year-on-year, which drove a double-digit revenue increase with good cost control. At the same time, we have maintained very solid liquidity ratios as a result of our conservative financial management strategy and a credit quality that remains stable with cost of risk well below our target in line with the medium low risk profile of our business. These trends resulted in a profit of \u20ac2.6 billion, the highest in the last five quarters, while profitability improved and we also delivered strong capital generation. All in all, we are on track to reach our 2022 targets. I will provide more details later. Moving on to the income statement. Firstly, as we usually do, we present growth rates both in euros and constant euros. There was no material difference this quarter. Secondly, in January, we recorded a \u20ac224 million charge related to extraordinary banking tax on revenue in Spain, \u20ac202 million accounted in Spain and \u20ac22 million in DCB. Excluding this impact, profit rose 10% compared to the same quarter last year, 8% in constant euros. Additionally, we have positive and negative one-off impacts in Brazil, which do not affect profit. To better explain the business trends, they have been netted in the underlying P&L. Jose will go in more detail on this, please. And thirdly, the most notable movements in the quarter were, strong top line performance supported by NII and higher fees, supported by global and network businesses; cost, have started the year in line with expectations, growing one point below inflation. We demonstrated the sustainability of our results with double-digit growth in net operating income, which was to \u20ac8 billion. From a credit quality perspective, loan loss provisions continue to normalize. Jose will go into more detail on all these points later. This is a great start of the year. Good business dynamics that are translating into double-digit revenue growth with income increasing year-on-year across our regions and global businesses. We are implementing our One Transformation project, which is helping us improve the efficiency ratio to within the range of 44% to 45% that we established for 2023 and which makes us one of the most efficient global banks in the world. Our cost of risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below 1.2% at the end of the year. Our RoTE grew quarter-on-quarter to 14.4%, 15.3% if we do not analyze extraordinary banking tax in line to reach our year-end target. And we generated capital equivalent to 17 basis points after having completed the second share buyback program to reach a fully loaded CET1 ratio of 12.2%. In summary, very positive trends, which we expect to consolidate in the coming quarters as we progress towards the 2022 financial targets that we provided during our 2022 annual results presentation. As we announced at our Investor Day in February, we are building a digital bank with branches that makes our customers' lives easier with processes and products that are simpler and more attractive to them. This, together with our global network, are helping us to improve the levels of our activity, revenues and costs. This approach, combined with a disciplined capital allocation are the cornerstone of our value creation model. Now I will dedicate some time to explain how we're progressing. Our customer focus is driving volume and revenue growth across the group. We are progressing well in the initiatives. That will help us to improve the way we serve our customers, and let me explain some of the most relevant ones. We're also taking advantage of our network effect to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model that is growing at very high rates. Multi-Latinas and multi-Europeans are increasing revenue 53% and 72% year-on-year, respectively. We're also moving fast in the construction of our branch of the future to offer a best-in-class omnichannel experience across all the group. A good example of this is significant advances made in the digital onboarding processes in Mexico. We have a program that aims to better serve our customers through the use of data, which targets 80% of our customer base. It would help us to personalize our product offering, improve interaction with our customers and provide them with the best user experience. We have developed a common mobile app across Europe as a tactical solution while we implement the common front across all the group, which is already live in Spain, Portugal and Poland and will be also released in the U.K. in the end of 2023. Customer reception has been strong as demonstrated in Portugal, where we have improved for number five to number two by customer satisfaction that is NPS through the mobile channel since the app was released. Our efforts to become a fully customer-centric bank are allowing us to grow the number of customers, loans, deposits and transactions per active customer at a very significant pace as shown on the right side of the slide. But customer focus is not enough. Simplification and automation are also needed, and we are making a good progress in simplifying our product offering and fully automating our front and back-end operations. This is reflected in our leading position in efficiency and significant growth of 10% in net operating income per customer year-on-year. As we have discussed, one transformation is improving our local bank operations. We are bringing our 160 million customers onto a common operating and business model while converging into a common technology. We are simplifying our product offering to improve our customer experience and reduce the cost. We also have already simplified our product catalog by 42% since we started the project two years ago. We are reducing also administrative and operational task in branches. We aim to optimize around 80% to 90% of the overall customer-related processes, and we are progressing well. Spain, for example, has already optimized 40% of the processes in scope for 2023 and is expected to provide significant improvements. We are leveraging our global technology capabilities to accelerate digital transformation in Europe to make our processes fully digital end-to-end. Finally, we are migrating our core banking system to the cloud, a project, which we call Gravity, making it more efficient, modern and scalable. This should result in the annual efficiencies of around \u20ac150 million up on full implementation with a 67% return on investment and a payback of three years. Overall progress at the group is at 30%. Once we have completed Gravity in Santander U.K. for a corporate platform migrations in CIB and Chile are expected to be concluded before the end of '23. These are just a few examples of our ambitious transformation program that will bring Santander's operations to the next level. Moving to our Global and Network businesses. The revenue is growing above the group average and already represents 39% of the group's total revenue. Several actions and initiatives to drive revenue growth are already in full swing. CIB is still growing strongly after record highs in 2022. We are strengthening the centers of expertise with value-added products and services, developing global and regional platforms, focusing on our areas of strength, such as energy, transition, infrastructure or projects trade finance, among others. In the U.S., we are reinforcing CIB coverage teams, strengthening product capabilities and fully leveraging the integration of APS to expand our ability to distribute risk assets. Wealth Management and Insurance revenue grew 43% year-on-year. We are working to maintain the positive trends by scaling up alternative and institutional products and promoting collaboration between Wealth Management and CIB, offering private banking and asset management products and services for CIB clients and vice versa. In PagoNxt, which is also growing strongly, we have progressed with the migration of Santander Payments in Spain to our Payments Hub platform and already manages a significant part of the payments in Europe. Merchant acquiring expanded its innovative value-added services, which is reflected in 27% year-on-year growth in total payment volumes. Auto revenue fell affected by new lending and the performance of our leasing business in, SCUSA as well as the negative sensitivity to interest rates. We have recently announced an agreement with Stellantis in Europe to become its key financing partner. We expect to increase the outstanding portfolio by 30% to \u20ac40 billion by 2026. At the same time, we continue to leverage relationships with OEMs, importers and mobility providers to grow our businesses in North and South America. We further strengthened our balance sheet and capital position. Our overall risk profile remains medium low and is proving to be predictable based on our diversification. Cost of risk stood at 1.05%. Provisions continue to normalize year-on-year as expected. LLPs performed well in the quarter as provision dropped 3%, mainly driven by South America and North America. At the same time, we delivered strong capital generation. Our CET1 ratio reached 12.2% after having absorbed the full impacts from the second share buyback program and the extraordinary banking tax in Spain. Jose will provide more details in a moment. We will continue to leverage our transformation plan to deliver increased profitability and shareholder value creation on profitability. As I mentioned earlier, our RoTE closed at 14.4%, up 100 basis points in the quarter. If we do not analyze extraordinary banking tax in Spain, RoTE would have been around 15.3%. Earnings per share grew to \u20ac0.15, 11% higher than the 2022 quarterly average, supported by strong profit growth and lower number of shares following the buyback programs. Additionally, in the quarter, we delivered 5% growth in shareholder value creation as a result of our disciplined capital allocation and share buybacks. At current share prices, buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. We completed last Friday, the second 2022 share buyback program having repurchased around 7% of our outstanding shares in the last two years, which provides a return on investment of approximately 21% to our shareholders. These results demonstrate that Santander has a strong model and risk management capabilities that work very well even in the toughest environment. Jose will go now into more detail on the group's performance in 2023. Please, Jose?\nJose Garcia-Cantera: Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. Following our CEO's presentation, I will go into more detail on the group's P&L, risk profile and capital performance. Starting with the income statement, I will explain the account line by line in the following slides, but let me make a few initial comments. As it has been mentioned, we had some one-off results in the quarter related to the reversal of tax liabilities in Brazil for \u20ac261 million to \u20ac111 million in NII and \u20ac50 million in tax recovery and two provisions made to strengthen the balance sheet totaling \u20ac474 million, which net of taxes is \u20ac261 million. So these movements had no impact on profit, and we have decided to net them in the lines of the underlying P&L and ratios to facilitate comparisons with previous quarters and to better understand the underlying business dynamics to frame them against the year-end guidelines we gave at the Investor Day. Additionally, the P&L includes the extraordinary banking tax in Spain, which did have an impact on attributable profit. On the right-hand side, you can see the upward trend in profit quarter-on-quarter, 23% if we exclude the banking tax, which was driven by top line growth. Going into detail on the main lines and starting with the quarterly trends in cost in euros, we maintain our strong revenue improvement. In the first quarter, revenue was 3% higher than in the fourth quarter of '22, \u20ac1.5 billion higher than in the first quarter of '22, boosted particularly by NII, which increased \u20ac1.2 billion, but also by fees almost \u20ac300 million more. We have a balance sheet with very positive sensitivity to interest rates, mainly in Europe, which coupled with healthy volume growth and active margin management, led to a strong NII improvement in the last few quarters. Therefore, in the first quarter '23 was a solid quarter despite lower day count and seasonal factors in the Americas. We had good fee income growth supported by value-added products and the network effect. Trading gains, a small portion of our total revenue rose driven by customer base CIB transactions. And here is important to take into account that 97% of our CIB revenue is customer-driven. And finally, other income increase as the fourth quarter was affected by the deposit guarantee fund contribution. Group NII rose 14% year-on-year, supported by volumes, interest rate increases and margin management as I just said. In terms of volumes, loans were up year-on-year with double-digit growth in DCB and South America. North America rose 6%, and Europe was stable with falls in Spain and Portugal, mainly driven by prepayments of mortgages to individuals. Overall, loans grew 3% backed by consumer and mortgages. Likewise, deposits increased 6% with Europe growing 4%, and South America, North America and DCB growing around 10%. I will go into more detail on our loan and deposit structure later. Interest rate hikes mainly benefited Europe, Mexico and the Corporate Center. The latter driven by higher liquidity buffer remuneration. On the other hand, Brazil was impacted by a change in mix towards lower risk products and Chile and DCB were affected by their negative sensitivity to interest rates. Group net interest margin improved from 2.45% to 2.63% as we continued to actively manage our margins. We are very disciplined managing the cost of deposits and the repricing of loans. After the market movements at the beginning of the year, our deposit betas are on track with the numbers provided at Investor Day. So we expect this positive NII performance to continue in 2023. Turning to net fee income. It rose 7% year-on-year, reaching more than \u20ac3 billion, which is explained by more customers and more transactionality with them in retail banking. CIB, which stood out with a 16% growth in all regions, but especially in Europe, very positive trends in PagoNxt and cards. And in Wealth Management and Insurance, we had a good performance in private banking and insurance and volumes in Asset Management recovered in the first quarter with a net new money of \u20ac1.7 billion. Finally, in auto, volumes growth across the board continue. However, fee income in Europe was affected by the new insurance regulation in Germany. The evolution of fees reflects the improvements we make to our model to be more capital light. Moving on to costs. The first thing to highlight is that despite inflationary pressures, cost continued to increase below the rate of inflation. This was the case mainly in Europe, where costs in Spain, the U.K. and Portugal, well around 3% to 4% in real terms as salaries in Poland and Latin America tend to be more directly linked to changes in inflation. Our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 44.1%, having improved both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Outstanding performance in Europe, improving its efficiency ratio by 6 percentage points year-on-year. We will continue to deliver on our cost and efficiency targets and as we expect to further reduce our cost per customer, and as a result, continue to improve the net operating income per customer as Hector just explained. Credit quality remains robust and the cost of risk is well under control. Loan loss provisions grew year-on-year driving the cost of risk to converge towards -- through-the-cycle average as expected. The main changes by countries were the following, improvement in the cost of risk in Spain and Mexico, credit normalization in the U.S. from the very low levels we saw in 2021 and in 2022, but the behavior in the first quarter was much better than we thought. Poland increased its loan loss provisions impacted by higher Swiss franc mortgage provisions. And finally, in Brazil, we had higher loan loss provisions year-on-year on the back of individual consumer lending as well as overall portfolio growth. On a quarterly basis, loan loss provisions fell and the 3-month cost of risk in the quarter was 4.4%. This performance was supported by the high quality of our portfolio. The nonperforming loan ratio continued to improve, falling to 3.05% from 3.26% in March 2022. The main improvements came in Spain and DCB in part due to portfolio sales in the period and as well as Mexico. The portfolio distribution by stages remained stable. On the right-hand side, there is a brief overview of our loan portfolio structure. Around 80% of loans are mostly concentrated in mature markets. And if we look at the segments, our mortgages have low average loan to values. The consumer lending portfolio is well collateralized short term and has high returns, and the SME and corporate portfolio is well covered as well as over 50% has guarantees. Finally, a high weight of our corporate investment banking portfolio is investment grade. Finally, let me comment briefly on our exposure to commercial real estate, which is controlled and diversified across countries. Our exposure to CRE is 6% of total group's drawn uncommitted exposure. This is concentrated in the U.S., the U.K. and Spain, accounting for 75% of the total. Over half corresponds to social housing in the U.K. and multifamily in the U.S. The NPL ratio is 1.6% below the group's total NPL ratio. In the U.S., we have a total of \u20ac21 billion of total drawn and committed exposure with an average loan-to-value of between 50% to 60%. Office CRE is just \u20ac2 billion and it has an occupancy rate of 92% compared with around 80% for the sector as a whole. Let me also go into more detail in Brazil and the U.S., two countries that have raised some questions in the past quarters. In Brazil, the Brazilian economy has been performing well in recent years and interest rate hikes were implemented promptly and decisively to contain inflation growth in early stages. This environment accelerated the credit cycle and increased cost of risk in 2022. From now on, we expect interest rates to remain stable and probably start to come down after the summer. Additionally, during the last few years, we have been working on improving our portfolio mix in order to structurally reduce our cost of risk. We have enhanced our customer profile, the weight of new vintages with the best ratings has increased. We have been more selective in new business to increase our exposure to lower-risk secured portfolios like mortgages, agro or payroll. All in all, given our risk management, the enhanced portfolio mix and new lending profile, we expect to remain on target. Excluding one-offs in 2023, cost of risk should remain stable compared to 2022. Regarding the U.S., despite the bumpy start of the year in the country, the messages we gave at Investor Day have not changed. We expect normalization of the cost of risk to continue throughout 2023, but remain below pre-pandemic levels. We actually had a better start of the year than initially anticipated in terms of credit quality, which was supported by a stable used car prices and better late-stage delinquency payments. Our focus in auto at the moment is on quality and profitability over volumes. Moreover, we were able to further increase the share of auto loans funded by deposits. We have demonstrated that our conservative structural risk management and solid liquidity place us in a very strong position to face very challenging scenarios. At the end of the quarter, our liquidity buffer comprising high-quality liquid assets exceeded \u20ac300 billion, 97% of which were Level 1 assets. Two-thirds of this liquidity buffer is in cash, which is equivalent to 20% of our deposit base. Our liquidity is strong and stable with ratios well above regulatory requirements. The group LCR remained in line with year-end at 152% and the NSFR around 120%. The ALCO portfolio represents 6% of total assets, which is below industry average. The duration of the available-for-sale portfolio is very low and the current mark-to-market of the whole held to collect portfolio would have an impact equivalent to only 2% of our fully loaded CET1 capital. This demonstrates that impact from the change of the value of bond portfolio and capital would be very limited even in a very adverse scenario. Customer deposits are our primary source of funding and are mainly based on sticky retail deposits in our core markets. This diversified and stable funding structure supported year-on-year growth as deposits rose with positive performances across almost all countries and segments. The quarter-on-quarter decline in deposit balances is explained by the seasonal drop in CIB clients deposits, while retail remained stable in the quarter. Some customers using savings to prepay mortgages given the rising interest rates in Europe. And we have seen some flows from current accounts, time deposits and mutual funds. We have not seen any unusual deposit movements in recent weeks following the troubles of banks in the U.S. and Europe. In fact, we actually saw net inflows in the group in deposits in February and March of over \u20ac2 billion. Regarding capital, we ended the quarter at 12.2%. Let me give you some color about the variations in the quarter. 24 basis points of organic growth, which was basically driven by the strong profit generation in the quarter partially offset by risk-weighted asset growth. This includes a negative 4 basis point impact due to the extraordinary banking tax in Spain. 25 basis points drop from shareholder remuneration, which includes the total impact of the second 2022 share buyback program, 15 basis points and the accrual of the cash dividend 10 basis points for the first quarter, taking into account a 50% payout. 11 basis points were related to the update of the regulatory framework mainly following the EBA's clarification of its interpretation of CET1 minority interest calculation. And finally, a positive 7 basis points from markets, basically available for sale. So we have increased our fully loaded capital ratio while delivering on our capital productivity targets. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, improved front book RoRWA to 2.8% continued asset rotation and increase the percentage of risk-weighted assets, which deliver returns above the cost of equity. All in all, a disciplined capital allocation, which combined with our model, gives us confidence in the sustainability of our commitment to remuneration to our shareholders. Now I will hand it back to our CEO for the conclusions. Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Jose. To conclude the presentation and open the Q&A, I will briefly outline some final remarks that our vision for the coming quarters. Growth in customer volumes, robust revenue performance, double-digit NII growth, driven by positive sensitivity to rising rates in most countries and customer margin management. Fee income grew at high single digits, driven by our CIB payments and payment businesses. We expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters, mainly in Europe and Mexico. We are implementing our One Transformation plan. Our aim is to serve our customers more efficiently and foster process automation and simplification supporting our efficiency improvements. We will accelerate One Transformation further in the coming quarters. We have already identified business opportunities across the group, which will enable us to maintain strong global network businesses revenue. Finally, we have a solid balance sheet in terms of liquidity, solvency and risk profile. We will remain focused on maintaining a medium, low-risk profile and on capital efficiency and asset rotation to ensure a solid capital ratio. So as we embark on our new strategy phase, all these plans should increase revenue and improve the efficiency and profitability of our banks with the overall aim of supporting shareholder value creation and sustainability in profitability. As previously explained, our outstanding results in the first quarter puts us in an excellent position to meet our '23 financial targets. However, we may meet them in a slightly different way than initially anticipated, depending on the evolution of the macro environment. We are convinced that we are going to achieve our 15% RoTE target, but probably through a higher contribution from Europe and Mexico and a potential lower contribution from the U.S. Finally, we're also optimistic regarding our medium-term targets that we announced at the Investor Day. As I told our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, these targets are specific, ambitious and achievable. We have the vision of where we want to go and the right strategy to get there, and we have the best team in place to put it in motion. So I am convinced that we will progress quarter by quarter to achieve our targets. Thank you very much.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Jose and Hector. We can start the Q&A session now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We already have the first question from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Ulargui: Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. I just have two questions. The first one is on the outlook at group level for NII and fees. If I just look to 1Q, you have made the guidance provided by the bank in Investor Day and for 2023 of double-digit revenue growth. But as the year goes by, I think that, that target gets challenged a bit. So I wanted just to get a bit of your thoughts on what should we -- particularly on NII, what should see the acceleration coming? And based on the comments that you made at the end Hector, a bit of what would be the outlook for the U.S. NII after the performance of the first quarter. The second one is on cost of risk. I have seen a decline in NPLs in Brazil. Just wanted to be -- to get a bit of your thoughts about how should we expect cost of risk evolving from here in Brazil and whether we have seen a beginning in NPL or it's just a seasonal effect? Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Okay, Ignacio, thank you very much for your question. Okay. First of all, as I basically discussed, it's quite important to understand that we will achieve what the numbers that we said at the Investor Day and also our guidance, given that with the combination that the group is giving you, okay? So as I basically said, we're going to be a little lower in Brazil and the U.S., and we will be much better in Europe and in Mexico, okay? So it's quite important to understand exactly the combination and the work we're managing the group to get to the levels that we want, okay? So Europe is the one that is going to give us the strongest performance for the full 2023, okay? Mexico should be up -- what we call low double digit, okay? And we expect also, as I said, weaker performance in LatAm with the exception of Mexico, the U.S. and DCB. The U.S. is down mid-single digits. DCB will be low single-digit decline, and Brazil is basically mid-single-digit growth back ended, and we expect improvements towards the second half of the -- and towards the end of the year, okay? On the cost of risk, I will have Jose basically give you some ideas.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: Yes. So if I may complement the NII. In Europe, we have not seen the full repricing of our portfolio, obviously because, as you know, mortgages reprice every 12 months. So we still have a long way to go in the repricing of mortgages in Spain. Again, they are 12-month, Euribor based. And in Portugal is 6-month Euribor based. So we still have, again, way to go to reflect the full impact of the repricing or the rebasing of our portfolio in Europe. In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, as I said during my presentation, we expect cost of risk to remain fairly flat in 2023 relative to 2022, excluding the one-offs. The cost of risk in the first quarter was 4.4%. The \u20ac474 million provision that we took in Brazil in the first quarter to strengthen the balance sheet was used more or less one-fourth for one-off cases for specific cases and the rest it was just to strengthen our balance sheet. So in that sense, the 4.4% of the quarter is clean. It excludes one-off cases and it reflects the true asset quality evolution of the quarter. So for the rest of the year, as the interest rates are expected to remain high, we expect a better performance of our individuals portfolios because these are very short term. And obviously, they -- most of them have matured already, and we have been adding high-quality new vintages, but we might expect some more challenging evolution in the corporate sector. So again, all in all, excluding one-offs, more or less flat year-on-year.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Jose and Hector. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.\nFrancisco Riquel: Yes, hello. So I wanted to ask about following the recent turmoil in the sector. I wonder if you as a management have changed anything within the group in terms of liquidity and interest rate risk and/or if you expect any regulatory changes in this front in general? And more specifically, I wonder if you can elaborate a bit more the fall in deposits during the quarter. You mentioned seasonality in CIB, so do you expect to recover those deposits in the coming quarters? And also, if you can update your guidance in terms of deposit betas by the end of '23. You were previously guiding for 25, 30 in Spain, 40-50 in the U.K., 50 -- above 50 in the U.S. And just last question in terms of the ALCO portfolio in Spain, if you have changed your plans. You were aiming for \u20ac16 billion on average in '23 in terms of size, you're already above? I have seen in the slide, so you can also update on this. Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Francisco. I mean, first of all, let me tell you, I mean, given the turmoil and everything, I mean, the group is actually responding quite well, okay? We have seen all the levels in deposits basically maintain themselves. Individuals probably is the most important part in which 80% to 85% of our deposits are basically individuals, families, et cetera, which are basically very solid and very stable, okay? In that regard, also, I mean, with all these times, you always be prudent about how you manage things. But I can tell you that our units are performing really well in that sense, okay? In terms of the deposits, it's always cyclical. The decrease in deposits was mainly in CIB as we described. It was actually not very meaningful to the total size of the portfolio, and we expect basically to get them back and is the normal flow of the business, okay? In terms of the betas, I will have Jose give you a little bit of detail on that.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: So back when -- in the first quarter, we had a drop of around \u20ac21 billion in CIB deposits in Europe. But that was seasonal. If you look at the fourth quarter, we had quite a strong increase, but again, this happens every quarter. This quarter was a bit more -- a bit higher than in previous quarters because we also grew a lot in deposits with our customers in Europe in the fourth quarter. So associated basically with year-end balance sheet performance. So this is not recurring and this is seasonal and -- but again, it doesn't really affect the structure of our deposits. We always try to take advantage of the opportunities. We had an opportunity in the fourth quarter, took advantage of that, is normalizing a bit in the first quarter of the year, but I would expect the seasonal behavior to happen every year. Betas. Where are we? So let me tell you where we are. In Spain, we have a -- in retail banking, beta today is 6%. Yield, average yield is 22 basis points. In CIB, in Spain, European branches and global CIB, betas are between 80% to 100%. So in Spain, if you look at the whole of Spanish balance sheet, the cost is 80 basis points with EBITDA of 25%. And this is -- we guided for the year to between 25% to 30%, still this will hold because, again, most of the CIB business has already repriced and we expect a slow increase in the repricing of retail banking, so still within the 25% to 30% for the year. U.S. beta is 35% at a cost of 1.67. Betas were a bit higher in the first quarter, not significantly higher and very much in line with the average of the system. In the U.K., beta is 25%. And in the first quarter, betas were 30% to 35%, we guided to around 50% for the year. So if we look at our interest rate sensitivity relative to the figures we gave at Investor Day, very much in line with Europe, and the U.S. and probably a better outlook in the U.K. Finally, ALCO. Yes, we expected more or less 16% -- sorry, \u20ac16 billion average in Spain. We are already there. We might be above -- a little bit above that, but it basically depends on the opportunities we see to gradually increase the size of the portfolio. Remember that we are very, very far from a neutral ALCO portfolio. We have a negative balance sheet, which is what we want to have. We gradually want to close that negative sensitivity. So actually buying an ALCO portfolio or rebuilding an ALCO portfolio in Spain is not just a matter of 2023, it's probably also a matter of '24 and even 2025. So again, we will react to what we see are the market opportunities.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Hector and Jose, thank you, Paco for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank. Please go ahead.\nCarlos Peixoto: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my call - the question, sorry. So first question was actually -- I'm sorry, for a bit of a recap on previous ones, but I was just wondering if you could give us again the outlook for NII in both Brazil and in the U.S. and also so wondering if you could confirm, just make sure I understood correctly, you have that there is a \u20ac210 million one-off positive effect in Brazil and NII in the quarter? And the second question would be actually on fees and basically, the discussion that we have seen at the European level regarding fees namely potential raised. And I was wondering if you have -- if you can give us some visibility around the potential amount of fees that could be impacted if there were to be an investment bank being introduced at the European level. Thank you very much.\nBegona Morenes: Hi, Carlos, Begona here. Sorry to do this to you, but you need to repeat all of your questions. The line was terrible. We couldn't understand a word here. So can you start again maybe slightly slower and see if it goes better?\nCarlos Peixoto: So trying again, hopefully, you'll hear me better. So as I was saying, on NII, the question was really on the outlook for the U.S. and Brazil, if you could recap it. And also, I was asking to confirm whether there was \u20ac210 million positive one-off in the Brazilian NII, just to make sure that I got that number right. And then the second question was on potential inducement bans in Europe. What type of impact would such ban would have in fee income for Santander.\nHector Grisi: Okay. I mean, to give you exactly how do we see the NII okay, is exactly the guidance that we give is \u20ac211 million, okay? So Brazil is mid-single-digit growth, okay? We're talking 8.9 and then the U.S. is 6.1, is down mid-single digits, okay? That's exactly the number.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Carlos, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Sofie Peterzens for JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSofie Peterzens: Hi, here is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my questions. I know there has been a lot of questions already on net interest income. But could you kind of give a little bit more details around when you expect net interest income to peak in your core European markets? NII was slightly down in the U.K. Do you think we have seen peak NII and net interest income will kind of -- on a quarterly basis don't improve further? And when do you expect net interest income on a quarterly basis to peak in Spain? And when do you expect it to be in Portugal? And my second question would be around the cost of deposits in Mexico, they increased almost 1% quarter-on-quarter. Could you just detail what drove this increase in cost of deposits in Mexico? And then my final question would be on core equity Tier 1. You saw 11 basis points of regulatory capital tailwinds in the first quarter. How should we think about any further tailwinds or headwinds on the capital side to come? And could you kind of give details on the magnitude of any potential headwinds or tailwinds to come? Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Sofie. Okay, really quick. I mean, as Jose was explaining to you, in terms of NII, what we see in Europe, we're still not where I believe we're going to be. I mean, mostly, the majority of the portfolio will reprice in probably April and May, okay? So the portfolio is still repricing and we're going to see those impacts mainly in Spain exactly at that time probably to the mid through the cycle of the year and towards the end. It also is going to depend on what's happening with the deposit impact and how the market is basically going to react towards that. So in that sense, we'll see that. In the U.K., we're basically seeing things stable, okay? We basically see that we're still basically building up the way the portfolio has been going and also Portugal, we expect also to continue better towards the end of the year, okay? Also, the terms of what you were talking about growth in deposits in Mexico, you're right, is still lagging behind, okay? The growth in customers in Mexico is starting to peak. What is important to do in Mexico was actually to change the onboarding that we had with clients, okay? And that was part of the things that we needed in order to compete head-to-head against our competitors. So in that regard, you're going to see an increase on the deposit base in Mexico in the following quarters, given also the new payrolls that we have contracted that are coming into the portfolio. Also, you're going to see a very good increase in time deposits as basically the market has turned very competitive, and we will also be focused on profitability. What we've been doing in Mexico is mainly maintain our deposit base of individuals, while the costly deposits from corporates were basically leaving them aside also to have much better margins, okay? In terms of capital, Jose, would you like to comment?\nJoseGarcia-Cantera: Yes. Yes. Sofie, as you said, we had -- the QNA from the EBA was a positive 13 basis points. We had 2 basis points negative from other updates, model updates and regulatory updates. Basically in corporate investment banking, we would expect -- I don't know, just a few basis points per quarter of negative headwinds from regulatory and models for the rest of the year, very, very small charges per quarter. In terms of organic capital generation, if you do a simple math in the first quarter, the share buyback corresponds to two quarters, and we had the full impact of the Spanish tax, which was 4 basis points. So the first quarter only corresponded 1. So if you do a, let's say, clean organic capital generation, we generated 10 basis points -- 10 to 12 basis points in the quarter, which is what we have always said. We organically generate 10 to 15 basis points per quarter. And that's what we expect for the rest of the year.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. And thank you, Sofie, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Cerezo: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I've got one in the U.S. and one in Spain. The one in the U.S. is if you can elaborate a little bit on the cost of risk drivers in the future, breaking it down between probability of default, loss given default, what kind of measures are you taking to alleviate basically the increased installments on the auto business, in particular, for clients that gives you comfort basically that again, provisions are not going to go above pre-COVID levels. And the one in Spain, if you can give us a little bit of color in terms of the breakdown of your deposit base between retail, corporate and large corporate. What kind of behavior are you basically seeing in each of those segments from a customer point of view, how pushy, especially the retail side actually are being these days in terms of chasing additional remuneration. Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Ignacio. Let me explain you exactly what's going on in the U.S., okay? In terms of cost of risk, we expect the cost of risk actually to be better than we expected at the beginning. What we saw a little bit some of the vintages on '22 started to being a little bit more complicated than we expected. But it's quite interesting to see that normally, when you see customers in those vintages started to get delinquent for more than 90 days, usually will repossess between 90% and 95% of the autos, okay? What's been happening and it has been quite surprising is that whenever we see the clients going delinquent beyond 90 days, we see that they basically are calling us restructuring and start paying us back. So we have seen a decrease of repos from around 90% to 95% to around 59% to 60%, okay? That's basically 30 points. That's why you see the cost of risk is getting much better in the U.S., okay? To your question basically of going back to pre-COVID levels, what's going on there is that we have changed the mix of the portfolio. Pre-COVID, we have a lot more in subprime and deep subprime. Today, we have a much larger part in the portfolio of prime and near prime in the business. So that's why the portfolio is never going to go back to the levels it had. Also in '19, we have Bluestone, okay? If you remember, we actually eliminated that JV back in 2021. And that was basically very complicated in terms of cost of risk. So that's another part of the portfolio is actually much better because of that, okay? So in that sense, we believe that the cost of risk in the U.S. even though is normalizing because it's going back to pre-COVID levels, it's not going to be as that as it used to be, but it's much better than we expected at the beginning, okay, to conclude. And in terms of the break down in deposits, I don't know, Jose, if you would like to...\nJose Garcia-Cantera: In Spain, the Spanish business, we have \u20ac246 billion in deposits, individuals and SMEs is \u20ac229 billion, corporate clients, \u20ac18 billion. When we look at the public perimeter that it includes the branches and CIB in the branches, we have \u20ac15 billion in global corporate investment banking, \u20ac38 billion for the total is what you see in the accounts of \u20ac301 billion. Thank you.\nBegona Morenes: And thank you, Ignacio, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Carlos Cobo Catena from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.\nCarlos Cobo Catena: Hi, thank you for the presentation. Just a couple of questions because most of the doubts have been clear. But on the U.K., we've seen how cost of deposit also starting to accelerate. And if you could elaborate a little bit on the structural hedge. And when do you foresee the peak in net interest income because you've said this year, it's going to be more of flattish NII, if I understood correctly. Does it mean that we still have to see the benefits of the structural head going forward in '24 and '25 or how do you expect NII to combine competitive dynamics and the structural hedge upside. And the second one, if you could just explain a little bit better what was this change in the EBA criteria to have that positive impact on capital, just to understand the rationale. Thank you very much.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: Okay. I'll take the two of them. Let me answer the second one first, which is easy. What basically the EBA has ruled that minority interest in local currency does not need to be adjusted with the exchange rate because obviously, if capital is eventually used, let's say, Brazil, if capital is eventually used in Brazil, it will be used in reals, not in euros. So before this, the interpretation was that the capital needed to be adjusted through the exchange rate and now obviously, because the capital will be used in local currency doesn't need to be adjusted. That's a net between positives in some countries like Brazil and slightly negative in some countries like Mexico, where the currency has appreciated net-net, 13 basis points. U.K., okay. So in the U.K., yes, we still have around \u20ac100 billion structural position, which will help NII going forward. We would expect mortgages to go down this year more or less around 5%. So volumes a bit down in the year, but very positive NII sensitivity to rates, and we still think rates might go up a little bit. So we would expect NII to go up mid-single digits, probably a bit more than mid-single digits. So that's the expectation for this year in the U.K.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Carlos, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Marta S\u00e1nchez Romero from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMarta S\u00e1nchez Romero: Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is about the NII from your euro balance sheet. The problem we have is that transfer prices across the different constituents of that balance sheet make it very difficult to track your NII performance and compare it with your peers. So you guided at the Capital Markets Day that you would make \u20ac1.7 billion of extra NII in the euro balance sheet this year through that curve at the time. Could you please update that number today and how it breaks down between Spain, the corporate center, the digital bank, other Europe and Portugal. The second question is on the U.S. deposits. That was one of your -- expanding your deposit base as one of the pillars of your plan to improve profitability there that is now becoming more and more expensive. Where do you see the cost of deposits in the U.S. by year-end and what are you doing to differentiate yourselves and being able to raise deposits and having to pay much more than your competition? And just a quick one, if you could update us on the U.K. on what do you see for mortgage margins, please. Thank you.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: Sorry, I'll take the first one. Marta, I will get back to you with the breakdown. But basically, it's all a euro balance sheet. It's not that difficult to do the sensitivity, but I will get back to you. The sensitivity remains the same. Remember, we said \u20ac1.7 billion using the forward rates -- forward curve rates as of December. In the first quarter, the curves have remained after having moved up and down, they are basically where they were at the end of December. So we would still expect for the next 12 months, a sensitivity similar to the one that we have experienced in the first quarter and in line with that guidance we gave because as Hector explained, we would see the repreciation of our mortgage books in Spain and in Portugal to gradually gain speed throughout the year.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Jose. Okay. Let me tell you, Marta, about the U.S. deposits, okay. The U.S., basically accumulated beta has reached around 35%, and the cost is around 1.67%, okay? The higher interest rates reflected on the saving accounts have been showing improvements on the time deposits. So what I can tell you is the majority of our deposits in the U.S. basically is individuals, okay? That's the bulk of them, okay? And they have proven themselves very stable. We have really not lose any deposits at all in the individual side. We have seen a little bit of movement in the mid-corporate, okay, which we are basically diversifying deposits, but nothing material in that sense, okay? What is important to tell you is that we don't foresee really high increases on that. I mean there is a lot of competition in the market, but our deposit base has been -- even with this situation, maintained itself very stable. So we don't foresee that we're going to have a huge increase even with the competition from some other players that we have seen in the market, okay? And we are not changing our assumptions at this time in the way we see the deposits in the U.S., okay?\nJose Garcia-Cantera: And the final question is U.K. mortgage margins. Yes, the margins for that specific business are under pressure. We would expect a slightly weaker margins in the mortgage business going forward. We are -- right now, we have a market share of 11.3% when we look at stock mortgages in the U.K. But when you look at the first quarter, we have originated on average around 6% or 7% of the market because we are focusing on only on high-quality mortgages that obviously have slightly lower margins. But again, the combination of all our structural position, volume growth and margin management in the U.K. should lead to mid- to high single digits in NII in 2023.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. And thank you, Marta, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I have one question and two quick clarifications. The first is essentially, if we take your Q1 numbers and the clean underlying number you provided, and we just basically add up till the end of the year, we would reach \u20ac11 billion profit in 2023, where consensus is well below that. Where do you see consensus being too conservative on your -- on the estimates for 2023?And two clarifications. The first is on Brazilian cost of risk. You indicated a flattish evolution excluding one-offs. I just want to make sure I understood correctly that the \u20ac474 million charged on provisions this quarter is not a one-off. And so the guidance you're giving is at 4.4% to 4.5% cost of risk in 2023. The second is again on the guidance you have given before. I didn't understand it was related to NII growth or volumes when you said Mexico up double-digit, U.S. down mid-single digit and Brazil up low-single digit. Thank you.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: Okay. So let me take consensus and the cost of risk in Brazil, and I will try to clarify that. What is consensus below where we think we might be, I think we are a bit more constructive on fees, and I think the first quarter shows a very good performance of fees, basically on the back of the contribution of our global businesses. You've seen in the presentation that our global businesses, CIB, Wealth Management, PagoNxt, they're doing very, very well. Also, cost of risk, we guided for lower than 1.2% cost of risk. We are at 1.05% in the first quarter, probably the market is a bit skeptical about our capacity to keep cost of risk under control. So those, I think, are the two -- this is a bit on NII, but it's not significant and a bit on cost. So generally, I think its provisions and fees. Cost of risk in Brazil. So the \u20ac474 million is not in the P&L and that has been used to reinforce our balance sheet in Brazil, around one-fourth of that for one-off cases and the rest is just a generic strengthening of our balance sheet in Brazil. So the 4.4% cost of risk in the first quarter is clean in the sense that it doesn't have any one-offs for specific cases. From now on, as I said, I would expect if interest rates remain at 13.75% until after the summer, probably we are going to see cost of risk drifting upwards because of the gradual deterioration of the corporate sector, but by no means in excess of the cost of risk we had last year. So that's why we are saying more or less cost of risk in line with 2022, excluding the one-off, which is already excluded in the provisioning number in the first quarter. I think that clarifies my comments. And then on Mexico.\nHector Grisi: Yes. On Mexico, what I can tell you is that you're going to see very good growth in terms of NII, okay, because of your positive in the sensitivity there. Also, what you're going to see is very positive growth in terms of fees because we are growing clients in a very good way, okay? Mainly credit cards is one of the main drivers. Also, CIB is an important driver of fees, okay? And also, you're going to see that the cost of risk is actually very much under control, okay? So you're going to see an all in all very good performance in the country, given that particular situation and also that economic situation in the country is doing very well.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. And thank you, Andrea, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nBritta Schmidt: Hi there. Good morning. I'll ask a couple of questions on the deposit development in Spain, the decline. Can you maybe split the trends between corporate and retail deposits there? And also a question -- a follow-up question on the cost of deposits in Spain. There was quite a meaningful increase Q-on-Q. Do you swap any of your deposit base? And is that included in the number? And then lastly, of course, there was also a loan yield expansion regarding the management of your net interest income in Spain. Do you look more at the customer spread? Or do you look at the individual costing of the balance sheet? And then a couple of follow-ups. On Brazil, could you just clarify that last year's cost of risk, excluding one-off was around 460, 470 basis points, I think. Another question on the Polish FX saga. Do you expect there to be more provisions to come for the Polish Swiss franc mortgages and lastly, one question on the regulatory outlook. Do you expect there to be any rethink either in Spain or on a global level of deposit insurance charges and the funding of deposit insurance funds. Thank you.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: So deposits in Spain, as I said, \u20ac21 billion, \u20ac22 billion drop from corporate deposits, flat, slightly down retail deposits in the quarter. Basically, when you look at early mortgage repayments, they are very much aligned. So -- and if we look at February and March, as I mentioned, positive trends in both retail and corporate deposits because again, the \u20ac21 billion drop was associated with the year-end balance sheets of our corporate deposits. I'm not sure I understood your second question well. Your question was if we swap deposits or - no, we don't. Obviously, no, no, we don't swap the deposits. We manage net interest income -- sorry, interest rate risk through the asset side not through the liability side. How do we manage NII, if I understand correctly, do we look at customer margins or how do we manage that? I don't understand well your question, but obviously, again, interest rate risk management is mostly managed through the asset side and we look at the overall net interest margin of our interest-earning assets. Brazil, the cost of risk...\nHector Grisi: Cost of risk is around 4.58%. And excluding the one-off that we had, okay, and that's -- and in terms of the mortgages that you asked for Poland, up to now, the portfolio basically is 48% reserved, okay? That's exactly, and we are actually looking at what we're going to do, depending on how the portfolio evolves, okay? But we are now 48% coverage of the total portfolio.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, and thank you, Britta, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAlvaro Serrano: Hi, very quickly, hopefully. Two questions for me on provisions. On the U.S., I know you touched on an earlier question on it. But I just wanted to understand the car prices so far have been better certainly year-to-date. And looking at the citation data that's also doing slightly better and the NPLs are down. So why the provisions in a seasonally lower quarter, they didn't go down as much. Is there a lag effect here? How quickly do the secondhand car prices feed into the model? Maybe some handholding there? And I don't know if you could be more specific on your updated views for the full year cost of risk in the U.S. And on Brazil, I don't know if you've touched on this, but should we expect any more top-ups or one-offs in Brazil beyond the recurrent cost of risk that you've already touched on Jose? Thanks.\nHector Grisi: Alvaro, in the provisions on the U.S., okay, it's very important that you understand that. I already explained exactly how the vintages are performing. The other -- the previous vintages are basically performing quite well, okay? The thing is there are a couple of things. First of all, if you remember with the stimulus, we actually dropped quite a lot the amount of provisions that we had. What we're having right now is we're having to make some of the provisions that the portfolio needs to have in order to basically be in the same level that we need to be with IFRS, okay? IFRS, as you understand, the new definition of the folder was put in place two years ago didn't hit us as much in the U.S. because the portfolio was performing completely different, okay? So when you turn that portfolio to IFRS, the NOD, the new definition of default basically requires you to create a lot more provisions even though you may not need them because the portfolio is performing well beyond 90 days, okay? I don't know if I'm explaining it correctly because it's quite complicated. So what I'm trying to tell you that IFRS does not see that the portfolio could be so irregular in the way it performs, okay? So normally, a portfolio in Europe beyond 90 days, et cetera, will be -- I mean, go for repossession. A portfolio in the U.S. is not performing exactly like that. It's actually beyond 90 days is performing much better, and the client might pay you one installment, two installments, and then would pay you, not to pay you one installment and they will pay again, et cetera, okay? So that's why you see those differences and the movements in the provisions on the car prices. Even though you're right, car prices are better than -- much better than we expected, and the Manheim is actually at better levels. At the end, cost of risk in the U.S. is going to be around 2%, okay? It's exactly what we think and in terms of...\nJose Garcia-Cantera: So 2% compared with 3% pre-pandemic, all right? So as we were saying, it will gradually normalize, but it is actually performing a little bit better this year, and it will not reach pre-pandemic levels because of the change in the mix that Hector was referring to. But this year, we would expect it to be around 2%.\nHector Grisi: Okay. And in terms of Brazil, it's exactly, Alvaro, as Jose just explained you, rates in Brazil at around 13.75%, okay? Inflation is actually just below 7%. What Jose was explaining you if the rates continue to be that way, there might be the possibility that some of the big corporates or medium-sized corporates start to suffer, okay? We don't see that individual portfolio would suffer because it's shorter term is managing a different well and is a little bit inelastic to the rates, both the corporate portfolio in the mid corporates, mainly and SMEs could suffer because of that.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: But at the same time, individuals is improving. And you can see that actually in the first quarter cost of risk isolated at 4.4% because we are growing in high-quality retail loans and the old vintages are maturing very, very quickly. So even with that possible, and we don't know, but it might have a possible deterioration in the cost of risk in the corporate sector, we would still expect to be in line with the guideline that we gave at Investor Day for a flat cost of risk year-on-year, excluding one-offs. And no, the answer is no, we don't expect any significant one-offs for the rest of the year.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, and thank you, Alvaro, for your questions. Can we have the last question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Fernando Gil de Santiva\u00f1es from Bestinver Securities. Please go ahead.\nFernando Gil de Santiva\u00f1es: Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. Just a quick one on liquidity and LCR ratios. How do you see the year-end LCR ratios at a group level, Spain, Portugal and the U.S. base? And can you please remind us of the TLTRO maturities that the bank has. Thank you very much.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: So no, the LCRs. Very difficult to predict around, but 130 to 140 in every unit at least. For the group, it might be a bit higher than that because of the liquidity of the Corporate Center, but when we look at specific units, 130 or above. TLTRO, we have \u20ac25 billion left. So we have repaid \u20ac65 billion. This \u20ac25 billion will mature gradually until 2024. The \u20ac25 billion, \u20ac4 billion in Santander Spain, \u20ac18 billion in Santander Consumer Finance and \u20ac3 billion in Portugal.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, and thank you, Fernando, for your questions. Thank you all for your attendance. Santander's Investor Relations team is at your disposal for any and all questions that you may have.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: Thank you, everybody.",

        "text": "Thank you, Begona. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me just share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results within the context of the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day. Jose will review our financial performance in greater detail. And finally, I will conclude with final remarks. Before we start, let me briefly remark that during the first quarter the financial system has experienced situations, we've confirmed that our strategy and unique business model are key factors that allow us to deliver solid and resilient results, even in times of market volatility as we have demonstrated today through our first quarter performance. As we announced at the Investor Day, we have entered a new phase of shareholder value creation. We are focused on maximizing value creation, aiming for the first time ever to deliver double-digit growth in tangible net asset value per share plus dividend per share with solid capital generation and efficient capital allocation that will allow us to improve our profitability and provide more returns to our shareholders. And we will achieve it, thanks to, first, our unique combination of local leadership and our global scale network that very few others can replicate. Our business model based on customer focus, scale and diversification, which provide us growth, cost and profitability, competitive advantages, which is underpinned by an ambitious transformation plan that is already making Santander a digital bank with branches. Today, we delivered a solid Q1 with great progress in all our strategic objectives. TNAVps plus DPS improved 5% in the quarter. A strong capital generation increased our fully loaded CET1 ratio to 12.2%, and disciplined capital allocation improved the percentage of RWAs that create value and return on tangible equity reached an extraordinary 14.4%. In a difficult environment, we are growing customers and volumes. The deposits increased 6% year-on-year, which drove a double-digit revenue increase with good cost control. At the same time, we have maintained very solid liquidity ratios as a result of our conservative financial management strategy and a credit quality that remains stable with cost of risk well below our target in line with the medium low risk profile of our business. These trends resulted in a profit of \u20ac2.6 billion, the highest in the last five quarters, while profitability improved and we also delivered strong capital generation. All in all, we are on track to reach our 2022 targets. I will provide more details later. Moving on to the income statement. Firstly, as we usually do, we present growth rates both in euros and constant euros. There was no material difference this quarter. Secondly, in January, we recorded a \u20ac224 million charge related to extraordinary banking tax on revenue in Spain, \u20ac202 million accounted in Spain and \u20ac22 million in DCB. Excluding this impact, profit rose 10% compared to the same quarter last year, 8% in constant euros. Additionally, we have positive and negative one-off impacts in Brazil, which do not affect profit. To better explain the business trends, they have been netted in the underlying P&L. Jose will go in more detail on this, please. And thirdly, the most notable movements in the quarter were, strong top line performance supported by NII and higher fees, supported by global and network businesses; cost, have started the year in line with expectations, growing one point below inflation. We demonstrated the sustainability of our results with double-digit growth in net operating income, which was to \u20ac8 billion. From a credit quality perspective, loan loss provisions continue to normalize. Jose will go into more detail on all these points later. This is a great start of the year. Good business dynamics that are translating into double-digit revenue growth with income increasing year-on-year across our regions and global businesses. We are implementing our One Transformation project, which is helping us improve the efficiency ratio to within the range of 44% to 45% that we established for 2023 and which makes us one of the most efficient global banks in the world. Our cost of risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below 1.2% at the end of the year. Our RoTE grew quarter-on-quarter to 14.4%, 15.3% if we do not analyze extraordinary banking tax in line to reach our year-end target. And we generated capital equivalent to 17 basis points after having completed the second share buyback program to reach a fully loaded CET1 ratio of 12.2%. In summary, very positive trends, which we expect to consolidate in the coming quarters as we progress towards the 2022 financial targets that we provided during our 2022 annual results presentation. As we announced at our Investor Day in February, we are building a digital bank with branches that makes our customers' lives easier with processes and products that are simpler and more attractive to them. This, together with our global network, are helping us to improve the levels of our activity, revenues and costs. This approach, combined with a disciplined capital allocation are the cornerstone of our value creation model. Now I will dedicate some time to explain how we're progressing. Our customer focus is driving volume and revenue growth across the group. We are progressing well in the initiatives. That will help us to improve the way we serve our customers, and let me explain some of the most relevant ones. We're also taking advantage of our network effect to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model that is growing at very high rates. Multi-Latinas and multi-Europeans are increasing revenue 53% and 72% year-on-year, respectively. We're also moving fast in the construction of our branch of the future to offer a best-in-class omnichannel experience across all the group. A good example of this is significant advances made in the digital onboarding processes in Mexico. We have a program that aims to better serve our customers through the use of data, which targets 80% of our customer base. It would help us to personalize our product offering, improve interaction with our customers and provide them with the best user experience. We have developed a common mobile app across Europe as a tactical solution while we implement the common front across all the group, which is already live in Spain, Portugal and Poland and will be also released in the U.K. in the end of 2023. Customer reception has been strong as demonstrated in Portugal, where we have improved for number five to number two by customer satisfaction that is NPS through the mobile channel since the app was released. Our efforts to become a fully customer-centric bank are allowing us to grow the number of customers, loans, deposits and transactions per active customer at a very significant pace as shown on the right side of the slide. But customer focus is not enough. Simplification and automation are also needed, and we are making a good progress in simplifying our product offering and fully automating our front and back-end operations. This is reflected in our leading position in efficiency and significant growth of 10% in net operating income per customer year-on-year. As we have discussed, one transformation is improving our local bank operations. We are bringing our 160 million customers onto a common operating and business model while converging into a common technology. We are simplifying our product offering to improve our customer experience and reduce the cost. We also have already simplified our product catalog by 42% since we started the project two years ago. We are reducing also administrative and operational task in branches. We aim to optimize around 80% to 90% of the overall customer-related processes, and we are progressing well. Spain, for example, has already optimized 40% of the processes in scope for 2023 and is expected to provide significant improvements. We are leveraging our global technology capabilities to accelerate digital transformation in Europe to make our processes fully digital end-to-end. Finally, we are migrating our core banking system to the cloud, a project, which we call Gravity, making it more efficient, modern and scalable. This should result in the annual efficiencies of around \u20ac150 million up on full implementation with a 67% return on investment and a payback of three years. Overall progress at the group is at 30%. Once we have completed Gravity in Santander U.K. for a corporate platform migrations in CIB and Chile are expected to be concluded before the end of '23. These are just a few examples of our ambitious transformation program that will bring Santander's operations to the next level. Moving to our Global and Network businesses. The revenue is growing above the group average and already represents 39% of the group's total revenue. Several actions and initiatives to drive revenue growth are already in full swing. CIB is still growing strongly after record highs in 2022. We are strengthening the centers of expertise with value-added products and services, developing global and regional platforms, focusing on our areas of strength, such as energy, transition, infrastructure or projects trade finance, among others. In the U.S., we are reinforcing CIB coverage teams, strengthening product capabilities and fully leveraging the integration of APS to expand our ability to distribute risk assets. Wealth Management and Insurance revenue grew 43% year-on-year. We are working to maintain the positive trends by scaling up alternative and institutional products and promoting collaboration between Wealth Management and CIB, offering private banking and asset management products and services for CIB clients and vice versa. In PagoNxt, which is also growing strongly, we have progressed with the migration of Santander Payments in Spain to our Payments Hub platform and already manages a significant part of the payments in Europe. Merchant acquiring expanded its innovative value-added services, which is reflected in 27% year-on-year growth in total payment volumes. Auto revenue fell affected by new lending and the performance of our leasing business in, SCUSA as well as the negative sensitivity to interest rates. We have recently announced an agreement with Stellantis in Europe to become its key financing partner. We expect to increase the outstanding portfolio by 30% to \u20ac40 billion by 2026. At the same time, we continue to leverage relationships with OEMs, importers and mobility providers to grow our businesses in North and South America. We further strengthened our balance sheet and capital position. Our overall risk profile remains medium low and is proving to be predictable based on our diversification. Cost of risk stood at 1.05%. Provisions continue to normalize year-on-year as expected. LLPs performed well in the quarter as provision dropped 3%, mainly driven by South America and North America. At the same time, we delivered strong capital generation. Our CET1 ratio reached 12.2% after having absorbed the full impacts from the second share buyback program and the extraordinary banking tax in Spain. Jose will provide more details in a moment. We will continue to leverage our transformation plan to deliver increased profitability and shareholder value creation on profitability. As I mentioned earlier, our RoTE closed at 14.4%, up 100 basis points in the quarter. If we do not analyze extraordinary banking tax in Spain, RoTE would have been around 15.3%. Earnings per share grew to \u20ac0.15, 11% higher than the 2022 quarterly average, supported by strong profit growth and lower number of shares following the buyback programs. Additionally, in the quarter, we delivered 5% growth in shareholder value creation as a result of our disciplined capital allocation and share buybacks. At current share prices, buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. We completed last Friday, the second 2022 share buyback program having repurchased around 7% of our outstanding shares in the last two years, which provides a return on investment of approximately 21% to our shareholders. These results demonstrate that Santander has a strong model and risk management capabilities that work very well even in the toughest environment. Jose will go now into more detail on the group's performance in 2023. Please, Jose?"

        "text": "Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. Following our CEO's presentation, I will go into more detail on the group's P&L, risk profile and capital performance. Starting with the income statement, I will explain the account line by line in the following slides, but let me make a few initial comments. As it has been mentioned, we had some one-off results in the quarter related to the reversal of tax liabilities in Brazil for \u20ac261 million to \u20ac111 million in NII and \u20ac50 million in tax recovery and two provisions made to strengthen the balance sheet totaling \u20ac474 million, which net of taxes is \u20ac261 million. So these movements had no impact on profit, and we have decided to net them in the lines of the underlying P&L and ratios to facilitate comparisons with previous quarters and to better understand the underlying business dynamics to frame them against the year-end guidelines we gave at the Investor Day. Additionally, the P&L includes the extraordinary banking tax in Spain, which did have an impact on attributable profit. On the right-hand side, you can see the upward trend in profit quarter-on-quarter, 23% if we exclude the banking tax, which was driven by top line growth. Going into detail on the main lines and starting with the quarterly trends in cost in euros, we maintain our strong revenue improvement. In the first quarter, revenue was 3% higher than in the fourth quarter of '22, \u20ac1.5 billion higher than in the first quarter of '22, boosted particularly by NII, which increased \u20ac1.2 billion, but also by fees almost \u20ac300 million more. We have a balance sheet with very positive sensitivity to interest rates, mainly in Europe, which coupled with healthy volume growth and active margin management, led to a strong NII improvement in the last few quarters. Therefore, in the first quarter '23 was a solid quarter despite lower day count and seasonal factors in the Americas. We had good fee income growth supported by value-added products and the network effect. Trading gains, a small portion of our total revenue rose driven by customer base CIB transactions. And here is important to take into account that 97% of our CIB revenue is customer-driven. And finally, other income increase as the fourth quarter was affected by the deposit guarantee fund contribution. Group NII rose 14% year-on-year, supported by volumes, interest rate increases and margin management as I just said. In terms of volumes, loans were up year-on-year with double-digit growth in DCB and South America. North America rose 6%, and Europe was stable with falls in Spain and Portugal, mainly driven by prepayments of mortgages to individuals. Overall, loans grew 3% backed by consumer and mortgages. Likewise, deposits increased 6% with Europe growing 4%, and South America, North America and DCB growing around 10%. I will go into more detail on our loan and deposit structure later. Interest rate hikes mainly benefited Europe, Mexico and the Corporate Center. The latter driven by higher liquidity buffer remuneration. On the other hand, Brazil was impacted by a change in mix towards lower risk products and Chile and DCB were affected by their negative sensitivity to interest rates. Group net interest margin improved from 2.45% to 2.63% as we continued to actively manage our margins. We are very disciplined managing the cost of deposits and the repricing of loans. After the market movements at the beginning of the year, our deposit betas are on track with the numbers provided at Investor Day. So we expect this positive NII performance to continue in 2023. Turning to net fee income. It rose 7% year-on-year, reaching more than \u20ac3 billion, which is explained by more customers and more transactionality with them in retail banking. CIB, which stood out with a 16% growth in all regions, but especially in Europe, very positive trends in PagoNxt and cards. And in Wealth Management and Insurance, we had a good performance in private banking and insurance and volumes in Asset Management recovered in the first quarter with a net new money of \u20ac1.7 billion. Finally, in auto, volumes growth across the board continue. However, fee income in Europe was affected by the new insurance regulation in Germany. The evolution of fees reflects the improvements we make to our model to be more capital light. Moving on to costs. The first thing to highlight is that despite inflationary pressures, cost continued to increase below the rate of inflation. This was the case mainly in Europe, where costs in Spain, the U.K. and Portugal, well around 3% to 4% in real terms as salaries in Poland and Latin America tend to be more directly linked to changes in inflation. Our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 44.1%, having improved both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Outstanding performance in Europe, improving its efficiency ratio by 6 percentage points year-on-year. We will continue to deliver on our cost and efficiency targets and as we expect to further reduce our cost per customer, and as a result, continue to improve the net operating income per customer as Hector just explained. Credit quality remains robust and the cost of risk is well under control. Loan loss provisions grew year-on-year driving the cost of risk to converge towards -- through-the-cycle average as expected. The main changes by countries were the following, improvement in the cost of risk in Spain and Mexico, credit normalization in the U.S. from the very low levels we saw in 2021 and in 2022, but the behavior in the first quarter was much better than we thought. Poland increased its loan loss provisions impacted by higher Swiss franc mortgage provisions. And finally, in Brazil, we had higher loan loss provisions year-on-year on the back of individual consumer lending as well as overall portfolio growth. On a quarterly basis, loan loss provisions fell and the 3-month cost of risk in the quarter was 4.4%. This performance was supported by the high quality of our portfolio. The nonperforming loan ratio continued to improve, falling to 3.05% from 3.26% in March 2022. The main improvements came in Spain and DCB in part due to portfolio sales in the period and as well as Mexico. The portfolio distribution by stages remained stable. On the right-hand side, there is a brief overview of our loan portfolio structure. Around 80% of loans are mostly concentrated in mature markets. And if we look at the segments, our mortgages have low average loan to values. The consumer lending portfolio is well collateralized short term and has high returns, and the SME and corporate portfolio is well covered as well as over 50% has guarantees. Finally, a high weight of our corporate investment banking portfolio is investment grade. Finally, let me comment briefly on our exposure to commercial real estate, which is controlled and diversified across countries. Our exposure to CRE is 6% of total group's drawn uncommitted exposure. This is concentrated in the U.S., the U.K. and Spain, accounting for 75% of the total. Over half corresponds to social housing in the U.K. and multifamily in the U.S. The NPL ratio is 1.6% below the group's total NPL ratio. In the U.S., we have a total of \u20ac21 billion of total drawn and committed exposure with an average loan-to-value of between 50% to 60%. Office CRE is just \u20ac2 billion and it has an occupancy rate of 92% compared with around 80% for the sector as a whole. Let me also go into more detail in Brazil and the U.S., two countries that have raised some questions in the past quarters. In Brazil, the Brazilian economy has been performing well in recent years and interest rate hikes were implemented promptly and decisively to contain inflation growth in early stages. This environment accelerated the credit cycle and increased cost of risk in 2022. From now on, we expect interest rates to remain stable and probably start to come down after the summer. Additionally, during the last few years, we have been working on improving our portfolio mix in order to structurally reduce our cost of risk. We have enhanced our customer profile, the weight of new vintages with the best ratings has increased. We have been more selective in new business to increase our exposure to lower-risk secured portfolios like mortgages, agro or payroll. All in all, given our risk management, the enhanced portfolio mix and new lending profile, we expect to remain on target. Excluding one-offs in 2023, cost of risk should remain stable compared to 2022. Regarding the U.S., despite the bumpy start of the year in the country, the messages we gave at Investor Day have not changed. We expect normalization of the cost of risk to continue throughout 2023, but remain below pre-pandemic levels. We actually had a better start of the year than initially anticipated in terms of credit quality, which was supported by a stable used car prices and better late-stage delinquency payments. Our focus in auto at the moment is on quality and profitability over volumes. Moreover, we were able to further increase the share of auto loans funded by deposits. We have demonstrated that our conservative structural risk management and solid liquidity place us in a very strong position to face very challenging scenarios. At the end of the quarter, our liquidity buffer comprising high-quality liquid assets exceeded \u20ac300 billion, 97% of which were Level 1 assets. Two-thirds of this liquidity buffer is in cash, which is equivalent to 20% of our deposit base. Our liquidity is strong and stable with ratios well above regulatory requirements. The group LCR remained in line with year-end at 152% and the NSFR around 120%. The ALCO portfolio represents 6% of total assets, which is below industry average. The duration of the available-for-sale portfolio is very low and the current mark-to-market of the whole held to collect portfolio would have an impact equivalent to only 2% of our fully loaded CET1 capital. This demonstrates that impact from the change of the value of bond portfolio and capital would be very limited even in a very adverse scenario. Customer deposits are our primary source of funding and are mainly based on sticky retail deposits in our core markets. This diversified and stable funding structure supported year-on-year growth as deposits rose with positive performances across almost all countries and segments. The quarter-on-quarter decline in deposit balances is explained by the seasonal drop in CIB clients deposits, while retail remained stable in the quarter. Some customers using savings to prepay mortgages given the rising interest rates in Europe. And we have seen some flows from current accounts, time deposits and mutual funds. We have not seen any unusual deposit movements in recent weeks following the troubles of banks in the U.S. and Europe. In fact, we actually saw net inflows in the group in deposits in February and March of over \u20ac2 billion. Regarding capital, we ended the quarter at 12.2%. Let me give you some color about the variations in the quarter. 24 basis points of organic growth, which was basically driven by the strong profit generation in the quarter partially offset by risk-weighted asset growth. This includes a negative 4 basis point impact due to the extraordinary banking tax in Spain. 25 basis points drop from shareholder remuneration, which includes the total impact of the second 2022 share buyback program, 15 basis points and the accrual of the cash dividend 10 basis points for the first quarter, taking into account a 50% payout. 11 basis points were related to the update of the regulatory framework mainly following the EBA's clarification of its interpretation of CET1 minority interest calculation. And finally, a positive 7 basis points from markets, basically available for sale. So we have increased our fully loaded capital ratio while delivering on our capital productivity targets. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, improved front book RoRWA to 2.8% continued asset rotation and increase the percentage of risk-weighted assets, which deliver returns above the cost of equity. All in all, a disciplined capital allocation, which combined with our model, gives us confidence in the sustainability of our commitment to remuneration to our shareholders. Now I will hand it back to our CEO for the conclusions. Thank you."

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Jose. To conclude the presentation and open the Q&A, I will briefly outline some final remarks that our vision for the coming quarters. Growth in customer volumes, robust revenue performance, double-digit NII growth, driven by positive sensitivity to rising rates in most countries and customer margin management. Fee income grew at high single digits, driven by our CIB payments and payment businesses. We expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters, mainly in Europe and Mexico. We are implementing our One Transformation plan. Our aim is to serve our customers more efficiently and foster process automation and simplification supporting our efficiency improvements. We will accelerate One Transformation further in the coming quarters. We have already identified business opportunities across the group, which will enable us to maintain strong global network businesses revenue. Finally, we have a solid balance sheet in terms of liquidity, solvency and risk profile. We will remain focused on maintaining a medium, low-risk profile and on capital efficiency and asset rotation to ensure a solid capital ratio. So as we embark on our new strategy phase, all these plans should increase revenue and improve the efficiency and profitability of our banks with the overall aim of supporting shareholder value creation and sustainability in profitability. As previously explained, our outstanding results in the first quarter puts us in an excellent position to meet our '23 financial targets. However, we may meet them in a slightly different way than initially anticipated, depending on the evolution of the macro environment. We are convinced that we are going to achieve our 15% RoTE target, but probably through a higher contribution from Europe and Mexico and a potential lower contribution from the U.S. Finally, we're also optimistic regarding our medium-term targets that we announced at the Investor Day. As I told our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, these targets are specific, ambitious and achievable. We have the vision of where we want to go and the right strategy to get there, and we have the best team in place to put it in motion. So I am convinced that we will progress quarter by quarter to achieve our targets. Thank you very much."

        "text": "Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. I just have two questions. The first one is on the outlook at group level for NII and fees. If I just look to 1Q, you have made the guidance provided by the bank in Investor Day and for 2023 of double-digit revenue growth. But as the year goes by, I think that, that target gets challenged a bit. So I wanted just to get a bit of your thoughts on what should we -- particularly on NII, what should see the acceleration coming? And based on the comments that you made at the end Hector, a bit of what would be the outlook for the U.S. NII after the performance of the first quarter. The second one is on cost of risk. I have seen a decline in NPLs in Brazil. Just wanted to be -- to get a bit of your thoughts about how should we expect cost of risk evolving from here in Brazil and whether we have seen a beginning in NPL or it's just a seasonal effect? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Okay, Ignacio, thank you very much for your question. Okay. First of all, as I basically discussed, it's quite important to understand that we will achieve what the numbers that we said at the Investor Day and also our guidance, given that with the combination that the group is giving you, okay? So as I basically said, we're going to be a little lower in Brazil and the U.S., and we will be much better in Europe and in Mexico, okay? So it's quite important to understand exactly the combination and the work we're managing the group to get to the levels that we want, okay? So Europe is the one that is going to give us the strongest performance for the full 2023, okay? Mexico should be up -- what we call low double digit, okay? And we expect also, as I said, weaker performance in LatAm with the exception of Mexico, the U.S. and DCB. The U.S. is down mid-single digits. DCB will be low single-digit decline, and Brazil is basically mid-single-digit growth back ended, and we expect improvements towards the second half of the -- and towards the end of the year, okay? On the cost of risk, I will have Jose basically give you some ideas."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera",
        "text": "Yes. So if I may complement the NII. In Europe, we have not seen the full repricing of our portfolio, obviously because, as you know, mortgages reprice every 12 months. So we still have a long way to go in the repricing of mortgages in Spain. Again, they are 12-month, Euribor based. And in Portugal is 6-month Euribor based. So we still have, again, way to go to reflect the full impact of the repricing or the rebasing of our portfolio in Europe. In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, as I said during my presentation, we expect cost of risk to remain fairly flat in 2023 relative to 2022, excluding the one-offs. The cost of risk in the first quarter was 4.4%. The \u20ac474 million provision that we took in Brazil in the first quarter to strengthen the balance sheet was used more or less one-fourth for one-off cases for specific cases and the rest it was just to strengthen our balance sheet. So in that sense, the 4.4% of the quarter is clean. It excludes one-off cases and it reflects the true asset quality evolution of the quarter. So for the rest of the year, as the interest rates are expected to remain high, we expect a better performance of our individuals portfolios because these are very short term. And obviously, they -- most of them have matured already, and we have been adding high-quality new vintages, but we might expect some more challenging evolution in the corporate sector. So again, all in all, excluding one-offs, more or less flat year-on-year."

I wonder if you as a management have changed anything within the group in terms of liquidity and interest rate risk and/or if you expect any regulatory changes in this front in general? And more specifically, I wonder if you can elaborate a bit more the fall in deposits during the quarter. You mentioned seasonality in CIB, so do you expect to recover those deposits in the coming quarters? And also, if you can update your guidance in terms of deposit betas by the end of '23. You were previously guiding for 25, 30 in Spain, 40-50 in the U.K., 50 -- above 50 in the U.S. And just last question in terms of the ALCO portfolio in Spain, if you have changed your plans. You were aiming for \u20ac16 billion on average in '23 in terms of size, you're already above? I have seen in the slide, so you can also update on this. Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Francisco. I mean, first of all, let me tell you, I mean, given the turmoil and everything, I mean, the group is actually responding quite well, okay? We have seen all the levels in deposits basically maintain themselves. Individuals probably is the most important part in which 80% to 85% of our deposits are basically individuals, families, et cetera, which are basically very solid and very stable, okay? In that regard, also, I mean, with all these times, you always be prudent about how you manage things. But I can tell you that our units are performing really well in that sense, okay? In terms of the deposits, it's always cyclical. The decrease in deposits was mainly in CIB as we described. It was actually not very meaningful to the total size of the portfolio, and we expect basically to get them back and is the normal flow of the business, okay? In terms of the betas, I will have Jose give you a little bit of detail on that."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera",
        "text": "So back when -- in the first quarter, we had a drop of around \u20ac21 billion in CIB deposits in Europe. But that was seasonal. If you look at the fourth quarter, we had quite a strong increase, but again, this happens every quarter. This quarter was a bit more -- a bit higher than in previous quarters because we also grew a lot in deposits with our customers in Europe in the fourth quarter. So associated basically with year-end balance sheet performance. So this is not recurring and this is seasonal and -- but again, it doesn't really affect the structure of our deposits. We always try to take advantage of the opportunities. We had an opportunity in the fourth quarter, took advantage of that, is normalizing a bit in the first quarter of the year, but I would expect the seasonal behavior to happen every year. Betas. Where are we? So let me tell you where we are. In Spain, we have a -- in retail banking, beta today is 6%. Yield, average yield is 22 basis points. In CIB, in Spain, European branches and global CIB, betas are between 80% to 100%. So in Spain, if you look at the whole of Spanish balance sheet, the cost is 80 basis points with EBITDA of 25%. And this is -- we guided for the year to between 25% to 30%, still this will hold because, again, most of the CIB business has already repriced and we expect a slow increase in the repricing of retail banking, so still within the 25% to 30% for the year. U.S. beta is 35% at a cost of 1.67. Betas were a bit higher in the first quarter, not significantly higher and very much in line with the average of the system. In the U.K., beta is 25%. And in the first quarter, betas were 30% to 35%, we guided to around 50% for the year. So if we look at our interest rate sensitivity relative to the figures we gave at Investor Day, very much in line with Europe, and the U.S. and probably a better outlook in the U.K. Finally, ALCO. Yes, we expected more or less 16% -- sorry, \u20ac16 billion average in Spain. We are already there. We might be above -- a little bit above that, but it basically depends on the opportunities we see to gradually increase the size of the portfolio. Remember that we are very, very far from a neutral ALCO portfolio. We have a negative balance sheet, which is what we want to have. We gradually want to close that negative sensitivity. So actually buying an ALCO portfolio or rebuilding an ALCO portfolio in Spain is not just a matter of 2023, it's probably also a matter of '24 and even 2025. So again, we will react to what we see are the market opportunities."

So first question was actually -- I'm sorry, for a bit of a recap on previous ones, but I was just wondering if you could give us again the outlook for NII in both Brazil and in the U.S. and also so wondering if you could confirm, just make sure I understood correctly, you have that there is a \u20ac210 million one-off positive effect in Brazil and NII in the quarter? And the second question would be actually on fees and basically, the discussion that we have seen at the European level regarding fees namely potential raised. And I was wondering if you have -- if you can give us some visibility around the potential amount of fees that could be impacted if there were to be an investment bank being introduced at the European level.

But could you kind of give a little bit more details around when you expect net interest income to peak in your core European markets? NII was slightly down in the U.K. Do you think we have seen peak NII and net interest income will kind of -- on a quarterly basis don't improve further? And when do you expect net interest income on a quarterly basis to peak in Spain? And when do you expect it to be in Portugal? And my second question would be around the cost of deposits in Mexico, they increased almost 1% quarter-on-quarter. Could you just detail what drove this increase in cost of deposits in Mexico? And then my final question would be on core equity Tier 1. You saw 11 basis points of regulatory capital tailwinds in the first quarter. How should we think about any further tailwinds or headwinds on the capital side to come? And could you kind of give details on the magnitude of any potential headwinds or tailwinds to come?

I mean, mostly, the majority of the portfolio will reprice in probably April and May, okay? So the portfolio is still repricing and we're going to see those impacts mainly in Spain exactly at that time probably to the mid through the cycle of the year and towards the end. It also is going to depend on what's happening with the deposit impact and how the market is basically going to react towards that. So in that sense, we'll see that. In the U.K., we're basically seeing things stable, okay? We basically see that we're still basically building up the way the portfolio has been going and also Portugal, we expect also to continue better towards the end of the year, okay? Also, the terms of what you were talking about growth in deposits in Mexico, you're right, is still lagging behind, okay? The growth in customers in Mexico is starting to peak. What is important to do in Mexico was actually to change the onboarding that we had with clients, okay? And that was part of the things that we needed in order to compete head-to-head against our competitors. So in that regard, you're going to see an increase on the deposit base in Mexico in the following quarters, given also the new payrolls that we have contracted that are coming into the portfolio. Also, you're going to see a very good increase in time deposits as basically the market has turned very competitive, and we will also be focused on profitability. What we've been doing in Mexico is mainly maintain our deposit base of individuals, while the costly deposits from corporates were basically leaving them aside also to have much better margins, okay? In terms of capital, Jose, would you like to comment?"

Basically in corporate investment banking, we would expect -- I don't know, just a few basis points per quarter of negative headwinds from regulatory and models for the rest of the year, very, very small charges per quarter. In terms of organic capital generation, if you do a simple math in the first quarter, the share buyback corresponds to two quarters, and we had the full impact of the Spanish tax, which was 4 basis points. So the first quarter only corresponded 1. So if you do a, let's say, clean organic capital generation, we generated 10 basis points -- 10 to 12 basis points in the quarter, which is what we have always said. We organically generate 10 to 15 basis points per quarter. And that's what we expect for the rest of the year."

The one in the U.S. is if you can elaborate a little bit on the cost of risk drivers in the future, breaking it down between probability of default, loss given default, what kind of measures are you taking to alleviate basically the increased installments on the auto business, in particular, for clients that gives you comfort basically that again, provisions are not going to go above pre-COVID levels. And the one in Spain, if you can give us a little bit of color in terms of the breakdown of your deposit base between retail, corporate and large corporate. What kind of behavior are you basically seeing in each of those segments from a customer point of view, how pushy, especially the retail side actually are being these days in terms of chasing additional remuneration. Thank you."

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Ignacio. Let me explain you exactly what's going on in the U.S., okay? In terms of cost of risk, we expect the cost of risk actually to be better than we expected at the beginning. What we saw a little bit some of the vintages on '22 started to being a little bit more complicated than we expected. But it's quite interesting to see that normally, when you see customers in those vintages started to get delinquent for more than 90 days, usually will repossess between 90% and 95% of the autos, okay? What's been happening and it has been quite surprising is that whenever we see the clients going delinquent beyond 90 days, we see that they basically are calling us restructuring and start paying us back. So we have seen a decrease of repos from around 90% to 95% to around 59% to 60%, okay? That's basically 30 points. That's why you see the cost of risk is getting much better in the U.S., okay? To your question basically of going back to pre-COVID levels, what's going on there is that we have changed the mix of the portfolio. Pre-COVID, we have a lot more in subprime and deep subprime. Today, we have a much larger part in the portfolio of prime and near prime in the business. So that's why the portfolio is never going to go back to the levels it had. Also in '19, we have Bluestone, okay? If you remember, we actually eliminated that JV back in 2021. And that was basically very complicated in terms of cost of risk. So that's another part of the portfolio is actually much better because of that, okay? So in that sense, we believe that the cost of risk in the U.S. even though is normalizing because it's going back to pre-COVID levels, it's not going to be as that as it used to be, but it's much better than we expected at the beginning, okay, to conclude. And in terms of the break down in deposits, I don't know, Jose, if you would like to..."

But on the U.K., we've seen how cost of deposit also starting to accelerate. And if you could elaborate a little bit on the structural hedge. And when do you foresee the peak in net interest income because you've said this year, it's going to be more of flattish NII, if I understood correctly. Does it mean that we still have to see the benefits of the structural head going forward in '24 and '25 or how do you expect NII to combine competitive dynamics and the structural hedge upside. And the second one, if you could just explain a little bit better what was this change in the EBA criteria to have that positive impact on capital, just to understand the rationale. Thank you very much."

        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera",
        "text": "Okay. I'll take the two of them. Let me answer the second one first, which is easy. What basically the EBA has ruled that minority interest in local currency does not need to be adjusted with the exchange rate because obviously, if capital is eventually used, let's say, Brazil, if capital is eventually used in Brazil, it will be used in reals, not in euros. So before this, the interpretation was that the capital needed to be adjusted through the exchange rate and now obviously, because the capital will be used in local currency doesn't need to be adjusted. That's a net between positives in some countries like Brazil and slightly negative in some countries like Mexico, where the currency has appreciated net-net, 13 basis points. U.K., okay. So in the U.K., yes, we still have around \u20ac100 billion structural position, which will help NII going forward. We would expect mortgages to go down this year more or less around 5%. So volumes a bit down in the year, but very positive NII sensitivity to rates, and we still think rates might go up a little bit. So we would expect NII to go up mid-single digits, probably a bit more than mid-single digits. So that's the expectation for this year in the U.K."

The problem we have is that transfer prices across the different constituents of that balance sheet make it very difficult to track your NII performance and compare it with your peers. So you guided at the Capital Markets Day that you would make \u20ac1.7 billion of extra NII in the euro balance sheet this year through that curve at the time. Could you please update that number today and how it breaks down between Spain, the corporate center, the digital bank, other Europe and Portugal. The second question is on the U.S. deposits. That was one of your -- expanding your deposit base as one of the pillars of your plan to improve profitability there that is now becoming more and more expensive. Where do you see the cost of deposits in the U.S. by year-end and what are you doing to differentiate yourselves and being able to raise deposits and having to pay much more than your competition? And just a quick one, if you could update us on the U.K. on what do you see for mortgage margins, please. Thank you."

It's not that difficult to do the sensitivity, but I will get back to you. The sensitivity remains the same. Remember, we said \u20ac1.7 billion using the forward rates -- forward curve rates as of December. In the first quarter, the curves have remained after having moved up and down, they are basically where they were at the end of December. So we would still expect for the next 12 months, a sensitivity similar to the one that we have experienced in the first quarter and in line with that guidance we gave because as Hector explained, we would see the repreciation of our mortgage books in Spain and in Portugal to gradually gain speed throughout the year."

The higher interest rates reflected on the saving accounts have been showing improvements on the time deposits. So what I can tell you is the majority of our deposits in the U.S. basically is individuals, okay? That's the bulk of them, okay? And they have proven themselves very stable. We have really not lose any deposits at all in the individual side. We have seen a little bit of movement in the mid-corporate, okay, which we are basically diversifying deposits, but nothing material in that sense, okay? What is important to tell you is that we don't foresee really high increases on that. I mean there is a lot of competition in the market, but our deposit base has been -- even with this situation, maintained itself very stable. So we don't foresee that we're going to have a huge increase even with the competition from some other players that we have seen in the market, okay?

But again, the combination of all our structural position, volume growth and margin management in the U.K. should lead to mid- to high single digits in NII in 2023."

The first is essentially, if we take your Q1 numbers and the clean underlying number you provided, and we just basically add up till the end of the year, we would reach \u20ac11 billion profit in 2023, where consensus is well below that. Where do you see consensus being too conservative on your -- on the estimates for 2023?And two clarifications. The first is on Brazilian cost of risk. You indicated a flattish evolution excluding one-offs. I just want to make sure I understood correctly that the \u20ac474 million charged on provisions this quarter is not a one-off. And so the guidance you're giving is at 4.4% to 4.5% cost of risk in 2023. The second is again on the guidance you have given before. I didn't understand it was related to NII growth or volumes when you said Mexico up double-digit, U.S. down mid-single digit and Brazil up low-single digit. Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera",
        "text": "Okay. So let me take consensus and the cost of risk in Brazil, and I will try to clarify that. What is consensus below where we think we might be, I think we are a bit more constructive on fees, and I think the first quarter shows a very good performance of fees, basically on the back of the contribution of our global businesses. You've seen in the presentation that our global businesses, CIB, Wealth Management, PagoNxt, they're doing very, very well. Also, cost of risk, we guided for lower than 1.2% cost of risk. We are at 1.05% in the first quarter, probably the market is a bit skeptical about our capacity to keep cost of risk under control. So those, I think, are the two -- this is a bit on NII, but it's not significant and a bit on cost. So generally, I think its provisions and fees. Cost of risk in Brazil. So the \u20ac474 million is not in the P&L and that has been used to reinforce our balance sheet in Brazil, around one-fourth of that for one-off cases and the rest is just a generic strengthening of our balance sheet in Brazil. So the 4.4% cost of risk in the first quarter is clean in the sense that it doesn't have any one-offs for specific cases. From now on, as I said, I would expect if interest rates remain at 13.75% until after the summer, probably we are going to see cost of risk drifting upwards because of the gradual deterioration of the corporate sector, but by no means in excess of the cost of risk we had last year. So that's why we are saying more or less cost of risk in line with 2022, excluding the one-off, which is already excluded in the provisioning number in the first quarter. I think that clarifies my comments. And then on Mexico."

Also, what you're going to see is very positive growth in terms of fees because we are growing clients in a very good way, okay? Mainly credit cards is one of the main drivers. Also, CIB is an important driver of fees, okay? And also, you're going to see that the cost of risk is actually very much under control, okay? So you're going to see an all in all very good performance in the country, given that particular situation and also that economic situation in the country is doing very well."

And then lastly, of course, there was also a loan yield expansion regarding the management of your net interest income in Spain. Do you look more at the customer spread? Or do you look at the individual costing of the balance sheet? And then a couple of follow-ups. On Brazil, could you just clarify that last year's cost of risk, excluding one-off was around 460, 470 basis points, I think. Another question on the Polish FX saga. Do you expect there to be more provisions to come for the Polish Swiss franc mortgages and lastly, one question on the regulatory outlook.

I'm not sure I understood your second question well. Your question was if we swap deposits or - no, we don't. Obviously, no, no, we don't swap the deposits. We manage net interest income -- sorry, interest rate risk through the asset side not through the liability side. How do we manage NII, if I understand correctly, do we look at customer margins or how do we manage that?

So why the provisions in a seasonally lower quarter, they didn't go down as much. Is there a lag effect here? How quickly do the secondhand car prices feed into the model? Maybe some handholding there? And I don't know if you could be more specific on your updated views for the full year cost of risk in the U.S. And on Brazil, I don't know if you've touched on this, but should we expect any more top-ups or one-offs in Brazil beyond the recurrent cost of risk that you've already touched on Jose?

The other -- the previous vintages are basically performing quite well, okay? The thing is there are a couple of things. First of all, if you remember with the stimulus, we actually dropped quite a lot the amount of provisions that we had. What we're having right now is we're having to make some of the provisions that the portfolio needs to have in order to basically be in the same level that we need to be with IFRS, okay? IFRS, as you understand, the new definition of the folder was put in place two years ago didn't hit us as much in the U.S. because the portfolio was performing completely different, okay? So when you turn that portfolio to IFRS, the NOD, the new definition of default basically requires you to create a lot more provisions even though you may not need them because the portfolio is performing well beyond 90 days, okay? I don't know if I'm explaining it correctly because it's quite complicated. So what I'm trying to tell you that IFRS does not see that the portfolio could be so irregular in the way it performs, okay? So normally, a portfolio in Europe beyond 90 days, et cetera, will be -- I mean, go for repossession. A portfolio in the U.S. is not performing exactly like that. It's actually beyond 90 days is performing much better, and the client might pay you one installment, two installments, and then would pay you, not to pay you one installment and they will pay again, et cetera, okay? So that's why you see those differences and the movements in the provisions on the car prices. Even though you're right, car prices are better than -- much better than we expected, and the Manheim is actually at better levels. At the end, cost of risk in the U.S. is going to be around 2%, okay? It's exactly what we think and in terms of..."

So even with that possible, and we don't know, but it might have a possible deterioration in the cost of risk in the corporate sector, we would still expect to be in line with the guideline that we gave at Investor Day for a flat cost of risk year-on-year, excluding one-offs. And no, the answer is no, we don't expect any significant one-offs for the rest of the year."

    "transcript": "Begona Morenes: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Banco Santander's Conference Call to discuss our Financial Results for the First Half of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Hector Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. Jose Garcia-Cantera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] With this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi. Hector, the floor is yours.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Begona. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me just share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our half one results on the context of how we are progressing with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day. Jose will then review our financial performance in greater detail. And then, I'll conclude with a few closing remarks.  Despite the challenges the financial system experienced at the beginning of the year, Q2 was another strong quarter for Santander demonstrating the strength and resilience of our strategy and unique business model even in times of market volatility.  We delivered record profit of \u20ac2.7 billion, an increase of 14% compared with Q2 in \u201822, thus plus 17% in constant euros.  In the first half of \u201823, profit was \u20ac5.2 billion, up 7% supported by robust customer revenue growth. Revenue increased double-digits year-on-year, supported by all regions and global businesses. Global scale and network businesses are contributing around 40% of total Group revenue. Our number of customers grew by nine million year-on-year taking the total to 164 million and loans increased by 1% and deposits by 5%.  The Group continues progressing towards a simpler and more integrated model through One Transformation. The program that is accelerating our structural model change to drive efficiency improvement, and growth in profitability.  As a result, our efficiency ratio improved one point-three percentage points year-on-year to 44.2% and our net operating income grew double-digits. Our return on tangible equity RoTE rose 80 basis points year-on-year to 14.5, while our earnings per shares improved 13% year-on-year supported by greater profit and share buybacks.  At the same time, our strong balance sheet with solid and sound capital ratio, liquidity at comfortable levels and robust credit quality contributed to solid profitable growth, value creation, and shareholder remuneration. These results allow us to deliver value creation in terms of TNAVps plus EPS year-on-year of 11%, of which represents an increase of more than \u20ac6 billion in the first six months of the year.  Moving on to the income statement. Firstly, remember that as we usually do, we are presenting growth rates, both in current euros and constant euros. This quarter, there was no material difference between them. As I have just mentioned, profit increase in the first half, supported by, first of all, a strong line performance with all the regions and global businesses growing; cost in line with our expectations growing 1% point below the rate of inflation; double-digit growth in net operating income to approximately \u20ac16 billion, which demonstrates the strength of our results; and low loss provisions normalizing land with our expectations.  These Trends resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record 4% higher than in Q1, even after the following impacts, net of taxes recorded in Q2. The SRF contribution of more than \u20ac200 million and additional Swiss mortgage provisions in Poland of \u20ac140 million and one-offs in Brazil of \u20ac137 million. Jose will go into more detail on all of these points later on.  This was a great first half, that makes us confident that we will deliver on our 2023 targets. Good business dynamics are translating into double-digit revenue, growth; our efficiency ratio improved as a result of good cost control and revenue trends; our cost of risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below 1.2% at year end.  CET1 was 12.2 after profitably growing our businesses organically, and at a comfortable levels allowing us to accrue funds to meet our shareholders\u2019 remuneration targets of a 50% payout. Our RoTE also grew year-on-year to 14.5 on track to reach our target at would already be close to 15% if we don't analyze extraordinary banking tax on revenue earned in Spain.  As we announced at our Investor Day we have entered into a new phase of value creation that will help us grow TNAVps per share plus EPS at a double-digit during the year \u2013 or through the cycle.  I like to spend a couple of minutes updating you on the progress of our transformation plan, now that we are six months down the road from our Investor Day. We are transforming the Bank in the right way because we're structurally changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. We are making great progress in the implementation of One Transformation, creating a common operating model and technology for our retail business across our entire footprint.  To better serve our customers and to improve efficiency and increase the size and profitability of our customer base we are delivering across the three, pillars of One Transformation. In simplification, we already have reduced 5% our number of products, nearly 400 fewer products in 2023. We are progressing in our digital self-service model, increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact center by 17% just alone in the first quarter of \u201923, compared with the same period last year.  We are digitalizing the onboarding process and to enter in Mexico. This initial pilot has resulted in a 36% growth in digital accounts per month, compared to those in 2022. And we have already captured around \u20ac70 million in savings so far in the U.S. from transformation and simplification initiatives. As you can see on this slide, the initial efficiencies for One Transformation, and the impact of our good sprint management in a context of higher rates, higher interest rates which our CFO will cover later in depth, have already contributed 85 basis points in efficiency improvements. Our Global and network business keep contributing to the Group's profitability and have already delivered another 43 basis points.  Multi Latinas and multi Europeans our initiatives to better serve our Multinational corporates and SMEs through regional coverage model are growing at a very high rates with revenue increasing by more than 70% year-to-date. In asset management, we have progressed to enter the alternative business is starting to serve open market and institutional segment and has reached more than \u20ac2 billion commitments already.  In payments, we have deployed that in Portugal and Argentina in the first half and we expect to launching latest in Chile, in the second half.  In Auto, we're increasing managing OEMs and retail relationships globally, expanding our partnerships in Europe to LATAM and the U.S. We have recently onboarded new partners in the US, leverage the existing agreements in Europe, which are expected to materialize in around \u20ac4 billion of new business per year. We have also deployed a new parent regional leasing platform in two markets and more countries will be added throughout \u201823 and \u201824.  Finally, our global technology capabilities have already resulted in 36 basis points improvement in the efficiency ratio. Our Global approach to technology has allowed us to capture \u20ac80 million in savings this year, mainly driven by One Transformation and efficiencies from the recent development and deployment of Gravity in two countries, which has contributed with \u20ac31 million in savings in the first half. A new global agreement with vendors, which represent around \u20ac40 million in cost reduction year-to-date.  The actions that we are beginning to carry out as a part of One Transformation, which we are expanding across the Group are starting to be reflected on cost and on operational efficiencies. As you can see on this slide, simplification has already driven significant improvements in our cost and revenue per active customer ratios.  The solid progress we are making with the process digitalization and automation to capture efficiencies enables us to spend less time on operations in branches, and turn the branch, network into a powerful sales and advisory channel.  Portugal has already taken out most of the operational activities from the branches freeing up branch employees, so that they can spend more time supporting customers and commercial activities. We're extrapolating this to other of our banks. In only six months through One Transformation, we have already reduced the number of operational FTEs per million customers by 3%. We are already deploying global tech platforms to improve customer experience, leverage economies of scale, and extend best practices.  Open Digital Services, as we call it ODS, our cutting-edge front-end platform allows to deliver a best-in-class omni-channel experience to our customers. At the same time, that Gravity, our award-winning core banking platform drives significant efficiencies versus mainframe technology. We have integrated both in the U.S., so we will operate it on an end-to-end cloud-based retail technology stack core and omni-channel, which is already tested and will result in significant improvements in service quality and customer experience.  Our global and network businesses continue to contribute to this new phase of value creation. In CIB we continue growing strongly after record performance in 2022, beating the market. Our global presence has allowed us to grow at 24% year-on-year, well above the average of annual growth target of 10% for the period \u201820 to \u201825.  Because, first of all, we can provide a One-Stop shop service to our clients across all geographies, thereby capturing cross-border flows and because we bring CIB products and services to all wealth, retail and commercial clients across a group and vice-versa. As a result, revenue related to these two concepts which we call network revenue grew 27% year-on-year to \u20ac2 billion. Wealth management and insurance grew 25% percent year-on-year, well above our target and this has been boosted by the finance benefits obtained from the Santander network effect. A fundamental part of our value proposition in private banking is how unique combination of local presence and local reach, a global reach.  Our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another and that's the reason why customers have \u20ac50 billion in assets under management book abroad, 10% higher than one year ago.  Our payments business is also growing very strongly. Two years ago, we\u2019ve began to move our payments business on to scale global platforms. And, as of today, our payments platform already manages a significant part of all payments in the Eurozone and we are progressing in another key countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the UK. We are in the process of expanding our cards platform across the Group, delivering real-time digital processing capabilities to our banks, accelerating our business growth, as well as generating operational synergies of around \u20ac100 million per year during the next two years alone.  First delivery of the platform will be live in Brazil by the second half or 2023. In auto we continue to prioritize profitability, our market share growth in a context of rising interest rates.  Our transformation plan, which is making us more - much more efficient and increasing contribution of our global and network businesses is helping us reach our 2025 profitability targets across all regions and businesses. As I mentioned earlier, the Group's RoTE rose 80 basis points year-on-year to 14.5% and would be around 15% if we didn't analyze the extraordinary banking tax in Spain, which is in line with the Group's targets for 2022 - sorry \u201823 and \u201825.  Jose will now go in more detail through the Group\u2019s first half performance. Please Jose. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. [Audio Gap] and Latin America driven by growth in volumes and fees. Digital Consumer Bank benefited from asset repricing actions and gains on financial transactions due to FX hedges. We also saw a strong performance across businesses. The only exception was auto, the result of lower leasing income in the US, which as in previous quarters, was affected by an increase in the share of end of leased vehicles, repurchase at the dealership. Revenue at the corporate center also improved up nearly \u20ac400 million due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from FX hedging, which negatively affected revenue last year. Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued its upward trend increasing 6% in the quarter alone, driven in particular by Europe. We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters.  First half 2023 was 15% higher year-on-year in constant euros with positive sensitivity to raising rates mainly in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in auto, North America and South America, which more than offset negative in duration sensitivity in Brazil, Chile and auto.  In terms of profitability, we have improved our margins every quarter since the first quarter of 2021. We continue to actively manage our credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment. Gains from credit yields outweighed higher funding costs. Thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration strategy adapted to each country's specific needs.  In Europe, we are strictly managing deposit costs, especially in Spain and Portugal where there is excess liquidity in the system and much lower credit amount. The UK has a more competitive environment in line with our expectations. In LATAM, deposit rates are more directly linked to market interest rates, which implies negative sensitivity and will benefit margins when rates start to decline over the next few months. Finally, in the U.S., deposit betas are higher due to the heightened competition following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. All-in-all, net interest income sensitivity to interest rates has resulted on \u20ac500 million above the assumptions that we shared during our Investor Day. Therefore, we are well on track to meet our double-digit NII growth guidance for 2023.  Turning now to fees, in an environment of low fee growth in general as a result of subpar loan demand, weaker activity, consumer activity and higher margins, our net fee income grew at 4% in the quarter compared with the same quarter last year and 5% in the first half year-on-year. CIB and PagoNxt are leading the way in terms of growth. CIB is increasing its share of leading roles and mandates and PagoNxt continued to expand total payment volumes, which rose 25% year-on-year and transactions 32%.  We also had a very good performance for cards with turnover increasing 9% year-on-year with fees growing 20%. Retail banking also continued to grow well, primarily driven by an increase in customers and transactionality . Wealth management and insurance grew less as customers moved to lower risk, fixed income products with lower fees and margins.  However, we saw volume improvements in both, private banking, net new money of \u20ac6.5 billion and Santander Asset Management over \u20ac3 billion net sales. Auto performance year-on-year was affected by the new insurance regulation in Germany in the first quarter but recovered significantly in the second quarter. In terms, of course, our transformation efforts that Hector took you through earlier are paying off despite initial investments cost in real terms are growing below the rate of inflation across most of our footprint reflecting the savings we are beginning to generate on our strict control.  This in turn is reflected in efficiency improvements led by Europe which improved seven percentage points, thanks to strong revenue gains together with a 2% fall in costs in real terms. As a result, Group efficiencies already at the bottom end of our target range where we expected to remain for the rest of the year.  Credit quality remains robust, across our footprint. The non-performing loan ratio remains stable in the context of an expected soft lending and a strong labor markets as unemployment is a key driver of credit quality. Of note, were the positive trends in Brazil driven by the more selective lending policies that we introduced a year and a half ago. We said in the fourth quarter of last year that we believe the Brazil NPL ratio had already peaked, and trends so far this year support that view having improved almost 60 basis points year-to-date.  In terms of cost of risk, we remain comfortably on track to meet our 2023 target to remain below 1.2%. Spain continues to perform well, with a 12-month cost of risk, down 16 basis points year-on-year, supported by the quality of the long book and improving macro conditions. Normalization in the US continues, but is more resilient than anticipated. Brazil remains elevated due to the unsecured individual borrowers portfolio, but we are seeing signs that cost of risk has stabilized. Brazil's 12-month cost of risk at the end of June was 4.74%, but if we annualize the first six months, that improved to 4.5%.  Mexico is increasing from low levels, mainly due to a changing mix towards unsecured loans which require more provisions upfront and obviously is more profitable. Other units, such as the UK, Portugal, and the digital consumer bank are rising, but from a very low base and should remain below all in line with through the cycle averages.  Moving on to our balance sheet structure. As we have discussed in previous presentations, our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment, product, and country. Moreover, our balance sheet is low-risk. The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low average loan to values. Loan growth year-on-year, was flat in constant Euros as growth in auto and consumer was offset by falls in CIB, mainly in Spain from very high levels in 2022, mortgages driven by early repayments in Europe and slowing demand from corporate, also in Europe.  We saw positive dynamics in North America, South America, and DCB. On the other hand, deposits continue to grow well, up 4% year-on-year following a \u20ac3 billion increase in the second quarter in constant Euros, reflecting new customer capture with more than offset mortgage prepayments. We saw growth across the Bank concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher rates.  Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria 75% of our deposits are transactional, which are stickier and a high proportion of all deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes. We have not seen any unusual movements in deposits in the year-to-date following market turmoil, particularly in the U.S.  In fact, deposits in the U.S. grew in the quarter and remained flattish year-to-date which implies that we are gaining market share in deposits and with an average cost which was well below our main competitors. Mutual funds have begun to recover, up 4% year-on-year following a year of instability in 2022.  To close, let me cover capital. Our fully low risk capital ratio remains at a comfortable level of 12.2% backed by strong organic capital generation, which was again 10 basis points, net of dividend accrual in the quarter. We accounted for the payout of the minority shareholders in Mexico, which costs four basis points in terms of capital.  We also had a series of other small positives and negatives this quarter that almost offset each other. We continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities, which is reflected in a front book RoRWA of 2.9% up from 2.5% in the first half of 2022, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity in excess of 15% - sorry, in excess of the current Group return on tangible equity, which will support profitability going forward.  Additionally, we continue to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of risk-weighted assets with positive economic value added progressing well, towards our Investor Day target of 85 in 2025. This increased profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years and we are confident our capital ratio will remain above 12% even after taking into account, the final implementation of BASEL III on January 1st 2025.  Let me turn it back to Hector for his concluding remarks. Thank you. \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Jose. In summary, Q2 of \u201823 was another strong quarter supported by customer growth, double-digit revenue increase, and also backed by strong performance by all the regions and businesses. We are accelerating the structural change to a simpler and more integrated model through One Transformation spreading the initiative all across the Group, which is driving efficiency improvement, and also profitable growth.  A rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth, calue creation and shareholder remuneration. In summary, we have a very strong first half of the year and we are confident that we will achieve our 2023 targets and remunerate our shareholders in line with our 50% payout policy supported by our global and network businesses while we continue with our structural model transformation.  We see upside potential for further net interest income growth in the coming quarters, as tailwinds in Europe and Mexico, are expected to remain and inflation and interest rates in our largest Latin American - Latin American countries seem to have picked or nearly picked resulting in a positive outlook for margins in the next 6 to 9 months.  Cost of risk is normalizing in line with our expectation. In a context of an expected soft landing of the economy and a strong labor markets, we continue to see resilient customer and corporate behavior in most of the geographies. Group RoTE has reached 14.5% in the first half and we expect to close above 15% at the end of the year.  All in all, our TNAV plus cash dividend is growing at a double-digit, well on track with our target of average growth through the cycle.  And now, we will be happy to take any of your questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  We already have the first question from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank BPI. Please go ahead. \nCarlos Peixoto : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call - my question. The first question would actually be on Brazil. Margin stabilized quarter-on-quarter, it\u2019s still a bit under pressure year-on-year. I was wondering what evolution you expect for the rest of the year? And also on cost of risk what's the Outlook there? Then the second question would actually be on capital. So basically the capital generation in this quarter was only three basis points a bit below the runrate you have discussed in previous quarters. I reckon that this partially has to do with the Mexico minorities incorporation, but I was wondering how do you see this evolving throughout the rest of the year? And also, what is behind the increase in RWAs in this quarter? Thank you very much. \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Carlpos. What I'll do is, I'll \u2013 last - the first question on. Brazil we will give you a comment on capital and then Jose will tell you a little bit about what's going on with increasing RWA, okay? In terms of the Brazil margin quarter-on-quarter, as we say, basically is explained by the following: our launch since 2021, we have become much more conservative and growth \u2013 grown volumes very selectively changing the loan mix to lower risk. Okay? So we mainly get out - we're out of credit cards. Went on to Consignado, auto loans and mortgages.  On deposits also the fast increase in rates has meant a rapid rise in the cost of deposits, okay, as well as a change of the mix on the deposits. Rates are staying higher for longer has prevented the cost of deposit from coming down impacting NII. Remember that in Brazil, we have negative sensitivity to rates, okay? So Brazilian NIIs in the second quarter of \u201823 is already flat. Okay?  As we set and Jose was very precise on that the worst since behind us and we are already seeing a reduction on the average cost of deposits and we also see an improved customer spread. Okay? So we expect NII in the second half of \u201823 to be higher than the first half of the year leading to a flat NII in the year with a substantial improvement in \u201824, okay?  In terms of the cost of risk, not only the macro outlook is improving, but since \u201821, I just \u2013 I explained, we've been very selective in the approach of the new lending extension and focusing to more secure and higher rate customers as I explained, okay? This is showing good results and we believe the worst, as I said, it repeatedly is worst - sorry the worst is behind now.  Cost of risk in the second quarter is already improving, versus the first quarter and the vintages are showing really good performance as we have seen. So we don't expect cost of risk that will deteriorate in Brazil in \u201823 versus \u201822, excluding the one-off that which implies staying close to around 4.6%, okay? And then, to be on capital to be very precise, we expect to generate at least 10 basis points of organical capital on average per quarter with the current shareholder remuneration policy that we put in place.  As a result, we will be on track to meet our target to be above 12% even when the final implementation of BASEL III comes into effect on January 1st on \u201825, okay? And with that, I don't know, Jose, you can comment on RWAs please. \nJose Garcia-Cantera: Yes. Thank you. So, morning, Carlos. You are right. Loan growth was zero, but risk-weighted assets grew more or less than 2%. Half of that growth is due to FX as we consolidate the Latin America, basically, the peso and the Brazilian based assets in to the Group. Of the other half, half of the other half, so a substantial amount corresponds to a stock finance.  And this is due to the recovery of the new auto business in Europe. This will eventually translate into auto loans. So, this is obviously short term that will eventually lead a higher profitability going forward. When we look at the outlook, as Hector said, we don't expect any significant regulatory or supervisory capital impacts in the second half of the year.  We see no inorganic charges in the second half of the year. Obviously, it looks like the available for sale portfolio valuation also will stay relatively stable. We see improving profitability, as we have mentioned, particularly driven by higher NII in the second half. An increased weighted assets should be probably under control.  So net-net, we see a stronger capital - organic capital generation in the next couple of quarters again, leading to a capital that will remain well above 12% every quarter and building up sufficient capital to be above 12%, post BASEL III.\nBegona Morenes : Thank you Hector, and Jose can I have the next question, please? \nOperator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nAlvaro Serrano: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions please from my side on US and Spain. US has obviously done much better in provisions. I know you've touched on it a little bit, maybe you can give a bit more detail as to why the provision was so low in the quarter? Is its collateral? Is it default rates? And when you think about the rest of the year maybe you can update us about the guidance. Would you expect in costs of risk for the full year. I think you gave us some color in Q1, maybe an updated view on the moving parts there.  And second question on Spain. Deposit is much more stable this quarter, previous quarter. I wonder if you can give - again a bit more color on the deposit migration and remuneration and, and when do you, what would you expect NII to peak in Spain, I am extrapolating, Spain, Portugal, which I assume it's the same dynamics. Thank you. \nHector Grisi: Thank you, Alvaro. Okay, let me give you our outlook in the US, okay? And I explained it \u2013 it\u2019s basically the same dynamic I explained in the first quarter, okay? Credit provision, as you know decreased as credit quality is remaining robust and credit net charge-offs actually, what we called realized losses show better than anticipated performance.  And this is basically on the back, use prices continue to be strong, okay, as I explained and declining at slower pace that we previously anticipated. The changing out to loan portfolio mixed of our subprime, do you remember that I told you that before 2018, we had a lot more subprime than Prime and the change on the mix has helped.  Also, we have robust and better than expected labor market in the US, okay, which is sustaining that, okay? And out of customers that are delinquent exactly as I was explaining in the first quarter for more than 90 days are rolling into charge of status at historical low levels, okay? Normally, they were above 90%, 95%. Last quarter they were around 59%, this quarter around 67% percent, okay?  So it's still much better than we expect and much better than it was actually happening pre-COVID, okay? And in 2023, we expect cost or risk to continue on the normalization at around 2%. And after two years of artificially low figures given COVID et cetera, as I was saying, normalized levels should be below pre-pandemic, cost, or risk at around - you remember, pre-pandemic was around, 285, it\u2019s never going to get there, okay? Because of the change of mix and what I was explaining, okay? In terms of the Spain, okay?  In Spain, the deposits, I mean continued to be stable, okay, I at around, we have around \u20ac299 billion, okay? We have excess liquidity in Santander Spain, LTVs around 78% as is the case for the whole Spanish system that is around 80%. Quarterly the claim is most linked to CIB deposits, flat in retail in the quarter despite the early repayments of mortgages, okay. 60% compared to the same period of 2022 and increased volume of deposits moving off-balance sheet products.  Also, what we see between the first half of \u201923 versus the first half of \u201822 is plus 0.9% okay? So we have a different change of the mix with time deposits going up at around 61% up year-on-year, while demand deposits are going down around 5% on the back of the higher rates, driven by the growth of CIB, which allows us to maintain also - and maintain a stable net liquidity position, okay?  In terms of - what I was saying NII, we don't expect to peak yet. I mean we have still revisions and I will have horses playing in detail exactly how we\u2019ll see an eye evolution in the Spain. \nJose Garcia-Cantera: Good morning, Alvaro. Let me talk about all the Corporate Center, because Santander SA more than and Spain because this is going to give you a better view of our Euro sensitivity to rates in Spain. So we have assets of \u20ac330 billion, 60% floating 40% fixed. This fixed includes the ALCO, which is \u20ac27 billion that we've been buying recently with an average duration of six years on an interest rate of over 3%.  We also have intra-group transactions, et cetera, money markets that are fixed, but these are very short term. So they will reprice as short term ULIBOR actually goes up. Of the floating \u20ac200 billion, \u20ac65 billion. will reprice or reprices with 12-month ULIBOR. We expect the - if we use today\u2019s ULIBOR, compared with the average of the first half, so let\u2019s assume that the ULIBOR remains flat in the first half of next year, we have at least 50 basis points pick up in the repricing of this part of the portfolio next year.  And then we have 60 \u2013 sorry, \u20ac30 billion with reprices with a six months \u20ac40 billion with a three months and \u20ac65 billion with one month. So, we would still expect significant repricing upwards in the first half of next year, as interest rates in Europe may go up once or twice, but as they stabilize, we will still have significant repricing of a big chunk of the portfolio in the first half of next year.  So obviously, the asset yields are expected still to expand well into 2024. Obviously, margins will depend on the cost of deposits but as Hector said, we are not seeing any pressures today to increase their remuneration of retail deposits. We are already paying almost ULIBOR for CIB deposits, institutional deposits, but we don't see any pressures on the retail side of deposits, which means that probably the peak in net interest margins will not happen until well into 2024 in the Eurozone. \nBegona Morenes : Thank you, Alvaros for the questions and Jose and Hector for the answers. Can we have the next question? \nOperator: The next question is from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead. \nFrancisco Riquel: Wanted to ask about NII in the UK and in the U.S., if you can please update your guidance in the UK I see lending is week following a local mortgage market is declining, asset spreads are low, the deposit betas are still relatively low. How do you see all these dynamics from going forward and the NII? And also in the US, you are gaining market share, but are you gaining new clients or do you paying out for deposits. How do you see the beta compared to the local peers and - in absolute terms going forward and then NII there in the US? Thank you. \nHector Grisi: Thank you, Francisco. Okay. Let me give you the details, okay? In the - let's talk about first about the UK. NII, it was up double-digit in the first half of \u201823, okay? It was driven mainly by higher rates on the strong focus on managing the spreads and profitability. Although the UK tends to be more competitive than other Europeans markets as you know, okay?  So we're putting profitability ahead of market share, okay? And we have a lower risk appetite, but we're expecting good performance to continue leading to and NIM expansion, okay? So, we expect it to stabilize towards the second half. Okay, 2023 with a high-single-digit growth on higher rates. And despite the lower volumes that we have because of what I just explained about profitability, okay?  In the second quarter, NII was flattish. Okay? Higher yields on loans did not offset the higher cost of retail funding and the slowdown in new originations, okay? In terms of the betas, Jose will tell you afterwards that I tell you about what's going on in the U.S.  In terms of the U.S., overall, as you have seen has one better than expected given the change of mix towards prime, okay as I explained in detail, lower yield, but also better risk profile and the lower grade provisioning is helping us, okay? NII is flattish in the quarter and year-on-year on funding pressures on the wholesale and retail as you know, a lot of this is funded by wholesale, as well and a common trend across the sector which has been partially offset by higher yields that we have.  Santander, U.S. betas are above the what we expected but lower than the average of our peers. Just to give you exactly what's going on. And we expect NII to be down mid-single-digit on lower originations and also the higher funding pressure again in line with the peers.  However, given the strong behavior that we have on the labor market and seeing the performance on the first half, the US NII could do better than we expect, okay? U.S. NII is not the only one that has a cost of risk and profitability, are also better than expected in the country, okay? So Jose, I don't know, if you can comment on the betas please. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Yes, betas in the UK, when we look at the cost of deposits today relative to the level of rates today, that's around slightly below 30% is increasing slightly in the quarter three percentage points. We still think that that will continue. So the UK is a market with less excess liquidity than Spain for instance. So we would expect as Hector said, margins probably - they were stable in the second quarter relative to the first and we would expect them to remain more or less flattish in the third and probably slightly going down from there.  In the US, as Hector said, we kept our deposits flat, paying less than our regional bank competitors. The beta in the U.S. is 36.8%, up two percentage points quarter-on-quarter. So after the spike that we saw in February, March, the betas in the US have remained very stable. And we are actually increasing deposit market share at a lower cost than our competitors. \nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Paco. Can we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Next question from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead. \nIgnacio Ulargui: Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two questions. One is on the Spanish loan book. You could update a bit on the trends that we have seen in the quarter. Year-on-year rate you see an 8% decline. If you could elaborate a bit on, what are the dynamics there and what we should expect going forward? And the second question is a bit at a Group level? If I just look to the first half cost of case, 100 around 106 basis points, you are speaking to the guidance below 120. And is there any region besides the US whether we could see some deterioration in the second half that makes you to keep that conservative guidance, which would imply around \u2013 a rate of around 135 basis points, 140 basis points in the second half to make the 120? Thank you. \nHector Grisi: Thank you, Ignacio. Let me tell you a little bit about what's the dynamics on the Spanish loan book and then, Jose we'll talk about your second question, okay? In the Spanish loan book, the dynamic that we have seen is quite clear, okay? We have seen low demand of credit, okay, which is impacting us a little bit, mainly also we have seen an increase on the prepayment mainly on the mortgages, okay?  Because of the increased rates, remember that a lot of a big percentage of our portfolio is some variable rates and floating rate. So in that sense, that\u2019s the dynamic that we have seen. And also we have seen due to the increased rates, the corporates and the SMEs being more cautious in new credit demand, okay? And the dynamics, we lived throughout the year continuing that way, let's see what happens at the beginning of the year. And also, if we can see more confidence a little bit on investment, okay? But now we see the dynamics in that way.  Please Jose, on the second one. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Morning, Ignacio. Cost of risk, well, we see cost of risk normalizing in the US as we discussed. Also in Mexico, where we are seeing the normalization of the cost of risk as we change the business, the business mix. In auto, it will very much depend on the amount of loans that we are able to sell, but it should remain stable in the second half of the year. So, we feel very comfortable that we will beat our 1.2% guidance for the end of the year. We expect it to be better than the 1.2% that we gave as a guidance. \nBegona Morenes : Thank you, Ignacio. Can we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Next question from Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nSofie Peterzens : Yeah. This is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my question. So, could you just explain that the difference between your reported net interest income which was \u20ac10.5 billion on the underlying \u20ac10.7 billion. What explains the \u20ac200 million delta? And are there any more one-offs in an interest income that we should be aware of I mean, in the short-term? And then, the second question would be on the capital headwinds you mentioned that you're expected to remain above 12%, but could you just outlined what capital or core equity Tier 1 headwinds you're expecting in the coming quarters or at least on the year-end. And also, if you could remind us what the Basel IV impacts are? Thank you. \nHector Grisi: Okay. Thank you. So, Jose will explain you the NII evolution. On capital, let me reiterate exactly what I said and then Jose and can expand a little bit. So, as I told you we expect to generate at least ten basis points of organic capital on average per quarter, okay? And that is included with the current remuneration policy that we have, okay? So, as a result, what I told you we will be on track to meet our target to be above 12%. Also with the final implementation of Basel III comes into effect in 2025 to be precise on that point. Jose will comment a little bit more on that and explain you the NII evolution. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Yeah. So, Sofie. Hi, good morning. As I said, we don't expect any headwinds significant headwinds from any of the three big components that could affect capital regulatory or supervisory charges, inorganic charges or other charges basically market-related pensions, intangibles, we don't see significant headwinds in the second half of the year.  In terms of BASEL III, we have seen the proposal. It\u2019s still a proposal. So we need to wait to see exactly how is - how the regulation is approved. We still think we will have an impact of between 40 to 60 basis points, probably and again depending on how this is finally written, probably towards the lower end of that range, if things are confirmed when the final proposal is approved.  In terms of the accounting, well, I think Investor Relations will give you more details about - this is pretty detailed. But in the first half, there is no impact or no adjustments between net interest income statutory and underlying zero. What happened in the first quarter is, we had an positive adjustment of \u20ac211 million and we have reversed exactly the same amount in the second quarter, which by the way in terms of the \u20ac20 billion, it's a very small amount.  So, no adjustments to NII in the first half. What we added to underlying in the first quarter was reversed in the second quarter. There are other adjustments in the P&L, but basically netting out in most cases will happen in the first quarter in the second quarter. But Investor Relations will give you all the details line-by-line of the differences between the first and the second quarter. Thanks Sofie.\nBegona Morenes : Thank you, Sofie. Can we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Next question from Marta S\u00e1nchez Romero from Citi. Please go ahead. \nMarta S\u00e1nchez Romero : Thank you very much. My first question is on the digital bank. Could you please provide an update on your strategy for gathering deposits here. You've raised possibly \u20ac3.4 billion year-to-date, but seems a bit below what you had planned a few months ago. And also possibly, you are trying at 200%. So how much more deposit do you expect to get? And where do you feel like you need to put rates in order to be - to be more successful in Northern Europe and Germany?  The second question is a follow-up on mortgages in the UK? You are shrinking pretty fast for \u20ac1 billion per quarter. When do you expect to stabilize that book? Thank you. \nHector Grisi: Thank you, Marta. Okay, on the study the open bank is quite clear. Okay. And we just don't have open bank as the only vehicle to raise deposits. We have some other vehicles also. We are having some of the other different countries, okay? We believe that strategy is right? And the one that we manage at open bank is going along to our expectations and we believe that we are going to continue to manage that accordingly. Okay?  And in the some other different initiatives that we have, for example in Germany and some other places, the study has been proving very successful and we don't believe we need to basically continue raising rates depending on what the market reacts to it. Okay? So we're going to be moving it according to the market.  In terms of mortgages in the UK, I was very specific about what we're thinking in terms of profitability, okay? And the way we're managing the portfolio. First of all, we've been very cautious in the way we manage and our risk appetite is being very prudent in the way we\u2019re managing the UK, okay? If we see that there is a change of how we see the market, then we'll adjust at the point. But right now, we\u2019re concentrated in the two things I told you. First of all, profitability and being cautious on the risk appetite there. If we see one of these changes, then we will adjust in any way. I don't know Jose, do you like to comment a little bit more? \nJose Garcia-Cantera : In the digital consumer bank, now includes open bank. We have \u20ac60 billion in deposits, like you said. And I think we obviously manage that to maximize profitability. So it's not only a question of the amount of deposits, but the question is, managing the margins in a business that has negative sensitivity to rates. And I think we've been very successful if you compared these figures to what it was a couple of years ago and you look at margins and interest rate sensitivity management, I think you have to look at a whole picture and I think we've been very successful in managing interest rate sensitivity in a business that is naturally \u2013 that has naturally negative sensitivity to raising rates. Thanks Marta. \nBegona Morenes : Thank you, Marta. Can we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Next question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead. \nAndrea Filtri : Yes. I wanted to get more clarity in basically in page so to speak of [Indiscernible] going to the different geographies and particularly you've given a lot of detail on NII in a lot of countries. Can you do the same for Brazil please? And the second question is on Spain. And if you could split the drivers of NII there between the effect of increasing interest rates of deposit beta and the ALCO portfolio contribution? Thank you. \nHector Grisi: Okay. Thank you, Andrea. Let me explain a little bit, the NII in Brazil, and then Jose will give you the details of the drivers of NII and the betas in Spain, okay? Yeah, in Spain. So to start, I mean, Brazil NII, okay, performance in the recent quarter has explained first of all on loans in 2021 I have been very specific on that. We have become very much conservative and we have changed the mix, okay?  And we have grown volume selectively, okay, changing the loan mix the low mix \u2013 the loan mix to lower risk on deposits, okay. The fast increasing rates, means a rapid rise in the cost of deposits, okay. We expect NII in the second half of \u201823 to be higher than in the first half of the year leading to a flat NII in the year with a substantial improvement in \u201924, okay? If we see that the rates basically start to come down because it's very important to understand that Brazil has negative sensitivity to the, we should gain traction. And we maintain, we're going to maintain our cautious stance, but we believe that we can go back to the market, okay? And we believe that the functional rates could fall in the second half, bringing the cost down in retail funding, okay?  And then in the drivers of NII in Spain and Jose will give you more details. Spain is one of the countries that has benefited most from the higher rates, okay? We will continue to see strong growth in clients. Just in the first half of the year we have 300,000 more active clients, okay? NII in Spain is up around 57% in the first half of the year and 60% just alone this second quarter is mostly supported by the pricing of the loan portfolio.  The height yields and remain contained on the cost of deposits. So, we have been managing very well in that sense. We expect double-digit growth for NII in 2023 and regarding the peak of NII in Spain, there are several things to consider that Jose will explain you as this will continue to reprice at least during the first half of \u201924, clients which we expect will continue to grow and betas, which will be key. We're still seeing a rational competition with low betas for individuals in a system which remains highly liquid, okay? So as of today, we don't speak much higher remuneration on the foreseeable future. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : So, hi Andrea. The ALCO in Spain we have \u20ac27 billion ALCO, \u20ac21 billion is a structural long-term held to collect with an average maturity of - duration of 7.7 years on a yield of 3.3%, 3.4%. And then we have \u20ac6 billion which is more associated with short-term liquidity management average duration of 1.2 years and yields slightly below at 3%.  We expect to continue increasing the amount of the ALCO portfolio in Spain to gradually reposition the balance sheet towards a lower positive sensitivity because as interest rates start reaching a peak, we don't want to run a balance sheet with such huge positive sensitivity to rates. So one way of doing that is not the only we are also taking other measures, but one way is obviously increasing the ALCO portfolio.  In terms of betas, the beta for deposits in Spain is 17.8%. If we exclude CIB, by the way this is three percentage points higher than in the first quarter. If we exclude CIB, the beta is 9.5%. The beta in CIB is around 60%. So I think I've given you all the numbers to figure out exactly how we see the betas and the NII going forward. Thanks. \nBegona Morenes : Thank you Andrea. Can we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Next question from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous. Please go ahead. \nBritta Schmidt : Yeah, hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give a bit more color on the NII increase, the absolute NII increase in Spain Q-on-Q? The customer spread was up less in the previous quarter, but NII was up a lot more? And then, secondly, you could also update us on the net interest income sensitivity in Brazil over one year and two years? And lastly on the \u20ac500 million rate benefits that you see more so than previously. Can you give us an idea as to where you see them and how much of that has been recognized in the current runrate? Thank you. \nHector Grisi: Okay. So let me go backwards here. Yeah, in the first half, the sensitivity was more or less \u20ac500 million higher than what we - the guidance we gave in - at the Investor Day. We would expect more or less a similar amount in the second half in Euros. So, we - relative to the figures, we gave at Investor Day, the interest rate sensitivity in Euros due to the fact that obviously rates are higher and we are seeing better betas remember that the betas we use to give that sensitivity at Investor Day in Euros were around 30%. We are below 20% right now and it's already half of the year. So we would expect another \u20ac500 million more in the second half over \u20ac1 billion higher than what we mentioned at Investor Day.  NII sensitivity in Brazil I'm going to give you the rest of the currencies, as well. So if today, we had a 100 basis points parallel shift upwards, we would make \u20ac1.1 billion, \u20ac1.2 billion more in Euros. \u20ac250 million, more in the UK, flat slightly negative in the US and \u20ac100 million less in Brazil.  I think we gave you all the details to understand the NII sensitivity in Spain, but we can take it offline and if you wanted, you know, more detail analysis, but I think we gave you all the details. I give you the composition of the balance sheet by repricing on the asset side. So I think that's sufficient, I think, but we will take it, we will take it offline. \nBegona Morenes : Thank you, Britta. Can we have the next question please? \nOperator: The next question is from Carlos Cobo Catena from Societe Generale. Please go ahead. \nCarlos Cobo Catena : Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Just a quick follow up for NIM capital. You mentioned the finance impact, could you please quantify that in terms of stock and one single specific impact on risk-weighted assets just to clear that out from other impacts? Thank you. \nHector Grisi: Okay. So, the stock finance is seasonal. It tends to go up in December, which is the peak in the year, then it goes down in March, goes up a little bit in June and then same in September to peak again in the December. This year, the increase in June was higher than we expected. We are talking around \u20ac6 billion in total risk-weighted assets from stock financein the first half. \nBegona Morenes : Thank you, Carlos. Can we have, what I believe is the last question please. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. \nOperator: Next question Fernando Gil de Santiva\u00f1es from Bestinver. Please go ahead. \nFernando Gil de Santiva\u00f1es : All right, thank you for taking my question. Two questions please. One is on Poland. What we expect in terms of mortgage provisions related to these funds going forward at least you can comment on the average and this was helping out. And a second one is on average rate growth I am looking at your key figures and Poland figures I am looking at loans \u2013 loan growth and FX impacts and it seems like part of the result increase in \u2013 and if you can comment on why it\u2019s happening there and those would be changing? Thank you very much.\nHector Grisi: Okay, so Fernando, what you said at the beginning was mortgage provisions in Poland? Yeah. Okay. So, Fernando, let me tell you exactly how we are in Poland, okay, up to today, okay? And with the extra that we did, okay, we believe that is completely adequate. Okay, we're talking about that in the blended provisions that we have we are provisioned up to 58%, okay, of the outstanding that we have, okay and we believe that's enough to sustain exactly what needs to be done over there given the dynamics that we have seen in the market, and if you basically changing towards lot these when the these mortgages just started be about there, okay?  So I believe that we're at the right point and we believe the provisions at this level is completely adequate, okay?  On the second, I will have Jose give you the answer. Thank you. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : No, as I explained, loan growth year-on-year was zero. Risk-weighted assets increased 2%, half of which is FX and I can\u2019t take you through the composition of risk-weighted assets by country. But half of the risk-weighted asset inflation has to do with FX. Of the other half, we had some positives and negatives. As I said, we have contraction in the UK. We have contraction in terms of risk-weighted assets ex stock finance in auto, a slight contraction in Europe. And then we have the contraction in Europe and also risk-weighted asset growth both in ex FX in Mexico and in Brazil. \nBegona Morenes : Thank you Fernando. I'm unclear if there are any further questions?\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. Please go ahead. \nIgnacio Cerezo - UBS: Yeah. Hi, good morning. Sorry, it\u2019s just a quick follow-up on Brazil. If you can give us a little bit more color or at least ballpark magnitude of the substantial growth of NII you are expecting in \u201824 and the sensitivity to rates, Jose was mentioning so I guess, it\u2019s probably around yeah 1% for 100 basis points decline. So, just trying to understand basically, I guess, what kind of magnitude in terms of acceleration of NII you are expecting next year in Brazil. Thank you. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Okay. Thank you, Ignacio. I will answer the first part of the question and then Jose you will help me out with the rest, okay? This is sensitivity. What I told you is that, we believe that the worst is over in Brazil. Okay, and we're starting to see a little bit more growth in the portfolio. Okay. So we're changing that around.  We're starting to basically go back to the open market, which, you know, in \u201821 we decided basically to come out of it, given the what we saw in the core environment, okay. So at this point, we believe that Brazil is going to be able to turn around and also we see that the rates are going to be helping us out because we believe that the rate in August should start coming down.  So in that sense, we don't know exactly how the trends are going to work. But we see that is - this is coming much better than we expect okay. And we see that we're going to end up the year basically flattish to where we started, okay. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : So, hi, Ignacio. We Believe interest rates in Brazil will start coming down in August. They are at 13.75 our central scenario is for rates during the year at around 12, twelve and a quarter and then probably below 10 by the end of next year. So NII, when you look at sequentially quarter-on-quarter, NII probably will be flattish in the third, but it should increase in the fourth and more so into next year and the exact sensitivity, I mentioned the sensitivity to higher rates, but the sensitivity in Brazil to a 100 basis point.  But it is a parallel shift I insist the parallel shift, which is not what will happen probably because we are what we will see is lower rates in the short end of the curve, but flattish in the long end of the curve. But through a parallel shift, a drop in 100 basis points will generate \u20ac140 million higher revenue in Brazil. Thank you Ignacio.\nBegona Morenes : Thank you, Ignacio. I believe there are no further the questions. So thank you everybody, for your attendance and the Investor Relations team is at your disposal for any other questions that you may have. Thank you very much.",

        "text": "Thank you, Begona. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me just share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our half one results on the context of how we are progressing with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day. Jose will then review our financial performance in greater detail. And then, I'll conclude with a few closing remarks.  Despite the challenges the financial system experienced at the beginning of the year, Q2 was another strong quarter for Santander demonstrating the strength and resilience of our strategy and unique business model even in times of market volatility.  We delivered record profit of \u20ac2.7 billion, an increase of 14% compared with Q2 in \u201822, thus plus 17% in constant euros.  In the first half of \u201823, profit was \u20ac5.2 billion, up 7% supported by robust customer revenue growth. Revenue increased double-digits year-on-year, supported by all regions and global businesses. Global scale and network businesses are contributing around 40% of total Group revenue. Our number of customers grew by nine million year-on-year taking the total to 164 million and loans increased by 1% and deposits by 5%.  The Group continues progressing towards a simpler and more integrated model through One Transformation. The program that is accelerating our structural model change to drive efficiency improvement, and growth in profitability.  As a result, our efficiency ratio improved one point-three percentage points year-on-year to 44.2% and our net operating income grew double-digits. Our return on tangible equity RoTE rose 80 basis points year-on-year to 14.5, while our earnings per shares improved 13% year-on-year supported by greater profit and share buybacks.  At the same time, our strong balance sheet with solid and sound capital ratio, liquidity at comfortable levels and robust credit quality contributed to solid profitable growth, value creation, and shareholder remuneration. These results allow us to deliver value creation in terms of TNAVps plus EPS year-on-year of 11%, of which represents an increase of more than \u20ac6 billion in the first six months of the year.  Moving on to the income statement. Firstly, remember that as we usually do, we are presenting growth rates, both in current euros and constant euros. This quarter, there was no material difference between them. As I have just mentioned, profit increase in the first half, supported by, first of all, a strong line performance with all the regions and global businesses growing; cost in line with our expectations growing 1% point below the rate of inflation; double-digit growth in net operating income to approximately \u20ac16 billion, which demonstrates the strength of our results; and low loss provisions normalizing land with our expectations.  These Trends resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record 4% higher than in Q1, even after the following impacts, net of taxes recorded in Q2. The SRF contribution of more than \u20ac200 million and additional Swiss mortgage provisions in Poland of \u20ac140 million and one-offs in Brazil of \u20ac137 million. Jose will go into more detail on all of these points later on.  This was a great first half, that makes us confident that we will deliver on our 2023 targets. Good business dynamics are translating into double-digit revenue, growth; our efficiency ratio improved as a result of good cost control and revenue trends; our cost of risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below 1.2% at year end.  CET1 was 12.2 after profitably growing our businesses organically, and at a comfortable levels allowing us to accrue funds to meet our shareholders\u2019 remuneration targets of a 50% payout. Our RoTE also grew year-on-year to 14.5 on track to reach our target at would already be close to 15% if we don't analyze extraordinary banking tax on revenue earned in Spain.  As we announced at our Investor Day we have entered into a new phase of value creation that will help us grow TNAVps per share plus EPS at a double-digit during the year \u2013 or through the cycle.  I like to spend a couple of minutes updating you on the progress of our transformation plan, now that we are six months down the road from our Investor Day. We are transforming the Bank in the right way because we're structurally changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. We are making great progress in the implementation of One Transformation, creating a common operating model and technology for our retail business across our entire footprint.  To better serve our customers and to improve efficiency and increase the size and profitability of our customer base we are delivering across the three, pillars of One Transformation. In simplification, we already have reduced 5% our number of products, nearly 400 fewer products in 2023. We are progressing in our digital self-service model, increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact center by 17% just alone in the first quarter of \u201923, compared with the same period last year.  We are digitalizing the onboarding process and to enter in Mexico. This initial pilot has resulted in a 36% growth in digital accounts per month, compared to those in 2022. And we have already captured around \u20ac70 million in savings so far in the U.S. from transformation and simplification initiatives. As you can see on this slide, the initial efficiencies for One Transformation, and the impact of our good sprint management in a context of higher rates, higher interest rates which our CFO will cover later in depth, have already contributed 85 basis points in efficiency improvements. Our Global and network business keep contributing to the Group's profitability and have already delivered another 43 basis points.  Multi Latinas and multi Europeans our initiatives to better serve our Multinational corporates and SMEs through regional coverage model are growing at a very high rates with revenue increasing by more than 70% year-to-date. In asset management, we have progressed to enter the alternative business is starting to serve open market and institutional segment and has reached more than \u20ac2 billion commitments already.  In payments, we have deployed that in Portugal and Argentina in the first half and we expect to launching latest in Chile, in the second half.  In Auto, we're increasing managing OEMs and retail relationships globally, expanding our partnerships in Europe to LATAM and the U.S. We have recently onboarded new partners in the US, leverage the existing agreements in Europe, which are expected to materialize in around \u20ac4 billion of new business per year. We have also deployed a new parent regional leasing platform in two markets and more countries will be added throughout \u201823 and \u201824.  Finally, our global technology capabilities have already resulted in 36 basis points improvement in the efficiency ratio. Our Global approach to technology has allowed us to capture \u20ac80 million in savings this year, mainly driven by One Transformation and efficiencies from the recent development and deployment of Gravity in two countries, which has contributed with \u20ac31 million in savings in the first half. A new global agreement with vendors, which represent around \u20ac40 million in cost reduction year-to-date.  The actions that we are beginning to carry out as a part of One Transformation, which we are expanding across the Group are starting to be reflected on cost and on operational efficiencies. As you can see on this slide, simplification has already driven significant improvements in our cost and revenue per active customer ratios.  The solid progress we are making with the process digitalization and automation to capture efficiencies enables us to spend less time on operations in branches, and turn the branch, network into a powerful sales and advisory channel.  Portugal has already taken out most of the operational activities from the branches freeing up branch employees, so that they can spend more time supporting customers and commercial activities. We're extrapolating this to other of our banks. In only six months through One Transformation, we have already reduced the number of operational FTEs per million customers by 3%. We are already deploying global tech platforms to improve customer experience, leverage economies of scale, and extend best practices.  Open Digital Services, as we call it ODS, our cutting-edge front-end platform allows to deliver a best-in-class omni-channel experience to our customers. At the same time, that Gravity, our award-winning core banking platform drives significant efficiencies versus mainframe technology. We have integrated both in the U.S., so we will operate it on an end-to-end cloud-based retail technology stack core and omni-channel, which is already tested and will result in significant improvements in service quality and customer experience.  Our global and network businesses continue to contribute to this new phase of value creation. In CIB we continue growing strongly after record performance in 2022, beating the market. Our global presence has allowed us to grow at 24% year-on-year, well above the average of annual growth target of 10% for the period \u201820 to \u201825.  Because, first of all, we can provide a One-Stop shop service to our clients across all geographies, thereby capturing cross-border flows and because we bring CIB products and services to all wealth, retail and commercial clients across a group and vice-versa. As a result, revenue related to these two concepts which we call network revenue grew 27% year-on-year to \u20ac2 billion. Wealth management and insurance grew 25% percent year-on-year, well above our target and this has been boosted by the finance benefits obtained from the Santander network effect. A fundamental part of our value proposition in private banking is how unique combination of local presence and local reach, a global reach.  Our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another and that's the reason why customers have \u20ac50 billion in assets under management book abroad, 10% higher than one year ago.  Our payments business is also growing very strongly. Two years ago, we\u2019ve began to move our payments business on to scale global platforms. And, as of today, our payments platform already manages a significant part of all payments in the Eurozone and we are progressing in another key countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the UK. We are in the process of expanding our cards platform across the Group, delivering real-time digital processing capabilities to our banks, accelerating our business growth, as well as generating operational synergies of around \u20ac100 million per year during the next two years alone.  First delivery of the platform will be live in Brazil by the second half or 2023. In auto we continue to prioritize profitability, our market share growth in a context of rising interest rates.  Our transformation plan, which is making us more - much more efficient and increasing contribution of our global and network businesses is helping us reach our 2025 profitability targets across all regions and businesses. As I mentioned earlier, the Group's RoTE rose 80 basis points year-on-year to 14.5% and would be around 15% if we didn't analyze the extraordinary banking tax in Spain, which is in line with the Group's targets for 2022 - sorry \u201823 and \u201825.  Jose will now go in more detail through the Group\u2019s first half performance. Please Jose. "

        "text": "Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. [Audio Gap] and Latin America driven by growth in volumes and fees. Digital Consumer Bank benefited from asset repricing actions and gains on financial transactions due to FX hedges. We also saw a strong performance across businesses. The only exception was auto, the result of lower leasing income in the US, which as in previous quarters, was affected by an increase in the share of end of leased vehicles, repurchase at the dealership. Revenue at the corporate center also improved up nearly \u20ac400 million due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from FX hedging, which negatively affected revenue last year. Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued its upward trend increasing 6% in the quarter alone, driven in particular by Europe. We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters.  First half 2023 was 15% higher year-on-year in constant euros with positive sensitivity to raising rates mainly in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in auto, North America and South America, which more than offset negative in duration sensitivity in Brazil, Chile and auto.  In terms of profitability, we have improved our margins every quarter since the first quarter of 2021. We continue to actively manage our credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment. Gains from credit yields outweighed higher funding costs. Thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration strategy adapted to each country's specific needs.  In Europe, we are strictly managing deposit costs, especially in Spain and Portugal where there is excess liquidity in the system and much lower credit amount. The UK has a more competitive environment in line with our expectations. In LATAM, deposit rates are more directly linked to market interest rates, which implies negative sensitivity and will benefit margins when rates start to decline over the next few months. Finally, in the U.S., deposit betas are higher due to the heightened competition following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. All-in-all, net interest income sensitivity to interest rates has resulted on \u20ac500 million above the assumptions that we shared during our Investor Day. Therefore, we are well on track to meet our double-digit NII growth guidance for 2023.  Turning now to fees, in an environment of low fee growth in general as a result of subpar loan demand, weaker activity, consumer activity and higher margins, our net fee income grew at 4% in the quarter compared with the same quarter last year and 5% in the first half year-on-year. CIB and PagoNxt are leading the way in terms of growth. CIB is increasing its share of leading roles and mandates and PagoNxt continued to expand total payment volumes, which rose 25% year-on-year and transactions 32%.  We also had a very good performance for cards with turnover increasing 9% year-on-year with fees growing 20%. Retail banking also continued to grow well, primarily driven by an increase in customers and transactionality . Wealth management and insurance grew less as customers moved to lower risk, fixed income products with lower fees and margins.  However, we saw volume improvements in both, private banking, net new money of \u20ac6.5 billion and Santander Asset Management over \u20ac3 billion net sales. Auto performance year-on-year was affected by the new insurance regulation in Germany in the first quarter but recovered significantly in the second quarter. In terms, of course, our transformation efforts that Hector took you through earlier are paying off despite initial investments cost in real terms are growing below the rate of inflation across most of our footprint reflecting the savings we are beginning to generate on our strict control.  This in turn is reflected in efficiency improvements led by Europe which improved seven percentage points, thanks to strong revenue gains together with a 2% fall in costs in real terms. As a result, Group efficiencies already at the bottom end of our target range where we expected to remain for the rest of the year.  Credit quality remains robust, across our footprint. The non-performing loan ratio remains stable in the context of an expected soft lending and a strong labor markets as unemployment is a key driver of credit quality. Of note, were the positive trends in Brazil driven by the more selective lending policies that we introduced a year and a half ago. We said in the fourth quarter of last year that we believe the Brazil NPL ratio had already peaked, and trends so far this year support that view having improved almost 60 basis points year-to-date.  In terms of cost of risk, we remain comfortably on track to meet our 2023 target to remain below 1.2%. Spain continues to perform well, with a 12-month cost of risk, down 16 basis points year-on-year, supported by the quality of the long book and improving macro conditions. Normalization in the US continues, but is more resilient than anticipated. Brazil remains elevated due to the unsecured individual borrowers portfolio, but we are seeing signs that cost of risk has stabilized. Brazil's 12-month cost of risk at the end of June was 4.74%, but if we annualize the first six months, that improved to 4.5%.  Mexico is increasing from low levels, mainly due to a changing mix towards unsecured loans which require more provisions upfront and obviously is more profitable. Other units, such as the UK, Portugal, and the digital consumer bank are rising, but from a very low base and should remain below all in line with through the cycle averages.  Moving on to our balance sheet structure. As we have discussed in previous presentations, our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment, product, and country. Moreover, our balance sheet is low-risk. The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low average loan to values. Loan growth year-on-year, was flat in constant Euros as growth in auto and consumer was offset by falls in CIB, mainly in Spain from very high levels in 2022, mortgages driven by early repayments in Europe and slowing demand from corporate, also in Europe.  We saw positive dynamics in North America, South America, and DCB. On the other hand, deposits continue to grow well, up 4% year-on-year following a \u20ac3 billion increase in the second quarter in constant Euros, reflecting new customer capture with more than offset mortgage prepayments. We saw growth across the Bank concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher rates.  Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria 75% of our deposits are transactional, which are stickier and a high proportion of all deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes. We have not seen any unusual movements in deposits in the year-to-date following market turmoil, particularly in the U.S.  In fact, deposits in the U.S. grew in the quarter and remained flattish year-to-date which implies that we are gaining market share in deposits and with an average cost which was well below our main competitors. Mutual funds have begun to recover, up 4% year-on-year following a year of instability in 2022.  To close, let me cover capital. Our fully low risk capital ratio remains at a comfortable level of 12.2% backed by strong organic capital generation, which was again 10 basis points, net of dividend accrual in the quarter. We accounted for the payout of the minority shareholders in Mexico, which costs four basis points in terms of capital.  We also had a series of other small positives and negatives this quarter that almost offset each other. We continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities, which is reflected in a front book RoRWA of 2.9% up from 2.5% in the first half of 2022, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity in excess of 15% - sorry, in excess of the current Group return on tangible equity, which will support profitability going forward.  Additionally, we continue to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of risk-weighted assets with positive economic value added progressing well, towards our Investor Day target of 85 in 2025. This increased profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years and we are confident our capital ratio will remain above 12% even after taking into account, the final implementation of BASEL III on January 1st 2025.  Let me turn it back to Hector for his concluding remarks. Thank you. "

        "text": "Thank you, Jose. In summary, Q2 of \u201823 was another strong quarter supported by customer growth, double-digit revenue increase, and also backed by strong performance by all the regions and businesses. We are accelerating the structural change to a simpler and more integrated model through One Transformation spreading the initiative all across the Group, which is driving efficiency improvement, and also profitable growth.  A rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth, calue creation and shareholder remuneration. In summary, we have a very strong first half of the year and we are confident that we will achieve our 2023 targets and remunerate our shareholders in line with our 50% payout policy supported by our global and network businesses while we continue with our structural model transformation.  We see upside potential for further net interest income growth in the coming quarters, as tailwinds in Europe and Mexico, are expected to remain and inflation and interest rates in our largest Latin American - Latin American countries seem to have picked or nearly picked resulting in a positive outlook for margins in the next 6 to 9 months.  Cost of risk is normalizing in line with our expectation. In a context of an expected soft landing of the economy and a strong labor markets, we continue to see resilient customer and corporate behavior in most of the geographies. Group RoTE has reached 14.5% in the first half and we expect to close above 15% at the end of the year.  All in all, our TNAV plus cash dividend is growing at a double-digit, well on track with our target of average growth through the cycle.  And now, we will be happy to take any of your questions.

        "text": "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call - my question. The first question would actually be on Brazil. Margin stabilized quarter-on-quarter, it\u2019s still a bit under pressure year-on-year. I was wondering what evolution you expect for the rest of the year? And also on cost of risk what's the Outlook there? Then the second question would actually be on capital. So basically the capital generation in this quarter was only three basis points a bit below the runrate you have discussed in previous quarters. I reckon that this partially has to do with the Mexico minorities incorporation, but I was wondering how do you see this evolving throughout the rest of the year? And also, what is behind the increase in RWAs in this quarter? Thank you very much. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Thank you, Carlpos. What I'll do is, I'll \u2013 last - the first question on. Brazil we will give you a comment on capital and then Jose will tell you a little bit about what's going on with increasing RWA, okay? In terms of the Brazil margin quarter-on-quarter, as we say, basically is explained by the following: our launch since 2021, we have become much more conservative and growth \u2013 grown volumes very selectively changing the loan mix to lower risk. Okay? So we mainly get out - we're out of credit cards. Went on to Consignado, auto loans and mortgages.  On deposits also the fast increase in rates has meant a rapid rise in the cost of deposits, okay, as well as a change of the mix on the deposits. Rates are staying higher for longer has prevented the cost of deposit from coming down impacting NII. Remember that in Brazil, we have negative sensitivity to rates, okay? So Brazilian NIIs in the second quarter of \u201823 is already flat. Okay?  As we set and Jose was very precise on that the worst since behind us and we are already seeing a reduction on the average cost of deposits and we also see an improved customer spread. Okay? So we expect NII in the second half of \u201823 to be higher than the first half of the year leading to a flat NII in the year with a substantial improvement in \u201824, okay?  In terms of the cost of risk, not only the macro outlook is improving, but since \u201821, I just \u2013 I explained, we've been very selective in the approach of the new lending extension and focusing to more secure and higher rate customers as I explained, okay? This is showing good results and we believe the worst, as I said, it repeatedly is worst - sorry the worst is behind now.  Cost of risk in the second quarter is already improving, versus the first quarter and the vintages are showing really good performance as we have seen. So we don't expect cost of risk that will deteriorate in Brazil in \u201823 versus \u201822, excluding the one-off that which implies staying close to around 4.6%, okay? And then, to be on capital to be very precise, we expect to generate at least 10 basis points of organical capital on average per quarter with the current shareholder remuneration policy that we put in place.  As a result, we will be on track to meet our target to be above 12% even when the final implementation of BASEL III comes into effect on January 1st on \u201825, okay? And with that, I don't know, Jose, you can comment on RWAs please. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera",
        "text": "Yes. Thank you. So, morning, Carlos. You are right. Loan growth was zero, but risk-weighted assets grew more or less than 2%. Half of that growth is due to FX as we consolidate the Latin America, basically, the peso and the Brazilian based assets in to the Group. Of the other half, half of the other half, so a substantial amount corresponds to a stock finance.  And this is due to the recovery of the new auto business in Europe. This will eventually translate into auto loans. So, this is obviously short term that will eventually lead a higher profitability going forward. When we look at the outlook, as Hector said, we don't expect any significant regulatory or supervisory capital impacts in the second half of the year.  We see no inorganic charges in the second half of the year. Obviously, it looks like the available for sale portfolio valuation also will stay relatively stable. We see improving profitability, as we have mentioned, particularly driven by higher NII in the second half. An increased weighted assets should be probably under control.  So net-net, we see a stronger capital - organic capital generation in the next couple of quarters again, leading to a capital that will remain well above 12% every quarter and building up sufficient capital to be above 12%, post BASEL III."

I know you've touched on it a little bit, maybe you can give a bit more detail as to why the provision was so low in the quarter? Is its collateral? Is it default rates? And when you think about the rest of the year maybe you can update us about the guidance. Would you expect in costs of risk for the full year. I think you gave us some color in Q1, maybe an updated view on the moving parts there.  And second question on Spain. Deposit is much more stable this quarter, previous quarter. I wonder if you can give - again a bit more color on the deposit migration and remuneration and, and when do you, what would you expect NII to peak in Spain, I am extrapolating, Spain, Portugal, which I assume it's the same dynamics. Thank you. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Alvaro. Okay, let me give you our outlook in the US, okay? And I explained it \u2013 it\u2019s basically the same dynamic I explained in the first quarter, okay? Credit provision, as you know decreased as credit quality is remaining robust and credit net charge-offs actually, what we called realized losses show better than anticipated performance.  And this is basically on the back, use prices continue to be strong, okay, as I explained and declining at slower pace that we previously anticipated. The changing out to loan portfolio mixed of our subprime, do you remember that I told you that before 2018, we had a lot more subprime than Prime and the change on the mix has helped.  Also, we have robust and better than expected labor market in the US, okay, which is sustaining that, okay? And out of customers that are delinquent exactly as I was explaining in the first quarter for more than 90 days are rolling into charge of status at historical low levels, okay? Normally, they were above 90%, 95%. Last quarter they were around 59%, this quarter around 67% percent, okay?  So it's still much better than we expect and much better than it was actually happening pre-COVID, okay? And in 2023, we expect cost or risk to continue on the normalization at around 2%. And after two years of artificially low figures given COVID et cetera, as I was saying, normalized levels should be below pre-pandemic, cost, or risk at around - you remember, pre-pandemic was around, 285, it\u2019s never going to get there, okay? Because of the change of mix and what I was explaining, okay? In terms of the Spain, okay?  In Spain, the deposits, I mean continued to be stable, okay, I at around, we have around \u20ac299 billion, okay? We have excess liquidity in Santander Spain, LTVs around 78% as is the case for the whole Spanish system that is around 80%. Quarterly the claim is most linked to CIB deposits, flat in retail in the quarter despite the early repayments of mortgages, okay. 60% compared to the same period of 2022 and increased volume of deposits moving off-balance sheet products.  Also, what we see between the first half of \u201923 versus the first half of \u201822 is plus 0.9% okay? So we have a different change of the mix with time deposits going up at around 61% up year-on-year, while demand deposits are going down around 5% on the back of the higher rates, driven by the growth of CIB, which allows us to maintain also - and maintain a stable net liquidity position, okay?  In terms of - what I was saying NII, we don't expect to peak yet. I mean we have still revisions and I will have horses playing in detail exactly how we\u2019ll see an eye evolution in the Spain. "

        "text": "Good morning, Alvaro. Let me talk about all the Corporate Center, because Santander SA more than and Spain because this is going to give you a better view of our Euro sensitivity to rates in Spain. So we have assets of \u20ac330 billion, 60% floating 40% fixed. This fixed includes the ALCO, which is \u20ac27 billion that we've been buying recently with an average duration of six years on an interest rate of over 3%.  We also have intra-group transactions, et cetera, money markets that are fixed, but these are very short term. So they will reprice as short term ULIBOR actually goes up. Of the floating \u20ac200 billion, \u20ac65 billion. will reprice or reprices with 12-month ULIBOR. We expect the - if we use today\u2019s ULIBOR, compared with the average of the first half, so let\u2019s assume that the ULIBOR remains flat in the first half of next year, we have at least 50 basis points pick up in the repricing of this part of the portfolio next year.  And then we have 60 \u2013 sorry, \u20ac30 billion with reprices with a six months \u20ac40 billion with a three months and \u20ac65 billion with one month. So, we would still expect significant repricing upwards in the first half of next year, as interest rates in Europe may go up once or twice, but as they stabilize, we will still have significant repricing of a big chunk of the portfolio in the first half of next year.  So obviously, the asset yields are expected still to expand well into 2024. Obviously, margins will depend on the cost of deposits but as Hector said, we are not seeing any pressures today to increase their remuneration of retail deposits. We are already paying almost ULIBOR for CIB deposits, institutional deposits, but we don't see any pressures on the retail side of deposits, which means that probably the peak in net interest margins will not happen until well into 2024 in the Eurozone.

It was driven mainly by higher rates on the strong focus on managing the spreads and profitability. Although the UK tends to be more competitive than other Europeans markets as you know, okay?  So we're putting profitability ahead of market share, okay? And we have a lower risk appetite, but we're expecting good performance to continue leading to and NIM expansion, okay? So, we expect it to stabilize towards the second half. Okay, 2023 with a high-single-digit growth on higher rates. And despite the lower volumes that we have because of what I just explained about profitability, okay?  In the second quarter, NII was flattish. Okay? Higher yields on loans did not offset the higher cost of retail funding and the slowdown in new originations, okay? In terms of the betas, Jose will tell you afterwards that I tell you about what's going on in the U.S.  In terms of the U.S., overall, as you have seen has one better than expected given the change of mix towards prime, okay as I explained in detail, lower yield, but also better risk profile and the lower grade provisioning is helping us, okay? NII is flattish in the quarter and year-on-year on funding pressures on the wholesale and retail as you know, a lot of this is funded by wholesale, as well and a common trend across the sector which has been partially offset by higher yields that we have.  Santander, U.S. betas are above the what we expected but lower than the average of our peers. Just to give you exactly what's going on. And we expect NII to be down mid-single-digit on lower originations and also the higher funding pressure again in line with the peers.  However, given the strong behavior that we have on the labor market and seeing the performance on the first half, the US NII could do better than we expect, okay? U.S. NII is not the only one that has a cost of risk and profitability, are also better than expected in the country, okay? So Jose, I don't know, if you can comment on the betas please. "

We still think that that will continue. So the UK is a market with less excess liquidity than Spain for instance. So we would expect as Hector said, margins probably - they were stable in the second quarter relative to the first and we would expect them to remain more or less flattish in the third and probably slightly going down from there.  In the US, as Hector said, we kept our deposits flat, paying less than our regional bank competitors. The beta in the U.S. is 36.8%, up two percentage points quarter-on-quarter. So after the spike that we saw in February, March, the betas in the US have remained very stable. And we are actually increasing deposit market share at a lower cost than our competitors. "

Year-on-year rate you see an 8% decline. If you could elaborate a bit on, what are the dynamics there and what we should expect going forward? And the second question is a bit at a Group level? If I just look to the first half cost of case, 100 around 106 basis points, you are speaking to the guidance below 120. And is there any region besides the US whether we could see some deterioration in the second half that makes you to keep that conservative guidance, which would imply around \u2013 a rate of around 135 basis points, 140 basis points in the second half to make the 120? Thank you. "

        "text": "Thank you, Ignacio. Let me tell you a little bit about what's the dynamics on the Spanish loan book and then, Jose we'll talk about your second question, okay? In the Spanish loan book, the dynamic that we have seen is quite clear, okay? We have seen low demand of credit, okay, which is impacting us a little bit, mainly also we have seen an increase on the prepayment mainly on the mortgages, okay?  Because of the increased rates, remember that a lot of a big percentage of our portfolio is some variable rates and floating rate. So in that sense, that\u2019s the dynamic that we have seen. And also we have seen due to the increased rates, the corporates and the SMEs being more cautious in new credit demand, okay? And the dynamics, we lived throughout the year continuing that way, let's see what happens at the beginning of the year. And also, if we can see more confidence a little bit on investment, okay? But now we see the dynamics in that way.  Please Jose, on the second one. "

Also in Mexico, where we are seeing the normalization of the cost of risk as we change the business, the business mix. In auto, it will very much depend on the amount of loans that we are able to sell, but it should remain stable in the second half of the year. So, we feel very comfortable that we will beat our 1.2% guidance for the end of the year. We expect it to be better than the 1.2% that we gave as a guidance. "

So, could you just explain that the difference between your reported net interest income which was \u20ac10.5 billion on the underlying \u20ac10.7 billion. What explains the \u20ac200 million delta? And are there any more one-offs in an interest income that we should be aware of I mean, in the short-term? And then, the second question would be on the capital headwinds you mentioned that you're expected to remain above 12%, but could you just outlined what capital or core equity Tier 1 headwinds you're expecting in the coming quarters or at least on the year-end. And also, if you could remind us what the Basel IV impacts are? Thank you. "

So, as I told you we expect to generate at least ten basis points of organic capital on average per quarter, okay? And that is included with the current remuneration policy that we have, okay? So, as a result, what I told you we will be on track to meet our target to be above 12%. Also with the final implementation of Basel III comes into effect in 2025 to be precise on that point.

As I said, we don't expect any headwinds significant headwinds from any of the three big components that could affect capital regulatory or supervisory charges, inorganic charges or other charges basically market-related pensions, intangibles, we don't see significant headwinds in the second half of the year.  In terms of BASEL III, we have seen the proposal. It\u2019s still a proposal. So we need to wait to see exactly how is - how the regulation is approved. We still think we will have an impact of between 40 to 60 basis points, probably and again depending on how this is finally written, probably towards the lower end of that range, if things are confirmed when the final proposal is approved.  In terms of the accounting, well, I think Investor Relations will give you more details about - this is pretty detailed. But in the first half, there is no impact or no adjustments between net interest income statutory and underlying zero. What happened in the first quarter is, we had an positive adjustment of \u20ac211 million and we have reversed exactly the same amount in the second quarter, which by the way in terms of the \u20ac20 billion, it's a very small amount.  So, no adjustments to NII in the first half. What we added to underlying in the first quarter was reversed in the second quarter. There are other adjustments in the P&L, but basically netting out in most cases will happen in the first quarter in the second quarter. But Investor Relations will give you all the details line-by-line of the differences between the first and the second quarter. Thanks Sofie."

You've raised possibly \u20ac3.4 billion year-to-date, but seems a bit below what you had planned a few months ago. And also possibly, you are trying at 200%. So how much more deposit do you expect to get? And where do you feel like you need to put rates in order to be - to be more successful in Northern Europe and Germany?  The second question is a follow-up on mortgages in the UK? You are shrinking pretty fast for \u20ac1 billion per quarter. When do you expect to stabilize that book? Thank you. "

We are having some of the other different countries, okay? We believe that strategy is right? And the one that we manage at open bank is going along to our expectations and we believe that we are going to continue to manage that accordingly. Okay?  And in the some other different initiatives that we have, for example in Germany and some other places, the study has been proving very successful and we don't believe we need to basically continue raising rates depending on what the market reacts to it. Okay? So we're going to be moving it according to the market.  In terms of mortgages in the UK, I was very specific about what we're thinking in terms of profitability, okay? And the way we're managing the portfolio. First of all, we've been very cautious in the way we manage and our risk appetite is being very prudent in the way we\u2019re managing the UK, okay? If we see that there is a change of how we see the market, then we'll adjust at the point. But right now, we\u2019re concentrated in the two things I told you. First of all, profitability and being cautious on the risk appetite there. If we see one of these changes, then we will adjust in any way. I don't know Jose, do you like to comment a little bit more?

And I think we've been very successful if you compared these figures to what it was a couple of years ago and you look at margins and interest rate sensitivity management, I think you have to look at a whole picture and I think we've been very successful in managing interest rate sensitivity in a business that is naturally \u2013 that has naturally negative sensitivity to raising rates.

        "text": "Okay. Thank you, Andrea. Let me explain a little bit, the NII in Brazil, and then Jose will give you the details of the drivers of NII and the betas in Spain, okay? Yeah, in Spain. So to start, I mean, Brazil NII, okay, performance in the recent quarter has explained first of all on loans in 2021 I have been very specific on that. We have become very much conservative and we have changed the mix, okay?  And we have grown volume selectively, okay, changing the loan mix the low mix \u2013 the loan mix to lower risk on deposits, okay. The fast increasing rates, means a rapid rise in the cost of deposits, okay. We expect NII in the second half of \u201823 to be higher than in the first half of the year leading to a flat NII in the year with a substantial improvement in \u201924, okay? If we see that the rates basically start to come down because it's very important to understand that Brazil has negative sensitivity to the, we should gain traction. And we maintain, we're going to maintain our cautious stance, but we believe that we can go back to the market, okay? And we believe that the functional rates could fall in the second half, bringing the cost down in retail funding, okay?  And then in the drivers of NII in Spain and Jose will give you more details. Spain is one of the countries that has benefited most from the higher rates, okay? We will continue to see strong growth in clients. Just in the first half of the year we have 300,000 more active clients, okay? NII in Spain is up around 57% in the first half of the year and 60% just alone this second quarter is mostly supported by the pricing of the loan portfolio.  The height yields and remain contained on the cost of deposits. So, we have been managing very well in that sense. We expect double-digit growth for NII in 2023 and regarding the peak of NII in Spain, there are several things to consider that Jose will explain you as this will continue to reprice at least during the first half of \u201924, clients which we expect will continue to grow and betas, which will be key. We're still seeing a rational competition with low betas for individuals in a system which remains highly liquid, okay? So as of today, we don't speak much higher remuneration on the foreseeable future. "

        "text": "So, hi Andrea. The ALCO in Spain we have \u20ac27 billion ALCO, \u20ac21 billion is a structural long-term held to collect with an average maturity of - duration of 7.7 years on a yield of 3.3%, 3.4%. And then we have \u20ac6 billion which is more associated with short-term liquidity management average duration of 1.2 years and yields slightly below at 3%.  We expect to continue increasing the amount of the ALCO portfolio in Spain to gradually reposition the balance sheet towards a lower positive sensitivity because as interest rates start reaching a peak, we don't want to run a balance sheet with such huge positive sensitivity to rates. So one way of doing that is not the only we are also taking other measures, but one way is obviously increasing the ALCO portfolio.  In terms of betas, the beta for deposits in Spain is 17.8%. If we exclude CIB, by the way this is three percentage points higher than in the first quarter. If we exclude CIB, the beta is 9.5%. The beta in CIB is around 60%. So I think I've given you all the numbers to figure out exactly how we see the betas and the NII going forward. Thanks. "

And lastly on the \u20ac500 million rate benefits that you see more so than previously. Can you give us an idea as to where you see them and how much of that has been recognized in the current runrate? Thank you. "

We would expect more or less a similar amount in the second half in Euros. So, we - relative to the figures, we gave at Investor Day, the interest rate sensitivity in Euros due to the fact that obviously rates are higher and we are seeing better betas remember that the betas we use to give that sensitivity at Investor Day in Euros were around 30%. We are below 20% right now and it's already half of the year. So we would expect another \u20ac500 million more in the second half over \u20ac1 billion higher than what we mentioned at Investor Day.  NII sensitivity in Brazil I'm going to give you the rest of the currencies, as well. So if today, we had a 100 basis points parallel shift upwards, we would make \u20ac1.1 billion, \u20ac1.2 billion more in Euros. \u20ac250 million, more in the UK, flat slightly negative in the US and \u20ac100 million less in Brazil.  I think we gave you all the details to understand the NII sensitivity in Spain, but we can take it offline and if you wanted, you know, more detail analysis, but I think we gave you all the details. I give you the composition of the balance sheet by repricing on the asset side. So I think that's sufficient, I think, but we will take it, we will take it offline. "

So NII, when you look at sequentially quarter-on-quarter, NII probably will be flattish in the third, but it should increase in the fourth and more so into next year and the exact sensitivity, I mentioned the sensitivity to higher rates, but the sensitivity in Brazil to a 100 basis point.  But it is a parallel shift I insist the parallel shift, which is not what will happen probably because we are what we will see is lower rates in the short end of the curve, but flattish in the long end of the curve.

    "transcript": "Begona Morenes: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Banco Santander's conference call to discuss our financial results for the first 9 months of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation that we will be following today are available to you on our website.  Let me just highlight that during the presentation, when we refer to global and network businesses, we are following the definition which was given during our Investor Day last February as the new reporting and full management of the group through global businesses will begin in January '24.  I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Hector Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. Jose Garcia Cantera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]  With this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi. Hector, the floor is yours. \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Begona. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I'll talk about our 9 months results in the context of how we are progressing with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day. Jose will then review our financial performance in greater detail, and then I'll conclude with a few closing remarks.  As you can see, we had another strong quarter, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our unique business model even in times of market volatility as well as a solid execution of our strategy. We delivered record profit of \u20ac2.9 billion. That's an increase of 20% compared with Q3 in '22, that's 26% in constant euros. Profit for the first 9 months of '23 was \u20ac8.1 billion, up 13% in constant euros, driven by strong customer revenue growth. Revenue increased by double digit year-on-year, supported by all global businesses and all our regions.  Commercial activity remained solid. We added 9 million new customers in the last 12 months, bringing the total to 166 million. We continue to advance towards a simpler, more integrated model through our One Transformation, which is leading to efficiency improvements and growth in profitability. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 44%. Our return on tangible equity rose 126 basis points year-on-year to nearly 15%, while our earnings per share improved by 17% year-on-year, supported by profit growth and share buybacks.  We further strengthened our balance sheet generating capital in the quarter, even after deducting the share buyback on the way, and liquidity remains at comfortable levels and credit quality is quite strong. All of this led to strong shareholder value creation and attractive remuneration. TNAV plus DPS grew 12% during the last 12 months, and we have increased the cash dividend per share by 39% year-on-year.  Moving to the income statement. As always, we present growth rates in both in current and constant euros. Profit increased strongly continuing the positive trends of previous quarters, supported by, first of all, strong top line performance with growth in all our global businesses. We have improved efficiency as costs increased well below revenue, reflecting our transformation efforts, double-digit growth in net operating income to more than \u20ac24 billion, normalization of loan loss provisions in line with our expectations. And as I mentioned in the previous slide, these trends resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record, 9% above that of Q2 '23. Jose will go now into more detail on these points later.  These results maintained us on track to achieve our '23 targets, targets that we reiterate. First of all, good business dynamics led to double-digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved and remains at the lower end of our target range, even with investments in One Transformation. A strong balance sheet with cost of risk normalizing as expected and capital ahead of target with CET1 improving quarter-on-quarter. Our RoTE is close to 15% and should comfortably reach our target at year-end.  Looking closer at capital and value creation, our CET1 ratio has grown year-to-date from 12% to 12.3%, backed by strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and remunerating our shareholders according to our dividend policy. We continued to grow our shareholder value creation, which was up 12% in the first 9 months of the year, and we're increasing our shareholder remuneration with payout up to 50%.  In September, the Board of Directors approved an interim distribution against our first half results, which is being executed as follows: a cash dividend of \u20ac0.081 per share to be paid in November, 39% higher than equivalent in '22; a share buyback program of up to \u20ac1.3 billion that is currently underway. Since '21 and after completing the current program, Santander will have bought back 9% of its outstanding shares, buybacks -- through share buybacks.  We are progressing in our new phase of value creation, transforming the bank in the right way by changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. One Transformation, which implies creating a common operating platform and technology for our retail and commercial business across all of our geographies, will lead to improved customer service, efficiency and profitability.  In simplification, we have reduced the number of products by 8% in '23. That's almost 800 less products. In digitalization, we are making good progress with our digital self-service model, increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact centers by 16%. We have set up a fully digital end-to-end onboarding process in Mexico that takes just 6 minutes to complete. Since its launch in July, we have opened 36,000 new accounts. In the U.S., we have already captured around \u20ac114 million in savings from transformation and simplification.  As you can see on the slide, the initial efficiencies from One Transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 117 basis points in efficiency improvements. Our global and network businesses contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 39 basis points in efficiency gains. For example, multi-Latinas and multi-Europeans, initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model, are growing at very high rates, with revenue up by 50% in '23 year-on-year. In Private Banking, we continue boosting collaboration with CIB and corporates, which has generated over \u20ac160 million revenue this year or 13%.  In Brazil, we have acquired 117 new relationships that brought BRL 6 billion in net new money. In payments, Getnet already operates in 5 countries. We expect implementation in Chile in the next few months and in the U.K. in '24. In auto, we continued to strengthen our relationships with global OEMs. Since January '23, we have expanded 3 of our OEM partnerships to new countries.  Finally, our global technology capabilities have already resulted in a 29 basis points improvement in the efficiency ratio. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture \u20ac125 million savings this year, \u20ac55 million from the recent deployment of Gravity, \u20ac60 million from the new global agreements with vendors and \u20ac9 million from the implementation of new IT & Ops shared services.  Let's look at how One Transformation is reflected in cost and operational efficiencies. Simplification is driving significant improvements in our cost and revenue per active customer. Process automation is enabling us to spend less time on operations in branches and turn this into a powerful sales and advisory channel. Since our Investor Day, we have reduced the number of operational FTEs per million customers by 5%. We are already deploying global platforms to improve customer experience, leverage economies of scale and spread best practices.  We have implemented across the group, proprietary back-end Gravity, already deployed in 3 countries and CIB. This is delivering \u20ac55 million in efficiencies in '23, and we have executed 75 billion transactions this year alone, that's 10% of the group's total. We're expanding our cards platform across the group, delivering real-time digital processing capabilities to our banks and accelerating our business growth and will generate operational synergies of around \u20ac100 million per year when it's fully deployed.  Finally, we are being able to transfer the best-in-class products and processes from the country of origin to the rest of the group, which led to a strong value creation.  The contribution of our global and network businesses is clear. In CIB, we continued to grow strongly. Our global presence has allowed us to grow revenue by 21% year-on-year as we provide a one-stop shop service to all our clients, capturing cross-border flows and making CIB products and services available to our wealth, retail and commercial customers across the group and vice versa.  As a result, revenue from these 2 concepts, our network revenue grew by 27% year-on-year to \u20ac3 billion. Wealth Management and Insurance grew revenue 22% year-on-year, well above target, boosted by benefits of the Santander network effect. In Private Banking, a fundamental part of our value proposition is that our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another. Today, customers have \u20ac52 billion of assets under management booked abroad. That's 12% higher than a year ago.  Our payments business is growing strongly and faster than the market. Our Payments Hub has become one of the largest processors of account-to-account payments in Europe. Spain, the U.K. and CIB are already processing a significant payment volume through PagoNxt, while we execute full migration of all the group's A2A payments in the next 18 months.  In auto, we continue to prioritize profitability over market share growth in the context of rising interest rates. Global auto revenue was affected by lower lease income in the U.S. and the new regulation in Germany.  One Transformation is now being extended across the group, and the increasing contribution from our global and network businesses are helping us to reach our '25 profitability targets across regions and businesses. Some geographies and businesses have benefited from rising rates, and they should continue to do so in '24. As for those countries and the businesses that do not benefit from higher rates, they are already showing signs of improvement. This diversification, which is a clear competitive advantage, will lead to consistent profitable growth and value creation. The group's RoTE rose 126 basis points year-on-year to around 15%, as mentioned before.  Jose will go now in more detail to the group's performance. Thank you, Jose. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. I will take you through the main lines of the P&L in more detail. Starting with revenue. There was strong growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter. This was primarily supported by our retail business as we actively managed the interest rate tailwinds in Europe and Mexico and due to the positive fee performance in Latin America.  We delivered double-digit growth across most businesses, in particular, our network businesses, which made up 38% of total group revenue. The only exception was auto, which was affected by lower leasing income in the U.S. Revenue at the Corporate Center also improved by more than \u20ac500 million year-on-year due to higher liquidity buffer, remuneration and a lower impact from FX hedging.  Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued its upward trend, increasing 7% in the quarter, driven mostly by Europe and Mexico. We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters. Nine months 2023 was 16% higher year-on-year in constant euros on the back of positive sensitivity to rising rates, mainly in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in DCB, North America and South America.  In terms of profitability, we have improved our net interest margin every quarter since the first quarter of 2021. Gains from credit yields outweighed higher funding costs, thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration leading to a clear margin expansion. In Europe, we are strictly managing deposit costs, especially in Spain and Portugal, where there is excess liquidity in the system and lower credit demand. The U.K. has a more competitive environment, but betas remain in line with our expectations. In South America, deposit rates are more directly linked to market interest rates, which results in negative sensitivity to rising rates. Therefore, as interest rates are starting to decline, we are seeing improved NII trends.  In North America, in the U.S., betas continued to increase, although in line with our expectations, while net interest margin in Mexico expanded. Going forward, in Europe, we expect further benefits from portfolio repricing in the context of stable interest rates or a slight increase, which we expect will more than outweigh potential cost of deposit growth, at least in the first half of next year. At the same time, as I said, we expect to benefit from interest rate cuts in South America.  Turning to fees. In an environment of low fee income growth in general as a result of subdued loan demand and weak consumer activity, our net fee income grew 9% compared to the third quarter of '22 and 6% year-on-year with good performance across regions and businesses.  Retail Banking grew well, supported by a larger customer base and our tailored and targeted value propositions. Our global network businesses represented 42% of total group fees which -- with Corporate Investment Banking and PagoNxt leading the way in terms of growth. Corporate Investment Banking is increasing its share of leading roles and PagoNxt continued to expand its businesses, increasing total payment volumes 24% year-on-year and transactions 32%.  Wealth Management and Insurance was slightly up as customers move to lower value-added funds than bringing lower fees. However, we saw increased activity in both Private Banking and Santander Asset Management with 3 consecutive quarters of positive net sales. Auto performance increased year-on-year, driven by good performance in all our main markets.  In terms of costs, savings from One Transformation initiatives, which will become more evident in the coming quarters, are already offsetting our investments in tech and digitalization. Group cost declined 0.5% in real terms. And driving down the transaction cost per active -- the transactional cost per active customer, 2% in real terms, as Hector mentioned earlier. This in turn is reflected in efficiency gains led by Europe, which improved 6 percentage points with costs flat in real terms.  In North America and DCB, cost increased slightly in real terms, reflecting investments to accelerate transformation. Additionally, costs were also slightly affected by some perimeter effects, such as the incorporation of APS in the U.S. and MCE Bank acquisition and new Stellantis agreement in DCB. As a result, group efficiency remains at the bottom end of our target range where we expect it to stay for the rest of the year.  Credit quality remains robust across our footprint and in line or actually slightly better than our expectations, which is supported by strong labor markets and resilience in used car prices in the U.S. The NPL ratio was stable and in line with expected levels, and we remain comfortably on track to meet our 2023 cost of risk target of less than 1.2%.  Spain continues to perform well with a 12-month cost of risk down 9 basis points year-on-year, supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions. In other units such as the U.K., Portugal and the Digital Consumer Bank, the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels, and we expect it to remain below or in line with through-the-cycle averages.  Mexico is also increasing, although it remains at comfortable levels, mainly due to a change in mix towards unsecured loans in line with our strategy to improve profitability. Normalization continues in the U.S. in line with expectations. As we mentioned last quarter, cost of risk in Brazil seems to have reached a turning point. The 12-month cost of risk decreased for the second quarter in a row, and the NPL ratio improved 28 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the improving macro conditions and our focus on more secured and high-rated customers.  To close with our balance sheet structure, as we have discussed in previous presentations, our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment, product and country. Our balance sheet is low risk. The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low loan to values -- average loan to values. Loans decreased 2% year-on-year as a consequence of higher interest rates, reducing credit demand and driving early repayments, especially evident in Europe and especially evident within European mortgages. Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America and DCB.  On the other hand, deposits continued to grow well, up 4% year-on-year and 2% in the quarter as deposit inflows more than offset mortgage prepayments. Growth in the year was concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher rates. Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, 75% of our deposits are transactional, which are stickier and a high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes.  Mutual funds rose 11% with broad-based growth across all countries except the U.S., following a year of instability in 2022. Our fully loaded capital ratio improved to 12.3%, backed by strong organic generation of 45 basis points in the quarter which included 33 basis point charge in shareholder remuneration, 21 basis points related to the latest program of share buybacks that we are currently executing and 12 basis points for the cash dividend accrual.  We continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities, and this was reflected in a front book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the first 9 months of 2022, equivalent to a return on tangible equity above our current group return on tangible equity, which will support profitability going forward. Additionally, we continue to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of risk-weighted assets with positive economic value added, progressing well towards our Investor Day target of 85% in 2025. Increased profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years.  We are confident our fully loaded capital ratio will remain above 12%, even after taking into account the final implementation of Basel III in 2025 on a fully loaded basis.  That's all from my side. Hector, over to you. Thank you. \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Jose. To wrap up, these are the messages I will leave with you. Q3 was another strong quarter with customer and double-digit revenue growth supported by all regions and businesses. We are accelerating One Transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model, which is extracting value from our global and network businesses, driving efficiency gains and profitable growth.  We have strengthened our balance sheet and increased our CET1, while credit quality remains strong, in line with our expectations. All of this contributes to double-digit growth in shareholder value creation and increased remuneration, and we remain on track to meet our '23 targets.  The execution of our strategy, the progress we are making in our platforms and our local leadership makes us confident we can continue to grow and to increase profitability. We see further upside potential for NII growth from the portfolio repricing and potential interest rate hikes in Europe and positive outlook for the margins in South America.  Efficiency, already at the lower range of our '23 target, is expected to keep improving our revenue and cost as we increasingly realize One Transformation benefits. We expect the cost of risk to end the year better than target, and we expect it to remain at similar levels in '24.  At our Investor Day, we set a RoTE target of 15% to 17%. We expect to reach a RoTE above 15% by the year-end and continue to improve significantly during '24, and we see our fully loaded CET1 clearly above our 12% target even after the implementation of Basel III in January '25. As a result, we expect to progress in our target of double-digit shareholder value creation through the cycle, further supported by our last step towards the full implementation of One Santander, which will enable us to fully capture our in-market and global value.  And now, thank you. We would be happy to take your questions. \nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Hector. We're ready to start the Q&A session. Can we have the first question, please? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We already have the first question from Francisco Riquel from Alantra Equities. \nFrancisco Riquel : Yes. I want to focus on loan growth. In Spain has been particularly weak. It's down 10% year-on-year. The sector is minus 3%. I see that most of the 4% is related to CIB, which is down over 20%, but SMEs and mortgages are also weak. If you can comment the gap with the sector? We know demand this week, but you are below the sector.  And then more broadly in other regions, I mean, loans in the U.K. are also down 5%, sector is up 1%, Brazil is up by just 3%. The sector is growing 9%. So if you can elaborate on whether you are repricing margins over volumes, if you are more prudent on risk taking at this point in the cycle? So loan growth in general and in Spain, in particular. \nHector Grisi : Francisco, yes, basically, as you have said, loan growth has not been good in the -- all the year, I would say, Spain mainly. As you basically say, it's also being affected by the prepayments in some of the mortgages. If you see the portfolio of mortgages, we have seen -- I mean, normally, basically, we go down 3.5%. This basically, we have had prepayments up to \u20ac6.5 billion so far this year. And you're right. SMEs and mortgages basically have been not demanding credit as much. I believe people are being cautious in the way and trying to see how the economy evolves, even though employment has continued to be strong and demand continues to be strong. This is a fact, and we have seen the clients basically being cautious.  Nevertheless, if you see our portfolio in the rest of the countries, mainly Latin America has continued to grow. There, we have been maintaining and being very, very cautious in credit appetite, but also very focused on profitability. So we're growing the portfolio in Latin America in a very good way, but in a profitable way.  And also, you have seen that DCB has increased and has a substantial good development during the year, and we will continue to see that over the next few months. So all in all, we are 2% below in loans this year, but we foresee that once clients basically see that rates are starting to stabilize and the market basically has a more clear view of what's going on, I believe that credit will come back, little by little. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to just complement... \nJose Garcia-Cantera : No, just one final comment. Risk-weighted assets are down \u20ac2 billion in the quarter, but it's exclusively due to FX. So if we look -- if we exclude FX impacts on risk-weighted assets, risk-weighted assets are actually flat in the quarter, which is what matters most for profitability and capital. \nOperator: Next question from Antonio Reale from Bank of America. \nAntonio Reale : It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions from me, please. The first one is on the profitability outlook. And the second one on asset quality in the U.S. So starting with the first one. You've reiterated your guidance for the full year, which, if I'm not mistaken, implies a net profit of around \u20ac10.9 billion for this year. Can you confirm that's right? And how do you see profitability in 2024? It would be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing into next year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the U.S.  My second question is with respect to asset quality in the U.S. There was a big uptick this quarter, and you've been talking about normalization in cost of risk. And now we've seen lower used car prices and higher delinquencies, but neither of them were material changes. So the question is what's driving this? Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing specifically on asset quality? And related to that, I think you've confirmed your 200 basis points cost of risk for this year. What do you expect this number to look like next year? \nHector Grisi : Yes. Thank you, Antonio. Okay. On profitability, as I said during the presentation, I reiterate the 15% RoTE. So that basically gives you the numbers that you're looking for, okay? So in that sense, we're pretty comfortable on that. On '24, as I basically said, we see also the portfolio repricing. So we see a strong first half of the year in Europe. And then we see a strong second half of the year in Latin America when we see basically the dynamics changing. And you have seen that and you've seen that in the numbers of this quarter when basically you have seen Latin America basically performing better, okay? So in that sense, that can give you a very good idea and Jose will give you more details on that.  In terms of asset quality in the U.S., and I've been saying all along that in the past few quarters, it's very important to understand that it's always seasonal. If you take a look at what happened last year, in the third quarter, it was actually the same and we expected that, and we told you so. And -- but it's important to tell you that it's actually better than we expected. And also it's not going to go beyond the 200 basis points, as you correctly pointed.  In that sense also, we see that the portfolio is performing better in the sense that we see that people with 90-day delinquencies or above when it used to happen is we used to repossess about more than 90% of those cars is basically performing much better, and we are repossessing between 60% and 65% of those. If the threat continues like that and used car prices in the U.S. continue like that, we expect a better performance than we normally expect.  It's important that you understand that we have a completely different mix today in the portfolio. The portfolio that we had pre-COVID didn't have as much prime and near prime as we do today. Prime and near prime is at around 41% of the mix of the portfolio, though that basically tells you that we expect the asset quality to maintain at good levels. And also, the U.S. has been performing with a strong employment as well and the dynamic as well. So in that sense, I'm comfortable with the numbers we're giving you.  Jose, please, would you like to complement on the profitability? \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Yes. Just one final comment on U.S. asset quality. The cost of risk in 2019 was 2.85%. And given the changes in the mix that Hector mentioned, we don't expect to reach that -- those levels at all. And we would expect cost of risk in 2024 to be fairly flat, maybe slightly up compared to 2023 in the U.S.  In terms of profitability, well, we have -- we still have negative sensitivity to rates in Latin America. So as rates start going down, we will see accelerated momentum in NII in Brazil, in particular, coupled with higher loan growth and flat or slightly improving asset quality. So clearly, the profitability in South America as Hector mentioned is going to gain momentum throughout the year with a much better second half relative to the first half. \nHector Grisi : And in Europe, as he said, we still have a lot to reprice on the asset side. That's one example. In Spain, we have around \u20ac80 billion of mortgages. You know that they reprice around 112% every month. Well, in fact, we repriced 60% of the total in the first half relative to the second half. So in the first half of '24, we will still reprice a big chunk of our mortgage portfolio in Spain up year-on-year as they come to repricing.  So, asset repricing, particularly in Spain and, obviously, some beta pressures and the cost of deposit pressures with profitability still improving in the first half of the year. So when you look at the total year, we actually -- we remain constructive on profitability, and profitability improving actually in '24 relative to '23. \nOperator: Next question from Sofie Peterzens from J.P. Morgan. \nSofie Peterzens : Yes. Here is Sofie from J.P. Morgan. Just to follow up on the previous question. So could you just remind us what the current deposit beta in Spain is? And kind of how it moved in the quarter and also how you see the deposit beta moving in the other geographies, mainly U.K., U.S., and I guess, also Portugal? So that would be my first question.  And then the second question would be around the U.S. tax rate. It was very low this quarter. How should we think about the U.S. tax rate going forward? And what's the kind of normalized run rate? And then if I may, just if you could comment on any capital headwinds going forward? \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Sofie. Could you explain us a little bit the second question because we couldn't hear you well? First of all, on deposit betas, I mean, betas today in most geographies remain below the initial expectations that we had. And in general terms, they're behaving rather rationally, and we expect pressure to mount in the coming months and the betas to increase. I mean it's normal because of the dynamics of what's going on. And the geographies we are present are showing a different behavior. Our CFO, now give you a little bit further details on that. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Yes. Sofie, in Spain, total beta is slightly over 20%, 22%, but we exclude Corporate Investment Banking. Corporate Investment Banking is already almost fully priced. Ex-Corporate Investment Banking is 13%. Remember that we have \u20ac153 billion of current accounts in Spain with very low volumes. So -- and the beta there is almost 0. We don't expect any significant change in the behavior in the market in the coming quarters. So we would expect the beta in Spain to gradually drift upwards, but very gradually, similar performance to what we have seen this year.  In the U.K., beta is 35%. If we look at the beta in the quarter is higher than that. It's around 50%. So here, we would expect higher -- gradually higher betas, but we are pricing assets also higher. The new mortgage pricing in the U.K. today is around 5.7%. So this is going to help withstand the slightly higher betas that we expect next year. For the rest of the countries, Portugal at 9%, Poland, 30%, and in the U.S., it's 32%. Ex-Corporate Investment Banking is 31%, very much in line with expectation, not much to comment on that.  So bottom line is we would expect cost of deposits to gradually increase against repricing on the assets in some countries, particularly in Spain, also in the U.K., et cetera. \nHector Grisi : Sofie, in terms of the tax rate in the U.S. going forward, what I could tell you and we could basically contact you to give you more detail, I believe that we may improve it given that we are doing some leasing on electric vehicles, and that basically would help us out in the tax rate that we have outstanding today. But to give you details, later we could call you and give you exactly what's going on there. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Your final question, capital headwinds. The only one is -- the only significant capital headwind we have is the final implementation of Basel III. Still some detailed rulings or regulations need to be written. But bottom line is the total fully loaded impact would be around 50 or 55 basis points. The phasing impact, so the charge on January 1, '25 is going to be between 15 to 20 basis points. So again, very much in line with previous expectations, maybe a touch better than what we expected. \nOperator: Next question from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas. \nIgnacio Ulargui : I have just 2 questions. The first one on Brazil. After the performance that we have seen this quarter, where there has been growth, you were guiding before for a bit of an acceleration, and you have been commenting into the quarter results that we should expect better momentum in the second half. Did you see a moment to change your risk appetite? So we see an acceleration of growth also due to mix changes as we are seeing in Mexico? And what should we expect for 2024 from Brazil?  And also, if you could share a bit of color on what has been the driver of cost growth in Spain in the quarter? And whether we should expect some synergies coming from One Santander in coming quarters in Spain or it's more restricted to Mexico and the U.S.? \nHector Grisi : Thank you. In terms of what's going on in Brazil, Ignacio, a couple of points. First of all, what you have been seeing is, as you remember, we changed a little bit the mix. So we're changing a little bit that the cost of risk is helping us out first of all, because our -- some of them -- the positions that we took, actually the credit loans that we gave are basically performing much better than we expected. And the mix also is helping us out because remember that the mix that we changed, went a little bit into payrolls and to secure loans, and the mix has also changed and it's getting better.  We're also seeing that the market is performing much better in terms of LLPs. So in that sense, we're opening it a little bit. I mean we're open to a little bit more or giving out loans in terms of going back a little bit to the credit card markets. We are performing very well, but our credit appetite is cautious, nevertheless, and we expect Brazil basically to perform really well in that sense. So you're going to see really growth in momentum also given that the rate is coming down, and we expect the rates basically to continue coming down over the next few months. So this is a double combination in terms of how we're managing the portfolio and second, because of the way the rates are moving in Brazil. So in that sense, I believe it's going to be much better.  In terms of the growth in cost in Spain, as you know, we have been implementing One Transformation. So with the implementation of One Transformation, we're spending a little bit to transform a little bit on processes, some things that we're doing and the way we're managing the bank in that sense. But -- and you're going to see a much better outcome in the next few months due to that fact because we are -- as you know, we are simplification -- we're doing simplification, dropping the number of products that we have, we are doing also automation of many different things, and we are pushing our branches basically to move more towards businesses than look at the incidents or problems.  So all that transformation that we're making in -- all that transformation that we're making is the one that is pushing us a little bit to spend a little bit more, but it's going to be in control, and we expect that to continue to drop in the next few months. So in that sense, I feel confident that we're going to be able to do that.  So in terms of in Brazil, going back to the -- to just to that -- just to tell you the second half is going to be much better than the first half of '24. As we continue to go on and we build up the portfolio, it's going to be performing much better. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : As I said, I think the sensitivity to rates gains momentum. So we have already started to see a slight change. Rates have dropped just 100 basis points to -- from 13.75% to 12.75%. We expect another 100 basis point drop in the third quarter -- sorry, in the fourth quarter, but we would expect probably 200 basis point to 250 basis point drop next year. So these accumulates. So when we look at year-on-year third quarter, fourth quarter, we will see rates probably 400 basis points down. So clearly, the second half next year will look much, much better in terms of NII than the second half of this year. \nOperator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. \nBegona Morenes : Next question and we'll recapture Alvaro later on. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from S\u00e1nchez Romero from Citi. \nS\u00e1nchez Romero : My first question is on restructuring charges. So I understand your profitability target is underlying. Should we expect any material restructuring charges associated with your new reporting structure?  The second question is your outlook on operating expenses in the U.S. You've gone on a hiring spree of investment bankers recently. So what is the outlook for cost? And how much revenue do you expect to generate as a result? And just quickly on your effective tax rate in Brazil for 2024 and what is your expectation regarding any potential changes on interest on capital? \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Marta. No, we don't expect any restructuring charges at all because of the restructuring that we just did in the organization. The other way around, actually, we are moving towards lowering the cost as much as possible in the organization. This is exactly what we're doing. It's very important to understand exactly what One Transformation means, which means exactly simplifying, first of all, and simplifying the amount of products that we have significantly. Second, basically automation of a lot of the processes, and this is mainly -- I'm talking about on the retail side, which is quite important, which means, for example, transformation in countries like Portugal, where we have already gone through a really good transformation, basically, now 10% of the things we do in a branch is basically operations and incidents and problems. 90% is taking care of the client.  In other countries, such as Mexico or Spain is 50% of that. So basically, this is what One Transformation means, and this is what we're doing. So simplification, automation, then we're going to come in with the platforms. You have seen a little bit what we've been doing with the different platforms that we're deploying, for example, merchant acquiring that has been deployed already mostly in Latin America. You see the cost coming down. And you see also that we are getting revenue on quota from our customers. So in that sense, it's very important that you understand what One Transformation is and why are we doing this.  Second, in terms of -- your second question was on operating expenses in the U.S. Okay, very important question. What we're doing in the U.S. is just a complement of the rest of our CIB business. What do I mean by a complement? We have become a very large player in CIB, I mean, large for the standards of Latin America and a very important player also in CIB in Europe. It's important to point out that 94% of our -- of the business that we do there basically is client-oriented. It's very important to understand that it's just 6% is trading. So it's client flow, your selling FX, your selling plain vanilla derivatives, is doing a lot of trade finance to our normal clients at midsize and SME clients.  And this is basically -- the only piece that we needed is basically was to complement the U.S. This is not in any means to really beef up our presence in CIB in the U.S. This basically will complement the rest of our business and also will give us capabilities in 4 or 5 particular sectors that complement the rest of the business that we do in Latin America and Europe, in the U.S., which, by the way, we were not making because we didn't have the capabilities. So it's not a huge thing vis-a-vis the size of the group, but it's important that it's going to be an important revenue generator. And you're going to see that revenue going to start to pick up in CIB pretty fast given that because it's already a complement, as I was saying, of the rest of the business. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Tax rate in Brazil next year, Eurozone-- sorry, taxes on capital, that's been proposed and discussed is not approved, and we are not sure that the final shape of that tax will be the one that was proposed. The Finance Minister believes that they need to do a more detailed analysis on the impact of that because the main reason for that is to tax companies that are not paying taxes. The banks are paying already lots of taxes. So I think we need to wait and see what the final shape and form of that tax will take. But by no means it's a done deal and definitely not in the way that it was presented. Thank you, Marta. \nOperator: Next question from Carlos Cobo Catena from Societe General. \nCarlos Cobo Catena : From my side, a quick question on revenue performance. You explained how NII has been the key driver of revenue momentum. However, going back to the Capital Markets Day, I remember that there was a way stronger emphasis on fee income and non-NII revenues, which seems to be underperforming a little bit or initial expectations. So could you elaborate on that? Is that the market momentum has weakened, but you see that being recovered in the future or simply that there's some -- you are running behind your initial plan?  And second, when you talk about the cost of risk seasonality in the U.S., could you explain a little bit better why is that? I mean why there is such a concentration in provisions in the third quarter? It will be helpful to understand.  And lastly, on reporting changes. I don't know if you can share that already, but when you're talking about the retail and commercial new global business line, could you explain if you plan to have also regional P&L and balance sheet for its subsidiary, which will be consistent with the consolidated global unit or we are not going to have that detail? \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Carlos. I mean, I think it's important to understand basically the dynamics in the market. If you see the fees, for example, in the first 9 months, we grew 6% year-on-year. It's basically customer growth and the global network business is basically helping out, mainly CIB and payments. It's important to say that global and network businesses now contribute to around 42% of the total fee income. And by '25, that would increase from 42% to 50%. So basically, it's according to our plan.  It's important also that risk appetite increase is changing the portfolio mix. And volume growth and transactionality increase is going to help out. And we see also -- and you're going to see that it's going to complement the revenue. It's actually what you're asking. You're going to see a strong CIB that is basically up 15% year-on-year. PagoNxt is the payment side and merchant acquiring is up 12%. We have weaker wealth management that is around 1%, but it's market conditions, because exactly what's happening in the market.  The auto business is generating 5% more across the board. You see very good performance in Mexico and the U.S., and Europe is a little bit impacted by regulatory changes. And retail, you're going to see a growth of around 5% year-on-year because we had active customers coming in that are helping us out, mainly 2 million active customers that we didn't have. So in that sense, what I'm telling you is that we see that fees are going to starting to come up, also helping out by what's -- the dynamics that we see in South America and Mexico mainly. So in that sense, you're going to see that it's going to perform well.  And also, as credit picks up, that's also going to help us in the fee revenue. That's basically what has been one of the ladders that fuel revenue. The seasonality in the U.S. has always been like that. I mean that's basically the way people perform in this particular market. I mean, it's a little different than it performs in Europe. And in that sense, it's always been marked in the third and the fourth quarter and normally becomes a lot better when people get more money during Christmas and start to pay us back, et cetera.  The dynamic that I basically explained given that there is a very strong second-hand car market in the U.S. and also that people basically don't want to refinance their cars or don't see the availability of loans on cars for the next few months that basically shall help us out, and that's why you see better numbers, and I don't see the cost of risk going beyond the 200 basis points. And Jose gave you a very good explanation of how was the level of the cost of risk before and what is it today, and we expect it to continue. And also the change of mix is helping us out. So it's very important for you to understand that, but this is the way the market has been always and you can see it if you go all the years behind.  In terms of the reporting changes, we're going to continue to basically show the countries as a secondary segment. So you will continue to have that information. I don't know, Jose, if I left anything out. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : No, no, no. I think we will report as we manage the bank. So we will report these horizontal businesses as the primary segments, obviously. But we will continue, as Hector said, providing all the information from a country-level upwards, so you will be able to see the country's performance organized by these businesses and the global performance organized by country. So you will be able to have both views at the same time. Thank you, Carlos. \nOperator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. \nAlvaro Serrano : Sorry for earlier. A couple of questions. One is really a follow-up and thanks very much for your steer on provisions for 2024. If I can sort of take advantage of -- given you opened that door, in the context of what we've seen in the U.S. within that flat provision, what directionally or a bit of color on what -- how could we expect the U.S. evolve in 2024? And in particular, I took note of your data on repossessions now at 60%, 65%, it was 58%. I think you quoted that number earlier in the year. How quickly do you think the repossessions are going to go back to historical levels? Because presumably this is savings, COVID savings and now you have student loans picking up, is that something we're going to see sort of going back to historical levels already in 2024? Or do you think it could take more time? Just want to understand how you're thinking about the U.S. within that flat group context.  And the second, hopefully, easier one is on the U.K. You've done pretty well considering some of your competitors in the U.K., has been a bit of a car crash. Can you maybe talk about the outlook there, specifically for U.K.? Given what we're seeing in the market, pretty tough competition on deposits. You had your own offering out in September. So maybe you've got a bit more visibility now for Q4 and 2024. \nHector Grisi : Yes. Thank you, Alvaro. Actually, I was expecting your question on the U.S. So let me give you exactly what is the important different dynamic that car has to the loans and different things. The car in the U.S. is quite interesting. It's not as in Europe, as in Latin America. Actually, people in Europe and Latin America pay first the mortgage and then the auto loan, et cetera. In the U.S., it's the other way around. The U.S., if you don't have a car, you don't have a mean to go to work or to move around. I mean you're completely isolated.  So the behavior of the auto loans in the U.S. is completely different to anything you see because of this particular issue. Without a car, you cannot work and you cannot generate money. So that's exactly why the performance of the portfolio has turned it in that way because people basically take a lot of care to that. And that's exactly why the behavior of delinquencies basically are performing that well. I mean, normally, if the economy complicates, you're going to see that number of 60% to 62%, 63% maybe going up. Let's see how the U.S. evolves. And if we have a soft landing or not, that will all depend on that.  Also, it's important to acknowledge that we are changing the mix of the portfolio, as we have said already. So that's quite important because we are much more concentrating with the funding that we have from our bank to be more in prime and in near prime. And even though we will continue to do so prime because it's a business that we know well, and we manage pretty well in the terms of risk underway, but we are trying to change a little bit the mix of the portfolio. And also, we are offloading some of that risk through asset sales, et cetera. So it's quite important to understand that we are being very cautious about that. I'm very cautious on the way we're managing cost -- sorry, cost of risk. So I hope I answered your question correctly.  And then on the U.K. The U.K., as you have said, we have performed well. We'll end up having a really strong year. We are working really hard to follow a strong strategy in terms of cost. We are also, it's very important, advancing of One Transformation. We believe there is a huge opportunity there, leading to probably -- and the U.K.'s leading probably to its best year in bottom line. But it's important that you see that there is an opportunity there in transforming and decrease the cost that we have in that country. So I really do see the U.K. with a huge opportunity. I've been spending a lot of my time there because I believe there is opportunities.  NII has grown year-on-year 9.3%, is driven by higher rates, as you know, and a strong -- what -- we have a really strong focus on managing the spreads and profitability. So you'll see that we have been lowering the portfolio debt because we're very focused on that. You see that in Q3, I mean, we are, as the rest of the market at 2.2 [ph] both -- and we are offset -- offsetting the increased cost of the retail funding and a slowdown of new originations by basically playing that and also using a different mix of the portfolio and trying to see other opportunities.  It's important to tell you that we are putting profitability ahead of market share. And we have lower risk appetite, as I told you. And we believe that we could have a NIM expansion by doing that. \nOperator: Next question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. \nAndrea Filtri : Yes. First question on -- if you can remind us of the Brazilian interest rate sensitivity? Second question is a follow-up on several questions from colleagues. If you can actually give us a concrete indication of the structural tax rate in Brazil and in the U.S. in light of the new electric vehicles leasing that you're doing? Is this a structural move or it's just a one-off that we've seen?  Then on capital, given that you are confirming your 15% to 17% target with a 15% for this year, should we not see also a natural acceleration in the organic capital buildup that you should be able to generate? And finally, digital euro. What do you see as risks and opportunities from the digital euro implementation? Have you budgeted the impact to your business model and can you share it with us? \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Andrea. Let me do the following thing. Let me answer your question on the digital euro, and then Jose will basically talk about the structural tax rates and the capital. First of all, it's quite important to understand that the European Commission has published a proposal of regulation last June, which basically sets a framework and it's a necessary condition for the digital euro to be launched. They have publicly stated the discussion should not be rushed ahead of European elections in June '24. And they're saying that instead, they were examined in a quiet and slow way by the new commission and the new parliament. So we expect a long negotiation process to achieve a common agreement in that sense.  In parallel, what we have seen is the ECB has just finalized investigation phase of the digital euro, as I said. The government counsel published last week the results and they decided to initiate a 2-year preparation phase, as we have heard, basically focused on the actual implementation of it. It will evolve finalizing in the rule book and the selection -- selecting providers that could develop the infrastructure. This is quite important. And this phase will pave way to a potential future decision on issuing the digital euro or not. But we see that it's going to happen.  And as the decision on the digital euro, I don't believe will not be taken before the regulatory proposal is approved. So I don't expect to its release before 2026. On this context, I mean, also as Banco Santander, we are aligned with the European authorities to design the European -- the digital euro, also develop the pan-European integrated payments market. It's basically very important that we believe we generate value for consumers, companies and the financial institutions. And it's also important to say that we will continue to monitor the potential impact the digital euro may have on our banks in Europe. And also it's important for us to have greater clarity as the ECB and the European Commission finalize the regulatory proposal and implementation phase. So that's the way we see it at this point.  With this, I will basically pass it to Jose to tell you. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Hello, Andrea. Brazil interest rate sensitivity is \u20ac150 million to a drop of 100 basis points, all things being equal. Tax rate -- the -- in terms of structural tax rate for the group going forward, I think using 30% is the right number. This year is going to be a bit lower because of the tax benefits on EV in the U.S.  And then organic capital, well, the higher the profitability, obviously, the higher the organic capital generation. We don't expect any significant regulatory charges other than the ones we mentioned, and obviously, always subject to available-for-sale impacts, et cetera. But we don't see any significant inorganic or extraordinary charges to our capital buildup. So you're right. I mean the higher the profitability, the better.  We also have a very strong focus on asset rotation. We have started a team that is going to be looking at ways of optimizing risk-weighted assets across the group. In the first 9 months of this year, we have already rotated the equivalent to around \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac18 billion in risk-weighted assets. We think we can do more or less \u20ac30 billion -- close to \u20ac30 billion -- \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion this year, and that will be the focus going forward. The focus will be to rotate the balance sheet because we might not be the best tenors of some of the assets that we have in our balance sheet, so -- on our balance sheet.  So the focus going forward is going to be optimizing risk-weighted asset consumption and maximizing profitability. So you're right that we would expect the capital buildup to accelerate in the coming quarters. \nOperator: Next question from Pablo de la Torre Cuevas from RBC. \nPablo de la Torre Cuevas : I had a question on credit cards in Brazil. Could you please provide us an update on the ongoing negotiations there between the banking sector and the central bank regarding the new limits on installment and revolving credit card lending in the country? And if possible, could you please give us any indication of the contribution to Brazilian NII of these types of lending? And any estimates that you can give us on the potential P&L impact of the new measures announced? I guess besides the negative impact to NII, are the measures also likely to impact fee income from lower transactionality? And are there any offsets there like lower cost of risk or lower cost of funding that we should also think about? \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Pablo. Jose will tell you basically about the situation in Brazil. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Again, these are ongoing negotiations. I just already referred to interest on capital. Here again, the focus is more on corporates than financials. Obviously, there might be an effect on banks, but that's not the main focus. But in our case, it would have a relatively minor impact if it was approved as it has been proposed. But again, we think that will change credit cards.  The 90-day period for self-regulation is already [comping] and is finalizing by year-end. We do not expect an agreement here. So probably, [BASN], the Bankers Association in Brazil -- sorry, the central bank in Brazil will have to regulate. There is a not minor possibility that we will go to a model in which total interest paid by the customer is capped to total principal, which is called the U.K. model.  Again, Santander and FEBRABAN, the Bankers Association, are already working with the Central Bank of Brazil to try to find a best solution. It's very early to comment on the impact because this type of regulation could have an impact on NII, but there might be ways of offsetting this through commission income, et cetera, because there is a lot -- a significant rotation of the balances in Brazil. So again, working on all of these very early to put numbers to these changes. \nOperator: Next question from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank BPI. \nCarlos Peixoto : Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank. A couple of questions from my side as well, and a few follow-ups. So on NII, a minor detail, but -- or a minor geography. But in Portugal, you have a 40% quarter-on-quarter increase in NII this quarter. I see the improvement in customer spread is actually lower than in the previous quarter. And you do have an increase in the ALCO portfolio. But in any case, I was trying to see if you could have some color on the rationale on what caused this evolution? And also, what should we expect in coming quarters?  And then on the U.K. and NII as well. I'm sorry if I missed it, but I was wondering, do you expect -- previously you were talking about a high single-digit increase in NII in the U.K. for this year. You expect that to be the case still? And how do you see it evolving into next year? \nHector Grisi : Okay. Thank you, Carlos. NII, I mean, as you said, grew very strongly in Portugal. It's been helping us out basically because of the repricing of the portfolio, the rates we're going. And I believe that it will continue a good trend towards the end of the year if rates go up a little bit more in Europe. So that will help out. And then we'll stabilize. And that's my view because we see that the rates will stabilize at some time, and we don't see more growth in that sense. So NII should stabilize in Portugal.  In terms of the U.K., I explained to you quite well exactly what's going on. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : If I may, before you go, just to give some more color on Portugal. When we look at yield on loans, in the fourth quarter of last year, yield on loans in Portugal was 2.4%, 3.3% in the first quarter, 4% in the second, 4.6% in the third. So the yield on loans basically increasing almost at the same rate every quarter this year. Yield on deposits, 4 basis points, 14 basis points, 26 basis points, 38 basis points, also more or less growing at the same pace. So one quarter, there's obviously seasonality, balances, number of days, all of this may explain the differences. But again, when you look at the trends, the trends in Portugal are very consistent.  We would expect, as Hector said, obviously, there is a limit to the repricing of assets. And mortgages in Portugal, contrary to Spain, are linked to the 6-month Euribor, the 12-month Euribor in Spain. So the flattening out on the asset side in Portugal is going to happen a bit faster than in Spain. But again, the cost of deposits in Portugal is really, really low, and we don't see any competition there. So we remain constructive in the next few quarters in Portugal. \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Jose. Very quickly on the U.K., Carlos. I mean, as I said, basically, I mean, we continue to put profitability ahead of market share. And we have lower risk appetite given the dynamics in that market, and we combine that -- and we'd like to combine that with a good performance that basically could lead to a NIM expansion. But answering your question, I expect 2023 with a high-single-digit growth and on higher rates, management of deposit cost, while we assume the lower volumes that we have. And that's basically the outlook that we have for the U.K. at this point.  I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement. But I think with that, I answered your question. \nOperator: Next question from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous. \nBritta Schmidt : The first one will be on the NII in Spain. The customer spread widened and you've also increased the ALCO portfolio, but the NIM was flat. So maybe you can explain what's happened there and also give us an update on the ALCO portfolio?  And the second one will be on Chile. We've seen a big decline in NII here. I think the business has guided to a big decline in profits this year. But what do you think is the outlook there for this year? And also when will the NII improve in 2024? \nHector Grisi : Thank you, Britta. I will start basically give you the overall view and then Jose can give you a little bit of more details on both. I mean, Spain, as you say, is one of the countries that has benefited the most on the higher rates. And we continue to see, as I said, a strong growth from clients. We have 651,000 new customers -- net new customers in the last 12 months. We see also a strong contribution from the global businesses. Wealth Management is increasing 84% year-on-year. CIB, 11%. I'm talking about PAT. And CIB is also achieving a substantial growth and net margin growth mid-teens, maintaining a superior profitability levels. So you're going to see that.  We expect double-digit NII growth in '23. And in terms we see very factors to consider. We see, as Jose explained to you in detail, assets repricing at least during the first half of '24, clients continue to grow, and betas will be key in this particular issue. We see no meaningful deposit movements in Spain in reaction to prevailing rates. Our deposit base is extremely atomized. 80% of our deposit base have an average balance of \u20ac20,000, which basically contributes to the stability.  Also, it's very important to take into account that the One Transformation I explained is going through in Spain as well, and we're very focused on the product simplification. As I said, we're reducing 21% the product portfolio. We're doing a process of optimization there. But I see that exactly that's the trend that it's going to happen, exactly as Jose basically detailed. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement, but you already gave a lot of detail. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Yes. Britta, let me tell you, yield on loans -- it is the same explanation that we have for Portugal. Quarter-on-quarter, it basically has to do with many -- probably many small things. But when you look at yield on loans in Spain from the fourth quarter of last year at 2.5%, first quarter 3.3%, second quarter 3.8%, fourth quarter 4.3%. So very much almost a straight line increase. And in the case of deposits, also the same, 22 basis points, 53 basis points, 72 basis points, 19 basis points, in the last couple of quarters, 18, 19 basis points increase. So very much flat.  So the point here is that we still have a substantial part of our balance sheet in Spain that will reprice up in the first half of next year. I just use the figure for mortgages, it's \u20ac77 billion and around 60% reprices in the first half. So I think the yield on loans will continue. Although the rates -- interest rates in Spain might stay or in Europe may stay flat, the repricing of assets in Spain will continue for at least the first half of next year.  And in terms of the pressure on the cost of deposits, again, most of institutional deposits, corporate investment banking deposits have already repriced. So the question is to what extent the cash balances in the current accounts will move to time deposits. To what extent customers have excess liquidity in their current accounts to be put aside for time deposits? And we do think that is a limited -- is a very limited amount. So we see not a lot of pressure on that particular part of the business for increased cost of deposits.  In Chile, we have 2 balance sheets, so 2 sensitivities to the balance sheet. One is to rates and the other one is to inflation. Obviously, the relative movements of inflation and rates is what explains what we've seen. So we have seen already inflation going down, rates going down slower. So as inflation continues to go down and rates follow, we will see the reversal. So we see NII in Brazil actually expanding, again gaining momentum towards the second half of next year, but expanding substantially in the second half of next year relative to the second half of this year because, again, the relative movement that we have between inflation, which is the U.S. and rates. \nOperator: Next question from Hugo Cruz from KBW. \nHugo Cruz : Hugo from KBW. Just a couple of questions. Mexico NII, the growth Q-on-Q has been quite strong. I guess I'm not going to ask you why it's been stronger than expected. But I wonder if you could give guidance on -- for the full year, what kind of NII growth you expect in euros? And then finally, on Argentina, quite volatile, and we have elections soon. So I was wondering if you can give what you expect an impact from the elections, but also if you could give guidance on the earnings for this year and the next. \nHector Grisi : Thank you. Okay. Mexico, as you have seen, has been -- had a strong growth in NII. It's a combination of many things. First of all, the rates increase, but most of that is basically because of the change of the mix that we have performed in the country. We saw an opportunity of basically switching a little bit of the portfolio into credit cards and unsecured loans and payroll loans to individuals. So to have a much better structured mix than we used to have before. So Mexico is helped out by the rates, but also by the change of the mix of the portfolio, all right? So it's quite important to see that.  We see that Mexico will continue to have a really good trend. I mean, Mexico, as you have seen, has grown pretty well, pretty nicely over the past few months, and I believe it is going to grow strongly also on '24. The important thing to understand exactly how rates are going to perform, and that's going to depend a little bit on what happens in the U.S., all right? But I see that if rates continue to be stable and the economy performs well, I believe that Mexico should develop very good on '24 and continue to have very good growth on NII.  In terms of Argentina, as you have seen, we have a, I would say, complicated environment to say the least about what's going on. We really -- and I wouldn't like to basically make a prediction of what could happen, but looks that may -- things may stay as they are. We have, as you know, a potential difference between the -- in the exchange rate -- between the official exchange rate and what's happening in the black market. So in that sense, let's see how it evolves and how the government would like basically to land the difficult task they have in front. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Just one final comment here. The way we've managed Argentina is to -- is trying to hedge obviously against inflation and hedging our investment against inflation. And that will continue to be the key element. Obviously, there is a big difference between official exchange rates and nonofficial exchange rates. We are aware of that. We are aware of the impact that a revaluation could have on our books. So we are managing that to minimize the impact, if that was to happen. And obviously, again, the key is to preserve the value of our investment in Brazil, but basically by managing and investing inflation risk. \nOperator: Next question from Fernando Gil de Santiva\u00f1es from Bestinver. \nFernando Gil de Santiva\u00f1es : Three questions, please. First of all, on Digital Consumer Bank. I see return on tangible book at 11%, still a bit far from the target of 15% that you have for the plan. Can you just cover the outlook for 2024, please? This is the first one.  The second would be about the ALCO portfolio. I see an increase of about \u20ac10 billion in the quarter. Can you please refer to strategy and the level of unrealized loss that you have on portfolio?  And finally, on Poland, if you can please comment on the outlook for the extension on the mortgage volume, please? \nJose Garcia-Cantera : So let me start with Poland. The proposal comes from the current government. We need -- we are going to have a new government, and this will have to go to parliament. So very early stages of this proposal, and I am almost 100% sure that some other form of proposal, if any, will be conducted because again, this is a proposal of the existing government, not the upcoming government.  The ALCO -- sorry, also Britta about this and I forgot. We have more or less \u20ac27 billion, almost \u20ac30 billion of ALCO in Spain at an average yield of around 3.4%. We expect to end the year at around \u20ac30 billion. We might increase the ALCO a little bit more next year, obviously, taking advantage of the higher yields. So depending on how you measure the profitability of this, if you measure this against average cost of deposits sort of against the marginal funding cost, you have different profitability. But obviously, this is going to add significant push to the profitability of the group next year.  DCB, I don't know if you want to comment on DCB and the outlook for the business. \nHector Grisi : Yes. I mean on DCB, there has been a particular change in the business in this year. In DCB in particular, there is one very important. We had really good growth in terms of loans, but the majority of those loans -- a vast majority is basically stock financing. Given the dynamics that the auto market has had over the past few months, first of all, there was not enough production, then the production started and now basically, we are financing a huge amount of the car dealerships. We expect basically to start -- the dealerships start moving that inventory out and that basically will produce more -- the normal auto loans and then will give us the normal NII that we are accustomed to at this point. So that's basically the way we believe that this is going to evolve.  It is important to acknowledge that also we have been able to finance a lot of this portfolio with our own deposits instead of going that much to wholesale. And also, you're going to see a dynamic of what Jose was telling you about of selling a lot of these portfolios out into the market once we basically start out giving out loans, direct to individuals. So we believe that the outlook would be good.  It's important to see also how the economy evolves mainly in Europe, and that would also depend on how fast the inventory is moved. \nJose Garcia-Cantera : Yes. Well, final comment here. Although we have a neutral position into rates in DCB, obviously, the higher the rates, the more difficult the business is, particularly when rates start going up. So once rates stabilize, the business also stabilizes and increases the profitability. The difficulty in managing DCB is when rates actually go up because although we do not have sensitivity to that movement, obviously the customers do not react well to that. So that is one point I wanted to make.  The other point is on cost of risk. We would expect the cost of risk in DCB to gradually trend towards the normalized level of around 50 basis points a year, taking into account that this will depend on asset sales, securitizations, et cetera. So our aim is to try to minimize that, like Hector was saying, by managing the assets that we have on our books. \nOperator: Last question from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. \nIgnacio Cerezo : I've got 3 follow-ups. First one is on NII in Brazil. I mean are you sticking to the guidance you gave in Q2 that Q4 would be better than Q3? And if you can give a little bit of color in terms of pattern of NII expansion next year, should we be expecting like a linear increase through the year? Or you're going to have some degree of seasonality at some point?  Second one is on the U.S. I'm sorry if you have mentioned that already, but what has driven the 13 percentage point decline of the coverage in the quarter in the units?  And the third one is on capital return. Given your comments around accelerated capital generation as profitability goes up and mindful of Basel IV, do you see any chances of topping up your capital or increasing your shareholder return in '24? \nHector Grisi : Thank you. Look, Ignacio, in terms of NII in Brazil, I think it's important. I mean, we reiterate, first of all, as I have seen the worst of the NII is behind us. We continue expecting an improvement both in NIM and NII in the coming quarters. Rates, as Jose explained to you, have started to curve down, I mean, 100 basis points in the Q3 '23. Our numbers basically tell us that maybe they will come down towards the end of the year to 11.75%. So that basically tells you, reflecting the Q2 decline in rates plus credit activity increasing plus market-related NII no longer a drag, NII improvements. So that basically tells you that we -- yes, we believe that the second -- sorry, that the fourth quarter is going to be better than the third.  In terms of what do we see in the future is exactly as Jose explained to you, is that we see a trend going upwards towards -- more towards the second half of the year, next year. And that's the way we see it. It's going to help out if rates continue to come down and volumes continue to go up, but that's exactly the beauty of the diversification model that we have at this point.  In terms of the U.S. coverage, it's basically, I mean, the normal seasonality that we have discussed. And we have an update in loan-to-values including the current value of the cars. And in addition on the quarters, we have CRE charges due to downgrade rating of several companies in the sector and fintech charges due to originations in that sense. But I see that this will normalize towards the beginning of next year, as I said. So in that sense, I don't see a problem in that is -- also, there was an increase in provisions mainly, as I said, I mean, the LTV and the Stage 3 balance with the GST remediation. But other than that, I think it's quite what -- it was quite normal.  Cost of risk, as I said, is 1.77%, and is below the 200 basis points that we indicated as guidance for the year. And total coverage ratio is double. The total loan portfolio is flat year-on-year, 2.7%. I don't know if that answers your questions. And in terms of the capital return, please, Jose? \nJose Garcia-Cantera : No, I think that's for the Board to decide. So for this year, the policy has been decided, and that's for the Board to decide, obviously. \nBegona Morenes: Thank you. I believe we have no further questions. So thank you very much, everybody, for your time. As always, the Investor Relations team remains at your disposal for any and all questions that you may have. Thank you. Bye, bye.",

Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation that we will be following today are available to you on our website.  Let me just highlight that during the presentation, when we refer to global and network businesses, we are following the definition which was given during our Investor Day last February as the new reporting and full management of the group through global businesses will begin in January '24.  I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Hector Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. Jose Garcia Cantera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]  With this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi.

        "text": "Thank you, Begona. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I'll talk about our 9 months results in the context of how we are progressing with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day. Jose will then review our financial performance in greater detail, and then I'll conclude with a few closing remarks.  As you can see, we had another strong quarter, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our unique business model even in times of market volatility as well as a solid execution of our strategy. We delivered record profit of \u20ac2.9 billion. That's an increase of 20% compared with Q3 in '22, that's 26% in constant euros. Profit for the first 9 months of '23 was \u20ac8.1 billion, up 13% in constant euros, driven by strong customer revenue growth. Revenue increased by double digit year-on-year, supported by all global businesses and all our regions.  Commercial activity remained solid. We added 9 million new customers in the last 12 months, bringing the total to 166 million. We continue to advance towards a simpler, more integrated model through our One Transformation, which is leading to efficiency improvements and growth in profitability. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 44%. Our return on tangible equity rose 126 basis points year-on-year to nearly 15%, while our earnings per share improved by 17% year-on-year, supported by profit growth and share buybacks.  We further strengthened our balance sheet generating capital in the quarter, even after deducting the share buyback on the way, and liquidity remains at comfortable levels and credit quality is quite strong. All of this led to strong shareholder value creation and attractive remuneration. TNAV plus DPS grew 12% during the last 12 months, and we have increased the cash dividend per share by 39% year-on-year.  Moving to the income statement. As always, we present growth rates in both in current and constant euros. Profit increased strongly continuing the positive trends of previous quarters, supported by, first of all, strong top line performance with growth in all our global businesses. We have improved efficiency as costs increased well below revenue, reflecting our transformation efforts, double-digit growth in net operating income to more than \u20ac24 billion, normalization of loan loss provisions in line with our expectations. And as I mentioned in the previous slide, these trends resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record, 9% above that of Q2 '23. Jose will go now into more detail on these points later.  These results maintained us on track to achieve our '23 targets, targets that we reiterate. First of all, good business dynamics led to double-digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved and remains at the lower end of our target range, even with investments in One Transformation. A strong balance sheet with cost of risk normalizing as expected and capital ahead of target with CET1 improving quarter-on-quarter. Our RoTE is close to 15% and should comfortably reach our target at year-end.  Looking closer at capital and value creation, our CET1 ratio has grown year-to-date from 12% to 12.3%, backed by strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and remunerating our shareholders according to our dividend policy. We continued to grow our shareholder value creation, which was up 12% in the first 9 months of the year, and we're increasing our shareholder remuneration with payout up to 50%.  In September, the Board of Directors approved an interim distribution against our first half results, which is being executed as follows: a cash dividend of \u20ac0.081 per share to be paid in November, 39% higher than equivalent in '22; a share buyback program of up to \u20ac1.3 billion that is currently underway. Since '21 and after completing the current program, Santander will have bought back 9% of its outstanding shares, buybacks -- through share buybacks.  We are progressing in our new phase of value creation, transforming the bank in the right way by changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. One Transformation, which implies creating a common operating platform and technology for our retail and commercial business across all of our geographies, will lead to improved customer service, efficiency and profitability.  In simplification, we have reduced the number of products by 8% in '23. That's almost 800 less products. In digitalization, we are making good progress with our digital self-service model, increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact centers by 16%. We have set up a fully digital end-to-end onboarding process in Mexico that takes just 6 minutes to complete. Since its launch in July, we have opened 36,000 new accounts. In the U.S., we have already captured around \u20ac114 million in savings from transformation and simplification.  As you can see on the slide, the initial efficiencies from One Transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 117 basis points in efficiency improvements. Our global and network businesses contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 39 basis points in efficiency gains. For example, multi-Latinas and multi-Europeans, initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model, are growing at very high rates, with revenue up by 50% in '23 year-on-year. In Private Banking, we continue boosting collaboration with CIB and corporates, which has generated over \u20ac160 million revenue this year or 13%.  In Brazil, we have acquired 117 new relationships that brought BRL 6 billion in net new money. In payments, Getnet already operates in 5 countries. We expect implementation in Chile in the next few months and in the U.K. in '24. In auto, we continued to strengthen our relationships with global OEMs. Since January '23, we have expanded 3 of our OEM partnerships to new countries.  Finally, our global technology capabilities have already resulted in a 29 basis points improvement in the efficiency ratio. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture \u20ac125 million savings this year, \u20ac55 million from the recent deployment of Gravity, \u20ac60 million from the new global agreements with vendors and \u20ac9 million from the implementation of new IT & Ops shared services.  Let's look at how One Transformation is reflected in cost and operational efficiencies. Simplification is driving significant improvements in our cost and revenue per active customer. Process automation is enabling us to spend less time on operations in branches and turn this into a powerful sales and advisory channel. Since our Investor Day, we have reduced the number of operational FTEs per million customers by 5%. We are already deploying global platforms to improve customer experience, leverage economies of scale and spread best practices.  We have implemented across the group, proprietary back-end Gravity, already deployed in 3 countries and CIB. This is delivering \u20ac55 million in efficiencies in '23, and we have executed 75 billion transactions this year alone, that's 10% of the group's total. We're expanding our cards platform across the group, delivering real-time digital processing capabilities to our banks and accelerating our business growth and will generate operational synergies of around \u20ac100 million per year when it's fully deployed.  Finally, we are being able to transfer the best-in-class products and processes from the country of origin to the rest of the group, which led to a strong value creation.  The contribution of our global and network businesses is clear. In CIB, we continued to grow strongly. Our global presence has allowed us to grow revenue by 21% year-on-year as we provide a one-stop shop service to all our clients, capturing cross-border flows and making CIB products and services available to our wealth, retail and commercial customers across the group and vice versa.  As a result, revenue from these 2 concepts, our network revenue grew by 27% year-on-year to \u20ac3 billion. Wealth Management and Insurance grew revenue 22% year-on-year, well above target, boosted by benefits of the Santander network effect. In Private Banking, a fundamental part of our value proposition is that our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another. Today, customers have \u20ac52 billion of assets under management booked abroad. That's 12% higher than a year ago.  Our payments business is growing strongly and faster than the market. Our Payments Hub has become one of the largest processors of account-to-account payments in Europe. Spain, the U.K. and CIB are already processing a significant payment volume through PagoNxt, while we execute full migration of all the group's A2A payments in the next 18 months.  In auto, we continue to prioritize profitability over market share growth in the context of rising interest rates. Global auto revenue was affected by lower lease income in the U.S. and the new regulation in Germany.  One Transformation is now being extended across the group, and the increasing contribution from our global and network businesses are helping us to reach our '25 profitability targets across regions and businesses. Some geographies and businesses have benefited from rising rates, and they should continue to do so in '24. As for those countries and the businesses that do not benefit from higher rates, they are already showing signs of improvement. This diversification, which is a clear competitive advantage, will lead to consistent profitable growth and value creation. The group's RoTE rose 126 basis points year-on-year to around 15%, as mentioned before.  Jose will go now in more detail to the group's performance. Thank you, Jose. "

        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera ",
        "text": "Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. I will take you through the main lines of the P&L in more detail. Starting with revenue. There was strong growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter. This was primarily supported by our retail business as we actively managed the interest rate tailwinds in Europe and Mexico and due to the positive fee performance in Latin America.  We delivered double-digit growth across most businesses, in particular, our network businesses, which made up 38% of total group revenue. The only exception was auto, which was affected by lower leasing income in the U.S. Revenue at the Corporate Center also improved by more than \u20ac500 million year-on-year due to higher liquidity buffer, remuneration and a lower impact from FX hedging.  Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued its upward trend, increasing 7% in the quarter, driven mostly by Europe and Mexico. We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters. Nine months 2023 was 16% higher year-on-year in constant euros on the back of positive sensitivity to rising rates, mainly in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in DCB, North America and South America.  In terms of profitability, we have improved our net interest margin every quarter since the first quarter of 2021. Gains from credit yields outweighed higher funding costs, thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration leading to a clear margin expansion. In Europe, we are strictly managing deposit costs, especially in Spain and Portugal, where there is excess liquidity in the system and lower credit demand. The U.K. has a more competitive environment, but betas remain in line with our expectations. In South America, deposit rates are more directly linked to market interest rates, which results in negative sensitivity to rising rates. Therefore, as interest rates are starting to decline, we are seeing improved NII trends.  In North America, in the U.S., betas continued to increase, although in line with our expectations, while net interest margin in Mexico expanded. Going forward, in Europe, we expect further benefits from portfolio repricing in the context of stable interest rates or a slight increase, which we expect will more than outweigh potential cost of deposit growth, at least in the first half of next year. At the same time, as I said, we expect to benefit from interest rate cuts in South America.  Turning to fees. In an environment of low fee income growth in general as a result of subdued loan demand and weak consumer activity, our net fee income grew 9% compared to the third quarter of '22 and 6% year-on-year with good performance across regions and businesses.  Retail Banking grew well, supported by a larger customer base and our tailored and targeted value propositions. Our global network businesses represented 42% of total group fees which -- with Corporate Investment Banking and PagoNxt leading the way in terms of growth. Corporate Investment Banking is increasing its share of leading roles and PagoNxt continued to expand its businesses, increasing total payment volumes 24% year-on-year and transactions 32%.  Wealth Management and Insurance was slightly up as customers move to lower value-added funds than bringing lower fees. However, we saw increased activity in both Private Banking and Santander Asset Management with 3 consecutive quarters of positive net sales. Auto performance increased year-on-year, driven by good performance in all our main markets.  In terms of costs, savings from One Transformation initiatives, which will become more evident in the coming quarters, are already offsetting our investments in tech and digitalization. Group cost declined 0.5% in real terms. And driving down the transaction cost per active -- the transactional cost per active customer, 2% in real terms, as Hector mentioned earlier. This in turn is reflected in efficiency gains led by Europe, which improved 6 percentage points with costs flat in real terms.  In North America and DCB, cost increased slightly in real terms, reflecting investments to accelerate transformation. Additionally, costs were also slightly affected by some perimeter effects, such as the incorporation of APS in the U.S. and MCE Bank acquisition and new Stellantis agreement in DCB. As a result, group efficiency remains at the bottom end of our target range where we expect it to stay for the rest of the year.  Credit quality remains robust across our footprint and in line or actually slightly better than our expectations, which is supported by strong labor markets and resilience in used car prices in the U.S. The NPL ratio was stable and in line with expected levels, and we remain comfortably on track to meet our 2023 cost of risk target of less than 1.2%.  Spain continues to perform well with a 12-month cost of risk down 9 basis points year-on-year, supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions. In other units such as the U.K., Portugal and the Digital Consumer Bank, the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels, and we expect it to remain below or in line with through-the-cycle averages.  Mexico is also increasing, although it remains at comfortable levels, mainly due to a change in mix towards unsecured loans in line with our strategy to improve profitability. Normalization continues in the U.S. in line with expectations. As we mentioned last quarter, cost of risk in Brazil seems to have reached a turning point. The 12-month cost of risk decreased for the second quarter in a row, and the NPL ratio improved 28 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the improving macro conditions and our focus on more secured and high-rated customers.  To close with our balance sheet structure, as we have discussed in previous presentations, our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment, product and country. Our balance sheet is low risk. The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low loan to values -- average loan to values. Loans decreased 2% year-on-year as a consequence of higher interest rates, reducing credit demand and driving early repayments, especially evident in Europe and especially evident within European mortgages. Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America and DCB.  On the other hand, deposits continued to grow well, up 4% year-on-year and 2% in the quarter as deposit inflows more than offset mortgage prepayments. Growth in the year was concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher rates. Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, 75% of our deposits are transactional, which are stickier and a high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes.  Mutual funds rose 11% with broad-based growth across all countries except the U.S., following a year of instability in 2022. Our fully loaded capital ratio improved to 12.3%, backed by strong organic generation of 45 basis points in the quarter which included 33 basis point charge in shareholder remuneration, 21 basis points related to the latest program of share buybacks that we are currently executing and 12 basis points for the cash dividend accrual.  We continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities, and this was reflected in a front book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the first 9 months of 2022, equivalent to a return on tangible equity above our current group return on tangible equity, which will support profitability going forward. Additionally, we continue to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of risk-weighted assets with positive economic value added, progressing well towards our Investor Day target of 85% in 2025. Increased profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years.  We are confident our fully loaded capital ratio will remain above 12%, even after taking into account the final implementation of Basel III in 2025 on a fully loaded basis.  That's all from my side. Hector, over to you. Thank you. "

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Thank you, Jose. To wrap up, these are the messages I will leave with you. Q3 was another strong quarter with customer and double-digit revenue growth supported by all regions and businesses. We are accelerating One Transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model, which is extracting value from our global and network businesses, driving efficiency gains and profitable growth.  We have strengthened our balance sheet and increased our CET1, while credit quality remains strong, in line with our expectations. All of this contributes to double-digit growth in shareholder value creation and increased remuneration, and we remain on track to meet our '23 targets.  The execution of our strategy, the progress we are making in our platforms and our local leadership makes us confident we can continue to grow and to increase profitability. We see further upside potential for NII growth from the portfolio repricing and potential interest rate hikes in Europe and positive outlook for the margins in South America.  Efficiency, already at the lower range of our '23 target, is expected to keep improving our revenue and cost as we increasingly realize One Transformation benefits. We expect the cost of risk to end the year better than target, and we expect it to remain at similar levels in '24.  At our Investor Day, we set a RoTE target of 15% to 17%. We expect to reach a RoTE above 15% by the year-end and continue to improve significantly during '24, and we see our fully loaded CET1 clearly above our 12% target even after the implementation of Basel III in January '25. As a result, we expect to progress in our target of double-digit shareholder value creation through the cycle, further supported by our last step towards the full implementation of One Santander, which will enable us to fully capture our in-market and global value.  And now, thank you. We would be happy to take your questions. "

        "text": "Yes. I want to focus on loan growth. In Spain has been particularly weak. It's down 10% year-on-year. The sector is minus 3%. I see that most of the 4% is related to CIB, which is down over 20%, but SMEs and mortgages are also weak. If you can comment the gap with the sector? We know demand this week, but you are below the sector.  And then more broadly in other regions, I mean, loans in the U.K. are also down 5%, sector is up 1%, Brazil is up by just 3%. The sector is growing 9%. So if you can elaborate on whether you are repricing margins over volumes, if you are more prudent on risk taking at this point in the cycle? So loan growth in general and in Spain, in particular. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Francisco, yes, basically, as you have said, loan growth has not been good in the -- all the year, I would say, Spain mainly. As you basically say, it's also being affected by the prepayments in some of the mortgages. If you see the portfolio of mortgages, we have seen -- I mean, normally, basically, we go down 3.5%. This basically, we have had prepayments up to \u20ac6.5 billion so far this year. And you're right. SMEs and mortgages basically have been not demanding credit as much. I believe people are being cautious in the way and trying to see how the economy evolves, even though employment has continued to be strong and demand continues to be strong. This is a fact, and we have seen the clients basically being cautious.  Nevertheless, if you see our portfolio in the rest of the countries, mainly Latin America has continued to grow. There, we have been maintaining and being very, very cautious in credit appetite, but also very focused on profitability. So we're growing the portfolio in Latin America in a very good way, but in a profitable way.  And also, you have seen that DCB has increased and has a substantial good development during the year, and we will continue to see that over the next few months. So all in all, we are 2% below in loans this year, but we foresee that once clients basically see that rates are starting to stabilize and the market basically has a more clear view of what's going on, I believe that credit will come back, little by little. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to just complement... "

        "text": "No, just one final comment. Risk-weighted assets are down \u20ac2 billion in the quarter, but it's exclusively due to FX.

        "text": "It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions from me, please. The first one is on the profitability outlook. And the second one on asset quality in the U.S. So starting with the first one. You've reiterated your guidance for the full year, which, if I'm not mistaken, implies a net profit of around \u20ac10.9 billion for this year. Can you confirm that's right? And how do you see profitability in 2024? It would be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing into next year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the U.S.  My second question is with respect to asset quality in the U.S. There was a big uptick this quarter, and you've been talking about normalization in cost of risk. And now we've seen lower used car prices and higher delinquencies, but neither of them were material changes. So the question is what's driving this? Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing specifically on asset quality? And related to that, I think you've confirmed your 200 basis points cost of risk for this year. What do you expect this number to look like next year? "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Yes. Thank you, Antonio. Okay. On profitability, as I said during the presentation, I reiterate the 15% RoTE. So that basically gives you the numbers that you're looking for, okay? So in that sense, we're pretty comfortable on that. On '24, as I basically said, we see also the portfolio repricing. So we see a strong first half of the year in Europe. And then we see a strong second half of the year in Latin America when we see basically the dynamics changing. And you have seen that and you've seen that in the numbers of this quarter when basically you have seen Latin America basically performing better, okay? So in that sense, that can give you a very good idea and Jose will give you more details on that.  In terms of asset quality in the U.S., and I've been saying all along that in the past few quarters, it's very important to understand that it's always seasonal. If you take a look at what happened last year, in the third quarter, it was actually the same and we expected that, and we told you so. And -- but it's important to tell you that it's actually better than we expected. And also it's not going to go beyond the 200 basis points, as you correctly pointed.  In that sense also, we see that the portfolio is performing better in the sense that we see that people with 90-day delinquencies or above when it used to happen is we used to repossess about more than 90% of those cars is basically performing much better, and we are repossessing between 60% and 65% of those. If the threat continues like that and used car prices in the U.S. continue like that, we expect a better performance than we normally expect.  It's important that you understand that we have a completely different mix today in the portfolio. The portfolio that we had pre-COVID didn't have as much prime and near prime as we do today. Prime and near prime is at around 41% of the mix of the portfolio, though that basically tells you that we expect the asset quality to maintain at good levels. And also, the U.S. has been performing with a strong employment as well and the dynamic as well. So in that sense, I'm comfortable with the numbers we're giving you.  Jose, please, would you like to complement on the profitability? "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera ",
        "text": "Yes. Just one final comment on U.S. asset quality. The cost of risk in 2019 was 2.85%. And given the changes in the mix that Hector mentioned, we don't expect to reach that -- those levels at all. And we would expect cost of risk in 2024 to be fairly flat, maybe slightly up compared to 2023 in the U.S.  In terms of profitability, well, we have -- we still have negative sensitivity to rates in Latin America. So as rates start going down, we will see accelerated momentum in NII in Brazil, in particular, coupled with higher loan growth and flat or slightly improving asset quality. So clearly, the profitability in South America as Hector mentioned is going to gain momentum throughout the year with a much better second half relative to the first half. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "And in Europe, as he said, we still have a lot to reprice on the asset side. That's one example. In Spain, we have around \u20ac80 billion of mortgages. You know that they reprice around 112% every month. Well, in fact, we repriced 60% of the total in the first half relative to the second half. So in the first half of '24, we will still reprice a big chunk of our mortgage portfolio in Spain up year-on-year as they come to repricing.  So, asset repricing, particularly in Spain and, obviously, some beta pressures and the cost of deposit pressures with profitability still improving in the first half of the year. So when you look at the total year, we actually -- we remain constructive on profitability, and profitability improving actually in '24 relative to '23. "

First of all, on deposit betas, I mean, betas today in most geographies remain below the initial expectations that we had. And in general terms, they're behaving rather rationally, and we expect pressure to mount in the coming months and the betas to increase. I mean it's normal because of the dynamics of what's going on. And the geographies we are present are showing a different behavior. Our CFO, now give you a little bit further details on that. "

Ex-Corporate Investment Banking is 13%. Remember that we have \u20ac153 billion of current accounts in Spain with very low volumes. So -- and the beta there is almost 0. We don't expect any significant change in the behavior in the market in the coming quarters. So we would expect the beta in Spain to gradually drift upwards, but very gradually, similar performance to what we have seen this year.  In the U.K., beta is 35%. If we look at the beta in the quarter is higher than that. It's around 50%. So here, we would expect higher -- gradually higher betas, but we are pricing assets also higher. The new mortgage pricing in the U.K. today is around 5.7%. So this is going to help withstand the slightly higher betas that we expect next year. For the rest of the countries, Portugal at 9%, Poland, 30%, and in the U.S., it's 32%. Ex-Corporate Investment Banking is 31%, very much in line with expectation, not much to comment on that.  So bottom line is we would expect cost of deposits to gradually increase against repricing on the assets in some countries, particularly in Spain, also in the U.K., et cetera. "

After the performance that we have seen this quarter, where there has been growth, you were guiding before for a bit of an acceleration, and you have been commenting into the quarter results that we should expect better momentum in the second half. Did you see a moment to change your risk appetite? So we see an acceleration of growth also due to mix changes as we are seeing in Mexico? And what should we expect for 2024 from Brazil?  And also, if you could share a bit of color on what has been the driver of cost growth in Spain in the quarter? And whether we should expect some synergies coming from One Santander in coming quarters in Spain or it's more restricted to Mexico and the U.S.? "

        "text": "Thank you. In terms of what's going on in Brazil, Ignacio, a couple of points. First of all, what you have been seeing is, as you remember, we changed a little bit the mix. So we're changing a little bit that the cost of risk is helping us out first of all, because our -- some of them -- the positions that we took, actually the credit loans that we gave are basically performing much better than we expected. And the mix also is helping us out because remember that the mix that we changed, went a little bit into payrolls and to secure loans, and the mix has also changed and it's getting better.  We're also seeing that the market is performing much better in terms of LLPs. So in that sense, we're opening it a little bit. I mean we're open to a little bit more or giving out loans in terms of going back a little bit to the credit card markets. We are performing very well, but our credit appetite is cautious, nevertheless, and we expect Brazil basically to perform really well in that sense. So you're going to see really growth in momentum also given that the rate is coming down, and we expect the rates basically to continue coming down over the next few months. So this is a double combination in terms of how we're managing the portfolio and second, because of the way the rates are moving in Brazil. So in that sense, I believe it's going to be much better.  In terms of the growth in cost in Spain, as you know, we have been implementing One Transformation. So with the implementation of One Transformation, we're spending a little bit to transform a little bit on processes, some things that we're doing and the way we're managing the bank in that sense. But -- and you're going to see a much better outcome in the next few months due to that fact because we are -- as you know, we are simplification -- we're doing simplification, dropping the number of products that we have, we are doing also automation of many different things, and we are pushing our branches basically to move more towards businesses than look at the incidents or problems.  So all that transformation that we're making in -- all that transformation that we're making is the one that is pushing us a little bit to spend a little bit more, but it's going to be in control, and we expect that to continue to drop in the next few months. So in that sense, I feel confident that we're going to be able to do that.  So in terms of in Brazil, going back to the -- to just to that -- just to tell you the second half is going to be much better than the first half of '24. As we continue to go on and we build up the portfolio, it's going to be performing much better. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement. "

We expect another 100 basis point drop in the third quarter -- sorry, in the fourth quarter, but we would expect probably 200 basis point to 250 basis point drop next year. So these accumulates. So when we look at year-on-year third quarter, fourth quarter, we will see rates probably 400 basis points down. So clearly, the second half next year will look much, much better in terms of NII than the second half of this year. "

The other way around, actually, we are moving towards lowering the cost as much as possible in the organization. This is exactly what we're doing. It's very important to understand exactly what One Transformation means, which means exactly simplifying, first of all, and simplifying the amount of products that we have significantly. Second, basically automation of a lot of the processes, and this is mainly -- I'm talking about on the retail side, which is quite important, which means, for example, transformation in countries like Portugal, where we have already gone through a really good transformation, basically, now 10% of the things we do in a branch is basically operations and incidents and problems. 90% is taking care of the client.  In other countries, such as Mexico or Spain is 50% of that. So basically, this is what One Transformation means, and this is what we're doing. So simplification, automation, then we're going to come in with the platforms. You have seen a little bit what we've been doing with the different platforms that we're deploying, for example, merchant acquiring that has been deployed already mostly in Latin America. You see the cost coming down. And you see also that we are getting revenue on quota from our customers. So in that sense, it's very important that you understand what One Transformation is and why are we doing this.  Second, in terms of -- your second question was on operating expenses in the U.S. Okay, very important question. What we're doing in the U.S. is just a complement of the rest of our CIB business. What do I mean by a complement? We have become a very large player in CIB, I mean, large for the standards of Latin America and a very important player also in CIB in Europe. It's important to point out that 94% of our -- of the business that we do there basically is client-oriented. It's very important to understand that it's just 6% is trading. So it's client flow, your selling FX, your selling plain vanilla derivatives, is doing a lot of trade finance to our normal clients at midsize and SME clients.  And this is basically -- the only piece that we needed is basically was to complement the U.S. This is not in any means to really beef up our presence in CIB in the U.S. This basically will complement the rest of our business and also will give us capabilities in 4 or 5 particular sectors that complement the rest of the business that we do in Latin America and Europe, in the U.S., which, by the way, we were not making because we didn't have the capabilities. So it's not a huge thing vis-a-vis the size of the group, but it's important that it's going to be an important revenue generator. And you're going to see that revenue going to start to pick up in CIB pretty fast given that because it's already a complement, as I was saying, of the rest of the business. "

However, going back to the Capital Markets Day, I remember that there was a way stronger emphasis on fee income and non-NII revenues, which seems to be underperforming a little bit or initial expectations. So could you elaborate on that? Is that the market momentum has weakened, but you see that being recovered in the future or simply that there's some -- you are running behind your initial plan?  And second, when you talk about the cost of risk seasonality in the U.S., could you explain a little bit better why is that? I mean why there is such a concentration in provisions in the third quarter? It will be helpful to understand.  And lastly, on reporting changes. I don't know if you can share that already, but when you're talking about the retail and commercial new global business line, could you explain if you plan to have also regional P&L and balance sheet for its subsidiary, which will be consistent with the consolidated global unit or we are not going to have that detail?

        "text": "Thank you, Carlos. I mean, I think it's important to understand basically the dynamics in the market. If you see the fees, for example, in the first 9 months, we grew 6% year-on-year. It's basically customer growth and the global network business is basically helping out, mainly CIB and payments. It's important to say that global and network businesses now contribute to around 42% of the total fee income. And by '25, that would increase from 42% to 50%. So basically, it's according to our plan.  It's important also that risk appetite increase is changing the portfolio mix. And volume growth and transactionality increase is going to help out. And we see also -- and you're going to see that it's going to complement the revenue. It's actually what you're asking. You're going to see a strong CIB that is basically up 15% year-on-year. PagoNxt is the payment side and merchant acquiring is up 12%. We have weaker wealth management that is around 1%, but it's market conditions, because exactly what's happening in the market.  The auto business is generating 5% more across the board. You see very good performance in Mexico and the U.S., and Europe is a little bit impacted by regulatory changes. And retail, you're going to see a growth of around 5% year-on-year because we had active customers coming in that are helping us out, mainly 2 million active customers that we didn't have. So in that sense, what I'm telling you is that we see that fees are going to starting to come up, also helping out by what's -- the dynamics that we see in South America and Mexico mainly. So in that sense, you're going to see that it's going to perform well.  And also, as credit picks up, that's also going to help us in the fee revenue. That's basically what has been one of the ladders that fuel revenue. The seasonality in the U.S. has always been like that. I mean that's basically the way people perform in this particular market. I mean, it's a little different than it performs in Europe. And in that sense, it's always been marked in the third and the fourth quarter and normally becomes a lot better when people get more money during Christmas and start to pay us back, et cetera.  The dynamic that I basically explained given that there is a very strong second-hand car market in the U.S. and also that people basically don't want to refinance their cars or don't see the availability of loans on cars for the next few months that basically shall help us out, and that's why you see better numbers, and I don't see the cost of risk going beyond the 200 basis points. And Jose gave you a very good explanation of how was the level of the cost of risk before and what is it today, and we expect it to continue. And also the change of mix is helping us out. So it's very important for you to understand that, but this is the way the market has been always and you can see it if you go all the years behind.  In terms of the reporting changes, we're going to continue to basically show the countries as a secondary segment. So you will continue to have that information.

If I can sort of take advantage of -- given you opened that door, in the context of what we've seen in the U.S. within that flat provision, what directionally or a bit of color on what -- how could we expect the U.S. evolve in 2024? And in particular, I took note of your data on repossessions now at 60%, 65%, it was 58%. I think you quoted that number earlier in the year. How quickly do you think the repossessions are going to go back to historical levels? Because presumably this is savings, COVID savings and now you have student loans picking up, is that something we're going to see sort of going back to historical levels already in 2024? Or do you think it could take more time? Just want to understand how you're thinking about the U.S. within that flat group context.  And the second, hopefully, easier one is on the U.K. You've done pretty well considering some of your competitors in the U.K., has been a bit of a car crash. Can you maybe talk about the outlook there, specifically for U.K.? Given what we're seeing in the market, pretty tough competition on deposits. You had your own offering out in September. So maybe you've got a bit more visibility now for Q4 and 2024. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Yes. Thank you, Alvaro. Actually, I was expecting your question on the U.S. So let me give you exactly what is the important different dynamic that car has to the loans and different things. The car in the U.S. is quite interesting. It's not as in Europe, as in Latin America. Actually, people in Europe and Latin America pay first the mortgage and then the auto loan, et cetera. In the U.S., it's the other way around. The U.S., if you don't have a car, you don't have a mean to go to work or to move around. I mean you're completely isolated.  So the behavior of the auto loans in the U.S. is completely different to anything you see because of this particular issue. Without a car, you cannot work and you cannot generate money. So that's exactly why the performance of the portfolio has turned it in that way because people basically take a lot of care to that. And that's exactly why the behavior of delinquencies basically are performing that well. I mean, normally, if the economy complicates, you're going to see that number of 60% to 62%, 63% maybe going up. Let's see how the U.S. evolves. And if we have a soft landing or not, that will all depend on that.  Also, it's important to acknowledge that we are changing the mix of the portfolio, as we have said already. So that's quite important because we are much more concentrating with the funding that we have from our bank to be more in prime and in near prime. And even though we will continue to do so prime because it's a business that we know well, and we manage pretty well in the terms of risk underway, but we are trying to change a little bit the mix of the portfolio. And also, we are offloading some of that risk through asset sales, et cetera. So it's quite important to understand that we are being very cautious about that. I'm very cautious on the way we're managing cost -- sorry, cost of risk. So I hope I answered your question correctly.  And then on the U.K. The U.K., as you have said, we have performed well. We'll end up having a really strong year. We are working really hard to follow a strong strategy in terms of cost. We are also, it's very important, advancing of One Transformation. We believe there is a huge opportunity there, leading to probably -- and the U.K.'s leading probably to its best year in bottom line. But it's important that you see that there is an opportunity there in transforming and decrease the cost that we have in that country. So I really do see the U.K. with a huge opportunity. I've been spending a lot of my time there because I believe there is opportunities.  NII has grown year-on-year 9.3%, is driven by higher rates, as you know, and a strong -- what -- we have a really strong focus on managing the spreads and profitability. So you'll see that we have been lowering the portfolio debt because we're very focused on that. You see that in Q3, I mean, we are, as the rest of the market at 2.2 [ph] both -- and we are offset -- offsetting the increased cost of the retail funding and a slowdown of new originations by basically playing that and also using a different mix of the portfolio and trying to see other opportunities.  It's important to tell you that we are putting profitability ahead of market share. And we have lower risk appetite, as I told you. And we believe that we could have a NIM expansion by doing that. "

First of all, it's quite important to understand that the European Commission has published a proposal of regulation last June, which basically sets a framework and it's a necessary condition for the digital euro to be launched. They have publicly stated the discussion should not be rushed ahead of European elections in June '24. And they're saying that instead, they were examined in a quiet and slow way by the new commission and the new parliament. So we expect a long negotiation process to achieve a common agreement in that sense.  In parallel, what we have seen is the ECB has just finalized investigation phase of the digital euro, as I said. The government counsel published last week the results and they decided to initiate a 2-year preparation phase, as we have heard, basically focused on the actual implementation of it. It will evolve finalizing in the rule book and the selection -- selecting providers that could develop the infrastructure. This is quite important. And this phase will pave way to a potential future decision on issuing the digital euro or not. But we see that it's going to happen.  And as the decision on the digital euro, I don't believe will not be taken before the regulatory proposal is approved. So I don't expect to its release before 2026. On this context, I mean, also as Banco Santander, we are aligned with the European authorities to design the European -- the digital euro, also develop the pan-European integrated payments market. It's basically very important that we believe we generate value for consumers, companies and the financial institutions. And it's also important to say that we will continue to monitor the potential impact the digital euro may have on our banks in Europe. And also it's important for us to have greater clarity as the ECB and the European Commission finalize the regulatory proposal and implementation phase. So that's the way we see it at this point.  With this, I will basically pass it to Jose to tell you. "

Tax rate -- the -- in terms of structural tax rate for the group going forward, I think using 30% is the right number. This year is going to be a bit lower because of the tax benefits on EV in the U.S.  And then organic capital, well, the higher the profitability, obviously, the higher the organic capital generation. We don't expect any significant regulatory charges other than the ones we mentioned, and obviously, always subject to available-for-sale impacts, et cetera. But we don't see any significant inorganic or extraordinary charges to our capital buildup. So you're right. I mean the higher the profitability, the better.  We also have a very strong focus on asset rotation. We have started a team that is going to be looking at ways of optimizing risk-weighted assets across the group. In the first 9 months of this year, we have already rotated the equivalent to around \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac18 billion in risk-weighted assets. We think we can do more or less \u20ac30 billion -- close to \u20ac30 billion -- \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion this year, and that will be the focus going forward. The focus will be to rotate the balance sheet because we might not be the best tenors of some of the assets that we have in our balance sheet, so -- on our balance sheet.  So the focus going forward is going to be optimizing risk-weighted asset consumption and maximizing profitability. So you're right that we would expect the capital buildup to accelerate in the coming quarters. "

So probably, [BASN], the Bankers Association in Brazil -- sorry, the central bank in Brazil will have to regulate. There is a not minor possibility that we will go to a model in which total interest paid by the customer is capped to total principal, which is called the U.K. model.  Again, Santander and FEBRABAN, the Bankers Association, are already working with the Central Bank of Brazil to try to find a best solution. It's very early to comment on the impact because this type of regulation could have an impact on NII, but there might be ways of offsetting this through commission income, et cetera, because there is a lot -- a significant rotation of the balances in Brazil.

And you do have an increase in the ALCO portfolio. But in any case, I was trying to see if you could have some color on the rationale on what caused this evolution? And also, what should we expect in coming quarters?  And then on the U.K. and NII as well. I'm sorry if I missed it, but I was wondering, do you expect -- previously you were talking about a high single-digit increase in NII in the U.K. for this year. You expect that to be the case still? And how do you see it evolving into next year? "

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Okay. Thank you, Carlos. NII, I mean, as you said, grew very strongly in Portugal. It's been helping us out basically because of the repricing of the portfolio, the rates we're going. And I believe that it will continue a good trend towards the end of the year if rates go up a little bit more in Europe. So that will help out. And then we'll stabilize. And that's my view because we see that the rates will stabilize at some time, and we don't see more growth in that sense. So NII should stabilize in Portugal.  In terms of the U.K., I explained to you quite well exactly what's going on. "

        "text": "If I may, before you go, just to give some more color on Portugal. When we look at yield on loans, in the fourth quarter of last year, yield on loans in Portugal was 2.4%, 3.3% in the first quarter, 4% in the second, 4.6% in the third. So the yield on loans basically increasing almost at the same rate every quarter this year. Yield on deposits, 4 basis points, 14 basis points, 26 basis points, 38 basis points, also more or less growing at the same pace. So one quarter, there's obviously seasonality, balances, number of days, all of this may explain the differences. But again, when you look at the trends, the trends in Portugal are very consistent.  We would expect, as Hector said, obviously, there is a limit to the repricing of assets. And mortgages in Portugal, contrary to Spain, are linked to the 6-month Euribor, the 12-month Euribor in Spain. So the flattening out on the asset side in Portugal is going to happen a bit faster than in Spain. But again, the cost of deposits in Portugal is really, really low, and we don't see any competition there. So we remain constructive in the next few quarters in Portugal. "

And we have lower risk appetite given the dynamics in that market, and we combine that -- and we'd like to combine that with a good performance that basically could lead to a NIM expansion. But answering your question, I expect 2023 with a high-single-digit growth and on higher rates, management of deposit cost, while we assume the lower volumes that we have. And that's basically the outlook that we have for the U.K. at this point.  I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement. But I think with that, I answered your question. "

I think the business has guided to a big decline in profits this year. But what do you think is the outlook there for this year? And also when will the NII improve in 2024? "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Thank you, Britta. I will start basically give you the overall view and then Jose can give you a little bit of more details on both. I mean, Spain, as you say, is one of the countries that has benefited the most on the higher rates. And we continue to see, as I said, a strong growth from clients. We have 651,000 new customers -- net new customers in the last 12 months. We see also a strong contribution from the global businesses. Wealth Management is increasing 84% year-on-year. CIB, 11%. I'm talking about PAT. And CIB is also achieving a substantial growth and net margin growth mid-teens, maintaining a superior profitability levels. So you're going to see that.  We expect double-digit NII growth in '23. And in terms we see very factors to consider. We see, as Jose explained to you in detail, assets repricing at least during the first half of '24, clients continue to grow, and betas will be key in this particular issue. We see no meaningful deposit movements in Spain in reaction to prevailing rates. Our deposit base is extremely atomized. 80% of our deposit base have an average balance of \u20ac20,000, which basically contributes to the stability.  Also, it's very important to take into account that the One Transformation I explained is going through in Spain as well, and we're very focused on the product simplification. As I said, we're reducing 21% the product portfolio. We're doing a process of optimization there. But I see that exactly that's the trend that it's going to happen, exactly as Jose basically detailed. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement, but you already gave a lot of detail. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera ",
        "text": "Yes. Britta, let me tell you, yield on loans -- it is the same explanation that we have for Portugal. Quarter-on-quarter, it basically has to do with many -- probably many small things. But when you look at yield on loans in Spain from the fourth quarter of last year at 2.5%, first quarter 3.3%, second quarter 3.8%, fourth quarter 4.3%. So very much almost a straight line increase. And in the case of deposits, also the same, 22 basis points, 53 basis points, 72 basis points, 19 basis points, in the last couple of quarters, 18, 19 basis points increase. So very much flat.  So the point here is that we still have a substantial part of our balance sheet in Spain that will reprice up in the first half of next year. I just use the figure for mortgages, it's \u20ac77 billion and around 60% reprices in the first half. So I think the yield on loans will continue. Although the rates -- interest rates in Spain might stay or in Europe may stay flat, the repricing of assets in Spain will continue for at least the first half of next year.  And in terms of the pressure on the cost of deposits, again, most of institutional deposits, corporate investment banking deposits have already repriced. So the question is to what extent the cash balances in the current accounts will move to time deposits. To what extent customers have excess liquidity in their current accounts to be put aside for time deposits? And we do think that is a limited -- is a very limited amount. So we see not a lot of pressure on that particular part of the business for increased cost of deposits.  In Chile, we have 2 balance sheets, so 2 sensitivities to the balance sheet. One is to rates and the other one is to inflation. Obviously, the relative movements of inflation and rates is what explains what we've seen. So we have seen already inflation going down, rates going down slower. So as inflation continues to go down and rates follow, we will see the reversal. So we see NII in Brazil actually expanding, again gaining momentum towards the second half of next year, but expanding substantially in the second half of next year relative to the second half of this year because, again, the relative movement that we have between inflation, which is the U.S. and rates.

But I wonder if you could give guidance on -- for the full year, what kind of NII growth you expect in euros? And then finally, on Argentina, quite volatile, and we have elections soon. So I was wondering if you can give what you expect an impact from the elections, but also if you could give guidance on the earnings for this year and the next. "

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Thank you. Okay. Mexico, as you have seen, has been -- had a strong growth in NII. It's a combination of many things. First of all, the rates increase, but most of that is basically because of the change of the mix that we have performed in the country. We saw an opportunity of basically switching a little bit of the portfolio into credit cards and unsecured loans and payroll loans to individuals. So to have a much better structured mix than we used to have before. So Mexico is helped out by the rates, but also by the change of the mix of the portfolio, all right? So it's quite important to see that.  We see that Mexico will continue to have a really good trend. I mean, Mexico, as you have seen, has grown pretty well, pretty nicely over the past few months, and I believe it is going to grow strongly also on '24. The important thing to understand exactly how rates are going to perform, and that's going to depend a little bit on what happens in the U.S., all right? But I see that if rates continue to be stable and the economy performs well, I believe that Mexico should develop very good on '24 and continue to have very good growth on NII.  In terms of Argentina, as you have seen, we have a, I would say, complicated environment to say the least about what's going on. We really -- and I wouldn't like to basically make a prediction of what could happen, but looks that may -- things may stay as they are. We have, as you know, a potential difference between the -- in the exchange rate -- between the official exchange rate and what's happening in the black market. So in that sense, let's see how it evolves and how the government would like basically to land the difficult task they have in front. "

And that will continue to be the key element. Obviously, there is a big difference between official exchange rates and nonofficial exchange rates. We are aware of that. We are aware of the impact that a revaluation could have on our books. So we are managing that to minimize the impact, if that was to happen. And obviously, again, the key is to preserve the value of our investment in Brazil, but basically by managing and investing inflation risk. "

Can you just cover the outlook for 2024, please? This is the first one.  The second would be about the ALCO portfolio. I see an increase of about \u20ac10 billion in the quarter. Can you please refer to strategy and the level of unrealized loss that you have on portfolio?  And finally, on Poland, if you can please comment on the outlook for the extension on the mortgage volume, please? "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera ",
        "text": "So let me start with Poland. The proposal comes from the current government. We need -- we are going to have a new government, and this will have to go to parliament. So very early stages of this proposal, and I am almost 100% sure that some other form of proposal, if any, will be conducted because again, this is a proposal of the existing government, not the upcoming government.  The ALCO -- sorry, also Britta about this and I forgot. We have more or less \u20ac27 billion, almost \u20ac30 billion of ALCO in Spain at an average yield of around 3.4%. We expect to end the year at around \u20ac30 billion. We might increase the ALCO a little bit more next year, obviously, taking advantage of the higher yields. So depending on how you measure the profitability of this, if you measure this against average cost of deposits sort of against the marginal funding cost, you have different profitability. But obviously, this is going to add significant push to the profitability of the group next year.  DCB, I don't know if you want to comment on DCB and the outlook for the business. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Yes. I mean on DCB, there has been a particular change in the business in this year. In DCB in particular, there is one very important. We had really good growth in terms of loans, but the majority of those loans -- a vast majority is basically stock financing. Given the dynamics that the auto market has had over the past few months, first of all, there was not enough production, then the production started and now basically, we are financing a huge amount of the car dealerships. We expect basically to start -- the dealerships start moving that inventory out and that basically will produce more -- the normal auto loans and then will give us the normal NII that we are accustomed to at this point. So that's basically the way we believe that this is going to evolve.  It is important to acknowledge that also we have been able to finance a lot of this portfolio with our own deposits instead of going that much to wholesale. And also, you're going to see a dynamic of what Jose was telling you about of selling a lot of these portfolios out into the market once we basically start out giving out loans, direct to individuals. So we believe that the outlook would be good.  It's important to see also how the economy evolves mainly in Europe, and that would also depend on how fast the inventory is moved. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia-Cantera ",
        "text": "Yes. Well, final comment here. Although we have a neutral position into rates in DCB, obviously, the higher the rates, the more difficult the business is, particularly when rates start going up. So once rates stabilize, the business also stabilizes and increases the profitability. The difficulty in managing DCB is when rates actually go up because although we do not have sensitivity to that movement, obviously the customers do not react well to that. So that is one point I wanted to make.  The other point is on cost of risk. We would expect the cost of risk in DCB to gradually trend towards the normalized level of around 50 basis points a year, taking into account that this will depend on asset sales, securitizations, et cetera. So our aim is to try to minimize that, like Hector was saying, by managing the assets that we have on our books. "

And if you can give a little bit of color in terms of pattern of NII expansion next year, should we be expecting like a linear increase through the year? Or you're going to have some degree of seasonality at some point?  Second one is on the U.S. I'm sorry if you have mentioned that already, but what has driven the 13 percentage point decline of the coverage in the quarter in the units?  And the third one is on capital return. Given your comments around accelerated capital generation as profitability goes up and mindful of Basel IV, do you see any chances of topping up your capital or increasing your shareholder return in '24? "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi ",
        "text": "Thank you. Look, Ignacio, in terms of NII in Brazil, I think it's important. I mean, we reiterate, first of all, as I have seen the worst of the NII is behind us. We continue expecting an improvement both in NIM and NII in the coming quarters. Rates, as Jose explained to you, have started to curve down, I mean, 100 basis points in the Q3 '23. Our numbers basically tell us that maybe they will come down towards the end of the year to 11.75%. So that basically tells you, reflecting the Q2 decline in rates plus credit activity increasing plus market-related NII no longer a drag, NII improvements. So that basically tells you that we -- yes, we believe that the second -- sorry, that the fourth quarter is going to be better than the third.  In terms of what do we see in the future is exactly as Jose explained to you, is that we see a trend going upwards towards -- more towards the second half of the year, next year. And that's the way we see it. It's going to help out if rates continue to come down and volumes continue to go up, but that's exactly the beauty of the diversification model that we have at this point.  In terms of the U.S. coverage, it's basically, I mean, the normal seasonality that we have discussed. And we have an update in loan-to-values including the current value of the cars. And in addition on the quarters, we have CRE charges due to downgrade rating of several companies in the sector and fintech charges due to originations in that sense. But I see that this will normalize towards the beginning of next year, as I said. So in that sense, I don't see a problem in that is -- also, there was an increase in provisions mainly, as I said, I mean, the LTV and the Stage 3 balance with the GST remediation. But other than that, I think it's quite what -- it was quite normal.  Cost of risk, as I said, is 1.77%, and is below the 200 basis points that we indicated as guidance for the year. And total coverage ratio is double. The total loan portfolio is flat year-on-year, 2.7%. I don't know if that answers your questions. And in terms of the capital return, please, Jose? "

    "transcript": "Begona Morenes: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Banco Santander's Conference Call to Discuss our Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our Executive Chair, Ms. Ana Botin; our CEO, Mr. Hector Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. Jose Garcia-Cantera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have in the Q&A session. With this, I will hand over to Ms. Botin. Ana, the floor is yours.\nAna Botin: Good morning, everybody, and thank you, Begonia. It\u2019s great pleasure to be with you all and thank you for joining. As a reminder, we have recently announced, a last step towards one Santander. We finished the creation of the five global businesses, which we began a few years ago. I would come back to this in more detail in a moment, but I would like to note that any reference to these global businesses today relate to the new business definitions that were communicated last December. So, the focus today will be, first, main highlights of our results and update on our strategy. Hector will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I'll conclude with a few closing remark remarks on our guidance for '24. So, the high level messages we're presenting record results, \u20ac11.1 billion. We have delivered again on all our financial targets. Our customer focus and scale are driving consistent, sustainable profitable growth. In '23, we added 5 million customers and our revenue increased double-digit. And we did this as we continue, and I something we've reiterated year-after-year. We are investing for the future, and we are also making excellent progress towards a more simple and more integrated model. This is the driver to the improvement in efficiency year after year, 173 basis points. And it's also the driver to increase our profitability this year to about 15% as we committed. We have also in '23 strengthened our balance sheet, growing deposits, sound asset quality, again, below our guidance, and increasing our gross organic capital generation. So, in a summary, backed by strong profit growth with less shares following the buybacks, our earnings per share grew 21%, our TNAV and cash DPS by 15%. And once approved by shareholders, we expect our dividend per share to be near 50% higher than last year. So, just briefly, to the income statement, again, you can see the successful execution of our strategy and a strong top line performance. And what's really important is that across all our global businesses, this is the case. Our net interest income rose 12%, 16% in constant euros in a context of higher rates and with a special good performance in our retail and commercial banking business in Europe and Mexico. Net fee income was also higher. In this case, the network effects are the driver and the two global divisions of global businesses, the corporate bank and payments driving higher fees. Very important, the sustainability and the low volatility of our results across the cycle, I want special focus on the high quality of our revenue, where net interest income and fees are more than 95% of total income and drove the vast majority of Santander's total revenue growth. We're growing costs less than revenues, so positive operating leverage, including investment in our transformation where we're already seeing results. We achieved record net operating income of 32 billion that's the second highest among our global peers, again, showing our continuing focus on operational performance. And finally, the strength of our model is again evident in our cost of risk, where we finish at 1.18 again better than our guidance, and therefore, delivering on all the targets as I just mentioned. So what this means in terms of capital generation and the double-digit shareholder value creation that resulted from the results. We're ending the year, at the same level as September with a CET1 ratio at 12.3%, and that is after accruing 20 basis points for the buyback, which means that actually would have been at 50 basis points on a like for like compared to last year. We delivered 15% growth in shareholder value creation. Again, this represents an increase of more than 10 billion in the year and already mentioned, 50% increase in cash DPS against '23 results once we get shareholders' approval in March. The reduction in the number of shares through our share buybacks also, of course, helped, and a higher payout, which we increased from 40 to 50 this year. We continue to believe that at these prices, share buybacks are one of the most effective ways for us to generate shareholder value. Since '21, we have repurchased 9% of our outstanding shares, and buybacks currently deliver on a return on investment of close to 18% for our shareholders. So, let me just spend a few minutes looking at the consistency in the delivery of our plans and our targets. Step-by-step, we're making our business model stronger. We continue to deliver sustained earnings growth year-after-year, low volatility, high predictability, while we increase capital and shareholder remuneration. The record results in '23 means a 10% CAGR in profit since 2013, increasing profitability to 15.1 from below 10, again, improvements each and every year with the exception of COVID. And at the same time, we have steadily grown our capital. Please remember that when I took over, we had a CET1 ratio of 8.3, so we have a lot more capital and delivering much better results. I also want to point you to a couple of numbers, which is over the past nine years, we've generated approximately 26 billion of capital, which we've used to build up CET1 to 12.3 and that is on top of the 27 billion paid to shareholders over this time period. Very importantly, today's shareholder remuneration is five times that of 2014 and has grown again every year except for the COVID, crisis where dividends we're halted in light of the ECB's recommendations. As we think about value creation, this is our framework. We presented this one year ago in our new medium term plan. This is a new phase of value creation, where we are having a very strong first year as you've seen in today's results. We're on track to achieve all the targets and very importantly, compounding our equity through increased profits, which will result in increasing shareholder remuneration as we deliver this growth and profitability down the road. I would like now to spend a few minutes on the completion of this journey towards the five global businesses with retail and consumer DCB, which, of course, is the majority of Santander. And this is the reason we are confident we will continue to deliver medium term targets and beyond the customer focus, diversification, huge strength at times like this, and because we are doubling down on a very unique Santander strength, which very few can replicate, which is our local leadership and our global scale and network. We are the only bank in the world that has such a global and in market scale at the same time, 165 million customers globally with a market share over 10% in most of our core markets and operating at scale in every one of them. The strength and potential of Santander's scale network, again, are already evident in the numbers for this year. We can serve more customers, capture new revenue streams, that some of our competitors cannot. And it is precisely this network effect, which is helping us to grow cross border flows and you see this already in the very substantial growth in global businesses like the corporate bank, and we are increasingly seeing that also in payments and others. But very important, this scale allows us to invest together once across the group to operate more efficiently and to deliver better customer experience. So it's a win-win combination, both in revenues and efficiency. And you're going to see much more of this in the years ahead, because this combines a very strong starting point with a strong franchise, and in parallel, the deployment of our global platforms, which include proprietary technology. Again, this is incredibly differential for Santander, these are the most of our peers. And we are ultimately aiming to be the most profitable retail and commercial and consumer bank in every market where we operate. We're already top three in terms of profitability in 8 of our 10 markets, but we have a lot more upside. I'm not going to go over this slide, but it's really a summary just to remind us where we are. It's a last step. We took steps in the last few years in many of our global divisions. But now in the retail bank and in the consumer bank/DCB, we have taken a very important strategic step. We're operating in this way already during 2023. We're pulling investments. We're reducing cost in a structural way. And I want to emphasize in a structural way. We are already implementing this common business model and investing more efficiently and again, improving customer experience and driving sustainable and profitable growth. So, just briefly, the five divisions. The retail commercial bank, which I will refer to as retail. Our vision, we said it a year ago is becoming a digital bank with branches. This means three very important steps. First, simplifying our product offering in making it digitally available with a branch network and our people serving us very powerful sales and value added advisory channel. In 2023, we reduced our products by 16% globally, and 56% of our products are already fully available through digital channels. But very importantly, in the second half of the year, we did most of this. So, there is an acceleration in this transformation which Hector is driving. Second step, really important, a common operating model across our banks, which allows automation at a much higher level, freeing up time to talk to customers and focus on value added services. Again, dedication of resources and this is a metric we'll continue to track. Noncommercial activities, dropped 1.5% in the second half of '23. Again, a trend that is accelerating, and you'll see more good news of this in the next few years. And the third incredibly strategic step is our global tech platform. This is being rolled out in retail commercial. This is not a PowerPoint. This is happening. We are leveraging Gravity, which is our award winning backend where we partnered with Google and ODS, which is a cloud based front-end, which is built by us, operating in Openbank and tested and working Openbank as a reminder, is the largest native digital bank in Europe in '23 by size of deposits. All our retailer and consumers, and not just retail, but our consumer bank, DCB, all will be convergent to this common retail global front tech, starting in '24 with the U.S. This is going to allow us to both drive customer growth, but also better efficiency and therefore profitability, in a sustainable way. So, our consumer bank, this is digital consumer bank. The goal here is to become the partner of choice for our customers and, again, deliver superior profitability. Three main points here is in auto and consumer lending. We're offering best-in-class solutions for our both commercial customers and consumers. We are benchmarking very much the same as in retail against the best players, whether they're banks or digital players. We want to be number one, fastest credit approval, fastest on-boarding, more convenient, etcetera. The second point is we are and we've done this already for a couple of years managing our OEM relationships and our retail relationships globally. This is, again, a very important advantage. This means, for example, we can integrate the large digital e-commerce players just once. And, of course, that is something which is not available to many, and expanding our partnerships in Europe to LatAm and the U.S. And third and really important, we're planning to grow our business and improve efficiency and profitability by deploying these common platforms. And there are several. There's Openbank, of course, leasing. There's buy now, pay later, which we have built our own buy now, pay later. It's already up and running in Europe, and this common front end with OEMs and dealers. Again, we deployed a new pan-regional leasing platform in '23 and very important, in the U.S, our own Openbank ODS Gravity platform is already technically up and running. We expect to launch in the U.S. in the second half of '24, a fully digital offering nationwide, and then in '25 to have all our U.S. customers including our current retail customers on that same platform. Again, this is a big driver already behind our numbers, improving our efficiency, overall, but specific in the U.S., I would be an even bigger driver down the road. In our corporate bank, we're building and have been on this task as a global platform for at least five, six years. We are leveraging our strengths, our competitive advantages to ensure we can deepen relationships and have more profitable customer relationship across our markets, whilst maintaining the same risk profile. And we will continue to pursue the same strategy, focusing on customers. More than 80% of our revenues are coming from customer revenues and with a very close coordination between the global local teams, this is working really well. We're now having strategic dialogues with customers that we're mostly lending customers, and that is something which is happening from day one with some of the new teams in the U.S. But there's also a very important opportunity to leverage the 9 million existing group corporate and SME customers with these products and of course, this will grow collaboration revenues. This will deepen our relationships, will drive profitable growth, growing fees and support our capital light model. I want to also point out some of the numbers on the slide where our Corporate Investment Bank business is already growing faster than the balance sheet, and you can see here how total revenues to RWAs is improving to 6.7%. And last but not least, this is a very predictable, sustainable, and low volatility business, delivering consistent profitable growth for the last five, six years, a very different path from other players. So, again, the goal is to really make our global centers of expertise stronger. We've done that in London, and we're now doing that in the U.S. to make sure we can leverage our network, Accelerate process automation. We will increase asset rotation, and, this all in all will drive efficiency and profitability improvements. In our wealth business, we are aiming again to leverage our strengths. Our global model is aiming to capture growth by leveraging, in the case of private banking, our strong presence in Miami, one of the top Latin American private bankers. So we'll expand, on that basis, in the U.S., in our asset manager, again, leveraging to the strengths we have in verticals such as renewables, infrastructure, the SMEs. Again, this is something we've already been doing the last few years. And in insurance, focusing on verticals where we still have upside and growth opportunities like health savings, also SMEs, in general, again, the same principles as for other Global division simplification, in the case, for example, of our investment products and building together. I want to end by saying the same as for corporate bank that private banking is leveraging this network where we have different businesses working together. And this is again a very, very unique strength that drives profitability. Last but not least, payments. In our payments business, it's a large and growing and profitable industry. We have a unique position. We are on both sides of the value chain. We will use this to become a global leader in payments, supported by a current franchise of 165 million customers and 100 million active payment card customers. We're driving customer growth by offering a bundle proposition. As of today, this is also allowing us to grow in the open market because our products are competitive with the best. We have 16% of revenue coming from the open market, and we expect this to continue to grow significantly in '24 and beyond. We are leveraging, again, as in the other divisions, and optimizing our use of CapEx to meet customer needs in our acquiring platform, Getnet, which is already number 3 in LatAm. It's adapting to customers' payment ecosystems. We're also deploying our global cards platform starting with Brazil, which, again, will drive significant opportunities for all the countries as we roll this out. I want to just point to one specific number in PagoNxt, where activity increased 15% to reach 16%, sorry, 36 billion of total transactions. And very importantly, one of the key we gave you in Investor Day, which is EBITDA margin, which last year was 9%, 10%, has risen to 22% this year. Sorry, 25%, almost 25% in '23 already. So, we are focused on growth. You'll see the numbers, but we're also focusing on profitability, and we've done a big improvement, achieve a big improvement this year. So, let me just give you a specific example with the U.S. of how these global platforms are being rolled out in different countries. I mentioned it already briefly, but very important, the first technical integration of our proprietary tech for consumer, which combines the ODS, i.e. the Openbank front-end without Gravity backend will be launched in the U.S. in '24. This is a fully digital savings account. We'll start with that. In a year from now, in the first quarter of '25, we'll complement this with the transactional offering. And really important, this provides a scalable platform to strategically continue growing our business, including, improving profitability. And this is already showing in some of the numbers. One of the key metrics we look at is a retail deposit cost to serve as this has a very important effect on profitability where we can originate more assets, but we also need the funding side. I want to just remind that we are not and we do not want to be a universal bank in U.S. As you can see in the screen, we're not a full retail commercial bank as we're in Mexico or Spain or some of the big U.S. banks. We're a consumer bank with a limited commercial, multifamily business. We are targeting to grow in segments where we have local scale, such as consumer or commercial again or we can leverage the contribution of the group, such as the CIB or wealth. Now with the platform on the retail side, we will be much more efficient, and Hector will share some of these big numbers. You saw them at Investor Day. We are ahead of our plan in terms of, improving efficiency on the retail and deposit gathering side. And just as a closing remark, between 2019 and '22 Santander U.S. distributed to our shareholders more than 8.3 billion in dividends. So, we are confident to reach our profitability targets of 15% in the medium-term, in our medium-term plan. So, let me just finish by summing up. I'm not going to go through the slide, but I want to give you a sense of these five global businesses underweight in the Santander model. Just to reiterate the importance of retail and consumer, this is 70% of our revenues. This is where we have the most upside, and we already are delivering on some of these platforms. I'm not going to go through the others, but I just want to say that this model has already delivered improving profitability and growth, a 169 improvement in our RoTE in '23. Again, by moving to these five global businesses will unlock the full potential of our business model. It's all now going to be about execution, and Hector and I and all the teams are very focused on that. So, again, we aim to become, as I said, the most profitable bank in each one of our markets. So Hector, we now take you through the performance in '23.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Ana. Good morning to everyone. Moving on to the income statement, remember that as we always do, we present growth rates both in current and constant euros. As Ana already mentioned, we achieved a record profit last year with double-digit revenue and net operating income growth. But we also have a very solid quarter with profit growing 1% in euros even after seasonal effects in Q4 from the deposit warranty fund contribution in Spain and the bank levy in the UK, which represent around 210 million post tax. On the line trends remain strong as profit excluding the decisional factors will have grown about 8% in the quarter. Differences between growth in euros and cost in euros became more evident in the quarter as the devaluation of the Argentine peso in December introduced some distortions across the P&L. Remember that the full impact of the devaluation across the whole year is entirely recorded in Q4. Excluding Argentina, profit would have grown 7% in the quarter in current euros, and there is no material impact from other currencies, so growth in constant and current euros is pretty much the same across all the lines. I will now take you through the main lines in the P&L in much more detail. Starting with the revenue, there was a strong growth driven in the custom revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter. In the year, it was primarily supported by net interest income in the retail as we actively manage interest rates tailwinds in Europe and Mexico, and the positive fee performance of CIB and payments mainly in Latin America. Moreover, we have delivered double-digit revenue growth across most of the businesses, especially those that benefit most from the network effects. Revenue and the corporate center improved by more than 1 billion due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and the lower impact from the FX hedging. NII continue to be the main driver of our revenue growth. In '23, it was 16% higher year-on-year in constant euros on the back of basically positive sensitivity to rising rates in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in the Americas. In terms of profitability, we improved net interest margin year-on-year and every quarter, even in Q4, if we exclude the distortion from the devaluation we had in Argentina. This is mainly explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment. These gains from credit yields more than a weighted funding cost, thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration leading to our robust margin expansion. Going forward, we expect lower rates to drive net interest income higher through our consumer businesses across the group and our retail business in South America while the positive impact from interest rates in Europe starts to moderate. This is a great example of the power of the diversification that we have. Turning to fees. In an environment of low fee growth in general, as a result of subdued loan demand and weak consumer activity, our net fee income grew 7% in constant euros compared to Q4 '22 and 5% year-on-year. CIB and payments were double digits and compensated the other businesses that were more affected by lower activity or market volatility, which again demonstrates the value of diversification. We saw a strong growth in CIB across regions and products while we strengthened our capabilities in the U.S. Total payments volume grew 22% year-on-year, backed mainly by Brazil, Europe, and Mexico. On the other hand, consumer fees were affected by regulatory changes and lower activity in the U.S. In '24, we expect fees to grow supported by the increase in the number of customers and transactionalityas we implement our common platforms and reap the benefits from our new operating model becoming the principal bank for our customers. Our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 44.1%. Savings from one transformation initiatives are already offsetting our investments in technology and digitalization. Cost, as you have seen, remained flat in real terms in 2023 and driving the cost to serve, as Ana mentioned earlier. This is reflected in efficiency gains of almost 2 percentage points in the year, led by Europe, which improved 5 percentage points driven by strong revenue growth and cost almost flat in real terms. In North America and DCB, cost increases slightly in real terms, reflecting the impact of investments to accelerate transformation and some perimeter effects. As mentioned, in Q4, efficiency ratio is always affected by the DGF charge. If you exclude it, efficiency is 43.7%, fairly in line with that of Q3 despite the higher impacts from transformation in the quarter. We expect that savings from one transformation will become more evident in '24 and onwards, which, together with a positive revenue outlook, should result in further efficiency gains. We are transforming the bank in the right way because we are structurally changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. The efficiencies we have captured from one transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 112 basis points in efficiency improvements. For example, in the U.S., we have already generated around \u20ac200 million in savings from transformation and simplification initiatives. Our global and network businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 28 basis points in efficiency gains in '23 alone. Multi-Latins and Multi-Europeans are initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model grew at very high rates, with revenue increasing 40% in 2023 alone. Finally, our global technology capabilities have already generated 32 basis points in efficiencies so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture a 187 million savings this year, mainly driven by the deployment of Gravity, new global agreements with vendors and the implementation of new IT and ops shared services. Credit quality remained robust across all of our footprint and ended '23 in line with our expectation supported by our prudent approach to risk, strong labor markets and resilience in used car prices, mainly in the U.S. The NPL ratio was stable and in line with expected levels. We met our cost of risk target ending '23 below 1.2% despite the impact of single name cases and additional provisions in Poland related to the Swiss franc mortgages. Spain continues to perform well, NPL improving 21 basis points and cost of risk is stable year-on-year, supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions. Both metrics remained stable across the quarter. In other European units, the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels, and we expect it to remain below or in line with through the cycle averages. Normalization continues in the U.S. and Mexico, in line with expectations. And group credit quality trends are confirmed in Brazil as NPL ratio improved for the fourth quarter in a row and underlying cost of risk evolution reflects the improving macro conditions. Going forward, we don't foresee signs of significant credit quality deterioration in any subsidiary or at the group level. As we have discussed in previous presentations, our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment, product and country. Moreover, our balance sheet is low risk. The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low average LTVs. In '23, loans decreased 1% as higher rates reduced the credit demand and incentivized early repayments, which was especially evident in Europe. Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America, and ECB. Deposits continue to grow well, up 2% both year-on-year and in the quarter as deposits inflows more than offset savings used to prepare the mortgages. Growth in the year was mainly concentrated in time deposits as customers seek higher rates. Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, around 75% of our deposits are transactional, which are a lot thicker, and high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposits warranty schemes. Mutual funds rose 13% with broad based growth across all countries except the U.S. following a year of instability in '22. Closing with the capital, we maintained a CET1 ratio of 12.3% in Q4. That's 0.2 percentage points, up if we exclude the impact from the new EBA guidelines related to the accrual of the share buybacks, driven by strong growth gross organic capital generation, sorry. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a front book return on risk weighted assets of 2.7%. That's up from 2.6% in 2022, equivalent to RoTE in excess of 15%, which will support profitability going forward. Finally, we continue to enhance portfolio management and balance sheet mobilization, improving the percentage of RWAs with positive economic value added, progressing well towards our Investor Day target of 85% by year '25. These principles of capital management will help us to continue build capital over the next few years, and we are confident that our CET1 ratio will remain above 12% even after taking into account the final implementation of Basel III in 2025. That's all from my side, Ana. Thank you. Over to you.\nAna Botin: Thank you very much, Hector. So, let me just sum up very briefly so we can go to questions. So, three very simple points, '23 was a very first strong year in our new face of value creation. By the way, the best is yet to come. We grew customers. We increased revenue and profits double-digit in all regions and businesses, basically. Second, a lot of this has been driven by the structural change in the model, by one transformation to one Santander. There was also, of course, an improved operating context, especially for our retail business and especially in Europe this year. And point number three, we have further strengthened our already very strong balance sheet, increasing our CET1 ratio and, very importantly, with very strong credit quality across our footprint and in line with our expectations. Once again, all of this, of course, leading to the 15% growth in value creation and 21% increase in EPS, and the highest shareholder remuneration in our history in terms of both cash dividend plus share buybacks. So what this means, again, is we've delivered once again on all our '23 targets. We're on track to achieve the 2025 goals that we communicated last year, and very important, as Hector mentioned, you're just seeing the initial results of our transformation in our '23 results. You're going to see much more coming in the next few years. I want to emphasize again that not only do we have solid foundations, but these foundations are already proving on our model that we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth, increased returns to our shareholders, leveraging our model. I'm taking the last step we took this year in our retail and consumer business is absolutely critical to the confidence we have for the next couple of years because it depends on us. So, our guidance for '24 is, '24 will be an even better year for Santander. You can see here the numbers. We are confident that our customer focus, diversification will be differential this year vis-\u00e0-vis our peers. We have many engines, and all of the engines are going strong with different focuses in the regions, but all our global businesses going strong. We'll continue to accelerate the implementation of our model in the retail and consumer, to deliver again on these targets. Just very briefly, if you go down, across the slide, we continue to see revenue growth mid single digit in '24. This will be supported by net interest income growth in our consumer businesses. You saw Hector's presentation that this was the opposite this year. This year, the consumer top line will be much stronger than this year will be also driven in terms of regions in our retail business in South America and Mexico with higher growth than Europe. And very importantly, much higher fees in many of our global businesses than we saw this year, driven once again both by customer growth and by increased engagement with these customers. Again, the one transformation will be absolutely key and delivering this, supporting both our customer growth and our efficiency. In terms of cost of risk, we'll be roughly flat against this year, on an underlying basis ahead of this year. We had some one offs this year. We said last year and we continue to be in a prudent conservative risk appetite and this is still the case. There will be some normalization in our provisions in our consumer businesses based on our current economic forecast. And finally, we continue to be very positive overall in terms of revenue, but very importantly also on efficiency. You can see we are continuing to target positive operating jaws with flattish costs for next year leading to a cost income below 43% and a return on tangible equity of 16%. So, we're now happy to take your questions. Again, thank you very much.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can we start the Q&A session and have the first question, which I believe is from Ignacio Ulargui?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Ulargui: I have two questions if I may link a bit to the revenue growth tackle the first one, which is when we look to the mid-single-digit revenue growth, and you have just give a bit of clarity on that, but just wanted to give a bit of sense of what will be the driver of the growth, NII or fees in that customer engagement that you were commenting before. And in terms of businesses, which would be in your view the one that has the biggest potential into 2024? The second one is focused on course. You've made a case for one transformation throughout the presentation. I would just like to get when you mentioned flattish cost, what should be looking for going forward? What is the advantage that the global footprint will give Santander in terms of that, in translating into cost growth efficiency again will continue towards say, 42 in 2025, which if I remember correctly was the target of the strategy planned. So, we are not yet at the end of the journey. We are just still in the process of getting that?\nAna Botin: So in terms of revenues, we of course delivered a very high, remember, we've started a very strong year. Our guidance for the three years was high single digit revenue. We've delivered double-digit. What's very important is that what you've seen this year is not just a context and the retail side in Europe, of course, with higher rates, but it's very much backed by strong customer activity across all businesses. You can see that, for example, in our transactions per customer, which grow 10% year-on-year. As I said, the retail Europe business has had very strong tailwinds. We do expect this to continue. We have positive momentum in all our five global businesses. I want to be clear on this. They're going to come from different regions and different sites. I'll give you a high level and then maybe Hector can give you a bit more detail. So again, revenue growing at mid-single-digit, the high level summary of the drivers of this, on revenue would be first positive revenue growth in our retail business, very high double-digits in South America, Brazil, Chile, with a positive sensitivity to falling rates. You've seen that already in Q4 and of course, very strong momentum in Mexico. If you look at the other important global business consumer, which this year suffered from the higher rates, this year it's exactly the opposite. So, you're going to see consumer in Europe and consumer in the U.S. with much better performance next year in terms of the top line than they had this year with volume growth and positive sensitivity to lower rates. Again, that's also going to be good for fees. Overall in fees, they're going to be driven, as Hector said, by customer growth, increased transactionality. And very important, as we implement these global platforms, you're going to see much more of that. But again, the high performing fee businesses will be corporate bank would be payments. But maybe Hector, you want to give a couple of the highlights for on revenues. We'll take net interest income maybe in another question, otherwise it's going to be too long a reply, but net interest income we also projecting that to rise again, mostly in retail and consumer. But, Hector, why do you want to give us some more?\nHector Grisi: Sure. Thank you. Okay. I mean, you're going to see the main drivers of growth is going to be retail, CIB and consumer, as Ana told. Mid single digit and positive revenue growth in '24, you're going to see a little bit of the region's basically Europe moderating because of the rate but we don't expect the rates basically to go to the levels of that we had some time ago. You're going to see also that, the main driver will be South America and what's going on in Mexico, and then also you're going to see good growth from coming from the U.S. Okay. So, in that sense, you'll see also the consumer business globally in NIR both in Europe, in the U.S. it should grow benefited by credit growth and the progressive re-pricing that we have. Okay? And you're going to see in CIB higher income from financial transactions. Both answering your question in terms of fee, we expect the fee income to grow and that's very important. As Anna was saying, supported by the strategy of being the number one bank for our customers. This is quite important. The moment that you become the number one bank to your customer, fees basically and different revenue growth exponentially, and that's going to help us quite a lot. You have heard a lot about connectivity several times, but let me tell you why it's very important. Okay? Connectivity between the global businesses and platforms and the countries is the one that drives a strong free generation. Okay. That basically leads to double-digit fee growth for most of our global businesses in '24 so we can reach the mid to high single digit growth ambition that we have on the fees. Okay? So that's very important. And, going to cost, I don't know if I can comment fairly quickly or you want to comment on that?\nAna Botin: Yes, let me just give a high-level and then maybe you can give a bit more detail. So, basically, what's important in cost is that we want to do better in cost next year than this year. We're aiming for, I would say, flattish cost. So, the goal is to grow customers, grow top line have positive operating leverage of flattish cost that is below 43% by the end of '24. You also said, how do we see it in '25? Obviously, we see it better. As I said, we intend to go step-by-step sustainably getting better. We've had big improvements in '23, '24. We expect also improvements in '25 and reaching at least our target, if not better. I'm not changing the guidance. I'm just saying we to do better than that. So I want to be clear on that. But yes, we see many more benefits. And I want to again insist on the structural change in the model, and that is what one transformation is allowing us to do. We're reducing not just efficiency as a ratio, but the cost to serve the customer. We see a very, very strong acceleration in the numbers that you have in the presentation in the second half of the year, and we hope to carry that. We have positive momentum in all our markets. And again, I use the example of the U.S. because the U.S. is the place where we have an upscale auto business. But with our common platforms in the consumer and retail banks, we will get to be very competitive on the deposit gathering side. You saw in the slide that Hector showed that we had targeted around 400 million in savings in our consumer business in the U.S. by '25. With delivered 200 million this year. We are, of course, investing investments in the U.S. transformation will not be as large next year. So you are going to see a much better performance for the U.S. as a whole in '25. But what I said before, we will migrate our existing retail customers in '25 to this new platform. So in '25 and again, this is only one example with the U.S., driven by one transformation by the common platform that technically is already up and running, which is in the regulatory approval process. So that should drive increased efficiencies. And then again in Hector's slide. You saw that one transformation is helping us across the board in many other areas in technology. So our investments, one transformation investment in technology have reached 2.4, but they've been more than offset in real terms by savings in the global tech platform. So again, we're very confident that these numbers will be delivered and will get better. You want to give a bit more on the one transformation.\nHector Grisi: Do you want me to compliment? I think this is one very important point, Ignacio, to remember about. I mean, one transformation is not just about the platforms. There are two steps before it, which are quite important where you see the impact on the cost. One is simplification. As you have seen in one of Ana's slides, you saw the amount of products that were basically diminishing throughout all the whole organization. So that's very important. That's simplification. Then the second is automation, which basically allows us to automate a huge amount of processes and basically have people in the branches and mainly a lot of amount of our products in our apps, which basically allows us to spend more time with clients selling products, et cetera, and also diminishing the cost. Opti means better service user experience, less cost per transaction and client, more revenues, which is best basically means, profitability. And then you're going to see an inflection point that goes through '24, '25 when the platforms are being deployed and cost should start coming down in a much faster way.\nOperator: Benjamin Toms from RBC.\nBenjamin Toms: You've guided for UK NIM to be down in 2024. Can you quantify how much NIM pressure you'd expect to materialize this year in the UK versus the Q4 exit rate? Or if it's easier, express this as a percentage expectation for NII change in the UK 2024 versus 2023. And secondly, your structural hedge notional in the UK increased by 7 billion or 7% quarter-on-quarter. That compares to a fall in current accounts of about 1.6 billion, that's a little counterintuitive. Can you explain this is driven by growth in savings deposits? Or rather, is it because you manage the structural hedge using a dynamic rather than the caterpillar approach? And could you guide us, please, for how much change you expect in the structural hedge notional in the UK in 2024?\nAna Botin: So yes, let me just frame the answer in terms of the UK NIM in the context of our retail business. So again, our overall retail business for '24 will do better than '23, driven more by the Americas, in this case, both Latin America, but also the U.S. because it's on the consumer side actually. So, what's very important is again, single and mid single digit growth is what we are guiding in terms of revenue growth overall. With mid single digit growth overall, I mean, also for net interest income. Within that, the UK, this year has delivered a 13%, I believe, 13% RoTE. Will continue to be double-digit, but will be lower profitability. So, as you as you know volumes and the top line net interest income, I'll let Hector and Jose give you a bit more detail on that, but has not been as strong because we have basically managed the UK for profitability. So, we have a very strong business in mortgages, very strong business in current accounts in the UK at scale and competitive. And for '24, we expect still double-digit profitability, but lower than this year. What's important and again, as we think about the one transformation, that is going to help maybe not as much as in other countries next year in the U.S. in terms of the top line, but is going to help already on the cost side. So, we're guiding UK should be flattish cost next year with low cost of risk, in a very, very strong balance sheet. And so, again, leading to lower profitability overall in the UK, but still double-digit RoTE. So, in terms of, I don't know if you want to give a bit more detail on volumes or on NIM in the UK?\nHector Grisi: Sure. I will do so. But mainly, I think it's important to tell you a couple of things. As Ana said, basically, retail represents the bulk of the business in the UK, mainly mortgages and the current accounts that we have. We anticipate in terms of your question in terms of cost, flattish cost. This is benefiting for the change of the model that we're doing. And also, we believe that cost of risk is going to remain low given the quality of the portfolio and the focus on profitability that we're telling you. Okay? It's important to understand that high rates and economic slowdown are continued to affect the loan volumes and the market deposit growth continued to be subdued. Okay? So, in '24, we anticipate a challenging competitive environment as the one that you saw during the third and fourth quarter with rates on deposits growing through the year and across all the banks, which is basically what's going on there. Mortgage rates have started to fall since December '23, you saw that, following a drop in the market swap rates and in the number of mortgages approvals have started to recover since then. So, we see a little bit changes in the volume. The outlook is driven by an increased competition also, which will keep focusing on profitability as Ana basically said. And we're going to leverage on the group platforms to maintain the cost of better levels and to find new revenue streams. Cost, as I said, flattish. And as a result, we anticipate and a slightly lower RoTE. But I don't know, Jose, if you want to beat exact details.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: On the hedge, in the structural hedge no. I think looking at the structural hedge on a quarterly basis, it very much, it may suffer some volatility due to maturities, et cetera. If we look at the structural hedge in December '22, it was \u00a3108 billion it is now \u00a3106 billion. And at that time, the duration was 2.5 years and its 2.4 years. That shows it's very stable and we would expect it to keep it stable. This is structural, so we would not use the hedge to bring forward profits. But again, this is a structural hedge of the balance sheet and it should remain stable and, like you said, linked to our interest rate sensitivity basically coming from the current accounts.\nOperator: Next question is from Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Reale: I have two questions please, one on the guidance for this year and one on strategy. So you've disclosed your guidance for 2024 at 16% RoTE, which implies a net profit of more than 12 billion on current tangible book value. And this one has been growing, so we hope that continues. So you'd be implicitly guiding between 12 billion and 12.5 billion net profit this year, which I mean will be a strong number if delivered. Now I won't ask you to confirm if that's right, but it will be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing this year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the U.S? Actually, when you talk about Europe, if you could comment about Spain and the UK given the weakness this quarter that I think would help. My second question is on strategy. So you're adding a decent number of investment bankers in the U.S. And now over the years, we've seen a few of European International peers have ambitions, change the allocation of capital in their CIB businesses in the U.S., which is almost systematically resulted in negative jaws and higher capital consumption. Can you talk us through what your expectations are here, please? And possibly share with us some numbers in terms of size of the investment and expected returns on these investments?\nAna Botin: So in terms of the guidance, again, we're not going to give specific numbers, but you can do the math. I think what's important in terms of how we see revenues profits, costs, et cetera, is that the key here is the operating leverage. So as I said, this is going to be partly revenues and partly costs due to the change in the model, this is really important because obviously we have a lot more control. We control the top-line to a certain degree but there's some external impacts. And so, what really matters is the operating leverage and the change in the model. So we have a structurally lower cost to serve. So we're going to work very hard on both of those. As you know, we've moved to managing the bank primarily by global business. So if you allow me, I'm going to give you the vision by global business because this is really how we manage, this is how we predict. We have been managing this way forever, by the way, at the country level. So, we've been predicting retail commercial by country. It's not anything different. We're now just putting that together and working together in a common business model that Hector explained in detail. So again, we expect all our five global businesses to do better in 2024. This is really important. So we expect revenue growth in all our businesses. Retail commercial DCB in terms of NII is 80%, so it's obviously very important. Both our retail commercial and DCB should grow mid-single-digit. Again, our retail commercial, as I said, will do better in the Americas this year than in Europe. But with the exception of the UK, the top-line will grow in all the countries, including Spain. So, revenues will continue to grow in Spain, Poland, Portugal. So again, very diversified and I would say very strong, momentum, in some cases, more now fees than net interest income. Hector mentioned on the retail commercial side, fees were negative to flat this in 2023. It should be much more positive in '24, including in Europe, by the way, because there's more activity. We're seeing positive signs already the last few months that activity is picking up, so fees would grow in retail commercial. What's going to be doing better, and Hector and I mentioned that already is our consumer business, DCB, and that is both in Europe and in the U.S. So again, here both net interest income and revenue growth should also continue to grow, fees growing much faster because of higher activity. So, again, very balanced across all the businesses and with different contribution from different geographies and different businesses that are more positive sensitivity to the lower rates. The Corporate Investment Bank will continue to grow very well, mostly on fees. As you've seen there, we've put specifically some operating metrics that show that we are not planning to increase the size of the business, we just wanted to be more profitable, but not the size in terms of capital. So, that should remain basically where it is today. It's a 13% of our revenues, but the composition of our business is really different from our peers. So, a lot of transactional banking, a lot of corporate customers that we now expect to do more fee and advisory business with, I mean, both Hector and I have met with a number of top CEOs that are now already engaging with us in this new context, right? So, we are very, very focused on what you said of playing to our strengths of not doing, what we are not either the best or could be the best at and leveraging on our corporate relationships, which are incredibly strong across Latin America, Europe and increasingly the U.S. So, that is really the focus of the strategy there. In terms of more specific guidance on specific countries, I think I would suggest that the CFO reach out to you if you want some more. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Carlos Cobo from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.\nCarlos Cobo: Quick couple of questions from me. One is on, fees. I'm sorry, you touched on this already. Feel free to refer to the call because I couldn't connect until recently. The thing is that fee income is the area where you have sort of under delivered, you promised a stronger growth and only grown by mid single digits in '23. I would like to understand why do you think that was the case and why are you bullish for 2024? Or were you again expect to grow by high single digits? I understand the hiring in the U.S., but other than that, what is driving that strong growth across the board? And the second one is about the cost income ratio in digital consumer versus retail. It's just a little bit comparative. We're looking at similar cost income ratios in both segments where in theory, we would expect the digital consumer to be and more efficient business line than retail with the network. Could you explain what extent the cost income ratio in the retail consumer is affected by investment needs and IT development? And what will be a more normalized cost in commercial? Thank you.\nAna Botin: So, let me just very briefly answer the second question. You're totally right. There's a lot of upside in our consumer business. Remember that this is mostly Europe, but also the U.S. So, we invested a lot in this, especially on the retail side -- sorry, on the, well, its retail and consumer. The bank side is exactly the same backend. But you're totally right. So, that should improve a lot next year. So, we're actually targeting lower cost absolutely, for our consumer bank again driven not just by Europe but also by the U.S. So yes, absolutely, that is a big goal we have. Fees, so again, we're not always going to deliver exactly how we said, but we're going to deliver because diversification, because we're working on different angles, and so you're going to get some lags. One of the reasons, our retail commercial bank has had much lower activity, especially in Europe in some markets, and that is a big driver of fees. We are targeting fees in our retail commercial to turn positive next year. So from zero growth this year as you saw in Hector's presentation that should be up maybe not much. We're expecting fees to be much higher in our consumer bank. Again, as we said, our diversification is a huge strength. It's differential against most of our peers, if not all of them. So as rates stabilize and come down, you're going to see a much better performance in our consumer business, not just on the cost side as I just explained, but also in revenue growth, net interest income and fees. And fees should be high-single-digit in our consumer bank, which is pretty big. And yes, absolutely, our Corporate Investment Bank should grow fees much faster. That is one of the goals. That is one of the reasons that we brought the team we brought in the U.S., because they can help us grow fees on the back of our existing customer relationships. So you're going to see CIB fees doing as well or maybe a bit better than this year, double-digit for sure. And you're going to see a lot of that in the U.S. Again, so you will see the U.S. as a country, both consumers doing better, CIB doing better, the whole of the U.S. going to, above double-digit returns next year. But again, you're going to see hopefully. You see payments also doing very well this year and next year and Wealth Management doing better next year than this year. So that is the reason we are confident that our fees will improve more in '24.\nOperator: Next question is from Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSofie Peterzens: This is Sofie from JPMorgan. So my first question would be on U.S. asset quality. If I look at the NPL ratio in the U.S, it increased from 4.2% to 4.6%. Coverage fell from 73% to 68%. Cost of risk in the fourth quarter was 250 basis points. If I look at the secondhand core value, they've dropped over 30% in peak value. And in addition, you're doing more EV financing, as far as I can see, given the tax rate, given that you had heard dumping 20,000 EV vehicles in the U.S., I think up to 80% discounts. And the secondhand core price is coming down so much and asset quality already showing signs of deterioration. How should we think about the cost of risk in the U.S. going forward? And if you could just remind us what a normalized cost of risk level is? And then my second question would be on the Corporate Center. As far as I can see, the first time you make a profit in the corporate center since the global financial crisis. You also made a positive net interest income in the Corporate Center. So how should we think about the contribution from the Corporate Center going forward?\nAna Botin: Let me take a couple of this high level and then I'll pass to Jose and Hector. But in terms of asset quality, I want to say we've seen no signs of asset quality deterioration at all. We are guiding and we are confident our cost of risk will stay around 1.2%. That is probably a through the cycle number, roughly. So, it could be lower, it could be a bit higher, but should be a 1.2%. We're not seeing really, we have said previously 1% through the cycle. We have a bit bigger balance sheets in some emerging markets, but we haven't given this, but I'd say and maybe Jose wants to address that, but I'd say around 1.2%. What's important is that and this is not just zero but it's mostly Europe. Our balance sheet is very low risk and highly secured. In the case of Europe, a lot of that is mortgages. So, 33% actually of our total balance sheet is prime mortgages with very low average LTVs. We're not anticipating a big change in those numbers, maybe a few basis points, yes. That's why we, as you know, the 1.13 is the underlying. So, we do have some space to grow there, but this really is about basis points. And the big driver and that's the reason we're not seeing any deterioration in our big portfolios is that we had record low unemployment and this is the biggest driver of cost of risk in most of our balance sheet. So again, we are confident the economy will remain resilient. If you look at the latest actually to date, the IMF just upgraded growth, especially for Spain and some of our key economies. And then our consumer portfolios, and maybe Hector wants to comment a bit more on the U.S. But yes, there will be some normalization. But to be honest, everything we expected this year has happened in our consumer portfolios. Brazil is trending down. The U.S. is normalizing as we expected. There will be some normalization in consumer next year, but very much within the expectations of what we've been seeing in the last year. I'll let Hector answer on that, but let me just address the corporate, the corporate center. Maybe that's for Jose. But just to say that that it's very important that different banks have different policies for the corporate center. So, in the corporate center, for example, we place our excess liquidity with the ECB. Then we have transfer pricing. And so again, you should see some of that and I'll let the detail for Jose in the context of our commercial business, for example, in the euro balance sheet in Spain and Portugal. Again, part of that is, let's say, more financial and part of that is depending on how you choose. And our policy in high-level terms is to take out some of the volatility and really try to have a more market based transfer pricing. So you can see the actual commercial business. And so, some of those financial benefits of higher rates, sometimes in our case, as you've seen this year, go to the corporate center. So maybe you want to take the U.S., maybe autos, and then, Jose, you want to also expand on the corporate center?\nHector Grisi: Sure. So, Sofie, I mean, really quickly on the U.S. Our U.S. auto business that we have has shown a very robust growth in '23. Sales volume are 26 billion is basically helped by the new, relationship we have with some new OEMs that we have included in the portfolio. And we have, as you know, a continued dominance in the so prime used car segment, which, we are the leaders in the market. This volume basically rebounded as you have seen on the back of the new OEMs agreements that I explained, okay, and also compensated for some declines on volumes that we had in other OEMs. Okay? And then, you basically see that we have seen a reversion to normal in credit performance with delinquencies and losses increasing, seasonally as we have every single year through the last quarter, but it's still below the pre-pandemic levels. Okay? So we expect the performance to continue through '24 and we see lower roll rates of charge-offs and lower delinquencies driving that of the shift that we have to prime and near prime loans and a generally U.S. recovery in the U.S. economy. So, I wouldn't say recovery but robust U.S. economy. New vehicle prices basically continue to be higher by pre-pandemic period, and use prices are falling, but they continue to be higher than four years ago and also are being supported by a robust recovery rate that we have. Remember that I explained last quarter about after 90 days delinquencies, We're still below pre-pandemic levels at about, I mean, 67% compared to above 90%. So our outlook for 2024 is a positive on the U.S. auto, sales growth in both loans and leases and the sustained net income delivery as losses basically stay below the historical term. So we don't expect basically cost or risk to deteriorate in the U.S.\nJose Garcia-Cantera: Sofie, the NII at the Corporate Center. The NII at the Corporate Center basically comes from the relationship between the Corporate Center with the balance sheet in Spain. And there are two different balance sheets in Spain. One is the commercial balance sheet in Spain and we make it as an like an independent bank. So we charge to Spain the TLAC MREL costs. We charge the financing of the ALCO portfolio and a couple of other things. So net Commercial Spain balance sheet, we charge around 1.4 billion for those items. And then, we also have a CIB balance sheet in Spain. That's group CIB booked in Spain, plus the branches. And like Ana said, we isolate the CIB business from interest rate risk. So, there is an intra group transfer pricing for the CIB business that is in the balance sheet of Spain, and that's around 800 million. So, although we remunerate the commercial gap in Spain, you see a commercial gap that is the difference between loans of 228 billion and deposits of 308 billion, the difference is 80 billion we remunerate that gap at the central bank rate, but then we charge these items that I explained, making Spain equivalent to a country and isolating CIB against the TTI. So obviously, when rates are up, we have at the corporate center higher income from the TTI coming from CIB. As rates will come down, that should also come down.\nOperator: Next question is from Francisco Riquel from Alantra Equities. Please go ahead.\nFrancisco Riquel: I want to ask about the capital. About the 16%, do you stick to your 50% payout ratio, but yet the capital build is limited in 24% as per your guidance. So I wonder what are the regulatory impacts that we should expect, if any? What are the moving parts impacting the 24% capital ratios. And second here is the 12% capital target, the threat CET1 has been raised by 75 basis points in the last two years to 9.6%. So regulators could also impose further countercyclical buffers. So in this context, do you think that the 12% capital target post Basel IV is still valid? Or would you be looking to increase this part over time? Thank you.\nAna Botin: So in terms of capital, we are very comfortable with our level of current capital. It's over 12%, not 12%. And just very important, it's over 12% fully loaded after Basel III, so, again, really important that we are comfortable. We have ample buffers in terms of the regulatory requirements. The second point is that every year, we're generating more and more capital organically. We are a compound compounder. We're adding to equity, and we're investing in profitable growth for the future and this is really important. So this is allowing us enough capital to grow. We have put in place a very ambitious and successful program in terms of rotation of the balance sheet. So as you can see, the net RWA growth last year was zero, but increasing the front book, profitability. And so again, we're aiming to, in terms of capital build this year, on a like-for-like basis, we went from 12 to 12.50. We're now accruing the buyback in December, so that means 12.30. That goes up from 12, and that's after increasing the payout to 50%, as you know, from 40. So again, we're generating more and more capital. We generated 10 billion of capital this year. It's much, much larger than the last few years. We continue to aim as you've seen to grow profitability next year, which should increase the capital generation and give us space to both fund out growth, increasing returns to shareholders as we make more money and we generate more capital. And next year, we will have the Basel III, but the number that we are projecting for the end of this year is 12.40 to 12.50 from the 12.30 for the end of '24, we expect that number to be exactly the same on day one. Again, 12.40 to 12.50 by the end of the year and on day one in January, the same, the final impact in '28, we estimate 25, 30 basis points. So, that would mean that on January 1, '25, we would be compliant already with the fully loaded down the road, with the 12.40, 12.50 that I'm saying. Anything else on the requirements you want to say on the P2R and P2G because?\nHector Grisi: We will generate between 10% to 15% of organic capital per quarter and we expect to have around 35 basis points of regulatory charges, of which 20 will be up I mean, front loading Basel III. So that's why by the end of December '24, the ratio that we will publish will be already fully Basel III compliant, as Ana just explained. And the capital ratio of 12.40 to 12.50 will be the same on December 31st and on January 1, 2025, because we will not have any impact from Basel III on day one. That impact will be absorbed in 2024 and in terms of the 12% and headroom.\nAna Botin: I believe one of the few European banks that under the stress test doesn't breach MD&A, I mean, there's not very many. The headroom is very comfortable. We have hundreds of basis points. I never know, if we've given this number or not. But we have a management buffer that is absolutely more than enough to satisfy our economic, our risk appetite, and the regulators. So, we're comfortable with our position and will be even better on a nominal basis, which again, we don't think that is the only number we should look at. But on a nominal basis, 12 months from now we're going to be in a much better position even than we are today vis-\u00e0-vis our peers.\nOperator: Next question is from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: First question is on the NII prospect. Have you been hedging your variable mortgage portfolio to protect the NII trajectory in your rate sensitive geographies? Can you please update us on your net interest income sensitivity with the forward rates curve and flat deposit remuneration? The second is a more conceptual question. You hit your 2023 guidance and keep on running ahead of consensus on profitability, while capital is growing. Yet consensus estimates are hesitant to meet your guidance and valuation stays undemanding. What do you say to the skeptics on Santander?\nAna Botin: What I say to the skeptics, look at, and what I tell everybody every time they evaluate something is look at the numbers, look at the track record. If you look at our track record, that's why I showed a slide. By the way, the NII will answer, Jose will answer that on the hedge. But basically, I think we have gotten some recognition this year, way we need way, way more, absolutely. We are distributing to shareholders 10% of our market value, 5.5%. That is five times to shareholders, what we gave nine years ago, but very importantly on a per share basis, as we said this year, we're up 50% as we increase the payout, 50% cash dividend per share, I mean, any number you look at is at the group level is I think, sorry to say this, but impressive, but very importantly we see a lot more upside in the next few years. So, what I would say is just look at the numbers and that's what we're doing. Look at our track record, look at our model, look at our diversification. I think it's going to be an, as we are preparing for this Cole, if you look at the group by global business, it's a much more simple to understand group. But very importantly, by managing the bank now by five global business, we have a lot more upside for many more years. And this is the key. The market will see this year, we're launching our own tech platform in the U.S. This is totally differential for the U.S., of course, but also for the group. There is, and this is really important, a plan to deploy, as Hector said, common business model, common operating model and common tech in both our retail bank and our consumer bank. So you know as well, you know the numbers. Your recommendations are higher. I think you're still way short by the way of how we see things, but that's fine. So you're not even half as bullish as we are. We own a lot of shares. And I think just to answer the last question, the market tends to look and this is the feedback we've got from a couple of long-term Santander investors. They look at us through the rearview mirror. And if you look at Santander through the rearview mirror, the first year where we are outperforming our peers on almost every dimension and not all our peers, but our goal is to outperform all our peers, don't get me wrong, it's '23. And what they tell us is you need two years of consistency, and you will see that. I am very confident we will see that. Hector and I are working together really well. We like what we do. We believe in this company. We have a great team. We just announced yesterday a top hire from a major digital bank in Europe to run our Openbank platform. We're going to deploy our national digital platform in the U S. this year. All our customers from our current retail bank in the U.S. will be on the new platform in '25. So just we'll keep on delivering, and we'll keep on buying shares at 18% ROI. So I'm sure this is something which we'll get to. Jose, can you answer on the structural question?\nJose Garcia-Cantera: Andrea, NII and prospect sensitivity, et cetera, yes, you're right. We had a hedging of our variable mortgages, which is basically expired already. It will expire by April, it will expire. So, the sensitivity that we're going to have next year, it's going to be the actual sensitivity of the portfolio. There are two ways of answering your question about future sensitivity. One is, let me give you the sensitivity to a drop, a parallel drop of 100 basis points. In Spain, it would be minus \u20ac1 billion, all things being equal. Another way of looking at it is the way you post the question, which is, if I use forward rate curves with flat cost of deposits, meaning that the cost of deposits in 2024 will be the same as we had in December 2024, which is probably not realistic. NII is positive around \u20ac500 million. So, we will still have positive re-pricing next year with costs of deposits remaining flat. But again, that is not a realistic assumption in our opinion. So, I give you the minus \u20ac1 billion, a 100 basis points drop, plus \u20ac500 million with cost of deposits flat.\nOperator: Next question is from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Cerezo: Two very quick ones. The first one is, if you can give us your best approximation of what to expect from Argentina in terms of earnings in 2024? And the second one, if you have charged anything on the motor finance and discussion basically in the UK and if you can give us your view of how that discussion basically can develop and what kind of restructuring charges impairments actually might have to face in '24 and '25 on the basis of this?\nAna Botin: So Argentina, our bank in Argentina is doing incredibly well. Obviously, the exchange rate has meant a few basis points of effect on our capital and volatility in the quarterly numbers. I believe for next year and how we're going to report is going to be leaving Argentina in current so you can get a better view of what really is going on. So this is really important. We report in constant when you look at the performance of the business, but we'll leave Argentina in current. In terms of the P&L, it's not really material except for this volatility across that. And the effect on capital was a few basis points, I think 2, 3 basis points in Q4, Argentina. We're not anticipating, nothing very different for the next year. In terms of the UK, it's still early days. It would not be a significant, I mean, we -- I'm going to say it can be significant. We don't really know but it should not be a big number because it's not a really big portfolio. FCA is looking into it. So, nothing really that, right now we're concerned about.\nOperator: Next question is from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAlvaro Serrano: Two quick ones, hopefully, on Brazil, obviously, very strong growth in NII, can you maybe talk us through that strong growth? I see that cards have seen a pickup in growth. Maybe you can update us where you are in that card growth strategy versus your run rates, you've given us in the past. And will the 100% cap on loan rates. How will that affect you in 2024? And second very quick one, can you give us what tax rate you're assuming for your 2024 and 2025 targets? And any color you can give us in particular in Brazil and the U.S, how to think about in those two regions?\nAna Botin: There's quite a few questions. I'm going to answer very high level and we can then address some of the others in the coming quarters. But basically Brazil is as you've seen is doing exactly what we predicted in the last few quarters. We're expecting a much higher profitability in 2024 in the high-teens actually, costs actually growing less in line or even a bit below inflation given the one transformation which is already having effects in Brazil. We can grow and actually grow our cost base less because we're investing together. Revenue growth, net interest income between double-digit and yes, all double-digit growth in all the top-line and efficiency ratio improving again. So very strong performance anticipated for 2024 across all the different global businesses, but driven by retail and consumer in terms of the tax rate and cards, just I don't think anything you want to say about cards? All I can say about cards is that we put the brakes on two years ago actually 18 months ago, you've seen that in the cost of risk in the consumer portfolios in Brazil coming down. We're anticipating a lower cost of risk in Brazil next year. And that is mostly a reflection of the lesser growth in cards. We will start to grow again. But again, the growth in Brazil is across all the global businesses, not just the retail, but also the consumer, CIB and all the others. In terms of the tax rate for '24?\nHector Grisi: No. mean, just one comment on growth in Brazil. If you look at the consumer finance, which includes everything in Brazil this year, it was the portfolio together with CIB that grew the least, just 2.2%. And obviously, as rates come down, that portfolio should increase next year a bit more than the average. So, we are expecting more or less very low-double-digit growth in loans in Brazil next year. This portfolio should grow a little bit more than the average, and we would expect corporate loans, corporate lending growing a little bit less than the average. So that shows the change in mix that we expect for next year that should support margin expansion together with the interest the sensitivity that we have to rates.\nAna Botin: On the tax rate, I don't know the exact numbers and maybe afterwards you can follow up Jose or Begona. But there is an effect in the tax rate from the, which is actually a business line or business quality revenue because of the electric vehicles in the U.S. You're seeing that some of that already in Q4. It's actually as I say, it's a business, but you're seeing that through the tax line. So, that maybe you want to give some color on that later on.\nOperator: Next question is from Marta Sanchez Romero from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMarta Sanchez Romero: My first question, do you expect positive jaws in the U.S. in 2024? And then I guess you are in 2025, I'm interested on 2024. And then second, following up on your strategy in the UK, you're shrinking you're saying that you're going to be shrinking your loan book and your deposits, but you expect group platforms it's going to rise to the revenue line over time. I'm struggling to reconcile what the strategy and what the endpoint in the UK is because you got a plan that need a bank. You gather deposits. You give mortgages in a very challenging in a very competitive environment. So unless you throw money into your UK business, you're not going to do anything. So what is the plan? Thank you.\nAna Botin: So, the answer in the U.S., yes, absolutely, we're expecting positive jaws in the U.S. So we are basically growing the top line in revenues. More or less flat fees, efficiency ratio improving, cost flat to flattish, I would say, and adjusted RoTE, there is actually a 12% going up in quite a significant way so yes, absolutely positive jaws in the U.S. In terms of the UK strategy, and let me just very briefly say that there's two countries, and these are the UK and the U.S., where U.S., we call it it's in retail because we have current accounts on mortgages, but I would say it's a much more narrow banking model than we have in Portugal, Spain, Mexico and Brazil. And that is really the strategy. So, Hector is working very hard on streamlining that business with the teams, making sure they get the benefit of the global platform so we can actually focus on profitability. So we are not, as you say, I think you use the word throwing. We never throw capital around with total respect, we are super efficient and we focused on profitability not just in the UK, but across. And we are putting, as you can see, more capital at work in the more profitable global businesses and the more profitable markets. Very important, this is a very granular work that is led by Hector and Jose, where we were not so much focusing on market share in certain countries and certain businesses as on profitability. UK is one of them. So again, full focus on profitability. You can see that in the volumes in the UK and Spain, for example. You can see that in the front book that Hector showed, the front book this year is above 2%, 2.3% rollaway. If I remember correctly, we are being very disciplined, again, not just by countries and global businesses, even by portfolios. And this is something which we intend to remain as focused or even more if possible in the next few years.\nBegona Morenes: All right. So, we're going to take the last question now. We do realize that there are a couple of others in the queue, but the Investor Relations team will be at your disposal for any questions that you may have. So can we take the last question please?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, first of all. Thanks for still disclosing the country reporting which is very useful to us as analysts. Thanks for that. My question relates to the customer growth, which was one of the KPIs to drive scale effects. You've added 5 million customers 265 million, the target is 200 million until 2025. To what extent is this dependent on the rollout of the fully digital offering? And, to what extent will that then back load some of the revenue growth that you expected to see until 2025?\nAna Botin: So yes, absolutely, in our consumer bank especially, the deployment of the platforms, including senior and Europe, drive a much faster customer growth in the next few years. But very important, sometimes, I mean our definition of customers is net customers. So some of our peers give gross customer, we give net customers. And so again, as we improve and Hector mentioned that several times, as we improve our service, our experience and become the number one bank. Customer rotation should be less. On the retail side, we should accelerate the consumer growth. But in any case, the revenues we are very confident we can deliver those revenues, whether and again, think that the revenues are coming with the active customers, more than total customers. So, total customer drives revenues but is much more direct correlation between active customers being the number one bank. And that's where we are also focusing a lot in the next few years. So I think there's a few more if you don't mind Begona and the team will address those. Again, thank you all very much. I just want to reiterate Hector and I and all the team remain incredibly confident about continued delivery on our targets, and we see an even better '24 for Santander. Thank you very much.",

        "text": "Good morning, everybody, and thank you, Begonia. It\u2019s great pleasure to be with you all and thank you for joining. As a reminder, we have recently announced, a last step towards one Santander. We finished the creation of the five global businesses, which we began a few years ago. I would come back to this in more detail in a moment, but I would like to note that any reference to these global businesses today relate to the new business definitions that were communicated last December. So, the focus today will be, first, main highlights of our results and update on our strategy. Hector will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then I'll conclude with a few closing remark remarks on our guidance for '24. So, the high level messages we're presenting record results, \u20ac11.1 billion. We have delivered again on all our financial targets. Our customer focus and scale are driving consistent, sustainable profitable growth. In '23, we added 5 million customers and our revenue increased double-digit. And we did this as we continue, and I something we've reiterated year-after-year. We are investing for the future, and we are also making excellent progress towards a more simple and more integrated model. This is the driver to the improvement in efficiency year after year, 173 basis points. And it's also the driver to increase our profitability this year to about 15% as we committed. We have also in '23 strengthened our balance sheet, growing deposits, sound asset quality, again, below our guidance, and increasing our gross organic capital generation. So, in a summary, backed by strong profit growth with less shares following the buybacks, our earnings per share grew 21%, our TNAV and cash DPS by 15%. And once approved by shareholders, we expect our dividend per share to be near 50% higher than last year. So, just briefly, to the income statement, again, you can see the successful execution of our strategy and a strong top line performance. And what's really important is that across all our global businesses, this is the case. Our net interest income rose 12%, 16% in constant euros in a context of higher rates and with a special good performance in our retail and commercial banking business in Europe and Mexico. Net fee income was also higher. In this case, the network effects are the driver and the two global divisions of global businesses, the corporate bank and payments driving higher fees. Very important, the sustainability and the low volatility of our results across the cycle, I want special focus on the high quality of our revenue, where net interest income and fees are more than 95% of total income and drove the vast majority of Santander's total revenue growth. We're growing costs less than revenues, so positive operating leverage, including investment in our transformation where we're already seeing results. We achieved record net operating income of 32 billion that's the second highest among our global peers, again, showing our continuing focus on operational performance. And finally, the strength of our model is again evident in our cost of risk, where we finish at 1.18 again better than our guidance, and therefore, delivering on all the targets as I just mentioned. So what this means in terms of capital generation and the double-digit shareholder value creation that resulted from the results. We're ending the year, at the same level as September with a CET1 ratio at 12.3%, and that is after accruing 20 basis points for the buyback, which means that actually would have been at 50 basis points on a like for like compared to last year. We delivered 15% growth in shareholder value creation. Again, this represents an increase of more than 10 billion in the year and already mentioned, 50% increase in cash DPS against '23 results once we get shareholders' approval in March. The reduction in the number of shares through our share buybacks also, of course, helped, and a higher payout, which we increased from 40 to 50 this year. We continue to believe that at these prices, share buybacks are one of the most effective ways for us to generate shareholder value. Since '21, we have repurchased 9% of our outstanding shares, and buybacks currently deliver on a return on investment of close to 18% for our shareholders. So, let me just spend a few minutes looking at the consistency in the delivery of our plans and our targets. Step-by-step, we're making our business model stronger. We continue to deliver sustained earnings growth year-after-year, low volatility, high predictability, while we increase capital and shareholder remuneration. The record results in '23 means a 10% CAGR in profit since 2013, increasing profitability to 15.1 from below 10, again, improvements each and every year with the exception of COVID. And at the same time, we have steadily grown our capital. Please remember that when I took over, we had a CET1 ratio of 8.3, so we have a lot more capital and delivering much better results. I also want to point you to a couple of numbers, which is over the past nine years, we've generated approximately 26 billion of capital, which we've used to build up CET1 to 12.3 and that is on top of the 27 billion paid to shareholders over this time period. Very importantly, today's shareholder remuneration is five times that of 2014 and has grown again every year except for the COVID, crisis where dividends we're halted in light of the ECB's recommendations. As we think about value creation, this is our framework. We presented this one year ago in our new medium term plan. This is a new phase of value creation, where we are having a very strong first year as you've seen in today's results. We're on track to achieve all the targets and very importantly, compounding our equity through increased profits, which will result in increasing shareholder remuneration as we deliver this growth and profitability down the road. I would like now to spend a few minutes on the completion of this journey towards the five global businesses with retail and consumer DCB, which, of course, is the majority of Santander. And this is the reason we are confident we will continue to deliver medium term targets and beyond the customer focus, diversification, huge strength at times like this, and because we are doubling down on a very unique Santander strength, which very few can replicate, which is our local leadership and our global scale and network. We are the only bank in the world that has such a global and in market scale at the same time, 165 million customers globally with a market share over 10% in most of our core markets and operating at scale in every one of them. The strength and potential of Santander's scale network, again, are already evident in the numbers for this year. We can serve more customers, capture new revenue streams, that some of our competitors cannot. And it is precisely this network effect, which is helping us to grow cross border flows and you see this already in the very substantial growth in global businesses like the corporate bank, and we are increasingly seeing that also in payments and others. But very important, this scale allows us to invest together once across the group to operate more efficiently and to deliver better customer experience. So it's a win-win combination, both in revenues and efficiency. And you're going to see much more of this in the years ahead, because this combines a very strong starting point with a strong franchise, and in parallel, the deployment of our global platforms, which include proprietary technology. Again, this is incredibly differential for Santander, these are the most of our peers. And we are ultimately aiming to be the most profitable retail and commercial and consumer bank in every market where we operate. We're already top three in terms of profitability in 8 of our 10 markets, but we have a lot more upside. I'm not going to go over this slide, but it's really a summary just to remind us where we are. It's a last step. We took steps in the last few years in many of our global divisions. But now in the retail bank and in the consumer bank/DCB, we have taken a very important strategic step. We're operating in this way already during 2023. We're pulling investments. We're reducing cost in a structural way. And I want to emphasize in a structural way. We are already implementing this common business model and investing more efficiently and again, improving customer experience and driving sustainable and profitable growth. So, just briefly, the five divisions. The retail commercial bank, which I will refer to as retail. Our vision, we said it a year ago is becoming a digital bank with branches. This means three very important steps. First, simplifying our product offering in making it digitally available with a branch network and our people serving us very powerful sales and value added advisory channel. In 2023, we reduced our products by 16% globally, and 56% of our products are already fully available through digital channels. But very importantly, in the second half of the year, we did most of this. So, there is an acceleration in this transformation which Hector is driving. Second step, really important, a common operating model across our banks, which allows automation at a much higher level, freeing up time to talk to customers and focus on value added services. Again, dedication of resources and this is a metric we'll continue to track. Noncommercial activities, dropped 1.5% in the second half of '23. Again, a trend that is accelerating, and you'll see more good news of this in the next few years. And the third incredibly strategic step is our global tech platform. This is being rolled out in retail commercial. This is not a PowerPoint. This is happening. We are leveraging Gravity, which is our award winning backend where we partnered with Google and ODS, which is a cloud based front-end, which is built by us, operating in Openbank and tested and working Openbank as a reminder, is the largest native digital bank in Europe in '23 by size of deposits. All our retailer and consumers, and not just retail, but our consumer bank, DCB, all will be convergent to this common retail global front tech, starting in '24 with the U.S. This is going to allow us to both drive customer growth, but also better efficiency and therefore profitability, in a sustainable way. So, our consumer bank, this is digital consumer bank. The goal here is to become the partner of choice for our customers and, again, deliver superior profitability. Three main points here is in auto and consumer lending. We're offering best-in-class solutions for our both commercial customers and consumers. We are benchmarking very much the same as in retail against the best players, whether they're banks or digital players. We want to be number one, fastest credit approval, fastest on-boarding, more convenient, etcetera. The second point is we are and we've done this already for a couple of years managing our OEM relationships and our retail relationships globally. This is, again, a very important advantage. This means, for example, we can integrate the large digital e-commerce players just once. And, of course, that is something which is not available to many, and expanding our partnerships in Europe to LatAm and the U.S. And third and really important, we're planning to grow our business and improve efficiency and profitability by deploying these common platforms. And there are several. There's Openbank, of course, leasing. There's buy now, pay later, which we have built our own buy now, pay later. It's already up and running in Europe, and this common front end with OEMs and dealers. Again, we deployed a new pan-regional leasing platform in '23 and very important, in the U.S, our own Openbank ODS Gravity platform is already technically up and running. We expect to launch in the U.S. in the second half of '24, a fully digital offering nationwide, and then in '25 to have all our U.S. customers including our current retail customers on that same platform. Again, this is a big driver already behind our numbers, improving our efficiency, overall, but specific in the U.S., I would be an even bigger driver down the road. In our corporate bank, we're building and have been on this task as a global platform for at least five, six years. We are leveraging our strengths, our competitive advantages to ensure we can deepen relationships and have more profitable customer relationship across our markets, whilst maintaining the same risk profile. And we will continue to pursue the same strategy, focusing on customers. More than 80% of our revenues are coming from customer revenues and with a very close coordination between the global local teams, this is working really well. We're now having strategic dialogues with customers that we're mostly lending customers, and that is something which is happening from day one with some of the new teams in the U.S. But there's also a very important opportunity to leverage the 9 million existing group corporate and SME customers with these products and of course, this will grow collaboration revenues. This will deepen our relationships, will drive profitable growth, growing fees and support our capital light model. I want to also point out some of the numbers on the slide where our Corporate Investment Bank business is already growing faster than the balance sheet, and you can see here how total revenues to RWAs is improving to 6.7%. And last but not least, this is a very predictable, sustainable, and low volatility business, delivering consistent profitable growth for the last five, six years, a very different path from other players. So, again, the goal is to really make our global centers of expertise stronger. We've done that in London, and we're now doing that in the U.S. to make sure we can leverage our network, Accelerate process automation. We will increase asset rotation, and, this all in all will drive efficiency and profitability improvements. In our wealth business, we are aiming again to leverage our strengths. Our global model is aiming to capture growth by leveraging, in the case of private banking, our strong presence in Miami, one of the top Latin American private bankers. So we'll expand, on that basis, in the U.S., in our asset manager, again, leveraging to the strengths we have in verticals such as renewables, infrastructure, the SMEs. Again, this is something we've already been doing the last few years. And in insurance, focusing on verticals where we still have upside and growth opportunities like health savings, also SMEs, in general, again, the same principles as for other Global division simplification, in the case, for example, of our investment products and building together. I want to end by saying the same as for corporate bank that private banking is leveraging this network where we have different businesses working together. And this is again a very, very unique strength that drives profitability. Last but not least, payments. In our payments business, it's a large and growing and profitable industry. We have a unique position. We are on both sides of the value chain. We will use this to become a global leader in payments, supported by a current franchise of 165 million customers and 100 million active payment card customers. We're driving customer growth by offering a bundle proposition. As of today, this is also allowing us to grow in the open market because our products are competitive with the best. We have 16% of revenue coming from the open market, and we expect this to continue to grow significantly in '24 and beyond. We are leveraging, again, as in the other divisions, and optimizing our use of CapEx to meet customer needs in our acquiring platform, Getnet, which is already number 3 in LatAm. It's adapting to customers' payment ecosystems. We're also deploying our global cards platform starting with Brazil, which, again, will drive significant opportunities for all the countries as we roll this out. I want to just point to one specific number in PagoNxt, where activity increased 15% to reach 16%, sorry, 36 billion of total transactions. And very importantly, one of the key we gave you in Investor Day, which is EBITDA margin, which last year was 9%, 10%, has risen to 22% this year. Sorry, 25%, almost 25% in '23 already. So, we are focused on growth. You'll see the numbers, but we're also focusing on profitability, and we've done a big improvement, achieve a big improvement this year. So, let me just give you a specific example with the U.S. of how these global platforms are being rolled out in different countries. I mentioned it already briefly, but very important, the first technical integration of our proprietary tech for consumer, which combines the ODS, i.e. the Openbank front-end without Gravity backend will be launched in the U.S. in '24. This is a fully digital savings account. We'll start with that. In a year from now, in the first quarter of '25, we'll complement this with the transactional offering. And really important, this provides a scalable platform to strategically continue growing our business, including, improving profitability. And this is already showing in some of the numbers. One of the key metrics we look at is a retail deposit cost to serve as this has a very important effect on profitability where we can originate more assets, but we also need the funding side. I want to just remind that we are not and we do not want to be a universal bank in U.S. As you can see in the screen, we're not a full retail commercial bank as we're in Mexico or Spain or some of the big U.S. banks. We're a consumer bank with a limited commercial, multifamily business. We are targeting to grow in segments where we have local scale, such as consumer or commercial again or we can leverage the contribution of the group, such as the CIB or wealth. Now with the platform on the retail side, we will be much more efficient, and Hector will share some of these big numbers. You saw them at Investor Day. We are ahead of our plan in terms of, improving efficiency on the retail and deposit gathering side. And just as a closing remark, between 2019 and '22 Santander U.S. distributed to our shareholders more than 8.3 billion in dividends. So, we are confident to reach our profitability targets of 15% in the medium-term, in our medium-term plan. So, let me just finish by summing up. I'm not going to go through the slide, but I want to give you a sense of these five global businesses underweight in the Santander model. Just to reiterate the importance of retail and consumer, this is 70% of our revenues. This is where we have the most upside, and we already are delivering on some of these platforms. I'm not going to go through the others, but I just want to say that this model has already delivered improving profitability and growth, a 169 improvement in our RoTE in '23. Again, by moving to these five global businesses will unlock the full potential of our business model. It's all now going to be about execution, and Hector and I and all the teams are very focused on that. So, again, we aim to become, as I said, the most profitable bank in each one of our markets. So Hector, we now take you through the performance in '23."

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Ana. Good morning to everyone. Moving on to the income statement, remember that as we always do, we present growth rates both in current and constant euros. As Ana already mentioned, we achieved a record profit last year with double-digit revenue and net operating income growth. But we also have a very solid quarter with profit growing 1% in euros even after seasonal effects in Q4 from the deposit warranty fund contribution in Spain and the bank levy in the UK, which represent around 210 million post tax. On the line trends remain strong as profit excluding the decisional factors will have grown about 8% in the quarter. Differences between growth in euros and cost in euros became more evident in the quarter as the devaluation of the Argentine peso in December introduced some distortions across the P&L. Remember that the full impact of the devaluation across the whole year is entirely recorded in Q4. Excluding Argentina, profit would have grown 7% in the quarter in current euros, and there is no material impact from other currencies, so growth in constant and current euros is pretty much the same across all the lines. I will now take you through the main lines in the P&L in much more detail. Starting with the revenue, there was a strong growth driven in the custom revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter. In the year, it was primarily supported by net interest income in the retail as we actively manage interest rates tailwinds in Europe and Mexico, and the positive fee performance of CIB and payments mainly in Latin America. Moreover, we have delivered double-digit revenue growth across most of the businesses, especially those that benefit most from the network effects. Revenue and the corporate center improved by more than 1 billion due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and the lower impact from the FX hedging. NII continue to be the main driver of our revenue growth. In '23, it was 16% higher year-on-year in constant euros on the back of basically positive sensitivity to rising rates in Europe and Mexico and volume growth in the Americas. In terms of profitability, we improved net interest margin year-on-year and every quarter, even in Q4, if we exclude the distortion from the devaluation we had in Argentina. This is mainly explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment. These gains from credit yields more than a weighted funding cost, thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration leading to our robust margin expansion. Going forward, we expect lower rates to drive net interest income higher through our consumer businesses across the group and our retail business in South America while the positive impact from interest rates in Europe starts to moderate. This is a great example of the power of the diversification that we have. Turning to fees. In an environment of low fee growth in general, as a result of subdued loan demand and weak consumer activity, our net fee income grew 7% in constant euros compared to Q4 '22 and 5% year-on-year. CIB and payments were double digits and compensated the other businesses that were more affected by lower activity or market volatility, which again demonstrates the value of diversification. We saw a strong growth in CIB across regions and products while we strengthened our capabilities in the U.S. Total payments volume grew 22% year-on-year, backed mainly by Brazil, Europe, and Mexico. On the other hand, consumer fees were affected by regulatory changes and lower activity in the U.S. In '24, we expect fees to grow supported by the increase in the number of customers and transactionalityas we implement our common platforms and reap the benefits from our new operating model becoming the principal bank for our customers. Our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 44.1%. Savings from one transformation initiatives are already offsetting our investments in technology and digitalization. Cost, as you have seen, remained flat in real terms in 2023 and driving the cost to serve, as Ana mentioned earlier. This is reflected in efficiency gains of almost 2 percentage points in the year, led by Europe, which improved 5 percentage points driven by strong revenue growth and cost almost flat in real terms. In North America and DCB, cost increases slightly in real terms, reflecting the impact of investments to accelerate transformation and some perimeter effects. As mentioned, in Q4, efficiency ratio is always affected by the DGF charge. If you exclude it, efficiency is 43.7%, fairly in line with that of Q3 despite the higher impacts from transformation in the quarter. We expect that savings from one transformation will become more evident in '24 and onwards, which, together with a positive revenue outlook, should result in further efficiency gains. We are transforming the bank in the right way because we are structurally changing our model to improve both cost and revenue. The efficiencies we have captured from one transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed 112 basis points in efficiency improvements. For example, in the U.S., we have already generated around \u20ac200 million in savings from transformation and simplification initiatives. Our global and network businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 28 basis points in efficiency gains in '23 alone. Multi-Latins and Multi-Europeans are initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model grew at very high rates, with revenue increasing 40% in 2023 alone. Finally, our global technology capabilities have already generated 32 basis points in efficiencies so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture a 187 million savings this year, mainly driven by the deployment of Gravity, new global agreements with vendors and the implementation of new IT and ops shared services. Credit quality remained robust across all of our footprint and ended '23 in line with our expectation supported by our prudent approach to risk, strong labor markets and resilience in used car prices, mainly in the U.S. The NPL ratio was stable and in line with expected levels. We met our cost of risk target ending '23 below 1.2% despite the impact of single name cases and additional provisions in Poland related to the Swiss franc mortgages. Spain continues to perform well, NPL improving 21 basis points and cost of risk is stable year-on-year, supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions. Both metrics remained stable across the quarter. In other European units, the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels, and we expect it to remain below or in line with through the cycle averages. Normalization continues in the U.S. and Mexico, in line with expectations. And group credit quality trends are confirmed in Brazil as NPL ratio improved for the fourth quarter in a row and underlying cost of risk evolution reflects the improving macro conditions. Going forward, we don't foresee signs of significant credit quality deterioration in any subsidiary or at the group level. As we have discussed in previous presentations, our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment, product and country. Moreover, our balance sheet is low risk. The portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low average LTVs. In '23, loans decreased 1% as higher rates reduced the credit demand and incentivized early repayments, which was especially evident in Europe. Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America, and ECB. Deposits continue to grow well, up 2% both year-on-year and in the quarter as deposits inflows more than offset savings used to prepare the mortgages. Growth in the year was mainly concentrated in time deposits as customers seek higher rates. Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, around 75% of our deposits are transactional, which are a lot thicker, and high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposits warranty schemes. Mutual funds rose 13% with broad based growth across all countries except the U.S. following a year of instability in '22. Closing with the capital, we maintained a CET1 ratio of 12.3% in Q4. That's 0.2 percentage points, up if we exclude the impact from the new EBA guidelines related to the accrual of the share buybacks, driven by strong growth gross organic capital generation, sorry. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a front book return on risk weighted assets of 2.7%. That's up from 2.6% in 2022, equivalent to RoTE in excess of 15%, which will support profitability going forward. Finally, we continue to enhance portfolio management and balance sheet mobilization, improving the percentage of RWAs with positive economic value added, progressing well towards our Investor Day target of 85% by year '25. These principles of capital management will help us to continue build capital over the next few years, and we are confident that our CET1 ratio will remain above 12% even after taking into account the final implementation of Basel III in 2025. That's all from my side, Ana. Thank you. Over to you."

        "speaker": "Ana Botin",
        "text": "Thank you very much, Hector. So, let me just sum up very briefly so we can go to questions. So, three very simple points, '23 was a very first strong year in our new face of value creation. By the way, the best is yet to come. We grew customers. We increased revenue and profits double-digit in all regions and businesses, basically. Second, a lot of this has been driven by the structural change in the model, by one transformation to one Santander. There was also, of course, an improved operating context, especially for our retail business and especially in Europe this year. And point number three, we have further strengthened our already very strong balance sheet, increasing our CET1 ratio and, very importantly, with very strong credit quality across our footprint and in line with our expectations. Once again, all of this, of course, leading to the 15% growth in value creation and 21% increase in EPS, and the highest shareholder remuneration in our history in terms of both cash dividend plus share buybacks. So what this means, again, is we've delivered once again on all our '23 targets. We're on track to achieve the 2025 goals that we communicated last year, and very important, as Hector mentioned, you're just seeing the initial results of our transformation in our '23 results. You're going to see much more coming in the next few years. I want to emphasize again that not only do we have solid foundations, but these foundations are already proving on our model that we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth, increased returns to our shareholders, leveraging our model. I'm taking the last step we took this year in our retail and consumer business is absolutely critical to the confidence we have for the next couple of years because it depends on us. So, our guidance for '24 is, '24 will be an even better year for Santander. You can see here the numbers. We are confident that our customer focus, diversification will be differential this year vis-\u00e0-vis our peers. We have many engines, and all of the engines are going strong with different focuses in the regions, but all our global businesses going strong. We'll continue to accelerate the implementation of our model in the retail and consumer, to deliver again on these targets. Just very briefly, if you go down, across the slide, we continue to see revenue growth mid single digit in '24. This will be supported by net interest income growth in our consumer businesses. You saw Hector's presentation that this was the opposite this year. This year, the consumer top line will be much stronger than this year will be also driven in terms of regions in our retail business in South America and Mexico with higher growth than Europe. And very importantly, much higher fees in many of our global businesses than we saw this year, driven once again both by customer growth and by increased engagement with these customers. Again, the one transformation will be absolutely key and delivering this, supporting both our customer growth and our efficiency. In terms of cost of risk, we'll be roughly flat against this year, on an underlying basis ahead of this year. We had some one offs this year. We said last year and we continue to be in a prudent conservative risk appetite and this is still the case. There will be some normalization in our provisions in our consumer businesses based on our current economic forecast. And finally, we continue to be very positive overall in terms of revenue, but very importantly also on efficiency. You can see we are continuing to target positive operating jaws with flattish costs for next year leading to a cost income below 43% and a return on tangible equity of 16%. So, we're now happy to take your questions. Again, thank you very much."

And in terms of businesses, which would be in your view the one that has the biggest potential into 2024? The second one is focused on course. You've made a case for one transformation throughout the presentation. I would just like to get when you mentioned flattish cost, what should be looking for going forward? What is the advantage that the global footprint will give Santander in terms of that, in translating into cost growth efficiency again will continue towards say, 42 in 2025, which if I remember correctly was the target of the strategy planned. So, we are not yet at the end of the journey. We are just still in the process of getting that?"

        "text": "So in terms of revenues, we of course delivered a very high, remember, we've started a very strong year. Our guidance for the three years was high single digit revenue. We've delivered double-digit. What's very important is that what you've seen this year is not just a context and the retail side in Europe, of course, with higher rates, but it's very much backed by strong customer activity across all businesses. You can see that, for example, in our transactions per customer, which grow 10% year-on-year. As I said, the retail Europe business has had very strong tailwinds. We do expect this to continue. We have positive momentum in all our five global businesses. I want to be clear on this. They're going to come from different regions and different sites. I'll give you a high level and then maybe Hector can give you a bit more detail. So again, revenue growing at mid-single-digit, the high level summary of the drivers of this, on revenue would be first positive revenue growth in our retail business, very high double-digits in South America, Brazil, Chile, with a positive sensitivity to falling rates. You've seen that already in Q4 and of course, very strong momentum in Mexico. If you look at the other important global business consumer, which this year suffered from the higher rates, this year it's exactly the opposite. So, you're going to see consumer in Europe and consumer in the U.S. with much better performance next year in terms of the top line than they had this year with volume growth and positive sensitivity to lower rates. Again, that's also going to be good for fees. Overall in fees, they're going to be driven, as Hector said, by customer growth, increased transactionality. And very important, as we implement these global platforms, you're going to see much more of that. But again, the high performing fee businesses will be corporate bank would be payments. But maybe Hector, you want to give a couple of the highlights for on revenues. We'll take net interest income maybe in another question, otherwise it's going to be too long a reply, but net interest income we also projecting that to rise again, mostly in retail and consumer. But, Hector, why do you want to give us some more?"

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Sure. Thank you. Okay. I mean, you're going to see the main drivers of growth is going to be retail, CIB and consumer, as Ana told. Mid single digit and positive revenue growth in '24, you're going to see a little bit of the region's basically Europe moderating because of the rate but we don't expect the rates basically to go to the levels of that we had some time ago. You're going to see also that, the main driver will be South America and what's going on in Mexico, and then also you're going to see good growth from coming from the U.S. Okay. So, in that sense, you'll see also the consumer business globally in NIR both in Europe, in the U.S. it should grow benefited by credit growth and the progressive re-pricing that we have. Okay? And you're going to see in CIB higher income from financial transactions. Both answering your question in terms of fee, we expect the fee income to grow and that's very important. As Anna was saying, supported by the strategy of being the number one bank for our customers. This is quite important. The moment that you become the number one bank to your customer, fees basically and different revenue growth exponentially, and that's going to help us quite a lot. You have heard a lot about connectivity several times, but let me tell you why it's very important. Okay? Connectivity between the global businesses and platforms and the countries is the one that drives a strong free generation. Okay. That basically leads to double-digit fee growth for most of our global businesses in '24 so we can reach the mid to high single digit growth ambition that we have on the fees. Okay? So that's very important. And, going to cost, I don't know if I can comment fairly quickly or you want to comment on that?"

        "speaker": "Ana Botin",
        "text": "Yes, let me just give a high-level and then maybe you can give a bit more detail. So, basically, what's important in cost is that we want to do better in cost next year than this year. We're aiming for, I would say, flattish cost. So, the goal is to grow customers, grow top line have positive operating leverage of flattish cost that is below 43% by the end of '24. You also said, how do we see it in '25? Obviously, we see it better. As I said, we intend to go step-by-step sustainably getting better. We've had big improvements in '23, '24. We expect also improvements in '25 and reaching at least our target, if not better. I'm not changing the guidance. I'm just saying we to do better than that. So I want to be clear on that. But yes, we see many more benefits. And I want to again insist on the structural change in the model, and that is what one transformation is allowing us to do. We're reducing not just efficiency as a ratio, but the cost to serve the customer. We see a very, very strong acceleration in the numbers that you have in the presentation in the second half of the year, and we hope to carry that. We have positive momentum in all our markets. And again, I use the example of the U.S. because the U.S. is the place where we have an upscale auto business. But with our common platforms in the consumer and retail banks, we will get to be very competitive on the deposit gathering side. You saw in the slide that Hector showed that we had targeted around 400 million in savings in our consumer business in the U.S. by '25. With delivered 200 million this year. We are, of course, investing investments in the U.S. transformation will not be as large next year. So you are going to see a much better performance for the U.S. as a whole in '25. But what I said before, we will migrate our existing retail customers in '25 to this new platform. So in '25 and again, this is only one example with the U.S., driven by one transformation by the common platform that technically is already up and running, which is in the regulatory approval process. So that should drive increased efficiencies. And then again in Hector's slide. You saw that one transformation is helping us across the board in many other areas in technology. So our investments, one transformation investment in technology have reached 2.4, but they've been more than offset in real terms by savings in the global tech platform. So again, we're very confident that these numbers will be delivered and will get better. You want to give a bit more on the one transformation."

        "text": "Do you want me to compliment? I think this is one very important point, Ignacio, to remember about. I mean, one transformation is not just about the platforms. There are two steps before it, which are quite important where you see the impact on the cost. One is simplification. As you have seen in one of Ana's slides, you saw the amount of products that were basically diminishing throughout all the whole organization. So that's very important. That's simplification. Then the second is automation, which basically allows us to automate a huge amount of processes and basically have people in the branches and mainly a lot of amount of our products in our apps, which basically allows us to spend more time with clients selling products, et cetera, and also diminishing the cost. Opti means better service user experience, less cost per transaction and client, more revenues, which is best basically means, profitability. And then you're going to see an inflection point that goes through '24, '25 when the platforms are being deployed and cost should start coming down in a much faster way."

Or if it's easier, express this as a percentage expectation for NII change in the UK 2024 versus 2023. And secondly, your structural hedge notional in the UK increased by 7 billion or 7% quarter-on-quarter. That compares to a fall in current accounts of about 1.6 billion, that's a little counterintuitive. Can you explain this is driven by growth in savings deposits? Or rather, is it because you manage the structural hedge using a dynamic rather than the caterpillar approach? And could you guide us, please, for how much change you expect in the structural hedge notional in the UK in 2024?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Ana Botin",
        "text": "So yes, let me just frame the answer in terms of the UK NIM in the context of our retail business. So again, our overall retail business for '24 will do better than '23, driven more by the Americas, in this case, both Latin America, but also the U.S. because it's on the consumer side actually. So, what's very important is again, single and mid single digit growth is what we are guiding in terms of revenue growth overall. With mid single digit growth overall, I mean, also for net interest income. Within that, the UK, this year has delivered a 13%, I believe, 13% RoTE. Will continue to be double-digit, but will be lower profitability. So, as you as you know volumes and the top line net interest income, I'll let Hector and Jose give you a bit more detail on that, but has not been as strong because we have basically managed the UK for profitability. So, we have a very strong business in mortgages, very strong business in current accounts in the UK at scale and competitive. And for '24, we expect still double-digit profitability, but lower than this year. What's important and again, as we think about the one transformation, that is going to help maybe not as much as in other countries next year in the U.S. in terms of the top line, but is going to help already on the cost side. So, we're guiding UK should be flattish cost next year with low cost of risk, in a very, very strong balance sheet. And so, again, leading to lower profitability overall in the UK, but still double-digit RoTE. So, in terms of, I don't know if you want to give a bit more detail on volumes or on NIM in the UK?"

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Sure. I will do so. But mainly, I think it's important to tell you a couple of things. As Ana said, basically, retail represents the bulk of the business in the UK, mainly mortgages and the current accounts that we have. We anticipate in terms of your question in terms of cost, flattish cost. This is benefiting for the change of the model that we're doing. And also, we believe that cost of risk is going to remain low given the quality of the portfolio and the focus on profitability that we're telling you. Okay? It's important to understand that high rates and economic slowdown are continued to affect the loan volumes and the market deposit growth continued to be subdued. Okay? So, in '24, we anticipate a challenging competitive environment as the one that you saw during the third and fourth quarter with rates on deposits growing through the year and across all the banks, which is basically what's going on there. Mortgage rates have started to fall since December '23, you saw that, following a drop in the market swap rates and in the number of mortgages approvals have started to recover since then. So, we see a little bit changes in the volume. The outlook is driven by an increased competition also, which will keep focusing on profitability as Ana basically said. And we're going to leverage on the group platforms to maintain the cost of better levels and to find new revenue streams. Cost, as I said, flattish. And as a result, we anticipate and a slightly lower RoTE. But I don't know, Jose, if you want to beat exact details."

If we look at the structural hedge in December '22, it was \u00a3108 billion it is now \u00a3106 billion. And at that time, the duration was 2.5 years and its 2.4 years. That shows it's very stable and we would expect it to keep it stable. This is structural, so we would not use the hedge to bring forward profits. But again, this is a structural hedge of the balance sheet and it should remain stable and, like you said, linked to our interest rate sensitivity basically coming from the current accounts."

        "text": "I have two questions please, one on the guidance for this year and one on strategy. So you've disclosed your guidance for 2024 at 16% RoTE, which implies a net profit of more than 12 billion on current tangible book value. And this one has been growing, so we hope that continues. So you'd be implicitly guiding between 12 billion and 12.5 billion net profit this year, which I mean will be a strong number if delivered. Now I won't ask you to confirm if that's right, but it will be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing this year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the U.S? Actually, when you talk about Europe, if you could comment about Spain and the UK given the weakness this quarter that I think would help. My second question is on strategy. So you're adding a decent number of investment bankers in the U.S. And now over the years, we've seen a few of European International peers have ambitions, change the allocation of capital in their CIB businesses in the U.S., which is almost systematically resulted in negative jaws and higher capital consumption. Can you talk us through what your expectations are here, please? And possibly share with us some numbers in terms of size of the investment and expected returns on these investments?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Ana Botin",
        "text": "So in terms of the guidance, again, we're not going to give specific numbers, but you can do the math. I think what's important in terms of how we see revenues profits, costs, et cetera, is that the key here is the operating leverage. So as I said, this is going to be partly revenues and partly costs due to the change in the model, this is really important because obviously we have a lot more control. We control the top-line to a certain degree but there's some external impacts. And so, what really matters is the operating leverage and the change in the model. So we have a structurally lower cost to serve. So we're going to work very hard on both of those. As you know, we've moved to managing the bank primarily by global business. So if you allow me, I'm going to give you the vision by global business because this is really how we manage, this is how we predict. We have been managing this way forever, by the way, at the country level. So, we've been predicting retail commercial by country. It's not anything different. We're now just putting that together and working together in a common business model that Hector explained in detail. So again, we expect all our five global businesses to do better in 2024. This is really important. So we expect revenue growth in all our businesses. Retail commercial DCB in terms of NII is 80%, so it's obviously very important. Both our retail commercial and DCB should grow mid-single-digit. Again, our retail commercial, as I said, will do better in the Americas this year than in Europe. But with the exception of the UK, the top-line will grow in all the countries, including Spain. So, revenues will continue to grow in Spain, Poland, Portugal. So again, very diversified and I would say very strong, momentum, in some cases, more now fees than net interest income. Hector mentioned on the retail commercial side, fees were negative to flat this in 2023. It should be much more positive in '24, including in Europe, by the way, because there's more activity. We're seeing positive signs already the last few months that activity is picking up, so fees would grow in retail commercial. What's going to be doing better, and Hector and I mentioned that already is our consumer business, DCB, and that is both in Europe and in the U.S. So again, here both net interest income and revenue growth should also continue to grow, fees growing much faster because of higher activity. So, again, very balanced across all the businesses and with different contribution from different geographies and different businesses that are more positive sensitivity to the lower rates. The Corporate Investment Bank will continue to grow very well, mostly on fees. As you've seen there, we've put specifically some operating metrics that show that we are not planning to increase the size of the business, we just wanted to be more profitable, but not the size in terms of capital. So, that should remain basically where it is today. It's a 13% of our revenues, but the composition of our business is really different from our peers. So, a lot of transactional banking, a lot of corporate customers that we now expect to do more fee and advisory business with, I mean, both Hector and I have met with a number of top CEOs that are now already engaging with us in this new context, right? So, we are very, very focused on what you said of playing to our strengths of not doing, what we are not either the best or could be the best at and leveraging on our corporate relationships, which are incredibly strong across Latin America, Europe and increasingly the U.S. So, that is really the focus of the strategy there. In terms of more specific guidance on specific countries, I think I would suggest that the CFO reach out to you if you want some more. Thank you."

The thing is that fee income is the area where you have sort of under delivered, you promised a stronger growth and only grown by mid single digits in '23. I would like to understand why do you think that was the case and why are you bullish for 2024? Or were you again expect to grow by high single digits? I understand the hiring in the U.S., but other than that, what is driving that strong growth across the board? And the second one is about the cost income ratio in digital consumer versus retail. It's just a little bit comparative. We're looking at similar cost income ratios in both segments where in theory, we would expect the digital consumer to be and more efficient business line than retail with the network. Could you explain what extent the cost income ratio in the retail consumer is affected by investment needs and IT development? And what will be a more normalized cost in commercial? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Ana Botin",
        "text": "So, let me just very briefly answer the second question. You're totally right. There's a lot of upside in our consumer business. Remember that this is mostly Europe, but also the U.S. So, we invested a lot in this, especially on the retail side -- sorry, on the, well, its retail and consumer. The bank side is exactly the same backend. But you're totally right. So, that should improve a lot next year. So, we're actually targeting lower cost absolutely, for our consumer bank again driven not just by Europe but also by the U.S. So yes, absolutely, that is a big goal we have. Fees, so again, we're not always going to deliver exactly how we said, but we're going to deliver because diversification, because we're working on different angles, and so you're going to get some lags. One of the reasons, our retail commercial bank has had much lower activity, especially in Europe in some markets, and that is a big driver of fees. We are targeting fees in our retail commercial to turn positive next year. So from zero growth this year as you saw in Hector's presentation that should be up maybe not much. We're expecting fees to be much higher in our consumer bank. Again, as we said, our diversification is a huge strength. It's differential against most of our peers, if not all of them. So as rates stabilize and come down, you're going to see a much better performance in our consumer business, not just on the cost side as I just explained, but also in revenue growth, net interest income and fees. And fees should be high-single-digit in our consumer bank, which is pretty big. And yes, absolutely, our Corporate Investment Bank should grow fees much faster. That is one of the goals. That is one of the reasons that we brought the team we brought in the U.S., because they can help us grow fees on the back of our existing customer relationships. So you're going to see CIB fees doing as well or maybe a bit better than this year, double-digit for sure. And you're going to see a lot of that in the U.S. Again, so you will see the U.S. as a country, both consumers doing better, CIB doing better, the whole of the U.S. going to, above double-digit returns next year. But again, you're going to see hopefully. You see payments also doing very well this year and next year and Wealth Management doing better next year than this year. So that is the reason we are confident that our fees will improve more in '24."

Coverage fell from 73% to 68%. Cost of risk in the fourth quarter was 250 basis points. If I look at the secondhand core value, they've dropped over 30% in peak value. And in addition, you're doing more EV financing, as far as I can see, given the tax rate, given that you had heard dumping 20,000 EV vehicles in the U.S., I think up to 80% discounts. And the secondhand core price is coming down so much and asset quality already showing signs of deterioration. How should we think about the cost of risk in the U.S. going forward? And if you could just remind us what a normalized cost of risk level is? And then my second question would be on the Corporate Center. As far as I can see, the first time you make a profit in the corporate center since the global financial crisis. You also made a positive net interest income in the Corporate Center. So how should we think about the contribution from the Corporate Center going forward?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Ana Botin",
        "text": "Let me take a couple of this high level and then I'll pass to Jose and Hector. But in terms of asset quality, I want to say we've seen no signs of asset quality deterioration at all. We are guiding and we are confident our cost of risk will stay around 1.2%. That is probably a through the cycle number, roughly. So, it could be lower, it could be a bit higher, but should be a 1.2%. We're not seeing really, we have said previously 1% through the cycle. We have a bit bigger balance sheets in some emerging markets, but we haven't given this, but I'd say and maybe Jose wants to address that, but I'd say around 1.2%. What's important is that and this is not just zero but it's mostly Europe. Our balance sheet is very low risk and highly secured. In the case of Europe, a lot of that is mortgages. So, 33% actually of our total balance sheet is prime mortgages with very low average LTVs. We're not anticipating a big change in those numbers, maybe a few basis points, yes. That's why we, as you know, the 1.13 is the underlying. So, we do have some space to grow there, but this really is about basis points. And the big driver and that's the reason we're not seeing any deterioration in our big portfolios is that we had record low unemployment and this is the biggest driver of cost of risk in most of our balance sheet. So again, we are confident the economy will remain resilient. If you look at the latest actually to date, the IMF just upgraded growth, especially for Spain and some of our key economies. And then our consumer portfolios, and maybe Hector wants to comment a bit more on the U.S. But yes, there will be some normalization. But to be honest, everything we expected this year has happened in our consumer portfolios. Brazil is trending down. The U.S. is normalizing as we expected. There will be some normalization in consumer next year, but very much within the expectations of what we've been seeing in the last year. I'll let Hector answer on that, but let me just address the corporate, the corporate center. Maybe that's for Jose. But just to say that that it's very important that different banks have different policies for the corporate center. So, in the corporate center, for example, we place our excess liquidity with the ECB. Then we have transfer pricing. And so again, you should see some of that and I'll let the detail for Jose in the context of our commercial business, for example, in the euro balance sheet in Spain and Portugal. Again, part of that is, let's say, more financial and part of that is depending on how you choose. And our policy in high-level terms is to take out some of the volatility and really try to have a more market based transfer pricing. So you can see the actual commercial business. And so, some of those financial benefits of higher rates, sometimes in our case, as you've seen this year, go to the corporate center. So maybe you want to take the U.S., maybe autos, and then, Jose, you want to also expand on the corporate center?"

        "text": "Sure. So, Sofie, I mean, really quickly on the U.S. Our U.S. auto business that we have has shown a very robust growth in '23. Sales volume are 26 billion is basically helped by the new, relationship we have with some new OEMs that we have included in the portfolio. And we have, as you know, a continued dominance in the so prime used car segment, which, we are the leaders in the market. This volume basically rebounded as you have seen on the back of the new OEMs agreements that I explained, okay, and also compensated for some declines on volumes that we had in other OEMs. Okay? And then, you basically see that we have seen a reversion to normal in credit performance with delinquencies and losses increasing, seasonally as we have every single year through the last quarter, but it's still below the pre-pandemic levels. Okay? So we expect the performance to continue through '24 and we see lower roll rates of charge-offs and lower delinquencies driving that of the shift that we have to prime and near prime loans and a generally U.S. recovery in the U.S. economy. So, I wouldn't say recovery but robust U.S. economy. New vehicle prices basically continue to be higher by pre-pandemic period, and use prices are falling, but they continue to be higher than four years ago and also are being supported by a robust recovery rate that we have. Remember that I explained last quarter about after 90 days delinquencies, We're still below pre-pandemic levels at about, I mean, 67% compared to above 90%. So our outlook for 2024 is a positive on the U.S. auto, sales growth in both loans and leases and the sustained net income delivery as losses basically stay below the historical term. So we don't expect basically cost or risk to deteriorate in the U.S."

And there are two different balance sheets in Spain. One is the commercial balance sheet in Spain and we make it as an like an independent bank. So we charge to Spain the TLAC MREL costs. We charge the financing of the ALCO portfolio and a couple of other things. So net Commercial Spain balance sheet, we charge around 1.4 billion for those items. And then, we also have a CIB balance sheet in Spain. That's group CIB booked in Spain, plus the branches. And like Ana said, we isolate the CIB business from interest rate risk. So, there is an intra group transfer pricing for the CIB business that is in the balance sheet of Spain, and that's around 800 million. So, although we remunerate the commercial gap in Spain, you see a commercial gap that is the difference between loans of 228 billion and deposits of 308 billion, the difference is 80 billion we remunerate that gap at the central bank rate, but then we charge these items that I explained, making Spain equivalent to a country and isolating CIB against the TTI. So obviously, when rates are up, we have at the corporate center higher income from the TTI coming from CIB. As rates will come down, that should also come down."

So in this context, do you think that the 12% capital target post Basel IV is still valid? Or would you be looking to increase this part over time? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Ana Botin",
        "text": "So in terms of capital, we are very comfortable with our level of current capital. It's over 12%, not 12%. And just very important, it's over 12% fully loaded after Basel III, so, again, really important that we are comfortable. We have ample buffers in terms of the regulatory requirements. The second point is that every year, we're generating more and more capital organically. We are a compound compounder. We're adding to equity, and we're investing in profitable growth for the future and this is really important. So this is allowing us enough capital to grow. We have put in place a very ambitious and successful program in terms of rotation of the balance sheet. So as you can see, the net RWA growth last year was zero, but increasing the front book, profitability. And so again, we're aiming to, in terms of capital build this year, on a like-for-like basis, we went from 12 to 12.50. We're now accruing the buyback in December, so that means 12.30. That goes up from 12, and that's after increasing the payout to 50%, as you know, from 40. So again, we're generating more and more capital. We generated 10 billion of capital this year. It's much, much larger than the last few years. We continue to aim as you've seen to grow profitability next year, which should increase the capital generation and give us space to both fund out growth, increasing returns to shareholders as we make more money and we generate more capital. And next year, we will have the Basel III, but the number that we are projecting for the end of this year is 12.40 to 12.50 from the 12.30 for the end of '24, we expect that number to be exactly the same on day one. Again, 12.40 to 12.50 by the end of the year and on day one in January, the same, the final impact in '28, we estimate 25, 30 basis points. So, that would mean that on January 1, '25, we would be compliant already with the fully loaded down the road, with the 12.40, 12.50 that I'm saying. Anything else on the requirements you want to say on the P2R and P2G because?"

So that's why by the end of December '24, the ratio that we will publish will be already fully Basel III compliant, as Ana just explained. And the capital ratio of 12.40 to 12.50 will be the same on December 31st and on January 1, 2025, because we will not have any impact from Basel III on day one. That impact will be absorbed in 2024 and in terms of the 12% and headroom."

We have hundreds of basis points. I never know, if we've given this number or not. But we have a management buffer that is absolutely more than enough to satisfy our economic, our risk appetite, and the regulators. So, we're comfortable with our position and will be even better on a nominal basis, which again, we don't think that is the only number we should look at. But on a nominal basis, 12 months from now we're going to be in a much better position even than we are today vis-\u00e0-vis our peers."

You hit your 2023 guidance and keep on running ahead of consensus on profitability, while capital is growing.

If you look at our track record, that's why I showed a slide. By the way, the NII will answer, Jose will answer that on the hedge. But basically, I think we have gotten some recognition this year, way we need way, way more, absolutely. We are distributing to shareholders 10% of our market value, 5.5%. That is five times to shareholders, what we gave nine years ago, but very importantly on a per share basis, as we said this year, we're up 50% as we increase the payout, 50% cash dividend per share, I mean, any number you look at is at the group level is I think, sorry to say this, but impressive, but very importantly we see a lot more upside in the next few years. So, what I would say is just look at the numbers and that's what we're doing. Look at our track record, look at our model, look at our diversification. I think it's going to be an, as we are preparing for this Cole, if you look at the group by global business, it's a much more simple to understand group. But very importantly, by managing the bank now by five global business, we have a lot more upside for many more years. And this is the key. The market will see this year, we're launching our own tech platform in the U.S. This is totally differential for the U.S., of course, but also for the group. There is, and this is really important, a plan to deploy, as Hector said, common business model, common operating model and common tech in both our retail bank and our consumer bank. So you know as well, you know the numbers. Your recommendations are higher. I think you're still way short by the way of how we see things, but that's fine. So you're not even half as bullish as we are. We own a lot of shares. And I think just to answer the last question, the market tends to look and this is the feedback we've got from a couple of long-term Santander investors. They look at us through the rearview mirror. And if you look at Santander through the rearview mirror, the first year where we are outperforming our peers on almost every dimension and not all our peers, but our goal is to outperform all our peers, don't get me wrong, it's '23. And what they tell us is you need two years of consistency, and you will see that. I am very confident we will see that. Hector and I are working together really well. We like what we do. We believe in this company. We have a great team. We just announced yesterday a top hire from a major digital bank in Europe to run our Openbank platform. We're going to deploy our national digital platform in the U S. this year. All our customers from our current retail bank in the U.S. will be on the new platform in '25. So just we'll keep on delivering, and we'll keep on buying shares at 18% ROI. So I'm sure this is something which we'll get to. Jose, can you answer on the structural question?"

        "text": "Andrea, NII and prospect sensitivity, et cetera, yes, you're right. We had a hedging of our variable mortgages, which is basically expired already. It will expire by April, it will expire. So, the sensitivity that we're going to have next year, it's going to be the actual sensitivity of the portfolio. There are two ways of answering your question about future sensitivity. One is, let me give you the sensitivity to a drop, a parallel drop of 100 basis points. In Spain, it would be minus \u20ac1 billion, all things being equal. Another way of looking at it is the way you post the question, which is, if I use forward rate curves with flat cost of deposits, meaning that the cost of deposits in 2024 will be the same as we had in December 2024, which is probably not realistic. NII is positive around \u20ac500 million. So, we will still have positive re-pricing next year with costs of deposits remaining flat. But again, that is not a realistic assumption in our opinion. So, I give you the minus \u20ac1 billion, a 100 basis points drop, plus \u20ac500 million with cost of deposits flat."

We report in constant when you look at the performance of the business, but we'll leave Argentina in current. In terms of the P&L, it's not really material except for this volatility across that. And the effect on capital was a few basis points, I think 2, 3 basis points in Q4, Argentina. We're not anticipating, nothing very different for the next year. In terms of the UK, it's still early days. It would not be a significant, I mean, we -- I'm going to say it can be significant.

But basically Brazil is as you've seen is doing exactly what we predicted in the last few quarters. We're expecting a much higher profitability in 2024 in the high-teens actually, costs actually growing less in line or even a bit below inflation given the one transformation which is already having effects in Brazil. We can grow and actually grow our cost base less because we're investing together. Revenue growth, net interest income between double-digit and yes, all double-digit growth in all the top-line and efficiency ratio improving again. So very strong performance anticipated for 2024 across all the different global businesses, but driven by retail and consumer in terms of the tax rate and cards, just I don't think anything you want to say about cards? All I can say about cards is that we put the brakes on two years ago actually 18 months ago, you've seen that in the cost of risk in the consumer portfolios in Brazil coming down. We're anticipating a lower cost of risk in Brazil next year. And that is mostly a reflection of the lesser growth in cards. We will start to grow again. But again, the growth in Brazil is across all the global businesses, not just the retail, but also the consumer, CIB and all the others. In terms of the tax rate for '24?"

If you look at the consumer finance, which includes everything in Brazil this year, it was the portfolio together with CIB that grew the least, just 2.2%. And obviously, as rates come down, that portfolio should increase next year a bit more than the average. So, we are expecting more or less very low-double-digit growth in loans in Brazil next year. This portfolio should grow a little bit more than the average, and we would expect corporate loans, corporate lending growing a little bit less than the average.

I'm struggling to reconcile what the strategy and what the endpoint in the UK is because you got a plan that need a bank. You gather deposits. You give mortgages in a very challenging in a very competitive environment. So unless you throw money into your UK business, you're not going to do anything. So what is the plan? Thank you."

        "text": "So, the answer in the U.S., yes, absolutely, we're expecting positive jaws in the U.S. So we are basically growing the top line in revenues. More or less flat fees, efficiency ratio improving, cost flat to flattish, I would say, and adjusted RoTE, there is actually a 12% going up in quite a significant way so yes, absolutely positive jaws in the U.S. In terms of the UK strategy, and let me just very briefly say that there's two countries, and these are the UK and the U.S., where U.S., we call it it's in retail because we have current accounts on mortgages, but I would say it's a much more narrow banking model than we have in Portugal, Spain, Mexico and Brazil. And that is really the strategy. So, Hector is working very hard on streamlining that business with the teams, making sure they get the benefit of the global platform so we can actually focus on profitability. So we are not, as you say, I think you use the word throwing. We never throw capital around with total respect, we are super efficient and we focused on profitability not just in the UK, but across. And we are putting, as you can see, more capital at work in the more profitable global businesses and the more profitable markets. Very important, this is a very granular work that is led by Hector and Jose, where we were not so much focusing on market share in certain countries and certain businesses as on profitability. UK is one of them. So again, full focus on profitability. You can see that in the volumes in the UK and Spain, for example. You can see that in the front book that Hector showed, the front book this year is above 2%, 2.3% rollaway. If I remember correctly, we are being very disciplined, again, not just by countries and global businesses, even by portfolios. And this is something which we intend to remain as focused or even more if possible in the next few years."

But very important, sometimes, I mean our definition of customers is net customers. So some of our peers give gross customer, we give net customers. And so again, as we improve and Hector mentioned that several times, as we improve our service, our experience and become the number one bank. Customer rotation should be less. On the retail side, we should accelerate the consumer growth. But in any case, the revenues we are very confident we can deliver those revenues, whether and again, think that the revenues are coming with the active customers, more than total customers. So, total customer drives revenues but is much more direct correlation between active customers being the number one bank. And that's where we are also focusing a lot in the next few years. So I think there's a few more if you don't mind Begona and the team will address those. Again, thank you all very much. I just want to reiterate Hector and I and all the team remain incredibly confident about continued delivery on our targets, and we see an even better '24 for Santander. Thank you very much."

    "transcript": "Bego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Good morning everybody and welcome to Banco Santander's Conference Call to Discuss our Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today, are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that this is the first full quarter in which we are publishing results with our global businesses as primary reporting, aligned with the way we are managed, as we announced late last year. Secondary reporting will be what used to be primary until 2023, mainly country reporting, European DCB, et cetera. As we will explain later, changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of Argentina, which is presented in current euros to avoid distortions. All information will be, as always, available in the Excel Sheet and report that is published on our website. But now to the presentation. I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. H\u00e9ctor Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Garcia-Cantera. Following their presentations, we will be opening the floor for any questions you may have in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi H\u00e9ctor, the floor is yours.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Thank you, Bego\u00f1a. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results on the context of our strategy. Second, Jos\u00e9 will then review our financial performance in greater detail, and then I will conclude with some final messages. Let's start with Q1. Q1 was another very strong quarter for Santander. Positive contributions for all our businesses, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model. We are presenting a profit of \u20ac2.9 billion, that's an 11% increase versus Q1 2023, 9% in constant euros. As Bego\u00f1a excluding the impact of the temporary levy of revenue paid in Spain recorded in full in Q1. If you include that, this was another record quarter. Our customer focus and scale are driving profitable growth. Over the last year, we welcomed 5 million new customers and our revenue in Q1 increased close to double-digit year-on-year in constant euros, and that's supported by all global businesses and the regions. We're executing on our transformation plan, which is already supporting efficiency improvements, leading to growth in profitability and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.4 percentage points year-on-year to 42.6%, and net operating income has grown double-digit year-on-year for the last eight quarters. Our return on tangible equity rose 55 basis points year-on-year to 14.9%, even more, 16.2% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain. Finally, our solid balance sheet. With some capital ratios and robust credit quality, it contributed to strong profitable growth and more importantly, to shareholder value creation. TNAV plus dividend per share grew by 14% year-on-year from a combination of higher profit, increased shareholder remuneration, and fewer shares due to the buyback programs we have and we are still executing. In the last 12 months, we increased TNAV by more than \u20ac4.5 billion. If we take a quick look at our income statement, as we usually do, we present growth both in current euros and in cost in euros, although there were no material differences between them this quarter. Part of the reason is that for the first time, the variations in constant euros applied to all countries except to Argentina, which is in current euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation. Our P&L was strong from top to bottom. The strong top -- number one, strong top line performance, driven both by NII, record fees supported, as I said, by all the global businesses and regions. Second, revenue grew while costs remained flattish in real terms, in line with expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters. Third, we demonstrated the sustainability of our results with 11% growth in net operating income. Fourth and low loss provisions continue to normalize as expected. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we recorded a \u20ac335 million charge related to the temporary levy in Spain, which was 50% higher than in 2023. Excluding this impact, profit rose 14% year-on-year, implying a growth of 12% in constant euros. Jose will go into more detail into these points later on. As you can see, this is a great start of the year, and we are well on track to achieve our 2024 targets, targets that we comfortably reiterate. Good business dynamics supported high single-digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved, even as we're investing for the future through one transformation and it is already better than our target in 2024. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, in line with our target of keeping it around 1.2% at the end of the year. The fully loaded CET1 ratio remained at 12.3% in Q1, having profitably grown our regions organically and accrued distributions in line with our 50% payout and we have absorbed regulatory impacts. We are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation, and Arrote grew year-on-year 16.2% putting us on track to reach our target of 16% for 2024. As you can clearly see, we're achieving these results backed by the operational leverage provided by one transformation, which is improving both revenue and cost. The efficiencies we have captured and the impact of our active spread management have already contributed 174 basis points of improvements since 2023. Our global businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 88 basis points in efficiency gains. Our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model continued to grow well with revenue increasing 5% year-on-year. Finally, our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated 63 basis points in efficiency savings so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture \u20ac50 million in additional savings in Q1 for a total of \u20ac237 million since 2022. This has been mainly driven by the deployment of gravity by new global agreements with vendors and process optimization in operations and the implementation of the new IT and Ops shared services. Our business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on profitable growth. From the creation of a best-in-class customer experience and operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech. This is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our investor rate targets. This operational leverage is already very evident in our retail and consumer businesses, where the efficiency ratios improved close to 400 basis points and 200 basis points year-on-year, respectively. In CIB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our ISO expertise to roll our US franchise without changing the risk profile, proof of which is the revenue, which grew 5% and reached another quarterly record, supported by the good performance in the US and strong client flows. Wealth continued to grow strongly, improving both efficiency and profitability. And finally, in payments, where we are managing more than 100 million cards group-wide, we are seeing good activity trends. In Q1 2023, we had a one-time revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our partners in Brazil. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 7% and efficiency remained flat year-on-year, despite our investments in deploying our global platforms. Now let's look at each business in greater detail. First, our goal in retail is to become the number one bank for our customers, which is key to our strategy. At the same time, our retail business is a great example that demonstrates the benefits we are generating from one transformation, as operational leverage has significantly improved the efficiency ratio. First, we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience. For example, in Spain, our new digital onboarding is contributing to 630,000 increase in net new customers year-on-year, while Santander Key already enables more than 4 million customers to approve transactions securely with a single click using biometrics. Second, we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks, increasing automation to free up time for our people to focus on commercial activities. As a result, the dedication of resources to non-commercial activities have dropped by 4% in the last nine months. Third, the deployment of our own global platform continued in Q1, and Gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Chile and the US. From a financial perspective, this is also a great moment for retail. We are managing margins very carefully to make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in Europe. And at the same time, benefit from our negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America on top of the strong operational leverage that we are obtaining from one transformation. As a result, our profit grew 22% year-on-year, with the following three things to highlight. First, double-digit revenue increase, driven by good performance, both in NII and fees, with all the regions growing year-on-year, especially Europe and South America. Second, cost under control, flat in real terms as the benefits from our transformation in some units are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments. And third, provisions dropping slightly with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group. The execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with growth increasing to 3% to 17.6%. In Consumer, we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers. We offer best-in-class global solutions, which are integrated to our partners' processes. Last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to pure direct auto players, which has been received well because it allows our customers to compete their vehicle acquisition and financing fully aligned. We're also progressing well on simplification and automation, supporting a 15 basis point decline on our cost to total volumes ratio. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing cost-to-serve and improving profitability. We recently announced the launch of Openbank in North America this year, which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the US. Consumer is also delivering operational leverage with net operating income growing by 7% year-on-year, driven by the following three elements. First, an increase in revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume growth, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good NII performance and 22% fee growth, mainly from insurance. Second, cost dropped 4% in real terms as a result of the execution of our strategy and the efficiency plans we implemented last year in a more complex interest rate environment. Third, provisions increased year-on-year, mainly due to the expected cost of risk normalization in the business, both in Europe and the US, though still below the historical averages as well as some impact from volumes and regulation. Last year, we started to prioritize profitability over volumes. So we are originating at high [indiscernible]. The increase of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to double digit year-on-year by the end of 2024, even after the normalization we expect on provisions. As you can see, we are building a world-class CIB business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to grow profit, while maintaining, at the same time, the same risk profile and is well-under control. We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on areas of expertise to accelerate growth across all regions. We had a good start of the year, and we have a very strong pipeline with markets also performing strongly across the asset classes. As a result, revenue in CIB in the US grew 35% year-on-year. Also, we continued expanding and strengthening our centers of expertise including key industry groups, such as synergy transition, healthcare, among others, and product teams such as M&A and ECM. At the same time, active capital management continued to support greater origination and high profitability levels. Our business through CIB is capital-light, very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year. CIB had a good result in Q1, with revenue up 5% year-on-year, even after the record in Q1 in 2023, making Q1 2024 the best quarter ever for the business. Almost all of our growth came from customer flows and was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking, both in global debt finance and corporate finance. Additionally, we are investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and further improve our profitability. As for wealth management and insurance, we continue our journey to build the best private banking and insurance manager in both Europe and the Americas. First, in Q1, Euromoney once again named us the best private bank in LatAm and the best international private bank in eight countries. Second, a major driver for growth is wealth, is collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, by capturing network benefits. Third, we are developing global platforms across the three businesses, while we digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. One example is the development of a global investment platform, which we began in Q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of investment across all countries. In summary, customer experience, efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth helping us to maintain our high profitability levels. Attributable profit grew double-digit on the back of strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment, with a total fee contribution from Santander Asset Management and Insurance growing at or close to double-digit, while costs remained fairly stable in real terms. As a result, efficiency improved four points year-on-year, and RoTA rose nine points to 80%. Finally, payments. We have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-wide and merchant acquiring. We are gaining market share as we strengthen Getnet's value proposition for customers through continued product development and a greater offering of value-added services. Growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where Getnet has been mostly rolled out, such as Chile, Spain, or Portugal. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the PagoNxt global platform to leverage on the group scale. Around 1 billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform, and we expect to double this volume by the end of the year. Also, we have started to deploy Plard, our global cards platform. We have more than 45,000 debit cards managed already in Plard, and we are starting the migration of the debit portfolio with 1.5 million cards in dual-run in Brazil, and we have launched a friends and family pilot in Chile. From a financial performance perspective, payments delivered a strong quarter, with good underlying revenue trends in both businesses, which combined with a positive performance of provisioning cards, drove 22% year-on-year profit growth. Finally, PagoNxt EBITDA margin reached 17%, showing good progress towards reaching our 30% target by 2025, which we set at our last Investor Day. Cost efficiency and CapEx optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our new phase of our shareholder value creation. Q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and double-digit shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I mentioned earlier, RoTE was 16.2%, if we analyze the Spanish bank levy, up 93 basis points year-on-year, reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Earnings per share rose to $0.17, up 14% year-on-year, supported by a strong profit generation and the lower number of shares following the buyback programs we have and are still executing. Finally, in the quarter, we delivered 14% growth in shareholder value creation, reflecting our disciplined capital allocation and the impact of the share buybacks. Buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. If we include in full the share buyback that is currently underway, where we have bought back around 11% of our outstanding shares in the last three years, providing a return of investment of approximately 19% to our shareholders. I'll leave you now with Jos\u00e9, our CFO, to go in through more detail on our quarterly financial performance. Thanks, Jos\u00e9\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera: Thank you, H\u00e9ctor, and good morning, everyone. I'll go into more detail on the Group's P&L and capital performance. But let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates, both in current and constant euros and also that the full impact of the Argentine peso devaluation last December for the whole year was accounted for in the fourth quarter, which introduces some distortions quarter-on-quarter. Let me also, as Sector has mentioned, highlight that we are presenting constant what we present here a constant is constant. That means local currency for all countries, but Argentina. Argentina is in current. By doing that, we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation. But also by doing this, we are lowering the growth rates that show us constant. For instance, net profit instead of growing 9%, with Argentina in constant is growing 13%. NII is growing 20% instead of 16%, fees would be up 8% instead of 5% or total revenue would be increasing 12% instead of 9%. So we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking into account the impact of hyperinflation in Argentina. Now let me go to the main components of the P&L. As H\u00e9ctor said, we are reporting exceptional results for the first quarter. We are starting to see the benefits of our transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in retail and consumer and obviously, the very positive momentum we are experiencing in both Europe and Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 10%. Actually, 12%, if we only look at customer revenue, supported by strong NII, highest quarterly fee income in our history, while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Net operating income grew 11% year-on-year. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, supported by strong labor markets and risk management provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries, but we see no asset quality pressures anywhere. Additionally, we had a higher impact from taxes year-on-year, driven mainly by stronger performance in Brazil, where we have a higher effective tax rate than the group average. And also the fact that the temporary levy in Spain is not tax deductible from the corporate tax level. The full impact of this tax levy in Spain is accounted for in the first quarter and is 50% higher than last year. As you can see on the right-hand side, excluding this impact, profit would have increased 14% year-on-year or 9% quarter-on-quarter, and Q1 would have been another record high. Let me break down the P&L. Starting with revenue. There was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of our total revenue and explain almost all of the growth in the quarter. Year-on-year, revenue increased 9% with all businesses and regions contributing. This growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which is growing at double-digit rates with good performance in net interest income and fees across regions and consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses and a strong volume growth in Europe and Latin America. CIB also had a great performance as revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter backed by outstanding performance in the US. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and in asset management. Payment is also showing very good underlying trends year-on-year as both PagoNxt and cards are growing if we exclude the onetime positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year, as Hector has explained. Finally, at the corporate center, high liquidity buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which contributed -- which continued growing in the quarter, particularly in retail and consumer, representing 82% of group's NII, it went up 16% year-on-year on the back of active price management in retail in Europe, especially deposits and also in Mexico and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates in South America, both in retail and consumer and the fact that now forward rate curves in Europe are a bit higher. In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year even if we exclude Argentina. This was mainly explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of our -- of the interest rate environment. These gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs, which we were able to contain thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration in Europe, and deposit re-pricing downwards in Brazil, leading to a notable margin expansion. The only country where we saw a slight increase in EBITDA in the quarter towards the UK. Going forward, we expect the positive momentum in Europe to continue, we expect to benefit from the interest rate cuts in South America, and we expect an improvement in our consumer business throughout the year, boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination. As a result, very good NII outlook for the year. In the context of low fee income growth in general because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity, we generated record net fee income of \u20ac3.2 billion in the quarter. Even if we exclude Argentina, growing strongly quarter-on-quarter despite the strong seasonality in payments in the fourth quarter. We also delivered solid growth year-on-year, supported by most of our businesses with retail growing 9%, driven mostly by higher activity in Brazil, outstanding performance in consumer fueled by insurance. CIB also growing from very high levels in the first quarter of last year, especially in the U.S. on the back of our strong dynamics in DCM and customer-related markets activity. Wealth also had a great performance, particularly in private banking, higher volumes in asset management, and protection businesses -- business performance in insurance. Payments was impacted by the usual seasonality from Christmas and Black Friday in the fourth quarter and the aforementioned one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter of 2023 in Brazil. In terms of efficiency, significant improvement in our ratio to 42.6%, which remains amongst the best in the sector. As we have already mentioned, structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms of operational leverage, especially in retail and consumer as costs remained stable at around \u20ac6.5 billion for the last three, four quarters. Average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint, dropping from 12% a year ago to 4% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real terms despite the lagged effect of higher inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. By business, costs remain well under control in retail, consumer, and wealth, which represents 75% of our total cost base. However, total cost rose 5%, reflecting our strategy to reinforce our CIB franchise and develop global payments platforms. We expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even more evident in the coming quarters and years. Credit quality, as I have mentioned, no signs of any pressure. In terms of quality -- credit quality, which remains robust with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint, in line with our expectations. By global business, credit quality remained stable at low levels in the quarter in retail, which represents 50% of the group's loan loss provisions with some underlying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved in Spain, remained at very low levels in the U.K., while Mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations. In consumer, what represents around 36% of group's loan loss provisions, cost of risk normalized to 2.12%, also in line with our expectations, but still below the historical average, both in DCB Europe and in the U.S., which is still 5 percentage points below 2016 levels. Going forward, we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around 1.2% in 2024, a strength in consumer and Mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in retail, especially in Brazil, improving mostly in the second half of the year; Spain will be stable; and in the U.K., that will also remain at very low levels. Closing with capital, our fully loaded capital ratio remained at a very comfortable level of 12.3%, backed by a strong capital generation and significant risk-weighted asset mobilization. This quarter, we generated 32 basis points organically after having absorbed 5 basis points due to the temporary levy in Spain and an increase in risk-weighted asset density related to a change in mix. We recorded 22 basis points charge from -- for shareholder remuneration, in line with our 50% payout. There are also 24 basis points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of CIB models, which is expected to be temporary and revert next year with the implementation of Basel III. Finally, there was a 14 basis point positive impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of available-for-sale portfolios. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book, return on risk-weighted assets of 2.8% in the quarter, well-above that of our back book and higher than last year's. We created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment. Last year, we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to \u20ac30 billion in risk-weighted assets at the cost of capital of around half of that of the new origination, our target this year is to do even more. That's all from my side, H\u00e9ctor over to you.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Thank you, Jos\u00e9. First of all, a quick reminder. We continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025. Thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with, first, a strong and increasing organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans. Second, we continued improving our profitability. Investor Day target, just to remember you, was 15% to 17% RoTE. And by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 14% value creation. And a summary to finish off. Q1 2024 was another strong quarter, supported by recurrent customer revenue growing high single digit, backed by a strong performance in all our businesses and regions. Our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model is driving efficient improvement and profitable growth, which is essentially evident in retail and consumer. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder value creation. This is very strong Q1 2024, we are confident that we will achieve our 2024 targets, as well as those we gave on our Investor Day in 2025. First of all, it's important to acknowledge that it's supported by our global businesses as we continue executing on one transformation. From a revenue perspective, we expect good NII performance in the year. This is based on, first, the positive momentum in Europe, which will continue at least in all of the quarter; second, enjoying the benefits from the interest rate cuts in South America; and third, the significant improvements in consumer boosted by the high new business profitability. The benefits of the operational leverage from one transformation program are expected to become even more evident during the rest of the year and well into 2025. Cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our expectations in the context of strong labor markets. As we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, the group's RoTE improved from 16.2% in Q1 2024, and we expect it to remain at 16% in line with our targets for 2024. All-in-all, our TNAV plus cash dividend is growing double digit, well on track to meet our target through the cycle. And now we would be happy to take your questions. Thank you.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you, H\u00e9ctor, and thank you, Jos\u00e9. We can start the Q&A session now.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We already have the first question from the line of Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.\nFrancisco Riquel: Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. First is on NII in Spain, which has surprised positively. We have seen local peers raising guidance. So I wonder if you can update on your guidance for 2024 and detail the main assumptions behind it? And then how big a lift shall we expect in 2025 with the current yield curve? Also connected to this, the NII in the corporate center because the Spanish liquidity, I understand is remunerated here. So you can provide any comment to better assess the combined NII performance of Spain and the corporate center? And my second question is on capital after the 20 bps front loaded in first quarter for Basel IV. You mentioned in the past 30 bps left for January 1, 2025. So, meaning that you're already in line with the 12% pro forma post Basel IV. I wonder if you can update on this Basel IV regulatory impacts and other headwinds that we should expect? And where do you see your CET1 target in the context also of potential countercyclical buffers? Thank you.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Thank you, Francisco. Let me explain exactly how do we see NII basically going in Spain. First of all, I mean, we see really good trends as you can see in retail due to the fact that we had really good growth in clients. I basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well, which we can basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients. It's important to say, and as I commented, that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to go. All the different business basically are doing quite well. As you can see, I mean, CIB is also performing quite well and the commercial business, too, and that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong 2024 all along in NII in Spain. In terms of the corporate center of what we see there on capital, I will ask basically Jose to give you the details.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera : Thank you, H\u00e9ctor. Let me complement those comments. With the current forward rates, as H\u00e9ctor said, we see NII still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NII in Spain year-on-year, up low single digits. Remember that we expected NII in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in 2024 relative to 2023 with the current level of interest rates and forward rates, we see actually NII up in Spain year-on-year. In the Corporate Center, the first quarter is a bit abnormal, because we increased the hedging. We always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies. So I would expect the NII in the corporate center to gradually perform better, as future charges might be lower. Capital, Basel III. Let me make a general comment before I go into Basel III. There are a few elements -- well, several elements of uncertainty to European bank's capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters. The first is the U.S. has stated that they will not implement FRTB for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed Basel III rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. impacts. It is therefore very likely that both the FRTB and the Basel III rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage. It is not unlikely though that the commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of FRTB beyond January 1, 2025. However, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EBA needs to publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive -- capital directive. The EBA mandate is that in aggregate, all these -- the impact of all these papers must be neutral. But that doesn't guarantee that everyone and all these papers will be neutral themselves. This is the case, for instance, in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation. So all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimate for a very low day one impact of Basel III. So on January 1, the impact will be very low, zero to 20 basis points, and the fully loaded impact of between 30 to 50 basis points as we had commented before. So all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully loaded and phase-in once Basel III comes into effect. Countercyclical buffers. If in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk-weighted assets for the group. So any countercyclical buffer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50 it will be 12 basis points. If it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember, however, that from the time countercyclical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, there is a one-year lag. So any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year. It most likely will not impact 2025 capital requirements or they might impact year-end capital requirements in 2025, but not 2024.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Question from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Ulargui: Hi, good morning. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, if I may. The first one is on fees and fee generation in the quarter was quite good when looking to the coming quarters, what should we expect? Should we expect an acceleration of growth, driven by the good performance of CIB and Wealth Management insurance? Linked to this, I just wanted to see if there was any kind of one-off in the fees reported in the US, which jumped out quarter-on-quarter? The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate. And I just wanted to better understand what is the organic generation that you expect, I mean, as profitability improves, I feel that 10 to 15 bps is to be a bit low and you could probably generate a bit more or you would be able that to additional growth of our revenue base? Thank you.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Thank you, Ignacio. Okay. In terms of fee generation, okay, we have, as you can see, I mean, a strong Q1, 14% quarter-on-quarter. That's an 18% quarter-on-quarter growth in retail. Retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth, and it's basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and it's continued to do so, okay? You talk about the outstanding performance in CIB, that's 39% quarter-on-quarter. That's record revenue. This is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking, and there is no one-offs whatsoever in all the bank and in the U.S. It's basically business as usual and client flow from all accounts, okay? In wealth, we have also a very strong recurring activity in private banking. Also, we have higher volumes in asset management. And as well in the insurance business, we have seen a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that could help us out, okay? Consumer growth came mainly from Europe, okay? Volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe, and that shall help us as well. For 2024, we expect that trying to continue, as I told you, the fees are growing to reach mid to high single-digit. This is not an official target, but I can tell you that this is a trend that we see. This is mostly driven by the increase in CIB with the connectivity we have on wealth and payments and the growth in customer and transactionality. And most of the global businesses, we experienced double-digit fee growth in 2024 as we changed the business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account. It's very important that you understand what the model change is about. The model change is exactly about that. When I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients, this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we used to do in the past, okay? So, this is the basic change that we're executing today. So, you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of RWAs. With that, then I'll leave on the capital question to Jos\u00e9. Thank you.\nJos\u00e9 Garcia-Cantera: Hello Ignacio. Our organic capital generation post dividends is around 15 basis points per quarter. We think we can keep risk-weighted assets fairly flat throughout the year, very, very low risk-weighted asset consumption because of the asset rotation initiatives that I mentioned. So, we should be able to have available for capital growth or regulatory headwinds, 15 per quarter the next three quarters. We still expect 20 to 30 basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for intangible management. So, net-net, with all of that, we still see 12.40 to 12.50 capital ratio by year end.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAlvaro Serrano: Hi, good morning. I've got kind of a couple of follow-up questions. H\u00e9ctor, you gave details on the fee performance. I just want to circle back to U.S. again and Brazil. In the U.S. so is this -- I noticed you said there's no one-offs, but is this the run rate we should expect going forward? How is the pipeline looking? I realize there's no one-offs, but there may be seasonality? And can you repeat, you mentioned in Brazil, there was a renegotiation [indiscernible] I suspect that's why the fees have been lower, but if you could repeat that? And then the second question on NII. If you think through your comments on Spain, could I invite you to comment on Brazil and U.K., Brazil, obviously, very, very strong. It sounds like above the sensitivity you gave. Can -- do you expect -- what do you expect for the full year? Can it continue strong? And on UK, just when you think it can bottom? Thank you.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Thank you, Alvaro. Yes, as I explained to you, the performance in the US is quite good. And look, we have a very strong pipeline. It's -- and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend. But as you know, that will all depend, I mean, how the market basically goes. But what I can tell you is that, the market is basically helping us out in that sense, and we will continue the trend if the market helps us. I'm sorry to repeat myself. In what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly you were saying, I mean, we had a one-off in payments that we had on the first quarter last year, which is not going to repeat itself. It was a big one, \u20ac195 million. So that basically slowed us a little bit, but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice. And I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth. And what I saw towards the end of the year, we see that if we continue that trend, that should help as well in insurance, in retail, so that will help us as well, okay? So I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that will continue to be strong. In terms of NII in Spain, Brazil and the UK, I could tell you that the indications we gave at the beginning is that with -- if the rates continue the way they are, this is going to give us -- I mean, first of all, see the volume growth that we're having in Brazil. So it's important to understand, and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly. And NII, in Spain, already Jose gave you a very good explanation, but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one. In terms of the UK, let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is. I mean, as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving, okay? The business, as you know, is very focused on retail. It's our core business, and we continue to improve their offering and the user experience. And we also are gradually continued growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail, okay? NII is down 4.4% in the quarter, similar just as I said, to the UK banks. And all the big ones have the similar trends of us, but we're taking actions to improve the NII. We're doing pricing changes. We announced both deposits and lending in the first quarter, and we are trying to use the betas and to manage them in a much better way. And asset mortgage spreads also are improving in the UK market, so that shall help us towards the next quarter. So it wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year. And then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that. That is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK. And the cost of risk is basically very well -- I mean, under control, and we expect it to be very much there. So with that, I'll ask Jose to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NII.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera: Yes. So in Brazil, NII should gradually accelerate over the second half of the year. That means that year-on-year, we should see mid- to high double digits teens, not double digit teams, growth in NII. And in the UK, the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter. We've -- as Hector said, we've seen a pickup in volumes, margins, customer margins were flat quarter-on-quarter. So year-on-year, for the full year, NII down a little bit, mid-single digits, something like that. With all of these estimates, we believe NII for the group should grow quarter-on-quarter this year. So sequentially, we should see higher NII every quarter this year. And year-on-year, customer revenue, we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees. So year-on-year, customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 2023.\nAlvaro Serrano: Thanks.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you both Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Cerezo: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. There are two, both on the US. I don't think I have seen the slide you used to have in last quarter around the aspirational 15% RoTE target in the US. So if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number, and what are the main drivers and the main initiatives I've seen Openbank being launched in the US recently. So just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that? And the second one is on the asset quality in the US. I mean, you used to give some information around PV's charge-offs in the past as well. I don't think I've seen those actually. So forgive me if I have missed them, but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US asset quality, delinquencies on the auto businesses are developing from here? Thank you.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Thank you, Ignacio. Okay. In terms of the US, a particular thing is, first of all, I mean, as you know, we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses, which is consumer on one side, which is a business that we have at scale. We have also expanded a little money on the CIB side to be for our presence there. And we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today, we are just basically for non-US alliance. So those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% RoTE. And I believe it's going to be more towards the end of 2025 that we're going to be able to get there, but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that. In terms of the asset quality in the US, let me explain you exactly how the trend is, first of all, we still see a strong labor market in the US. And the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well. What has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in delinquencies above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID, that remember pre-COVID was about 90%. We went all the way down to 59%. Today is more around close to in between mid-60s, and it continues to be like that. So as you can see, our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels, and we expect it to continue to be like that towards the end of the year. We don't see any surprises and the way the portfolio has behaved. So circa around 2% that's where I see it. And now what we have done also is very much focused on profitability. We've been very strong on capital allocation. And we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good. And also, we are focusing on credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40% prime and near prime, okay? So you see the portfolio very stable and in that level.\nIgnacio Cerezo: Thank you.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you, H\u00e9ctor. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank, BPI. Please go ahead.\nCarlos Peixoto: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So the first question would actually be on the U.S. on the outlook for NII, how do you see it evolving throughout the year? Should we expect pressure to continue? Or could we also see a recovery trend in there? And then second question, and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did. On the cost of risk in the U.K., it remains at quite low levels. Do you see this picking up throughout the year? Or should we -- or should we see the first Q level something recurring throughout the year? Thank you very much.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Sorry. Thank you, Carlos. First of all, on the outlook of NII in the U.S., I see it flattish, okay? Let's see how volumes basically turn out. And as I explained before, since we are very much focused on profitability and also in capital allocation, I see that it's going to be flattish around there, okay? And in terms of cost of risk in the U.K., sorry. The cost of risk in the U.K., as I told you before, when I was explaining Alvaro, I see it very flattish. I mean the guidance is going to be at around 11 basis points to 14 basis points at the most. So below 2% -- sorry, below 20 basis points.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera: So if I may add, we -- as I've said, we see no asset quality pressures anywhere. Labor markets are very strong, new employment, new job creation is also very strong everywhere. So we see really no pressure. There's no signs of asset quality deterioration. So we could extrapolate what we've seen in recent quarters in the U.K., we could extrapolate for the rest of the year.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Marta Sanchez Romero from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMarta Sanchez Romero: Thank you very much. Good morning. My first question is on capital. So the Bank of Spain were to introduce the CCI of 100 bps, that is 25 bps for you, but that would leave your 12% fully loaded core equity Tier 1 ratio, leaving or implying an MBDA buffer of just about 177 basis points, which is pretty low for European standards. So do you think that 12% fully loaded Tier 1 ratio target is still the right one in that event? And the second question is on the U.K. So the bottom line is now 25% smaller than last year. Is the shrinking going to continue? Or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels? And just quickly a clarification on a previous question. The revenue growth that you are foreseeing, is that just reported revenues? And is that in constant or current euros? Thank you.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera: Let me answer your final question. We are estimating almost or around double-digit revenue growth in constant euros with Argentina in current euros. Obviously, in current euros or in euros with Argentina in constant might be higher than that. But as I explained, we believe this is the best reflection of our underlying performance, eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation in Argentina.\nMarta Sanchez Romero: Thank you.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: In terms of capital, what I can tell you is basically that exactly, as I said, I reiterate that we're going to end up the year at around 12 40 to 12 50, okay? And I really do believe -- actually reiterate that we're going to be above 12% after Basel III. I would be -- that would be the main points.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera: Yes. And again, the countercyclical buffer will be implemented in a year's time. So again, the capital target is being decided by the Board. The Board might review that capital target once the variables that led to that capital target might change, but we are going to be comfortably above 200 basis points MDA with our actual capital buffer.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nBritta Schmidt: Yes. Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two questions. You sound more optimistic on net interest income in Spain, UK and Brazil. But yes, there's more been no change to the official group targets for 2024. What is the delta here? And what do you think is the biggest delta to consensus? And then secondly, you guided to double-digit customer revenue growth and the group revenue target is mid-single digit. What's the delta here for 2024? Thanks.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera: As we saw in the first quarter, just the monetary adjustment in Argentina, in the first quarter was \u20ac600 million. We have \u20ac1.2 billion monetary position in Argentina, and inflation was 51% in the first quarter. So just that in the first quarter was \u20ac600 million. That's what we are trying to avoid by looking at constant. So there are charges to the P&L that obviously we don't control. So that's the reason why we haven't changed the revenue target for, I mean, the total revenue target for the group, mid-single digits, but we believe that the customer revenue growth can approach can be close to double-digits.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Britta, in terms of the revenue overall, as you were saying in NII, Yes, I sound optimistic because I'm very optimistic of the trends that we have in front of us. And I reiterate that we're going to meet the 16% RoTE that we basically have announced onwards, I believe that is -- it looks good and it looks promising, but I reiterate the guidance that we have gave you.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from the line of Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSofie Peterzens: Hi, here is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks very much for taking my question. So I was just wondering about the net cost guidance for 2024. Does it still hold your costs were up 5% in constant euros, 7% in current euros, so how should we think about that as cost guidance that you previously gave? And then my second question would be on rates sensitivity to 100 basis point change in rates, if you could just remind us what that means for Spain, Brazil, the U.K., U.S., all the core markets? And also, if you have any hedging in place to reduce that rate sensitivity? And then my final question would be on Slide 5, you say that your -- you only got 5 million new customers year-on-year. But at the Investor Day a year ago, you targeted, I think, 75 million new customers. Just like a strategic question, maybe it doesn't make it different if you only have 5 million new customers or does it make it difference? And how do you plan to get the 75 million new customers that you guided for at the Investor Day a year ago? Thank you.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Thank you, Sofie Let me answer you the last question first. I mean, what we've been doing here is basically, we are cleaning up a lot of our customer bases. And even though we are growing quite hard, we've been cleaning up that and basically that's, at the end, what's going to be telling -- I mean, moving up towards the number of customers that we are able to include. We're going to be working on that. And -- but I mean, the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses. In terms of the cost, I was basically -- as I explained to you, I mean, this remained fairly stable for the third quarter in a row, okay? As you have seen, that's close 1% quarter-on-quarter. If you exclude Argentina, that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down. That's plus 2% year-on-year in real terms, and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 2024 target of below 43% cost to income. And I believe that we're going to be able to get to that. Cost efficiencies are just coming from operating leverage through simplification of products. If you see the amount of product that we have simplificated, we have 10,000 different products, today, we're down to 7,500 and automation, which is a very important part. And I was explaining you in the change of model how we're changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs. And this is something that, in time, will help us to control costs much better than we've been doing, okay? That's basically the efficiency gains. If you look at that simplification gave us 17 basis points year-on-year of savings. Automation is helping us out, 58% of product services are now digitally available, okay? That's 2 percentage points in help versus December 2023. And if I can tell you an example, the U.S. have captured \u20ac10 million in efficiencies just in Q1 alone. And that's \u20ac210 million since we started the process in 2022, and that's just in consumer and retail. So, it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a really cost-cutting exercise for the creation of the single model and with several other benefits, and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank, okay? So, to reiterate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost-to-income for the rest of the year.\nJos\u00e9 Garcia-Cantera: Now, in terms of rate sensitivity, there hasn't been any change in all countries, in most countries, but Europe, let me -- in euros. Let me explain. So, in the U.S., it's plus/minus \u20ac150 million; in Brazil, plus minus \u20ac150 million. In the UK, it's plus/minus \u20ac200 million; but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros, in Spain, in particular, significantly. Let me make first 1 particular comment about the UK. Our structural hedge in the UK is \u00a3113 billion with an average duration of \u00a32.4 billion. It was \u00a3106 billion in December. So \u00a3113, 2.4 years, average duration. And in Spain, we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions, basically originating -- adjusting the origination buying ALCO portfolio. We now have \u20ac30 billion ALCO in Spain at an average duration of between six to seven years at 3.25% yield. And we have been also writing some hedges. The result of that is that of the \u20ac240 billion risk-weighted assets, \u20ac250 billion average earning assets, we have in Spain, 60% is floating, 40% is fixed. That's significantly higher fixed portion than before. So now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe.\nJos\u00e9 Garcia-Cantera: Sorry, Sophie, just to be more precise, what I was saying is the cost to income is going to be below 43%. That's efficiency that we have said for the year, and we reiterate that. And efficiency this quarter was 42.6%.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Let me -- so let me just finish. The NII sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has been reduced to 7.5%, compared to their sensitivity at 5%. And we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we in the future. Obviously, the decision to this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates, curve rates, interest rate curves have picked up a bit, so that has allowed us to earn higher NII and also more time to hedge the positions. But again, we are gradually hedging our interest rate sensitivity in euros, reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you. Can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Next question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: Thank you for taking my question. The first is on your profitability targets. You're above 16% RoTE guidance for 2024 implies more than \u20ac12.4 billion net profit this year with Q1 on track to hit that with tailwinds in H2 that you indicated in Brazil, in the UK reticketing portfolio in consumer with lower rates. Can you be more specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the 2025 RoTE outlook? Second question, if you could give us a target for 2024, group costs in absolute million? And where do you see them going in 2025? Finally, a quick one on the insurance business, the new banking package improved, the treatment of insurance activities inside banks. Could you consider internalizing this business? Thank you.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera: Thank you, Andrea. You're right. I mean, we are confident that we are going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROTE for the year. And as we said correctly in our Investor Day, we said 15% to 17% towards 2025. And we are working towards that, and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it. But today, I reiterate to you that we're going to be at the 16% that we have set, okay? In terms of cost, what we have said is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income. If you see the numbers that we have been, we've been very disciplined in terms of -- and what we have said, I mean, if you said it, is you saw is quarter-on-quarter is around 1% top, and we're going to be very disciplined about it. And if you see the operational leverage that we have on the -- what I presented on retail, you see that the operational leverage is working like that, okay? So our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is. And I believe that the trend would continue like this. So I feel very confident on the way we're managing things. And I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flattish in terms of cost. The question of insurance is quite a good one. We love that business. We believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil, I could tell you, Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low. So we see huge opportunities on that, and we continue to better up our systems. For example, we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way. Today, average by market, we have 222 different products per market. The idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be much more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the clients exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend. So that's a huge opportunity, as you say. The other side of the coin is that we have JVs that in place on the long-term basis, mainly in Latin America and Spain and Portugal. And then we will continue to have them over the years because they are long term. I would love to internalize that business, what unfortunately is what it is. We have the JVs and we need to respect what we have there. But as you say, there's a huge opportunity in that sense, not just because of the change and sweets in regulation, but also because of the -- the advantages and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the low penetration in the different markets.\nAndrea Filtri: Thank you.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Benjamin Toms from RBC. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Toms: Thank you for taking my questions. At the full year results, you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the FCA's review of mode's Finance in the UK. And since then, one of the large banks in the UK has made a significant provision in respect to that issue, do you still expect no material impact here? And are there any numbers you can provide us with to help frame the issue? And then secondly, we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return profiles, your ROTE in the UK is slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix, do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using organic methods? Thank you.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Thank you. I mean, first of all, on the UK motor finance issue, I mean the resolution of such matters, as you know, is not possible to predict. There are some significant uncertainties that remain with regards to the existence, the scope and the timing of any possible outcome there. So as a result, we're not yet in a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact. And I don't believe until basically this, I understand there is an expert basically running through that. So I don't believe that we can give you an idea. What I can tell you is that so far, we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have. And so far, we've been doing better than we expected. In terms of consolidation in the UK, I don't see that we should play in a consolidation at this point. I don't believe that that's a market that we should invest more at this point. That would be my view in that sense.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Hallam: Yes, good morning, everybody. So two for me. So first on Basel IV and then on Argentina. So hope thanks for the color earlier on Basel IV. I mean I suppose it sounds very possible that FRTB gets pushed to align with a revised US time frame, let's say, towards July 1, 2026. And you mentioned the delegated act provision for FRTB here in Europe. So just within your day one and fully loaded guidance, how much is FRTB and how much is all the rest of it, i.e., if we only get parts of Basel IV in January 1, 2025, and then FRTB follows on July 1, 2026, how much would that change the phasing of the capital headwinds you talked about earlier? And then second, on Argentina. So clearly, it has quite a distortive effect on the group figures. And then there's the associated cost of hedging, and it's below 5% of group earnings. So I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina, I guess, especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market? Or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit on economic?\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera: So the answer to your third question. Yes, when -- we've always mentioned Basel III, but when we gave the impacts, we were including FRTB, you're right. So when we said day one impact of Basel III, was Basel III plus FRTB. FRTB isolated is 10 basis points. So if FRTB gets postponed, we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates. I hope this clarifies the matter.\nH\u00e9ctor Grisi: Thank you. In terms of Argentina, I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on in Argentina, basically can sustain what's going, and we're trying to be positive about what could happen, I don't believe that we have no downside or upside given the situation. So there are no plans to do anything at this point, and we'll just wait and we will continue operating our business. Our business is doing well. It's very good structured, is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration, in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients, fee generation. So we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The last question comes from the line of Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: Yes, thank you. Just having a second go. Asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024, the 16% rate implies over \u20ac12.3 billion, can you be more specific about what number you're actually targeting? And then your own cost, the same story. I'm asking for a nominal euro-denominated group cost target for 2024? Thank you.\nJos\u00e9 Garcia-Cantera: Insufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost. So, again, for net income, 13% -- sorry, 16% return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around 12 -- north of \u20ac12 billion, it's what -- it's the conclusion of the 16%, we agree with that. And in terms of costs, we are looking at a cost growth, which is going to be around 2% this year, 2% to 2.5% this year. Going forward, as we've discussed, we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward. That is going to be difficult. Obviously, we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment. We believe that -- well, it is a very ambitious target, but that's the internal target we have. We haven't given any guidance for 2025. But what I'm saying is that long, medium term, our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms. We are not there yet in 2024, close. We think we could be closer there in 2025, but it's too early. We are still in early 2023 -- sorry, 2024. So, we'll give you this guidance in due course. But again, our medium long-term objective is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms.\nBego\u00f1a Moren\u00e9s: Thank you very much. Thank you, H\u00e9ctor, and thank you, Jos\u00e9. I believe there are no more questions. Thank you all analysts and investors for your attendance. Our Investor Relations team is, as always, at your disposal for any further questions you may have.

Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today, are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that this is the first full quarter in which we are publishing results with our global businesses as primary reporting, aligned with the way we are managed, as we announced late last year. Secondary reporting will be what used to be primary until 2023, mainly country reporting, European DCB, et cetera. As we will explain later, changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of Argentina, which is presented in current euros to avoid distortions. All information will be, as always, available in the Excel Sheet and report that is published on our website. But now to the presentation. I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. H\u00e9ctor Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Garcia-Cantera.

        "speaker": "H\u00e9ctor Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Bego\u00f1a. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, let me share with you what we will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results on the context of our strategy. Second, Jos\u00e9 will then review our financial performance in greater detail, and then I will conclude with some final messages. Let's start with Q1. Q1 was another very strong quarter for Santander. Positive contributions for all our businesses, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model. We are presenting a profit of \u20ac2.9 billion, that's an 11% increase versus Q1 2023, 9% in constant euros. As Bego\u00f1a excluding the impact of the temporary levy of revenue paid in Spain recorded in full in Q1. If you include that, this was another record quarter. Our customer focus and scale are driving profitable growth. Over the last year, we welcomed 5 million new customers and our revenue in Q1 increased close to double-digit year-on-year in constant euros, and that's supported by all global businesses and the regions. We're executing on our transformation plan, which is already supporting efficiency improvements, leading to growth in profitability and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.4 percentage points year-on-year to 42.6%, and net operating income has grown double-digit year-on-year for the last eight quarters. Our return on tangible equity rose 55 basis points year-on-year to 14.9%, even more, 16.2% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain. Finally, our solid balance sheet. With some capital ratios and robust credit quality, it contributed to strong profitable growth and more importantly, to shareholder value creation. TNAV plus dividend per share grew by 14% year-on-year from a combination of higher profit, increased shareholder remuneration, and fewer shares due to the buyback programs we have and we are still executing. In the last 12 months, we increased TNAV by more than \u20ac4.5 billion. If we take a quick look at our income statement, as we usually do, we present growth both in current euros and in cost in euros, although there were no material differences between them this quarter. Part of the reason is that for the first time, the variations in constant euros applied to all countries except to Argentina, which is in current euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation. Our P&L was strong from top to bottom. The strong top -- number one, strong top line performance, driven both by NII, record fees supported, as I said, by all the global businesses and regions. Second, revenue grew while costs remained flattish in real terms, in line with expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters. Third, we demonstrated the sustainability of our results with 11% growth in net operating income. Fourth and low loss provisions continue to normalize as expected. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we recorded a \u20ac335 million charge related to the temporary levy in Spain, which was 50% higher than in 2023. Excluding this impact, profit rose 14% year-on-year, implying a growth of 12% in constant euros. Jose will go into more detail into these points later on. As you can see, this is a great start of the year, and we are well on track to achieve our 2024 targets, targets that we comfortably reiterate. Good business dynamics supported high single-digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved, even as we're investing for the future through one transformation and it is already better than our target in 2024. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, in line with our target of keeping it around 1.2% at the end of the year. The fully loaded CET1 ratio remained at 12.3% in Q1, having profitably grown our regions organically and accrued distributions in line with our 50% payout and we have absorbed regulatory impacts. We are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation, and Arrote grew year-on-year 16.2% putting us on track to reach our target of 16% for 2024. As you can clearly see, we're achieving these results backed by the operational leverage provided by one transformation, which is improving both revenue and cost. The efficiencies we have captured and the impact of our active spread management have already contributed 174 basis points of improvements since 2023. Our global businesses continue to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 88 basis points in efficiency gains. Our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model continued to grow well with revenue increasing 5% year-on-year. Finally, our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated 63 basis points in efficiency savings so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture \u20ac50 million in additional savings in Q1 for a total of \u20ac237 million since 2022. This has been mainly driven by the deployment of gravity by new global agreements with vendors and process optimization in operations and the implementation of the new IT and Ops shared services. Our business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on profitable growth. From the creation of a best-in-class customer experience and operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech. This is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our investor rate targets. This operational leverage is already very evident in our retail and consumer businesses, where the efficiency ratios improved close to 400 basis points and 200 basis points year-on-year, respectively. In CIB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our ISO expertise to roll our US franchise without changing the risk profile, proof of which is the revenue, which grew 5% and reached another quarterly record, supported by the good performance in the US and strong client flows. Wealth continued to grow strongly, improving both efficiency and profitability. And finally, in payments, where we are managing more than 100 million cards group-wide, we are seeing good activity trends. In Q1 2023, we had a one-time revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our partners in Brazil. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 7% and efficiency remained flat year-on-year, despite our investments in deploying our global platforms. Now let's look at each business in greater detail. First, our goal in retail is to become the number one bank for our customers, which is key to our strategy. At the same time, our retail business is a great example that demonstrates the benefits we are generating from one transformation, as operational leverage has significantly improved the efficiency ratio. First, we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience. For example, in Spain, our new digital onboarding is contributing to 630,000 increase in net new customers year-on-year, while Santander Key already enables more than 4 million customers to approve transactions securely with a single click using biometrics. Second, we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks, increasing automation to free up time for our people to focus on commercial activities. As a result, the dedication of resources to non-commercial activities have dropped by 4% in the last nine months. Third, the deployment of our own global platform continued in Q1, and Gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Chile and the US. From a financial perspective, this is also a great moment for retail. We are managing margins very carefully to make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in Europe. And at the same time, benefit from our negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America on top of the strong operational leverage that we are obtaining from one transformation. As a result, our profit grew 22% year-on-year, with the following three things to highlight. First, double-digit revenue increase, driven by good performance, both in NII and fees, with all the regions growing year-on-year, especially Europe and South America. Second, cost under control, flat in real terms as the benefits from our transformation in some units are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments. And third, provisions dropping slightly with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group. The execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with growth increasing to 3% to 17.6%. In Consumer, we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers. We offer best-in-class global solutions, which are integrated to our partners' processes. Last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to pure direct auto players, which has been received well because it allows our customers to compete their vehicle acquisition and financing fully aligned. We're also progressing well on simplification and automation, supporting a 15 basis point decline on our cost to total volumes ratio. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing cost-to-serve and improving profitability. We recently announced the launch of Openbank in North America this year, which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the US. Consumer is also delivering operational leverage with net operating income growing by 7% year-on-year, driven by the following three elements. First, an increase in revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume growth, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good NII performance and 22% fee growth, mainly from insurance. Second, cost dropped 4% in real terms as a result of the execution of our strategy and the efficiency plans we implemented last year in a more complex interest rate environment. Third, provisions increased year-on-year, mainly due to the expected cost of risk normalization in the business, both in Europe and the US, though still below the historical averages as well as some impact from volumes and regulation. Last year, we started to prioritize profitability over volumes. So we are originating at high [indiscernible]. The increase of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to double digit year-on-year by the end of 2024, even after the normalization we expect on provisions. As you can see, we are building a world-class CIB business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to grow profit, while maintaining, at the same time, the same risk profile and is well-under control. We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on areas of expertise to accelerate growth across all regions. We had a good start of the year, and we have a very strong pipeline with markets also performing strongly across the asset classes. As a result, revenue in CIB in the US grew 35% year-on-year. Also, we continued expanding and strengthening our centers of expertise including key industry groups, such as synergy transition, healthcare, among others, and product teams such as M&A and ECM. At the same time, active capital management continued to support greater origination and high profitability levels. Our business through CIB is capital-light, very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year. CIB had a good result in Q1, with revenue up 5% year-on-year, even after the record in Q1 in 2023, making Q1 2024 the best quarter ever for the business. Almost all of our growth came from customer flows and was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking, both in global debt finance and corporate finance. Additionally, we are investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and further improve our profitability. As for wealth management and insurance, we continue our journey to build the best private banking and insurance manager in both Europe and the Americas. First, in Q1, Euromoney once again named us the best private bank in LatAm and the best international private bank in eight countries. Second, a major driver for growth is wealth, is collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, by capturing network benefits. Third, we are developing global platforms across the three businesses, while we digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. One example is the development of a global investment platform, which we began in Q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of investment across all countries. In summary, customer experience, efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth helping us to maintain our high profitability levels. Attributable profit grew double-digit on the back of strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment, with a total fee contribution from Santander Asset Management and Insurance growing at or close to double-digit, while costs remained fairly stable in real terms. As a result, efficiency improved four points year-on-year, and RoTA rose nine points to 80%. Finally, payments. We have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-wide and merchant acquiring. We are gaining market share as we strengthen Getnet's value proposition for customers through continued product development and a greater offering of value-added services. Growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where Getnet has been mostly rolled out, such as Chile, Spain, or Portugal. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the PagoNxt global platform to leverage on the group scale. Around 1 billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform, and we expect to double this volume by the end of the year. Also, we have started to deploy Plard, our global cards platform. We have more than 45,000 debit cards managed already in Plard, and we are starting the migration of the debit portfolio with 1.5 million cards in dual-run in Brazil, and we have launched a friends and family pilot in Chile. From a financial performance perspective, payments delivered a strong quarter, with good underlying revenue trends in both businesses, which combined with a positive performance of provisioning cards, drove 22% year-on-year profit growth. Finally, PagoNxt EBITDA margin reached 17%, showing good progress towards reaching our 30% target by 2025, which we set at our last Investor Day. Cost efficiency and CapEx optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our new phase of our shareholder value creation. Q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and double-digit shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I mentioned earlier, RoTE was 16.2%, if we analyze the Spanish bank levy, up 93 basis points year-on-year, reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Earnings per share rose to $0.17, up 14% year-on-year, supported by a strong profit generation and the lower number of shares following the buyback programs we have and are still executing. Finally, in the quarter, we delivered 14% growth in shareholder value creation, reflecting our disciplined capital allocation and the impact of the share buybacks. Buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders. If we include in full the share buyback that is currently underway, where we have bought back around 11% of our outstanding shares in the last three years, providing a return of investment of approximately 19% to our shareholders. I'll leave you now with Jos\u00e9, our CFO, to go in through more detail on our quarterly financial performance. Thanks, Jos\u00e9"

        "text": "Thank you, H\u00e9ctor, and good morning, everyone. I'll go into more detail on the Group's P&L and capital performance. But let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates, both in current and constant euros and also that the full impact of the Argentine peso devaluation last December for the whole year was accounted for in the fourth quarter, which introduces some distortions quarter-on-quarter. Let me also, as Sector has mentioned, highlight that we are presenting constant what we present here a constant is constant. That means local currency for all countries, but Argentina. Argentina is in current. By doing that, we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation. But also by doing this, we are lowering the growth rates that show us constant. For instance, net profit instead of growing 9%, with Argentina in constant is growing 13%. NII is growing 20% instead of 16%, fees would be up 8% instead of 5% or total revenue would be increasing 12% instead of 9%. So we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking into account the impact of hyperinflation in Argentina. Now let me go to the main components of the P&L. As H\u00e9ctor said, we are reporting exceptional results for the first quarter. We are starting to see the benefits of our transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in retail and consumer and obviously, the very positive momentum we are experiencing in both Europe and Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 10%. Actually, 12%, if we only look at customer revenue, supported by strong NII, highest quarterly fee income in our history, while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Net operating income grew 11% year-on-year. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, supported by strong labor markets and risk management provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries, but we see no asset quality pressures anywhere. Additionally, we had a higher impact from taxes year-on-year, driven mainly by stronger performance in Brazil, where we have a higher effective tax rate than the group average. And also the fact that the temporary levy in Spain is not tax deductible from the corporate tax level. The full impact of this tax levy in Spain is accounted for in the first quarter and is 50% higher than last year. As you can see on the right-hand side, excluding this impact, profit would have increased 14% year-on-year or 9% quarter-on-quarter, and Q1 would have been another record high. Let me break down the P&L. Starting with revenue. There was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of our total revenue and explain almost all of the growth in the quarter. Year-on-year, revenue increased 9% with all businesses and regions contributing. This growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which is growing at double-digit rates with good performance in net interest income and fees across regions and consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses and a strong volume growth in Europe and Latin America. CIB also had a great performance as revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter backed by outstanding performance in the US. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and in asset management. Payment is also showing very good underlying trends year-on-year as both PagoNxt and cards are growing if we exclude the onetime positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year, as Hector has explained. Finally, at the corporate center, high liquidity buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which contributed -- which continued growing in the quarter, particularly in retail and consumer, representing 82% of group's NII, it went up 16% year-on-year on the back of active price management in retail in Europe, especially deposits and also in Mexico and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates in South America, both in retail and consumer and the fact that now forward rate curves in Europe are a bit higher. In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year even if we exclude Argentina. This was mainly explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of our -- of the interest rate environment. These gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs, which we were able to contain thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration in Europe, and deposit re-pricing downwards in Brazil, leading to a notable margin expansion. The only country where we saw a slight increase in EBITDA in the quarter towards the UK. Going forward, we expect the positive momentum in Europe to continue, we expect to benefit from the interest rate cuts in South America, and we expect an improvement in our consumer business throughout the year, boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination. As a result, very good NII outlook for the year. In the context of low fee income growth in general because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity, we generated record net fee income of \u20ac3.2 billion in the quarter. Even if we exclude Argentina, growing strongly quarter-on-quarter despite the strong seasonality in payments in the fourth quarter. We also delivered solid growth year-on-year, supported by most of our businesses with retail growing 9%, driven mostly by higher activity in Brazil, outstanding performance in consumer fueled by insurance. CIB also growing from very high levels in the first quarter of last year, especially in the U.S. on the back of our strong dynamics in DCM and customer-related markets activity. Wealth also had a great performance, particularly in private banking, higher volumes in asset management, and protection businesses -- business performance in insurance. Payments was impacted by the usual seasonality from Christmas and Black Friday in the fourth quarter and the aforementioned one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter of 2023 in Brazil. In terms of efficiency, significant improvement in our ratio to 42.6%, which remains amongst the best in the sector. As we have already mentioned, structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms of operational leverage, especially in retail and consumer as costs remained stable at around \u20ac6.5 billion for the last three, four quarters. Average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint, dropping from 12% a year ago to 4% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real terms despite the lagged effect of higher inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. By business, costs remain well under control in retail, consumer, and wealth, which represents 75% of our total cost base. However, total cost rose 5%, reflecting our strategy to reinforce our CIB franchise and develop global payments platforms. We expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even more evident in the coming quarters and years. Credit quality, as I have mentioned, no signs of any pressure. In terms of quality -- credit quality, which remains robust with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint, in line with our expectations. By global business, credit quality remained stable at low levels in the quarter in retail, which represents 50% of the group's loan loss provisions with some underlying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved in Spain, remained at very low levels in the U.K., while Mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations. In consumer, what represents around 36% of group's loan loss provisions, cost of risk normalized to 2.12%, also in line with our expectations, but still below the historical average, both in DCB Europe and in the U.S., which is still 5 percentage points below 2016 levels. Going forward, we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around 1.2% in 2024, a strength in consumer and Mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in retail, especially in Brazil, improving mostly in the second half of the year; Spain will be stable; and in the U.K., that will also remain at very low levels. Closing with capital, our fully loaded capital ratio remained at a very comfortable level of 12.3%, backed by a strong capital generation and significant risk-weighted asset mobilization. This quarter, we generated 32 basis points organically after having absorbed 5 basis points due to the temporary levy in Spain and an increase in risk-weighted asset density related to a change in mix. We recorded 22 basis points charge from -- for shareholder remuneration, in line with our 50% payout. There are also 24 basis points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of CIB models, which is expected to be temporary and revert next year with the implementation of Basel III. Finally, there was a 14 basis point positive impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of available-for-sale portfolios. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book, return on risk-weighted assets of 2.8% in the quarter, well-above that of our back book and higher than last year's. We created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment. Last year, we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to \u20ac30 billion in risk-weighted assets at the cost of capital of around half of that of the new origination, our target this year is to do even more. That's all from my side, H\u00e9ctor over to you."

        "text": "Thank you, Jos\u00e9. First of all, a quick reminder. We continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025. Thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with, first, a strong and increasing organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans. Second, we continued improving our profitability. Investor Day target, just to remember you, was 15% to 17% RoTE. And by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 14% value creation. And a summary to finish off. Q1 2024 was another strong quarter, supported by recurrent customer revenue growing high single digit, backed by a strong performance in all our businesses and regions. Our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model is driving efficient improvement and profitable growth, which is essentially evident in retail and consumer. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder value creation. This is very strong Q1 2024, we are confident that we will achieve our 2024 targets, as well as those we gave on our Investor Day in 2025. First of all, it's important to acknowledge that it's supported by our global businesses as we continue executing on one transformation. From a revenue perspective, we expect good NII performance in the year. This is based on, first, the positive momentum in Europe, which will continue at least in all of the quarter; second, enjoying the benefits from the interest rate cuts in South America; and third, the significant improvements in consumer boosted by the high new business profitability. The benefits of the operational leverage from one transformation program are expected to become even more evident during the rest of the year and well into 2025. Cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our expectations in the context of strong labor markets. As we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, the group's RoTE improved from 16.2% in Q1 2024, and we expect it to remain at 16% in line with our targets for 2024. All-in-all, our TNAV plus cash dividend is growing double digit, well on track to meet our target through the cycle. And now we would be happy to take your questions. Thank you."

So I wonder if you can update on your guidance for 2024 and detail the main assumptions behind it? And then how big a lift shall we expect in 2025 with the current yield curve? Also connected to this, the NII in the corporate center because the Spanish liquidity, I understand is remunerated here. So you can provide any comment to better assess the combined NII performance of Spain and the corporate center? And my second question is on capital after the 20 bps front loaded in first quarter for Basel IV. You mentioned in the past 30 bps left for January 1, 2025. So, meaning that you're already in line with the 12% pro forma post Basel IV. I wonder if you can update on this Basel IV regulatory impacts and other headwinds that we should expect? And where do you see your CET1 target in the context also of potential countercyclical buffers? Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Francisco. Let me explain exactly how do we see NII basically going in Spain. First of all, I mean, we see really good trends as you can see in retail due to the fact that we had really good growth in clients. I basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well, which we can basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients. It's important to say, and as I commented, that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to go. All the different business basically are doing quite well. As you can see, I mean, CIB is also performing quite well and the commercial business, too, and that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong 2024 all along in NII in Spain. In terms of the corporate center of what we see there on capital, I will ask basically Jose to give you the details."

        "speaker": "Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Cantera ",
        "text": "Thank you, H\u00e9ctor. Let me complement those comments. With the current forward rates, as H\u00e9ctor said, we see NII still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NII in Spain year-on-year, up low single digits. Remember that we expected NII in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in 2024 relative to 2023 with the current level of interest rates and forward rates, we see actually NII up in Spain year-on-year. In the Corporate Center, the first quarter is a bit abnormal, because we increased the hedging. We always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies. So I would expect the NII in the corporate center to gradually perform better, as future charges might be lower. Capital, Basel III. Let me make a general comment before I go into Basel III. There are a few elements -- well, several elements of uncertainty to European bank's capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters. The first is the U.S. has stated that they will not implement FRTB for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed Basel III rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. impacts. It is therefore very likely that both the FRTB and the Basel III rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage. It is not unlikely though that the commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of FRTB beyond January 1, 2025. However, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EBA needs to publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive -- capital directive. The EBA mandate is that in aggregate, all these -- the impact of all these papers must be neutral. But that doesn't guarantee that everyone and all these papers will be neutral themselves. This is the case, for instance, in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation. So all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimate for a very low day one impact of Basel III. So on January 1, the impact will be very low, zero to 20 basis points, and the fully loaded impact of between 30 to 50 basis points as we had commented before. So all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully loaded and phase-in once Basel III comes into effect. Countercyclical buffers. If in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk-weighted assets for the group. So any countercyclical buffer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50 it will be 12 basis points. If it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember, however, that from the time countercyclical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, there is a one-year lag. So any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year. It most likely will not impact 2025 capital requirements or they might impact year-end capital requirements in 2025, but not 2024."

The first one is on fees and fee generation in the quarter was quite good when looking to the coming quarters, what should we expect? Should we expect an acceleration of growth, driven by the good performance of CIB and Wealth Management insurance? Linked to this, I just wanted to see if there was any kind of one-off in the fees reported in the US, which jumped out quarter-on-quarter? The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate. And I just wanted to better understand what is the organic generation that you expect, I mean, as profitability improves, I feel that 10 to 15 bps is to be a bit low and you could probably generate a bit more or you would be able that to additional growth of our revenue base? Thank you."

Retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth, and it's basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and it's continued to do so, okay? You talk about the outstanding performance in CIB, that's 39% quarter-on-quarter. That's record revenue. This is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking, and there is no one-offs whatsoever in all the bank and in the U.S. It's basically business as usual and client flow from all accounts, okay? In wealth, we have also a very strong recurring activity in private banking. Also, we have higher volumes in asset management. And as well in the insurance business, we have seen a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that could help us out, okay? Consumer growth came mainly from Europe, okay? Volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe, and that shall help us as well. For 2024, we expect that trying to continue, as I told you, the fees are growing to reach mid to high single-digit. This is not an official target, but I can tell you that this is a trend that we see. This is mostly driven by the increase in CIB with the connectivity we have on wealth and payments and the growth in customer and transactionality. And most of the global businesses, we experienced double-digit fee growth in 2024 as we changed the business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account. It's very important that you understand what the model change is about. The model change is exactly about that. When I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients, this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we used to do in the past, okay? So, this is the basic change that we're executing today. So, you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of RWAs. With that, then I'll leave on the capital question to Jos\u00e9. Thank you."

We think we can keep risk-weighted assets fairly flat throughout the year, very, very low risk-weighted asset consumption because of the asset rotation initiatives that I mentioned. So, we should be able to have available for capital growth or regulatory headwinds, 15 per quarter the next three quarters. We still expect 20 to 30 basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for intangible management. So, net-net, with all of that, we still see 12.40 to 12.50 capital ratio by year end."

I realize there's no one-offs, but there may be seasonality? And can you repeat, you mentioned in Brazil, there was a renegotiation [indiscernible] I suspect that's why the fees have been lower, but if you could repeat that? And then the second question on NII. If you think through your comments on Spain, could I invite you to comment on Brazil and U.K., Brazil, obviously, very, very strong. It sounds like above the sensitivity you gave. Can -- do you expect -- what do you expect for the full year? Can it continue strong? And on UK, just when you think it can bottom? Thank you."

It's -- and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend. But as you know, that will all depend, I mean, how the market basically goes. But what I can tell you is that, the market is basically helping us out in that sense, and we will continue the trend if the market helps us. I'm sorry to repeat myself. In what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly you were saying, I mean, we had a one-off in payments that we had on the first quarter last year, which is not going to repeat itself. It was a big one, \u20ac195 million. So that basically slowed us a little bit, but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice. And I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth. And what I saw towards the end of the year, we see that if we continue that trend, that should help as well in insurance, in retail, so that will help us as well, okay? So I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that will continue to be strong. In terms of NII in Spain, Brazil and the UK, I could tell you that the indications we gave at the beginning is that with -- if the rates continue the way they are, this is going to give us -- I mean, first of all, see the volume growth that we're having in Brazil. So it's important to understand, and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly. And NII, in Spain, already Jose gave you a very good explanation, but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one. In terms of the UK, let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is. I mean, as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving, okay? The business, as you know, is very focused on retail. It's our core business, and we continue to improve their offering and the user experience. And we also are gradually continued growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail, okay? NII is down 4.4% in the quarter, similar just as I said, to the UK banks. And all the big ones have the similar trends of us, but we're taking actions to improve the NII. We're doing pricing changes. We announced both deposits and lending in the first quarter, and we are trying to use the betas and to manage them in a much better way. And asset mortgage spreads also are improving in the UK market, so that shall help us towards the next quarter. So it wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year. And then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that. That is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK. And the cost of risk is basically very well -- I mean, under control, and we expect it to be very much there. So with that, I'll ask Jose to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NII."

That means that year-on-year, we should see mid- to high double digits teens, not double digit teams, growth in NII. And in the UK, the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter. We've -- as Hector said, we've seen a pickup in volumes, margins, customer margins were flat quarter-on-quarter. So year-on-year, for the full year, NII down a little bit, mid-single digits, something like that. With all of these estimates, we believe NII for the group should grow quarter-on-quarter this year. So sequentially, we should see higher NII every quarter this year. And year-on-year, customer revenue, we've talked about fees and the strong performance in fees. So year-on-year, customer revenue should be very close to double digit in 2024 relative to 2023."

I don't think I have seen the slide you used to have in last quarter around the aspirational 15% RoTE target in the US. So if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number, and what are the main drivers and the main initiatives I've seen Openbank being launched in the US recently. So just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that? And the second one is on the asset quality in the US. I mean, you used to give some information around PV's charge-offs in the past as well. I don't think I've seen those actually. So forgive me if I have missed them, but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US asset quality, delinquencies on the auto businesses are developing from here? Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Ignacio. Okay. In terms of the US, a particular thing is, first of all, I mean, as you know, we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses, which is consumer on one side, which is a business that we have at scale. We have also expanded a little money on the CIB side to be for our presence there. And we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today, we are just basically for non-US alliance. So those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% RoTE. And I believe it's going to be more towards the end of 2025 that we're going to be able to get there, but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that. In terms of the asset quality in the US, let me explain you exactly how the trend is, first of all, we still see a strong labor market in the US. And the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well. What has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in delinquencies above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID, that remember pre-COVID was about 90%. We went all the way down to 59%. Today is more around close to in between mid-60s, and it continues to be like that. So as you can see, our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels, and we expect it to continue to be like that towards the end of the year. We don't see any surprises and the way the portfolio has behaved. So circa around 2% that's where I see it. And now what we have done also is very much focused on profitability. We've been very strong on capital allocation. And we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good. And also, we are focusing on credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40% prime and near prime, okay? So you see the portfolio very stable and in that level."

Does it still hold your costs were up 5% in constant euros, 7% in current euros, so how should we think about that as cost guidance that you previously gave? And then my second question would be on rates sensitivity to 100 basis point change in rates, if you could just remind us what that means for Spain, Brazil, the U.K., U.S., all the core markets? And also, if you have any hedging in place to reduce that rate sensitivity? And then my final question would be on Slide 5, you say that your -- you only got 5 million new customers year-on-year. But at the Investor Day a year ago, you targeted, I think, 75 million new customers. Just like a strategic question, maybe it doesn't make it different if you only have 5 million new customers or does it make it difference? And how do you plan to get the 75 million new customers that you guided for at the Investor Day a year ago? Thank you."

        "speaker": "H\u00e9ctor Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Sofie Let me answer you the last question first. I mean, what we've been doing here is basically, we are cleaning up a lot of our customer bases. And even though we are growing quite hard, we've been cleaning up that and basically that's, at the end, what's going to be telling -- I mean, moving up towards the number of customers that we are able to include. We're going to be working on that. And -- but I mean, the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses. In terms of the cost, I was basically -- as I explained to you, I mean, this remained fairly stable for the third quarter in a row, okay? As you have seen, that's close 1% quarter-on-quarter. If you exclude Argentina, that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down. That's plus 2% year-on-year in real terms, and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 2024 target of below 43% cost to income. And I believe that we're going to be able to get to that. Cost efficiencies are just coming from operating leverage through simplification of products. If you see the amount of product that we have simplificated, we have 10,000 different products, today, we're down to 7,500 and automation, which is a very important part. And I was explaining you in the change of model how we're changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs. And this is something that, in time, will help us to control costs much better than we've been doing, okay? That's basically the efficiency gains. If you look at that simplification gave us 17 basis points year-on-year of savings. Automation is helping us out, 58% of product services are now digitally available, okay? That's 2 percentage points in help versus December 2023. And if I can tell you an example, the U.S. have captured \u20ac10 million in efficiencies just in Q1 alone. And that's \u20ac210 million since we started the process in 2022, and that's just in consumer and retail. So, it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a really cost-cutting exercise for the creation of the single model and with several other benefits, and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank, okay? So, to reiterate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost-to-income for the rest of the year."

So, in the U.S., it's plus/minus \u20ac150 million; in Brazil, plus minus \u20ac150 million. In the UK, it's plus/minus \u20ac200 million; but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros, in Spain, in particular, significantly. Let me make first 1 particular comment about the UK. Our structural hedge in the UK is \u00a3113 billion with an average duration of \u00a32.4 billion. It was \u00a3106 billion in December. So \u00a3113, 2.4 years, average duration. And in Spain, we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions, basically originating -- adjusting the origination buying ALCO portfolio. We now have \u20ac30 billion ALCO in Spain at an average duration of between six to seven years at 3.25% yield. And we have been also writing some hedges. The result of that is that of the \u20ac240 billion risk-weighted assets, \u20ac250 billion average earning assets, we have in Spain, 60% is floating, 40% is fixed.

Obviously, the decision to this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates, curve rates, interest rate curves have picked up a bit, so that has allowed us to earn higher NII and also more time to hedge the positions.

Can you be more specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the 2025 RoTE outlook? Second question, if you could give us a target for 2024, group costs in absolute million? And where do you see them going in 2025? Finally, a quick one on the insurance business, the new banking package improved, the treatment of insurance activities inside banks. Could you consider internalizing this business? Thank you."

And as we said correctly in our Investor Day, we said 15% to 17% towards 2025. And we are working towards that, and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it. But today, I reiterate to you that we're going to be at the 16% that we have set, okay? In terms of cost, what we have said is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income. If you see the numbers that we have been, we've been very disciplined in terms of -- and what we have said, I mean, if you said it, is you saw is quarter-on-quarter is around 1% top, and we're going to be very disciplined about it. And if you see the operational leverage that we have on the -- what I presented on retail, you see that the operational leverage is working like that, okay? So our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is. And I believe that the trend would continue like this. So I feel very confident on the way we're managing things. And I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flattish in terms of cost. The question of insurance is quite a good one. We love that business. We believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil, I could tell you, Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low. So we see huge opportunities on that, and we continue to better up our systems. For example, we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way. Today, average by market, we have 222 different products per market. The idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be much more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the clients exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend. So that's a huge opportunity, as you say. The other side of the coin is that we have JVs that in place on the long-term basis, mainly in Latin America and Spain and Portugal. And then we will continue to have them over the years because they are long term. I would love to internalize that business, what unfortunately is what it is. We have the JVs and we need to respect what we have there. But as you say, there's a huge opportunity in that sense, not just because of the change and sweets in regulation, but also because of the -- the advantages and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the low penetration in the different markets."

And you mentioned the delegated act provision for FRTB here in Europe. So just within your day one and fully loaded guidance, how much is FRTB and how much is all the rest of it, i.e., if we only get parts of Basel IV in January 1, 2025, and then FRTB follows on July 1, 2026, how much would that change the phasing of the capital headwinds you talked about earlier? And then second, on Argentina. So clearly, it has quite a distortive effect on the group figures. And then there's the associated cost of hedging, and it's below 5% of group earnings. So I just wondered whether you've reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina, I guess, especially in light of the announcement that one of your peers is exiting that market?

So if FRTB gets postponed, we will not have this 10 basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates. I hope this clarifies the matter."

In terms of Argentina, I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on in Argentina, basically can sustain what's going, and we're trying to be positive about what could happen, I don't believe that we have no downside or upside given the situation. So there are no plans to do anything at this point, and we'll just wait and we will continue operating our business. Our business is doing well. It's very good structured, is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration, in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients, fee generation.

And in terms of costs, we are looking at a cost growth, which is going to be around 2% this year, 2% to 2.5% this year. Going forward, as we've discussed, we are targeting flat costs in absolute terms going forward. That is going to be difficult. Obviously, we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment. We believe that -- well, it is a very ambitious target, but that's the internal target we have. We haven't given any guidance for 2025. But what I'm saying is that long, medium term, our target is to keep costs flat or down in absolute terms. We are not there yet in 2024, close. We think we could be closer there in 2025, but it's too early. We are still in early 2023 -- sorry, 2024. So, we'll give you this guidance in due course.

    "transcript": "Begona Morenes: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Banco Santander's Conference Call to discuss our Financial Results for the First Half of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website. I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Hector Grisi, and our CFO, Mr. Jose Garcia-Cantera. Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any questions you may have in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi Hector, the floor is yours.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Begona. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's presentation will follow the usual structure. First, we will talk about our H1 results in the context of our strategy. Then Jose will review our financial performance in greater detail. And then I will conclude with some final messages. As Begona said, we will then open the floor for your questions. The main highlights of our results in the first half of 2024 are the following. Q2 was another record quarter for Santander, which shows the strength of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reached \u20ac3.2 billion, that's 20% above Q2 '23, even after the impact of \u20ac450 million of one-time charges, net of taxes and minorities. Excluding them, recurring profit was \u20ac3.7 billion in Q2. Profit in the first half reached \u20ac6.1 billion, also a record high of 16%, supported by the strong cost of revenue growth in all regions and global businesses. We continue to accelerate H1 transformation to become simpler, more automated, and more integrated. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved by 261 basis points to 41.6%, the best in 15 years. And our return on tangible equity rose 137 basis points to 15.9%, or 16.3% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain. Finally, our solid balance sheet with a sound capital ratio, solid credit quality, and a strict capital discipline helped us reach strong profitable growth and shareholder value creation, with TNAV plus dividend per share increasing 12%. Let us stop for a moment in our income statement. As always, we represent growth rates in both current and constant euros. This quarter, there were no material differences between them. Since last quarter, we have reported variation in constant euros in all countries except Argentina, which is shown in current euros to mitigate the distortions from hyperinflation. In Q2, we have taken a prudent approach again and used an inflation-adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso, given the significant divergence between inflation and the official effects. Although it has little impact when comparing half-years, distortions are more significant when we compare with Q1. Let's look at the income charges. These were 210 additional Swiss mortgage provision in Poland, reaching coverage of 100%. \u20ac240 million from the write-down of our merchant platform in Germany and Superdigital in Latin America. That I will explain in more detail later on. Additionally, we have positive and negative one-offs impacts in Brazil, which do not affect profit and have been netted in the underlying P&L. The increase, as you can see, is a strong first half of the year, with solid commercial and business dynamics that already puts us ahead of our plan for 2024. As a result, we have upgraded some of our targets for the year. We have increased our revenue growth target to high single-digit with better NII and fee income. We have improved our efficiency ratio target to around 42% as accelerating one transformation leads to higher operational leverage. And we have raised our RoTE target to above 16% versus the previous 16%. We are also confirming the rest of our targets for the year. Cost of risk is expected to remain stable at around 1.2% on active risk management and strong labor markets. As a reference, year-to-date cost of risk was 1.17%, even with additional provisions that I just described in Poland. In capital, our CET1 ratio ended June at 12.5%, with a strong organic capital generation in line with our target to be above 12%, even after the Basel III implementation. One key transformation and the operational leverage it brings are behind the record performance, structurally improving both revenue and cost performances. Simplifying and automating processes, plus our active spread management, have already contributed 266 basis points of efficiencies since we started. Our global businesses continue to push a group's profitability and have delivered 87 basis points in efficiency gains. Finally, our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated 71 basis points in efficiencies so far. As we have often said, we are going back to basics, which supports value creation based on profitable growth. How? By focusing on offering customers the best products and user experience, and by obtaining the operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech. This is reflected in the performance of our global businesses. Our retail and consumer businesses efficiency ratio improved by 480 basis points and 270 basis points, respectively. In CIB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our expertise to grow in the U.S., maintaining a risk profile. Revenue grew 6%, another record, supported by strong performance and inclined flows in the U.S. Wealth continued its strong growth, improving efficiency and profitability and in payments, where we manage over 100 million cards in the group, we have significantly improved profitability. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we had a one-time fee from a commercial agreement in Brazil, excluding this impact, payments revenue would be 6% up and efficiency would have improved by 113 basis points, even after investing in the global platforms. In the coming five slides, I will review the advances on each of our global businesses. Let's start with retail, where we are working to become the number one bank for our customers. It is a great example of the benefits from one transformation. Innovation helps to offer the best customer experience. In Mexico, for example, our new digital processes helped onboarding time and led to a record 90,000 digital account openings just last month. A common operating model across our banks, automation and digitalization frees up time of our people to focus on commercial activities. Dedication of resources to non-commercial activities has dropped 8% versus last year. Deployment of our global platform has continued. In the U.S., it has been successfully completed. Within the group, Gravity is already operational in Spain, the U.K., Mexico, Brazil and Chile. And it is processing a number of transactions that is around 20% higher year-on-year. Financially, we are extracting the potential from today's favorable conditions in our footprint as we benefit from our diversification. We carefully managed margins in the higher for longer rate environment in Europe and keep capturing the benefits from our negative sensitivity to rates in South America and while we achieve strong operational leverage across the group. As a result, our profit grew 35% year-on-year, RoTE up from 430 basis points to 18.1% on the back of revenue up double digit on good performance of NII and fees with all regions growing, especially Europe and South America. Cost is well under control, down 4% in real terms, reflecting the structural benefits from our transformation and provision and cost of risk fairly stable at comfortable levels. In consumer, we strive to be the partner of choice for our customers. Our best-in-class global solutions are integrated into our partners' processes. For example, last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to pure direct auto players, which allows them to offer their customers the completion of their auto finance online end to end in very little time. We are progressing well in deposit gathering to increase NII stability and autonomous funding across the interest rate cycle. Deposits were up 14% year-on-year, supported by our digital solutions. We expect positive trends to continue helped by the launch of our deposit gathering platforms. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing cost to serve and improving profitability. In check-out lending, we recently launched installment loans with Apple in Germany through Zinia, which we are looking to spend to other European countries. Consumer had a great quarter on its operational leverage, which resulted in double digit growth in net operating income and a 4% profit increase in H1, with number one, strong revenue, driven by positive commercial dynamics with higher volumes, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good NII performance and 27% fee growth from insurance. Number two, cost falling 3% in real terms on the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans executed last year. And third, higher provisions, mainly Swiss franc mortgages and expected cost of risk normalization in Europe and the U.S. Volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident then that consumer will end '24 with profit growth of around double-digit even after the normalization of provisions. We are building a world-class CIB business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to grow profit, while maintaining the same low-risk profile. We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the U.S., building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across regions. Our collaboration in the U.S. with the rest of the group is starting to pay off with several firsts. For example, we made our first corporate share buyback for a U.S. company, and we were appointed global coordinator for a U.S. listed IPO for the first time ever. In Mexico, we are creating a significant partnership within the Mexico-U.S. corridor, leveraging our global markets and U.S. Pan built-out initiatives. And these are just a few examples from a long list. As a result, revenue in CIB in the U.S. rose 33% year-on-year. This strong growth reflects the benefits of our U.S. banking build-out initiative, which will become even more evident in the coming quarters. We continue to expand and strengthen our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as chemicals, technology, and paper and packaging. Our CIB business is capital-light, very much linked to customers, and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year. Our active capital management continues to support greater origination and high profitability levels. In essence, CIB had great results, increasing revenue in H1 6% year-on-year, even after record first half in '23, making H1 the best ever, with fees growing at double digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from customer flows. Moving on to wealth management and insurance, we continue to build the best private bank and insurance manager in Europe and the Americas. How? Number one, by improving customer relationships through the best service and right solutions, resulting in double-digit growth in private banking customers. Second, collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, which is a major driver for growth and allows us to capture network benefits. Collaboration fees increase by 12% year-on-year. Third, developing global platforms across all three businesses and digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. A good example of this is Autocompara, our auto insurance comparison engine that operates in six countries and which we are expanding to new segments and businesses. In summary, we are accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. Attributable profit rose double digits on strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment, with total fees from all three businesses growing at double digits and costs toppled slightly in real terms. Finally, efficiency improved 230 basis points year-on-year and RoTE rose to 350 basis points to over 80%. Finally, payments, where we have unique positions on both sides of the value chain. One, issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-wide. And second, in merchant acquiring. In merchant, we are the second largest acquirer in Latin America and a market leader in Spain and Portugal, with the right balance between growth and profitability. We are gaining market share in most markets, as we have strengthened Getnet's customer value proposition with new global solutions. An example is dynamic currency conversion in Mexico, which has helped Getnet to become second in Mexico with a 20% market share and a 47% EBITDA margin in Q2. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to PagoNxt global platform to leverage the group's scale. The transactions managed globally through PagoNxt payments surpassed $1 billion per year during the first half of this year, with 30% growth quarter-on-quarter. The rollout of Plard, our global cards platform, is on track. We continue to increase the number of debit cards managed in Plard at a good pace, and we are starting the migration of the debit portfolio. We plan to manage around 15 million cards through Plard in Brazil by year end. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded one-off charges in PagoNxt from the write-down of investments. One, is a discontinuation of our merchant platform in Germany we announced in June, as we are focusing on our current acquiring value proposition in our core markets, where we have a very competitive business. The other one is our decision to write-down Superdigital, a natural step to promote the use of common platforms across the group and maximize operational leverage. These decisions will enable a more stable and profitable business, reducing fixed costs going forward. Excluding these impacts, underlying performance was very positive. Profit in payments was up 30% year-on-year, on good revenue performance, costs falling in real terms while we invest in our common platforms, and sound credit quality in cards. PagoNxt EBITDA margin improved to 20%, one of the best among competitors. We expect the consistent execution of our strategy, efficiency, and CapEx optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. Today's results show that our strategy has enabled us to deliver outstanding profitability growth in H1, with double-digit shareholder value creation for the fifth consecutive quarter. RoTE was 16.3%, up 134 basis points year-on-year, reflecting the high levels of profitability at which we are originating new business. EPS rose to nearly \u20ac0.37, that's around 20% year-on-year, and we delivered 12% growth in shareholder value creation. Supported all by strong profit generation, our strict discipline in capital allocation, and share buybacks. We have repurchased around 11% of our outstanding shares in the last three years, returning around $6.5 billion through buybacks and providing a return on investment of 19% to our shareholders. I'll leave you now with Jose, to go into our financial performance in more detail. Please, Jose.\nJose Garcia: Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. Like always, I will go into a bit more detail about the momentum both in Europe and in Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 9%, with the highest NII and fee income in our history, and costs were down slightly in real terms. As a result, operating income was up 14%. Provisions increased even after including the 200 million increase in Swiss franc provisions that we took in the quarter. On the right-hand side, you can see the upward trend in profit quarter-on-quarter at 12%, which was driven by top-line growth with lower costs and provisions fairly flat, as I just mentioned. Let me now spend a couple of minutes on the reasons why we're starting to use a new inflation-adjusted exchange rate in Argentina rather than the official one. We have observed a significant divergence between the official exchange rate and inflation, and we have decided to follow a prudent accounting approach. The new exchange rate is the result of adjusting the official exchange rate with the differential between the inflation in Argentina and in the U.S. This is a very conservative approach and a much more conservative way of recognizing the actual value in euros of our results and our investment in Argentina. And this should mitigate the volatility that the currency might experience in the future, as you all remember was the case in 2023. Following these accounting rules, we have recorded the full Q1 and Q2 impacts from this adjustment in Q2, which does not significantly affect the year-on-year figures, but it has a significant impact and causes some distortions when we look at quarter-on-quarter. And I will try to show these differences in the coming slides. For instance, NII is dropping -- is down 4% in the quarter, but if we exclude Argentina, the group's NII would have gone up 2%. Something similar happens with fees. Instead of decreasing in the quarter, increasing 1%, they would have increased 3%, and costs would have been fairly flat. If this exchange rate does not materialize, we would revert this adjustment and account for the results that we are not recognizing today. But it looks to us that this is a prudent, more conservative way of recognizing our investment and results in Argentina. There was a strong total revenue growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue. This strong growth was primarily supported by retail. Retail accounts, as you know, for more than 50% of our businesses, and is growing at double digits, with very good performance in NII across regions, and fees also growing, especially in the Americas, and also consumer, which is reaching good profitability levels in new businesses, and strong loan growth in Europe and LatAm. Corporate investment banking also had a good quarter, as revenue reached an all-time high, both in the quarter and in the first half of the year, particularly in Spain, in the US, and in Mexico. Also double-digit growth in wealth, as Hector mentioned, driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and in asset management. Payments also performing very well. Particularly we exclude the one-time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of '23, you remember, which we explained, and Hector just mentioned, where we had a one-off from an agreement with Mastercard. And finally, the corporate center\u2019s higher liquidity buffer remuneration was offset by higher TLAC/MREL issuances, and the negative impact from FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued to increase in the quarter, if we exclude Argentina, particularly driven by retail, consumer, and CIB, which represent 95% of groups in NII. On the slide, you can see that we are, in this small box in red, putting the figure that we would have recorded if we had used the official Argentina exchange rate. So this is important, keep this in mind, and to show again that what we have decided to do is a prudent accounting of our profits coming from Argentina. NII rose 11% year-on-year, supported by all businesses and regions, on the back of very active price management in retail Europe, especially in deposits, also higher volumes and the benefits of negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, in consumer South America, in retail South America -- and in consumer, sorry, which is now very evident in Brazil, especially in Brazil and Chile, and very good levels of activity in corporate investment banking. In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, explained by higher yield on assets as we continue repricing our books, but also very good management of deposit costs, which more than basically outweighed the pressures that we are seeing. It's true that the margin is expanding, as you can see, we exclude Argentina, or if we had used the official exchange rate, so overall the margin management, pricing management on both the asset side and liability side is really strong. We see a slight deterioration, though, if we use our official exchange rate or our adjusted exchange rate, although it's not very significant in the quarter. Going forward, we would expect some margin pressure in Europe that will be more than compensated by positive contribution from the Americas and our consumer business. In the context of low fee growth in general across the sector as a result of subdued loan demand, we generated another record quarter in fee income at \u20ac6.5 billion with solid growth all across the five businesses. Retail increased 3%, basically driven by Brazil, North America and Poland, outstanding performance in consumer on the back of very strong insurance businesses. Corporate Investment banking also grew from already the very high levels in the first quarter -- in the first half of last year, especially in the U.S. Wealth, supported by very strong private banking activity and Payments that, as we mentioned, was affected by the one-time fee recorded in Brazil last year. Structural efficiency gains from our transformation program are very evident quarter-after-quarter. Cost income was 41.6%, the best level that we have reported for the last 15 years and one of the best in the sector is already better than the levels that we guided for 2024. Cost declined quarter-on-quarter were very flattish if we exclude Argentina, after having been stable for the last three quarters with revenue growing steadily quarter after quarter, improving an increase in operational leverage that we obviously expect to continue to have in the second half of the year and into 2025. Average inflation continued its gradual decline, down from 12% a year ago to below 4% this quarter. In this context, costs fell 1% in real terms year-on-year. Despite that, as you all know, we have some lagged effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. By businesses, costs remain well under control in retail, consumer and payments, which will represent 80% of our cost base. And 80% of the increase, as you can see on the bottom of the chart, came from CIB, reflecting our strategy to reinforce our corporate investment banking franchise. In fact, if we exclude these investment costs in the rest of the group, would have decreased 3% in real terms. Credit quality remained very much under control, obviously, supported by a stable economic environment and our active risk management all across the group. Cost of risk was 1.21%. Remember that we look at the last 12 months, if we look at the first half of the year, cost of risk was 1.17%, even including the increase in the provisions for the Swiss franc mortgage portfolio in Argentina. So we are very much on target to reach the 1.2% for the year and we reiterate that target. In the second half, we expect that trends in consumer and Mexico will be closer to more normalized levels, but this will be offset by a better performance in Retail Europe and South America. Turning to capital and closing my section here, our CET1 ratio remains at a very comfortable level, backed by a strong organic capital generation and significant risk-weighted asset rotation. This quarter, we generated 52 basis points organically, supported by our asset rotation initiatives to compensate organic risk-weighted asset growth. We recorded 25 basis points charge for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout. And finally, there was a 7 basis point negative impact, mainly related to intangibles, the valuation of available-for-sale portfolios and others. There were no significant regulatory impacts in the quarter. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation has resulted in a new book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.9% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above that of our back book at 16%. Our centralized asset management desk, we change at optimizing capital deployment is achieving outstanding results. In the first half, we disposed of an amount of capital equivalent of \u20ac30 billion in risk-weighted assets and the cost of capital of half of that of the new originations. In addition, the one-third of our balance sheet that matures every year is being substituted by the more profitable new businesses at this return on tangible equity of 23%. The combination of these actions explained the expanding profitability and the increasing capital ratio. Let me turn it now back to Hector for his conclusions.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Jose. As our results clearly show, we continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025 in our last Investor Day, thanks to our unique business model and execution of our strategy. With a strong and increasing organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans, further improving our profitability to above 16% and by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 12% value creation to our shareholders. We said it in our Investor Day, and I want to remind you again, we have entered a new phase of value creation for our shareholders. In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are very evident. The strong growth in revenue with flattish cost and around 20% growth in EPS and the best ever H1 profit with all-time high NII, fees and net operating income backed by strong performance in all our businesses and regions. Sustained progress in our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale is driving both higher revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have ever reported in the last 15 years. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder value creation. As a result, we expect to exceed some of our targets for '24. We are upgrading our revenue growth target to high single digits, efficiency to run 42%. And as we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, we are improving our profitability target to above 16%. Our focus at Santander is to be reliable in providing returns that compound on an always increasing quantum of tangible book value consistently and through the cycle based on both business and geographic diversification. The progress over the last 10 years to simplify and align our model in all our businesses and now deploy our own tech stack is already evident and now depends on execution to continue to deliver on our primary target of double-digit TNF plus EPS growth through the cycle. And now we will be happy to take all your questions. Thank you.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Jose and Hector. We can start the Q&A session now, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We already have our first question from Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSofie Peterzens : This is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So my first question would be on the risk transfers. Did I hear it correctly that you saw \u20ac30 billion of risk-weighted asset disposals in the quarter? And maybe you could just talk about the decline in risk credit asset. I see risk-weighted assets, especially being down around 2% quarter-on-quarter, in digital consumer buying minus 1% quarter-on-quarter. But in both entities, the loan book grew by 3% quarter-on-quarter. So how should we think about these SRTs or securitization? And what will be the revenue invest going forward from securitizing some of the loans. And also related to that, if you could just remind us on the regulatory capital headwinds coming in the second half? And then my second question would be on Ebury. There has been quite a few press articles suggesting that you're looking to potentially IPO Ebury. Could you just remind us what the tangible book value per share is for the -- or tangible book value for these businesses? How much revenue do you get from Ebury and what your kind of plans for Ebury is? Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Sofie. I mean, first of all, I mean, our policy basically has been to -- as Jose was explaining in detail to rotate the balance sheet as much as we can. This is basically a very important change for us given the high capabilities that we have to originate assets, okay? So this is basically helping us to rotate and also giving us a new, basically, I would say, a turbocharger in the sense that with every single time that we sell something, we basically reduce that capital, already deploy the capital within the organization at a much better price. So that's exactly what we're doing and rotating the capital in a much better way. As Jose was explaining you, we rotate a third of the balance sheet every year. And since we're very focused on profitability, we're actually reinvesting better and better, and that's actually a new way of basically managing the balance sheet of the bank. Then Jose can give you a little bit of the details in terms of what you were explaining about it. In terms of regulatory capital, as we told you, our guidance is basically to be above 12% after regulatory charges, et cetera. So we continue to basically hang on to that number, 12%, above 12% we believe. And as we -- and as I said -- and Jose basically reiterated, we're going to be above the 12% after Basel III as well. And in terms of the IPO of Ebury, we'll give you the details -- Jose will give you the details on that. Thank you, Jose.\nJose Garcia: Hi, Sofie. First of all, the \u20ac30 billion was risk-weighted assets in the first half. So more or less 40% of this is SRTs, but the rest is other types of transactions like asset sales, hedges, et cetera. The cost of mobilizing this \u20ac30 billion was around RoTE equivalent, okay? We always look at RoTE, but just to use the same currency everywhere in RoTE equivalent, the cost of mobilizing this \u20ac30 billion was slightly below 10%. And we reinvested the capital, as I said, at 23%. So there was at least 13 percentage points difference on this \u20ac30 billion in risk-weighted assets. \u20ac30 billion in risk-weighted assets is close to \u20ac4 billion in capital times this 13%. So on an annualized basis, we generated increased profits with the same capital of around \u20ac500 million. We expect to continue doing this. The demand for private credit is significant that we have a very busy second half of the year. It's difficult to replicate the same figure in the second half of the year because of holidays, et cetera, but we expect to mobilize much more than last year. And as you can see from the figures I gave you, this is very profitable. Capital headwinds this year, we still expect 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. Basel III, as Hector mentioned, fully loaded. And when we mentioned fully loaded, is fully loaded, even taking into account those impacts that come in 2029, we will be comfortably above 12%. And the day one impacts will be very relatively small, as we mentioned before. And in the case of Ebury, we're always looking at ways of managing the capital and maximizing capital usage. So there were some news that we are contemplating an IPO in Ebury. Again, we are looking at all types of alternatives to maximize the capital. This is one of them. That doesn't necessarily mean that this will be executed. And again, this will be put as one of our several capital management initiatives that we have across the group.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Ulargui : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first one is on the revenue performance. We have seen a very good performance in Europe, probably a bit better than what we expected -- at least we expected at the beginning of the year. LatAm has been lagging a bit behind with Brazil being softer. How should we think about the revenue performance going forward in the second half? When you have upgraded the revenue guidance to high single digits from the 9% currently so we expect second half in line with these levels kind of getting a bit of a sense whether LatAm should offset the weakness of Europe that you have flagged Jose during the call in margin? And the second question is on the U.K. If you could elaborate a bit what should we expect in terms of NII for the UK, are stabilizing so try it getting your thoughts on the outlook for the UK? Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Ignacio. I mean, first of all, let me tell you, as Jose said, revenue has been very strong, much stronger than we believed at the beginning. Rates have helped, but also the good performance of our different businesses. As you know, we're very focus on profitability in the way we're restructuring things and that basically is paying off, right? I believe that, I mean, revenue will continue basically to give good results. I don't see that LatAm has a weakness. I see that actually, LatAm is going to be doing very well in the second half. And you can see also very good results coming out of what we're doing in retail in Brazil, okay? And also Chile is doing quite a good performance. Mexico, basically on retail, we're changing the mix, and that's why you see the flat NII on there, but I mean we will continue to give very good results. So we expect a very good second half of the year in terms of revenue. And in that sense, on basically what you were asking about the UK, UK was pared a better second half. First of all, we see that the market is a little bit more rational. Competition has been much rational than we saw during the first quarter. Second quarter has stabilized. We also -- some of the strategies I have done in terms of betas are paying off, okay? So I believe that all in all, UK will have a much better second half of the year than we have seen. In terms of detail, basically is more rational behavior, as I told you, fees are not going to be doing that well due to the switcher campaign that we structured and -- but benefits will come over in the third and fourth quarter, much better than the way we basically saw it. And what you're going to see is also a very good cost control because we have cost control initiatives coming into the U.K., which are going to make the business perform much better than we saw. I don't know, Jose would like to complement a little bit on the revenue side, but...\nJose Garcia: I think I'm sure that you will ask about -- you mentioned that revenue in Europe is better than you expected. At the beginning of the year, we guided for a drop in NII in the Eurozone. We now see NII in the Eurozone, particularly in Spain, Portugal, et cetera, up mid-single digits. Obviously, rates are higher for longer, so much better performance in NII. We have hedged a substantial amount of our balance sheet in the Eurozone, basically through the ALCO portfolio, hedging the assets, particularly mortgages and also swapping our fixed liabilities into variable liabilities. And it means that the sensitivity of our NII in Europe going forward is going to be significantly lower than we had before. So as Hector mentioned, we expect fairly stable, maybe slightly down NII in Spain in the second half of the year and next year. But at the same time, we continue to see good momentum coming from South America, Brazil and particularly Chile. So we are constructive on the future evolution of NII and revenue in the second half.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAlvaro Serrano: Hi, good morning. Can I ask a couple of follow-ups on -- just wanted to confirm the comment you've just made around mid-single digit in Spain NII? That implies, I think, almost 9% production half-on-half, which is feels a bit substantial. So I don't know if I've done my math very quickly wrong or if you can sort of add a bit of color on that. And then on the performance and fees in the U.S., could you give us a bit of color on the obviously very strong performance. But if you can maybe sort of give us some kind of color on split on, is it ECM/DCM, just perform an opinion of how sustainable it is going forward. If I can slip in a third, you mentioned over 12% capital, but I thought the target was 12.5% at the end of the year. So can you just confirm that's the case and we should still expect the 20, 30 basis points regulatory headwinds? Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Alvaro. First of all, let me talk about capital. In capital, we have always said we're going to be above 12%, okay? And that basically has been the guidance. We're at 12.5% right now. And we said -- as Jose basically reiterated that we're going to be above 12% even after Basel III fully loaded, okay? That's exactly the guidance. In terms of performance in the U.S. fees, okay, the majority is basically the CIB business. CIB is the one that is driving and also a little bit in terms of good performance in retail that we're having a little bit also in the U.S., but CIB is the main driver, okay? It's been growing -- it grew 38% year-on-year, 1.3% quarter-on-quarter. As you know, CIB business is cyclical. So we have pretty good mandates. The business is basically doing well and also a very good connection in between -- what we're doing with the U.S., as I explained during the presentation, with the business in Latin America and the business in Europe. What's happening, and let me explain a little bit is some of the businesses that we used to do in terms of DCM that we wouldn't get because we wouldn't be seen as a dollar house, we are becoming one, and you see us top three in the league tables right now in Latin America, doing dollar transactions, not just to the corporates, but also to the governments. I mean, when UMS did their transaction at the beginning of the year, \u20ac7.5 billion, we were one of the principal book runners in the transaction. So you're starting to see that because of the beef up that we did in the U.S. So that's starting to pay off. I believe that with the four teams that we added, I think it's going to complement the rest of the business and will continue driving fees up, but let's see what happens with the cyclicality of the business. On the other side, retail is also performing well in fees, and we believe that it continues to do so over the rest of the year. In terms of what we gave -- in terms of Spain, okay, performance, loans are starting to reprice lower at lower rates, but deposit betas are behaving very well. This is helping contain the cost of deposits. Also, as Jose explained you in detail, ALCO volumes are hoping and the lower cost of the hedging, which were not in place before and now are in place. So that's going to help us. NII, as Jose said, is reaching to speak, but I expect NII to grow mid-single digit in '24, better performance than we expected at the beginning of the year. It's also because of the higher -- for longer rates environment that we're experiencing, okay? I don't know, if Jose would like to add something?\nJose Garcia: Yes. In terms of details, Alvaro, I mean, it's first half against first half, NII in Spain is up 15%. So if we grew 0 in the second half, the year-on-year would be around 7%. So I don't understand where you get the minus 9. If we go quarter-on-quarter, NII in Spain was started in the third quarter of last year, 174, fourth quarter 174. First quarter of this year, 182, second quarter 184. We would expect the 184 to be the peak and then slightly down in the second half, probably to very, very similar levels that we had in the second half of last year. And we expect to be able to keep that same level in 2025. In terms of capital, 20 to 30 basis point headwinds, taking into account that we generate 20 to 30 basis points BAU, you should expect our capital ratio to be basically at these levels by year-end. The guidance of 12% is post Basel III fully loaded.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Marta Sanchez Romero from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMarta Sanchez Romero : Thank you very much. I've got a couple of follow-ups on the U.S. So you're still struggling to deliver positive jaws. When do you think things will turn around there? Do you think that we will see positive jaws in the second half of the year? In the U.S. as well, your P&L still remains pretty supported by tax credit. Can you help us understand how the tax line will look like in the next few quarters? And then if I may ask, do you think the new reporting is helping investors understand Santander better because judging by your low PE, I think not. So I would like to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Marta. Okay. Let me explain you a little bit what's going on in the U.S. If you look at by business, you're going to see that retail is actually having lower cost than you used to have because of the transformation even with the strong investment we're doing in transformation. But we have done a really -- good cost reduction, and we believe we're going to perform better. Their jaws are negative due to the fact that we're investing in CIB. And CIB, as you understand, I mean, cost a lot to do it. So if we're going to have a second half that is better, it's going to start looking better, but it's going to depend on the cyclicality of the CIB business and some of the still people that are coming into the team that will start to come in, in the next few months. As you know, there is a period of garden leave et cetera. But the main reason is the investment we're doing in CIB, which by in any way is not creating a big investment bank or anything like that. This is basically, as we said, complementing the rest of the business that we have. Our size is not going to be huge. It's the size of a really small boutique, but it's helping us out to beef up and to help us in the remainder of the business. And you can see fees are starting to basically be up due to that fact, okay? In terms of the P&L, it's at easy to understand. The DTAs are basically what we said last year when we started doing the electric vehicles. I mean we signed contracts with some OEMs that are generating the DTAs. And that's why you see that the P&L is affected by that, and it's going to continue due to the fact that we will continue to be absorbing, I mean, that volume. So we have now three things, and this is basically leases on electric vehicles that are creating the DTAs in the U.S., all right? And you're going to see that throughout the year. In terms of the new reporting, it's very important to understand what we're doing. The new reporting is helping us a lot in the way we are managing the business on a day-to-day basis, okay? Because it's making us work together, is making us spend a lot less. In the past, for example -- and let me give you a really stupid example. I mean we used to have 10, 11 different apps in our 10 different banks. Right now, we're just having one app being deployed in all the countries. For example, one app is being deployed. Today, it's being deployed in all of Europe. The last deployment we did was the U.K. and they were deploying Brazil and then we will -- we are deploying also the U.S. So what happens is basically, you use the same around 80/20, and that's the goal that we're basically going through, investing jaws ones and those 80% common, 20% customization for each country. So that basically will enable us in the future through these global platforms to work much better in a much cheaper way. We gave you a pretty good example in what we're doing in acquiring. When the acquiring platform was deployed in Mexico, it took us in 18 months to number two, and you saw the results that I explained, I mean, how EBITDA is growing. And I showed you in the presentation that is helping us quite a lot in terms of positioning ourselves to be very competitive and with really high margins in every single market. And jaws 1 platform, the one that is being deployed. Now this platform is being deployed down to Chile, is being deployed to Argentina, and they will -- we will deploy it in Europe in the near future. So this is basically helping us to work together and to manage the business in a much better way. Then in terms of how do you see the businesses and the way they're reporting, I mean you're going to start getting used to it because it's going to be a lot easier for you to understand every single business in the way we're managing it. We're reporting now, as you can see, the operational leverage that we're getting by working together in which revenue is going up, cost is staying stable and is giving us a really profitable run. So it's very important that you understand that. Also, let me give you a great example. In CIB, where we have been working together for a long time, the same factories that we use for Mexico, Brazil, Spain or the U.K. are completely the same and it's the same product, and we just made them once. So that basically tells you how we're going to be able -- I mean we have been able to make it a really profitable business with growing revenue every single year and with profitability at around 19% that I gave you. So this is exactly the points that we're doing, and I believe that this will enable us to give a lot more value to our shareholders. There is no way we're going to give you more value if we don't work together and do things in a much cheaper way.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can I have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.\nFrancisco Riquel : Yes, thank you. So two questions for me. The first one is on NII in Brazil. You still maintain the guidance of growth in the high teens for the year. Mid-teens would imply a quarter-on-quarter fall during the second half, if you think this could be the case or not? I mean, because selling rates have been expectations of cuts have been pushed out. So if you can comment on the main drivers of the NII in the coming quarters and also update on the sensitivity of the NII to select rates in Brazil? And the second question is about NII in the U.S. We have seen this is bottoming out in this second quarter, but they have also seen the deposits falling for a couple of quarters now. So you would need to pay up for deposit gathering in the second half of the year or not. In this context, if you can also comment on the plans to launch Openbank, shall we expect there? Because when I look, for example, at the digital consumer bank, the deposits are growing there by 20%, but net interest margin is still falling, despite the shift to retail deposits? So you can comment also on these NII trends here.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Francisco. Let me start with Brazil. First of all, as you have seen, I mean, very strong and solid numbers coming from Brazil. NII, once again, a very strong quarter, up more than 3% and it's up more than 22% in the year, okay? What's behind the performance is the combination of the healthy volume growth, the change in mix and lower rates, okay? It is true. First of all, rates outlook has changed. The market is expecting a smaller than initially anticipated rate cut by the year, by year-end, and this ultimately means that NII growth will be a bit less intense than what we thought at the beginning of the year. That's a fact, okay. Having said that, we still expect Brazil NII to grow in the mid-teens mark by the end '24, okay? It's a good performance that should continue in '25. And let me tell you that to take the opportunity that Brazil has delivered a 16% RoTE. We believe that the end of the year should end up between 16% and 17%. A strong profitability improvement is not just relying on NII growth, but on the good delivery on fees also, the cost contention that we have had and expected cost of risk is stable during the year. So I remember very optimistic in Brazil and the ability to continue funding the profitability, as you have seen. In terms of Openbank in the U.S., Openbank will come into the U.S. with the deposit gathering facility towards September, October, okay? We expect that to come. The first phase is the deposit gathering. And I believe it would be quite successful. We had a pretty good plan in place. And then we'll come -- and we'll be improving the platform as we see fit. In terms of deposits, the deposits -- the transactional deposits that SG&A has had remained stable during the year. What is -- what you have seen the movement in deposits in the U.S. is basically the deposits that we have in CIB, which are the ones that we decide on profitability, what's better for us or not. So sometimes because of profitability, we basically let them go and we move out if we see fit. So there is no problem into that, and we will continue to see that working profitability towards every business that we do.\nJose Garcia: One quick comment on DCB Europe margins and profitability. The new business we wrote in 2021 was extremely profitable. This was post-COVID, and we have historically high profitability levels. This year is going to stay -- this production is going to stay in our books for three years. So it's still in our books in 2024 and it will gradually disappear between '24 and '25. The new business that we are writing in 2024 is at RoTE's of around 20% RoTE was of 2.3%, 2.4%, which is much, much higher than '22 and '23 annual production. So you should expect in 2025, a very substantial pickup in profitability in margins and in profitability in Consumer Europe because of this in and out of the different productions and the fact that there was an abnormally high profitability in the year following COVID.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next Question from Alvaro Fernandez-Garayzabal from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlvaro Fernandez-Garayzabal : Hello, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions, I have two. First, we assume you're aiming for the upper end of your RoTE target for next year. So that is 17%, which implies a meaningful profit increase in '25 versus '24. So my question is, geographically, where is that earnings growth going to come from? And second, related to previous questions, we have seen revenues improving in the U.S. over the last couple of quarters, with volumes up, customer spread expanding and fees coming quite strong. So basically, how sustainable is this revenue pick up going forward? Thanks.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Alvaro. Let me start with the U.S. To tell you, I believe, I mean, the U.S. revenue is going to continue to do pretty well, but the profitability is always the most difficult in the second part because of seasonality in terms of what happens to us in provisions. So what you're going to see is revenue continue to go up quietly fairly strong. Let's see how we do in fees, as I said, due to the cyclicality of the CIB business, but revenues will be doing fine. In terms of the seasonality, let's see how we do in terms of the provisions, but we believe and the indication that we have had in terms of provisions show us that are coming better. The LTM numbers that we have in provisions for the U.S. are much better than last year. So it's looking well. And so the U.S. shall have a much better year than last year. In terms of the RoTE 17%, Jose, if you would like to comment?\nJose Garcia: Yes, I mean, obviously, we expect profitability to continue to increase on the back of increased -- Sorry what I was saying is that we expect our profitability to continue to increase on the back of higher operational leverage. Our transformation program is delivering very positive jaws that we expect to maintain, particularly in consumer and retail in 2025. The negative -- the sensitivity to rates in Europe has been much decreased, as I mentioned before, and we should have positive tailwinds coming from NII in South America, both Brazil and Chile. So definitely, operational leverage is we'll continue driving increased profitability. In terms of cost of risk, no signs of deterioration, and looking into the next few quarters, we see no signs that we will require to increase our provisions going forward. So if you put all of these together, again, this means that our profits should continue to increase going forward.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Benjamin Toms from RBC. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Toms : Good morning. Thank you both for taking my questions. The first one is on Brazil. You used a \u20ac350 million gain to top up your provisioning. I think that's one strategy you've adopted before, but how comfortable are you that you will not need to do further top-ups in Brazilian cost of risk going forward? And are the top-ups a catch-up? Or can we assume that the top-ups will mean a structurally lower cost of risk in Brazil in the coming years? And then secondly, in the U.K., in the deck, you mentioned that 100% of your hedge income is already locked in for 2024. This suggests that either you do not have any maturities this year or you pre-hedged some of your maturities. If you have been pre-hedging, what proportion of 2025 structural hedge maturities have you pre-hedged and what rate did you look in at given the swap rates have been volatile? And do you expect the tailwind from the structural hedge will overwhelm the headwinds on NII in the U.K. in 2025? Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you. Okay. Let me go to Brazil, okay? First of all, it's very important to tell you that increase in provision is exclusively linked to the loan growth that we have in the country, okay? Cost of risk, as you have seen, is flat quarter-on-quarter, 4.77% and credit quality in Brazil remains sound and solid. It's very important to understand that the recent vintages that we have are performing very well and no signs of deterioration. So it's performing than we expected. It's very important to understand that we're also changing the mix a little bit on the portfolio. Just to explain you a little bit, for example, credit cards where in '21, we were making around 800,000 to 900,000 credit cards per month. Today, we're just growing by 400,000 credit cards a month and just to our client base. So the important thing and the big change is exactly that we're not going to the open market, which was the 1 that hurt us quite a lot during '22 and '23. So that's exactly the change of mix that is helping us. Also, it's very important to understand that we're very focused on profitability, and we have been very opportunistic, and we used the proceeds of a corporate transaction to further reinforce the balance sheet at this point. And we reiterate that the '24 guidance of delivering is a flattish cost of risk versus '23, okay, excluding the one-offs. So that's what I see in terms of Brazil. In terms of the U.K., Jose, please?\nJose Garcia: Yes. So as you know, obviously, the strategy is to keep the structural hedge position in line with core deposits to protect the balance sheet ahead of decreasing interest rates. Following the recent increase in market rates and in order to protect the NII, we have accelerated the planned investments for 2024 amongst other measures. So the sensitivity we have today is to a 100% decrease in -- parallel decrease in rates in the U.K. Today is minus GBP 120 million compared to minus GBP 220 million a year ago. So roughly, we have half of the sensitivity today than we had a year ago. The current hedge -- structural hedge is GBP 114 billion, compared with GBP 106 billion in December. So this is related to my comment before. With the duration of 2.5 years in December, it was -- sorry, 2.5 years. In December, it was 2.4 years and the yield is slightly over 2%.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank BPI. Please go ahead.\nCarlos Peixoto : Hi, good morning. My first question would actually be a follow-up in Spain. I'm sorry to insist on this again. But if I understood correctly, and the message was that in 2025, NII should be roughly aligned with the second half of this year where you already expect NII to drop somewhat towards the mid-single-digit growth in the full year that you are mentioning? And then my second question was actually on the U.S. tax rebates that you have been booking. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on how the rebate works in the sense that -- or basically, for how long is it in place? Is it something that we should also witness next year? And also, is it this federal level rebate or something at the state level? And to what extent the potential changes in -- political changes in the U.S. could drive that to disappear or not. Just to have an idea on the time frame for which this is valid right now. Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Carlos. All right. I mean I think in the -- Jose gave a pretty good explanation of what's going on in terms of how do we see now things. It's important to understand what Jose explained you about what we're doing on the hedges, the ALCO position that we have, that will help us throughout the year. Even if the rates come down, I think we're probably in the best ever position in that sense. And even as we say, I mean, the NII would slightly come down over the second half. And then we'll see that we will have a pretty good run towards -- let's see how rates basically behave. But I don't know, Jose, if you like to complement, but it's basically...\nJose Garcia: No. It's exactly what I said. Carlos, it's exactly what you said. We expect NII to go down slightly in the second half of this year. The year-on-year growth, '24 against '23 will be somewhere between 5% to 7%. And then next year, NII should be fairly flat relative to the second half of this year, which means that NII should be down slightly low single digits. Because, again -- and this is using the forward rate curves today. So if this was to change, obviously, we would need to update these estimates. But using forward curve rates today, that's our best estimate for NII in Spain next year. And as Hector mentioned, this is thanks to the substantial reduction in NII sensitivity that we have conducted in the Eurozone in the last year, 1.5 years.\nHector Grisi: Carlos. Okay. On your -- on the U.S., let me walk you through exactly what happens. Okay. First of all, let me tell you that it's federal, okay? We don't know if this is going to be sustained. If there is a change of government in the U.S. or not. You -- I mean, I don't want to speculate on that one. Exactly what happens is every single time we do a lease on an electric vehicle, we buy the vehicle in the bank, okay? So what you see is basically a situation in which we own the vehicle. And then we get the cash back or -- sorry, the tax credit and you show the cash credit in 1 lump, okay, during the month in which we do that, right, to be exactly how it goes. So you don't see the impact in the revenue but the impact you see it in the taxes. So that's exactly how it works. I don't know if I'm being correct of -- I mean if I'm being clear in one, the way I'm explaining to you this, but it's exactly how it works, all right? So what we have done is that we have a program what we have signed with the OEMs that we're doing this for, it depends on the -- also the capacity that we have to absorb those ETAs because this is not, I mean, unlimited. This is not, I mean -- we have to have depends on the balance sheet that we have, and we have calculated the number exactly that we can absorb, and this is exactly what we negotiated with the OEMs. I know if you understood the question in the right way, but this is exactly how it works, okay? And we don't know if it's going to happen in the future or not, hopefully, continues to be like that.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Miruna Chirea [ph] from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst : Good morning, Hector. Good morning, Jose. Thank you for taking my questions. I just have a couple of follow-ups, please, on point we touched on before. Firstly, in the UK, your NII was slightly up quarter-on-quarter in Q2. So just wondering how you see it progressing from here? And is it fair to say that Q1 was probably the low point on NII and it should start building from here supported by the hedge and what is the shape of this into H2 and also into next year? Secondly, just a clarification on your U.S. business. You were talking about some seasonality into the second half of the year in provisions. Could you please explain what is driving this seasonality? And then lastly for Brazil. Also taking into consideration your comments about changing the mix of your business. When do you expect to see a full normalization in cost of risk and around what level would this normalization be? Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Thank you. Okay. So as I said in the UK, we see that we're going to have a second half better than the first half, okay? Market is more, more rational, both in the margins and in the betas. And on top of that, cost, as I said, is going to be slightly better than the first half of the year. Q2 in NII is showing signs of improvement, okay? And as I basically explained, and we see that betas are not going to go up so that basically will help us. In terms of revenue, we see mid-to single-digit decrease in NII, down mid-single digits versus last year and fees down low double digit due to the fact that I was explaining about what we're doing with the switcher campaign and the higher cash back. You're going to see that it's going to be much better in '25 because exactly we're preparing the bank towards that. Also, we're very focused on profitability. It's very important that you understand that, okay? We're not using capital below our cost of equity. So we're being very tough on that and that's exactly how we manage that. And then, Jose, I would like to...\nJose Garcia: A quick comment. The mortgage dynamics in the U.K. seem to suggest that margins in this business will pick up substantially from the fourth quarter of this year into next year, just as an additional comment. Brazil cost of risk, we still believe the cost of risk this year should be somehow below cost of risk last year. Remember that when you look at cost of risk quarter-on-quarter, it was a substantial increase in the fourth quarter when we look at year-on-year X the fourth quarter and we look at cost of risk for the full of 2024, we would expect to see an improvement in the cost of risk. So year-on-year because the fourth quarter will come out in the fourth quarter of this year, you should see the most significant improvement in cost of risk in the fourth quarter. And then provisions in the U.S. are normalizing. Cost of risk this year should be somehow around 2% or slightly below 2%.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. Can we have the last question, please?\nOperator: Last question from Alberto Negro [ph] from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I have just a few follow-ups. So the first one is on U.K. If you can give us more color on the contribution of the U.K. structure hedge in the second half of this year and in next year? And the second one is, again, on Brazil following your comment on the change of the loan mix. Should we expect normalization of the cost of risk in the next year and see an absolute decline of total provision next year? Thank you.\nHector Grisi: Okay. In terms of Brazil, we're changing the loan mix, but we are very flexible and very dynamic in the way we change the loan mix over there depending on what we are seeing and how the vintages are behaving, okay? So if we see that Brazil basically, and we're starting to see positive signs of how the mass market basically reacts, is inflation is coming down and we see the rates coming down. We might change the mix again, and we might be a little bit more aggressive. And I couldn't tell you up at this point, what are we going to do because we revised the strategy every single month of what we do and also the pricing okay? So I don't know what the mix is going to be in Brazil in '25, but I must tell you that we're working in a very dynamic way. It's a very dynamic market, and you need to be on top of it, all right? So I couldn't tell you at this point, but I mean, everything basically is -- and we do change the mix to sustain the cost of risk at the reasonable levels, and that's the intent that we have in order to manage that, right?\nJose Garcia: So U.K. NII, I think I gave you all the details to calculate that. I gave you the maturity, the rates, the amount and everything else. In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, rates this year are expected to stay at 10.5% by year-end, but to drop significantly next year and that should help. In addition to the structure of the balance sheet, lower rates next year in Brazil will help not only in terms of NII, but also cost of risk. It will be a gradual improvement. We need to see exactly how we will build the business in 2025 in Brazil, but definitely lower rates should help.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Jose. Thank you, Hector, and thank you all for your attendance. And if there are any further questions, Santander Investor Relations team, is always at your disposal for anything that you may need.",

        "text": "Thank you, Begona. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's presentation will follow the usual structure. First, we will talk about our H1 results in the context of our strategy. Then Jose will review our financial performance in greater detail. And then I will conclude with some final messages. As Begona said, we will then open the floor for your questions. The main highlights of our results in the first half of 2024 are the following. Q2 was another record quarter for Santander, which shows the strength of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reached \u20ac3.2 billion, that's 20% above Q2 '23, even after the impact of \u20ac450 million of one-time charges, net of taxes and minorities. Excluding them, recurring profit was \u20ac3.7 billion in Q2. Profit in the first half reached \u20ac6.1 billion, also a record high of 16%, supported by the strong cost of revenue growth in all regions and global businesses. We continue to accelerate H1 transformation to become simpler, more automated, and more integrated. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved by 261 basis points to 41.6%, the best in 15 years. And our return on tangible equity rose 137 basis points to 15.9%, or 16.3% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain. Finally, our solid balance sheet with a sound capital ratio, solid credit quality, and a strict capital discipline helped us reach strong profitable growth and shareholder value creation, with TNAV plus dividend per share increasing 12%. Let us stop for a moment in our income statement. As always, we represent growth rates in both current and constant euros. This quarter, there were no material differences between them. Since last quarter, we have reported variation in constant euros in all countries except Argentina, which is shown in current euros to mitigate the distortions from hyperinflation. In Q2, we have taken a prudent approach again and used an inflation-adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso, given the significant divergence between inflation and the official effects. Although it has little impact when comparing half-years, distortions are more significant when we compare with Q1. Let's look at the income charges. These were 210 additional Swiss mortgage provision in Poland, reaching coverage of 100%. \u20ac240 million from the write-down of our merchant platform in Germany and Superdigital in Latin America. That I will explain in more detail later on. Additionally, we have positive and negative one-offs impacts in Brazil, which do not affect profit and have been netted in the underlying P&L. The increase, as you can see, is a strong first half of the year, with solid commercial and business dynamics that already puts us ahead of our plan for 2024. As a result, we have upgraded some of our targets for the year. We have increased our revenue growth target to high single-digit with better NII and fee income. We have improved our efficiency ratio target to around 42% as accelerating one transformation leads to higher operational leverage. And we have raised our RoTE target to above 16% versus the previous 16%. We are also confirming the rest of our targets for the year. Cost of risk is expected to remain stable at around 1.2% on active risk management and strong labor markets. As a reference, year-to-date cost of risk was 1.17%, even with additional provisions that I just described in Poland. In capital, our CET1 ratio ended June at 12.5%, with a strong organic capital generation in line with our target to be above 12%, even after the Basel III implementation. One key transformation and the operational leverage it brings are behind the record performance, structurally improving both revenue and cost performances. Simplifying and automating processes, plus our active spread management, have already contributed 266 basis points of efficiencies since we started. Our global businesses continue to push a group's profitability and have delivered 87 basis points in efficiency gains. Finally, our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated 71 basis points in efficiencies so far. As we have often said, we are going back to basics, which supports value creation based on profitable growth. How? By focusing on offering customers the best products and user experience, and by obtaining the operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech. This is reflected in the performance of our global businesses. Our retail and consumer businesses efficiency ratio improved by 480 basis points and 270 basis points, respectively. In CIB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our expertise to grow in the U.S., maintaining a risk profile. Revenue grew 6%, another record, supported by strong performance and inclined flows in the U.S. Wealth continued its strong growth, improving efficiency and profitability and in payments, where we manage over 100 million cards in the group, we have significantly improved profitability. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we had a one-time fee from a commercial agreement in Brazil, excluding this impact, payments revenue would be 6% up and efficiency would have improved by 113 basis points, even after investing in the global platforms. In the coming five slides, I will review the advances on each of our global businesses. Let's start with retail, where we are working to become the number one bank for our customers. It is a great example of the benefits from one transformation. Innovation helps to offer the best customer experience. In Mexico, for example, our new digital processes helped onboarding time and led to a record 90,000 digital account openings just last month. A common operating model across our banks, automation and digitalization frees up time of our people to focus on commercial activities. Dedication of resources to non-commercial activities has dropped 8% versus last year. Deployment of our global platform has continued. In the U.S., it has been successfully completed. Within the group, Gravity is already operational in Spain, the U.K., Mexico, Brazil and Chile. And it is processing a number of transactions that is around 20% higher year-on-year. Financially, we are extracting the potential from today's favorable conditions in our footprint as we benefit from our diversification. We carefully managed margins in the higher for longer rate environment in Europe and keep capturing the benefits from our negative sensitivity to rates in South America and while we achieve strong operational leverage across the group. As a result, our profit grew 35% year-on-year, RoTE up from 430 basis points to 18.1% on the back of revenue up double digit on good performance of NII and fees with all regions growing, especially Europe and South America. Cost is well under control, down 4% in real terms, reflecting the structural benefits from our transformation and provision and cost of risk fairly stable at comfortable levels. In consumer, we strive to be the partner of choice for our customers. Our best-in-class global solutions are integrated into our partners' processes. For example, last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to pure direct auto players, which allows them to offer their customers the completion of their auto finance online end to end in very little time. We are progressing well in deposit gathering to increase NII stability and autonomous funding across the interest rate cycle. Deposits were up 14% year-on-year, supported by our digital solutions. We expect positive trends to continue helped by the launch of our deposit gathering platforms. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing cost to serve and improving profitability. In check-out lending, we recently launched installment loans with Apple in Germany through Zinia, which we are looking to spend to other European countries. Consumer had a great quarter on its operational leverage, which resulted in double digit growth in net operating income and a 4% profit increase in H1, with number one, strong revenue, driven by positive commercial dynamics with higher volumes, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good NII performance and 27% fee growth from insurance. Number two, cost falling 3% in real terms on the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans executed last year. And third, higher provisions, mainly Swiss franc mortgages and expected cost of risk normalization in Europe and the U.S. Volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident then that consumer will end '24 with profit growth of around double-digit even after the normalization of provisions. We are building a world-class CIB business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to grow profit, while maintaining the same low-risk profile. We are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the U.S., building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across regions. Our collaboration in the U.S. with the rest of the group is starting to pay off with several firsts. For example, we made our first corporate share buyback for a U.S. company, and we were appointed global coordinator for a U.S. listed IPO for the first time ever. In Mexico, we are creating a significant partnership within the Mexico-U.S. corridor, leveraging our global markets and U.S. Pan built-out initiatives. And these are just a few examples from a long list. As a result, revenue in CIB in the U.S. rose 33% year-on-year. This strong growth reflects the benefits of our U.S. banking build-out initiative, which will become even more evident in the coming quarters. We continue to expand and strengthen our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as chemicals, technology, and paper and packaging. Our CIB business is capital-light, very much linked to customers, and with fees growing at a good pace year-on-year. Our active capital management continues to support greater origination and high profitability levels. In essence, CIB had great results, increasing revenue in H1 6% year-on-year, even after record first half in '23, making H1 the best ever, with fees growing at double digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from customer flows. Moving on to wealth management and insurance, we continue to build the best private bank and insurance manager in Europe and the Americas. How? Number one, by improving customer relationships through the best service and right solutions, resulting in double-digit growth in private banking customers. Second, collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, which is a major driver for growth and allows us to capture network benefits. Collaboration fees increase by 12% year-on-year. Third, developing global platforms across all three businesses and digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. A good example of this is Autocompara, our auto insurance comparison engine that operates in six countries and which we are expanding to new segments and businesses. In summary, we are accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. Attributable profit rose double digits on strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment, with total fees from all three businesses growing at double digits and costs toppled slightly in real terms. Finally, efficiency improved 230 basis points year-on-year and RoTE rose to 350 basis points to over 80%. Finally, payments, where we have unique positions on both sides of the value chain. One, issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-wide. And second, in merchant acquiring. In merchant, we are the second largest acquirer in Latin America and a market leader in Spain and Portugal, with the right balance between growth and profitability. We are gaining market share in most markets, as we have strengthened Getnet's customer value proposition with new global solutions. An example is dynamic currency conversion in Mexico, which has helped Getnet to become second in Mexico with a 20% market share and a 47% EBITDA margin in Q2. We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to PagoNxt global platform to leverage the group's scale. The transactions managed globally through PagoNxt payments surpassed $1 billion per year during the first half of this year, with 30% growth quarter-on-quarter. The rollout of Plard, our global cards platform, is on track. We continue to increase the number of debit cards managed in Plard at a good pace, and we are starting the migration of the debit portfolio. We plan to manage around 15 million cards through Plard in Brazil by year end. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded one-off charges in PagoNxt from the write-down of investments. One, is a discontinuation of our merchant platform in Germany we announced in June, as we are focusing on our current acquiring value proposition in our core markets, where we have a very competitive business. The other one is our decision to write-down Superdigital, a natural step to promote the use of common platforms across the group and maximize operational leverage. These decisions will enable a more stable and profitable business, reducing fixed costs going forward. Excluding these impacts, underlying performance was very positive. Profit in payments was up 30% year-on-year, on good revenue performance, costs falling in real terms while we invest in our common platforms, and sound credit quality in cards. PagoNxt EBITDA margin improved to 20%, one of the best among competitors. We expect the consistent execution of our strategy, efficiency, and CapEx optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. Today's results show that our strategy has enabled us to deliver outstanding profitability growth in H1, with double-digit shareholder value creation for the fifth consecutive quarter. RoTE was 16.3%, up 134 basis points year-on-year, reflecting the high levels of profitability at which we are originating new business. EPS rose to nearly \u20ac0.37, that's around 20% year-on-year, and we delivered 12% growth in shareholder value creation. Supported all by strong profit generation, our strict discipline in capital allocation, and share buybacks. We have repurchased around 11% of our outstanding shares in the last three years, returning around $6.5 billion through buybacks and providing a return on investment of 19% to our shareholders. I'll leave you now with Jose, to go into our financial performance in more detail. Please, Jose."

        "speaker": "Jose Garcia",
        "text": "Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. Like always, I will go into a bit more detail about the momentum both in Europe and in Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 9%, with the highest NII and fee income in our history, and costs were down slightly in real terms. As a result, operating income was up 14%. Provisions increased even after including the 200 million increase in Swiss franc provisions that we took in the quarter. On the right-hand side, you can see the upward trend in profit quarter-on-quarter at 12%, which was driven by top-line growth with lower costs and provisions fairly flat, as I just mentioned. Let me now spend a couple of minutes on the reasons why we're starting to use a new inflation-adjusted exchange rate in Argentina rather than the official one. We have observed a significant divergence between the official exchange rate and inflation, and we have decided to follow a prudent accounting approach. The new exchange rate is the result of adjusting the official exchange rate with the differential between the inflation in Argentina and in the U.S. This is a very conservative approach and a much more conservative way of recognizing the actual value in euros of our results and our investment in Argentina. And this should mitigate the volatility that the currency might experience in the future, as you all remember was the case in 2023. Following these accounting rules, we have recorded the full Q1 and Q2 impacts from this adjustment in Q2, which does not significantly affect the year-on-year figures, but it has a significant impact and causes some distortions when we look at quarter-on-quarter. And I will try to show these differences in the coming slides. For instance, NII is dropping -- is down 4% in the quarter, but if we exclude Argentina, the group's NII would have gone up 2%. Something similar happens with fees. Instead of decreasing in the quarter, increasing 1%, they would have increased 3%, and costs would have been fairly flat. If this exchange rate does not materialize, we would revert this adjustment and account for the results that we are not recognizing today. But it looks to us that this is a prudent, more conservative way of recognizing our investment and results in Argentina. There was a strong total revenue growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more than 95% of total revenue. This strong growth was primarily supported by retail. Retail accounts, as you know, for more than 50% of our businesses, and is growing at double digits, with very good performance in NII across regions, and fees also growing, especially in the Americas, and also consumer, which is reaching good profitability levels in new businesses, and strong loan growth in Europe and LatAm. Corporate investment banking also had a good quarter, as revenue reached an all-time high, both in the quarter and in the first half of the year, particularly in Spain, in the US, and in Mexico. Also double-digit growth in wealth, as Hector mentioned, driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and in asset management. Payments also performing very well. Particularly we exclude the one-time positive impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of '23, you remember, which we explained, and Hector just mentioned, where we had a one-off from an agreement with Mastercard. And finally, the corporate center\u2019s higher liquidity buffer remuneration was offset by higher TLAC/MREL issuances, and the negative impact from FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued to increase in the quarter, if we exclude Argentina, particularly driven by retail, consumer, and CIB, which represent 95% of groups in NII. On the slide, you can see that we are, in this small box in red, putting the figure that we would have recorded if we had used the official Argentina exchange rate. So this is important, keep this in mind, and to show again that what we have decided to do is a prudent accounting of our profits coming from Argentina. NII rose 11% year-on-year, supported by all businesses and regions, on the back of very active price management in retail Europe, especially in deposits, also higher volumes and the benefits of negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America, in consumer South America, in retail South America -- and in consumer, sorry, which is now very evident in Brazil, especially in Brazil and Chile, and very good levels of activity in corporate investment banking. In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year, explained by higher yield on assets as we continue repricing our books, but also very good management of deposit costs, which more than basically outweighed the pressures that we are seeing. It's true that the margin is expanding, as you can see, we exclude Argentina, or if we had used the official exchange rate, so overall the margin management, pricing management on both the asset side and liability side is really strong. We see a slight deterioration, though, if we use our official exchange rate or our adjusted exchange rate, although it's not very significant in the quarter. Going forward, we would expect some margin pressure in Europe that will be more than compensated by positive contribution from the Americas and our consumer business. In the context of low fee growth in general across the sector as a result of subdued loan demand, we generated another record quarter in fee income at \u20ac6.5 billion with solid growth all across the five businesses. Retail increased 3%, basically driven by Brazil, North America and Poland, outstanding performance in consumer on the back of very strong insurance businesses. Corporate Investment banking also grew from already the very high levels in the first quarter -- in the first half of last year, especially in the U.S. Wealth, supported by very strong private banking activity and Payments that, as we mentioned, was affected by the one-time fee recorded in Brazil last year. Structural efficiency gains from our transformation program are very evident quarter-after-quarter. Cost income was 41.6%, the best level that we have reported for the last 15 years and one of the best in the sector is already better than the levels that we guided for 2024. Cost declined quarter-on-quarter were very flattish if we exclude Argentina, after having been stable for the last three quarters with revenue growing steadily quarter after quarter, improving an increase in operational leverage that we obviously expect to continue to have in the second half of the year and into 2025. Average inflation continued its gradual decline, down from 12% a year ago to below 4% this quarter. In this context, costs fell 1% in real terms year-on-year. Despite that, as you all know, we have some lagged effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation. By businesses, costs remain well under control in retail, consumer and payments, which will represent 80% of our cost base. And 80% of the increase, as you can see on the bottom of the chart, came from CIB, reflecting our strategy to reinforce our corporate investment banking franchise. In fact, if we exclude these investment costs in the rest of the group, would have decreased 3% in real terms. Credit quality remained very much under control, obviously, supported by a stable economic environment and our active risk management all across the group. Cost of risk was 1.21%. Remember that we look at the last 12 months, if we look at the first half of the year, cost of risk was 1.17%, even including the increase in the provisions for the Swiss franc mortgage portfolio in Argentina. So we are very much on target to reach the 1.2% for the year and we reiterate that target. In the second half, we expect that trends in consumer and Mexico will be closer to more normalized levels, but this will be offset by a better performance in Retail Europe and South America. Turning to capital and closing my section here, our CET1 ratio remains at a very comfortable level, backed by a strong organic capital generation and significant risk-weighted asset rotation. This quarter, we generated 52 basis points organically, supported by our asset rotation initiatives to compensate organic risk-weighted asset growth. We recorded 25 basis points charge for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout. And finally, there was a 7 basis point negative impact, mainly related to intangibles, the valuation of available-for-sale portfolios and others. There were no significant regulatory impacts in the quarter. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation has resulted in a new book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.9% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above that of our back book at 16%. Our centralized asset management desk, we change at optimizing capital deployment is achieving outstanding results. In the first half, we disposed of an amount of capital equivalent of \u20ac30 billion in risk-weighted assets and the cost of capital of half of that of the new originations. In addition, the one-third of our balance sheet that matures every year is being substituted by the more profitable new businesses at this return on tangible equity of 23%. The combination of these actions explained the expanding profitability and the increasing capital ratio. Let me turn it now back to Hector for his conclusions."

        "text": "Thank you, Jose. As our results clearly show, we continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for 2025 in our last Investor Day, thanks to our unique business model and execution of our strategy. With a strong and increasing organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans, further improving our profitability to above 16% and by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 12% value creation to our shareholders. We said it in our Investor Day, and I want to remind you again, we have entered a new phase of value creation for our shareholders. In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are very evident. The strong growth in revenue with flattish cost and around 20% growth in EPS and the best ever H1 profit with all-time high NII, fees and net operating income backed by strong performance in all our businesses and regions. Sustained progress in our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale is driving both higher revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have ever reported in the last 15 years. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder value creation. As a result, we expect to exceed some of our targets for '24. We are upgrading our revenue growth target to high single digits, efficiency to run 42%. And as we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, we are improving our profitability target to above 16%. Our focus at Santander is to be reliable in providing returns that compound on an always increasing quantum of tangible book value consistently and through the cycle based on both business and geographic diversification. The progress over the last 10 years to simplify and align our model in all our businesses and now deploy our own tech stack is already evident and now depends on execution to continue to deliver on our primary target of double-digit TNF plus EPS growth through the cycle. And now we will be happy to take all your questions. Thank you."

        "speaker": "Sofie Peterzens ",
        "text": "This is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So my first question would be on the risk transfers. Did I hear it correctly that you saw \u20ac30 billion of risk-weighted asset disposals in the quarter? And maybe you could just talk about the decline in risk credit asset. I see risk-weighted assets, especially being down around 2% quarter-on-quarter, in digital consumer buying minus 1% quarter-on-quarter. But in both entities, the loan book grew by 3% quarter-on-quarter. So how should we think about these SRTs or securitization? And what will be the revenue invest going forward from securitizing some of the loans. And also related to that, if you could just remind us on the regulatory capital headwinds coming in the second half? And then my second question would be on Ebury. There has been quite a few press articles suggesting that you're looking to potentially IPO Ebury. Could you just remind us what the tangible book value per share is for the -- or tangible book value for these businesses? How much revenue do you get from Ebury and what your kind of plans for Ebury is? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Sofie. I mean, first of all, I mean, our policy basically has been to -- as Jose was explaining in detail to rotate the balance sheet as much as we can. This is basically a very important change for us given the high capabilities that we have to originate assets, okay? So this is basically helping us to rotate and also giving us a new, basically, I would say, a turbocharger in the sense that with every single time that we sell something, we basically reduce that capital, already deploy the capital within the organization at a much better price. So that's exactly what we're doing and rotating the capital in a much better way. As Jose was explaining you, we rotate a third of the balance sheet every year. And since we're very focused on profitability, we're actually reinvesting better and better, and that's actually a new way of basically managing the balance sheet of the bank. Then Jose can give you a little bit of the details in terms of what you were explaining about it. In terms of regulatory capital, as we told you, our guidance is basically to be above 12% after regulatory charges, et cetera. So we continue to basically hang on to that number, 12%, above 12% we believe. And as we -- and as I said -- and Jose basically reiterated, we're going to be above the 12% after Basel III as well. And in terms of the IPO of Ebury, we'll give you the details -- Jose will give you the details on that. Thank you, Jose."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia",
        "text": "Hi, Sofie. First of all, the \u20ac30 billion was risk-weighted assets in the first half. So more or less 40% of this is SRTs, but the rest is other types of transactions like asset sales, hedges, et cetera. The cost of mobilizing this \u20ac30 billion was around RoTE equivalent, okay? We always look at RoTE, but just to use the same currency everywhere in RoTE equivalent, the cost of mobilizing this \u20ac30 billion was slightly below 10%. And we reinvested the capital, as I said, at 23%. So there was at least 13 percentage points difference on this \u20ac30 billion in risk-weighted assets. \u20ac30 billion in risk-weighted assets is close to \u20ac4 billion in capital times this 13%. So on an annualized basis, we generated increased profits with the same capital of around \u20ac500 million. We expect to continue doing this. The demand for private credit is significant that we have a very busy second half of the year. It's difficult to replicate the same figure in the second half of the year because of holidays, et cetera, but we expect to mobilize much more than last year. And as you can see from the figures I gave you, this is very profitable. Capital headwinds this year, we still expect 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. Basel III, as Hector mentioned, fully loaded. And when we mentioned fully loaded, is fully loaded, even taking into account those impacts that come in 2029, we will be comfortably above 12%. And the day one impacts will be very relatively small, as we mentioned before. And in the case of Ebury, we're always looking at ways of managing the capital and maximizing capital usage. So there were some news that we are contemplating an IPO in Ebury. Again, we are looking at all types of alternatives to maximize the capital. This is one of them. That doesn't necessarily mean that this will be executed. And again, this will be put as one of our several capital management initiatives that we have across the group."

        "text": "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first one is on the revenue performance. We have seen a very good performance in Europe, probably a bit better than what we expected -- at least we expected at the beginning of the year. LatAm has been lagging a bit behind with Brazil being softer. How should we think about the revenue performance going forward in the second half? When you have upgraded the revenue guidance to high single digits from the 9% currently so we expect second half in line with these levels kind of getting a bit of a sense whether LatAm should offset the weakness of Europe that you have flagged Jose during the call in margin? And the second question is on the U.K. If you could elaborate a bit what should we expect in terms of NII for the UK, are stabilizing so try it getting your thoughts on the outlook for the UK? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Ignacio. I mean, first of all, let me tell you, as Jose said, revenue has been very strong, much stronger than we believed at the beginning. Rates have helped, but also the good performance of our different businesses. As you know, we're very focus on profitability in the way we're restructuring things and that basically is paying off, right? I believe that, I mean, revenue will continue basically to give good results. I don't see that LatAm has a weakness. I see that actually, LatAm is going to be doing very well in the second half. And you can see also very good results coming out of what we're doing in retail in Brazil, okay? And also Chile is doing quite a good performance. Mexico, basically on retail, we're changing the mix, and that's why you see the flat NII on there, but I mean we will continue to give very good results. So we expect a very good second half of the year in terms of revenue. And in that sense, on basically what you were asking about the UK, UK was pared a better second half. First of all, we see that the market is a little bit more rational. Competition has been much rational than we saw during the first quarter. Second quarter has stabilized. We also -- some of the strategies I have done in terms of betas are paying off, okay? So I believe that all in all, UK will have a much better second half of the year than we have seen. In terms of detail, basically is more rational behavior, as I told you, fees are not going to be doing that well due to the switcher campaign that we structured and -- but benefits will come over in the third and fourth quarter, much better than the way we basically saw it. And what you're going to see is also a very good cost control because we have cost control initiatives coming into the U.K., which are going to make the business perform much better than we saw. I don't know, Jose would like to complement a little bit on the revenue side, but..."

        "text": "I think I'm sure that you will ask about -- you mentioned that revenue in Europe is better than you expected. At the beginning of the year, we guided for a drop in NII in the Eurozone. We now see NII in the Eurozone, particularly in Spain, Portugal, et cetera, up mid-single digits. Obviously, rates are higher for longer, so much better performance in NII. We have hedged a substantial amount of our balance sheet in the Eurozone, basically through the ALCO portfolio, hedging the assets, particularly mortgages and also swapping our fixed liabilities into variable liabilities. And it means that the sensitivity of our NII in Europe going forward is going to be significantly lower than we had before. So as Hector mentioned, we expect fairly stable, maybe slightly down NII in Spain in the second half of the year and next year. But at the same time, we continue to see good momentum coming from South America, Brazil and particularly Chile. So we are constructive on the future evolution of NII and revenue in the second half."

That implies, I think, almost 9% production half-on-half, which is feels a bit substantial. So I don't know if I've done my math very quickly wrong or if you can sort of add a bit of color on that. And then on the performance and fees in the U.S., could you give us a bit of color on the obviously very strong performance. But if you can maybe sort of give us some kind of color on split on, is it ECM/DCM, just perform an opinion of how sustainable it is going forward. If I can slip in a third, you mentioned over 12% capital, but I thought the target was 12.5% at the end of the year. So can you just confirm that's the case and we should still expect the 20, 30 basis points regulatory headwinds? Thank you."
      },

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Alvaro. First of all, let me talk about capital. In capital, we have always said we're going to be above 12%, okay? And that basically has been the guidance. We're at 12.5% right now. And we said -- as Jose basically reiterated that we're going to be above 12% even after Basel III fully loaded, okay? That's exactly the guidance. In terms of performance in the U.S. fees, okay, the majority is basically the CIB business. CIB is the one that is driving and also a little bit in terms of good performance in retail that we're having a little bit also in the U.S., but CIB is the main driver, okay? It's been growing -- it grew 38% year-on-year, 1.3% quarter-on-quarter. As you know, CIB business is cyclical. So we have pretty good mandates. The business is basically doing well and also a very good connection in between -- what we're doing with the U.S., as I explained during the presentation, with the business in Latin America and the business in Europe. What's happening, and let me explain a little bit is some of the businesses that we used to do in terms of DCM that we wouldn't get because we wouldn't be seen as a dollar house, we are becoming one, and you see us top three in the league tables right now in Latin America, doing dollar transactions, not just to the corporates, but also to the governments. I mean, when UMS did their transaction at the beginning of the year, \u20ac7.5 billion, we were one of the principal book runners in the transaction. So you're starting to see that because of the beef up that we did in the U.S. So that's starting to pay off. I believe that with the four teams that we added, I think it's going to complement the rest of the business and will continue driving fees up, but let's see what happens with the cyclicality of the business. On the other side, retail is also performing well in fees, and we believe that it continues to do so over the rest of the year. In terms of what we gave -- in terms of Spain, okay, performance, loans are starting to reprice lower at lower rates, but deposit betas are behaving very well. This is helping contain the cost of deposits. Also, as Jose explained you in detail, ALCO volumes are hoping and the lower cost of the hedging, which were not in place before and now are in place. So that's going to help us. NII, as Jose said, is reaching to speak, but I expect NII to grow mid-single digit in '24, better performance than we expected at the beginning of the year. It's also because of the higher -- for longer rates environment that we're experiencing, okay? I don't know, if Jose would like to add something?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia",
        "text": "Yes. In terms of details, Alvaro, I mean, it's first half against first half, NII in Spain is up 15%. So if we grew 0 in the second half, the year-on-year would be around 7%. So I don't understand where you get the minus 9. If we go quarter-on-quarter, NII in Spain was started in the third quarter of last year, 174, fourth quarter 174. First quarter of this year, 182, second quarter 184. We would expect the 184 to be the peak and then slightly down in the second half, probably to very, very similar levels that we had in the second half of last year. And we expect to be able to keep that same level in 2025. In terms of capital, 20 to 30 basis point headwinds, taking into account that we generate 20 to 30 basis points BAU, you should expect our capital ratio to be basically at these levels by year-end. The guidance of 12% is post Basel III fully loaded."

Do you think that we will see positive jaws in the second half of the year? In the U.S. as well, your P&L still remains pretty supported by tax credit. Can you help us understand how the tax line will look like in the next few quarters? And then if I may ask, do you think the new reporting is helping investors understand Santander better because judging by your low PE, I think not. So I would like to hear your thoughts there. Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Marta. Okay. Let me explain you a little bit what's going on in the U.S. If you look at by business, you're going to see that retail is actually having lower cost than you used to have because of the transformation even with the strong investment we're doing in transformation. But we have done a really -- good cost reduction, and we believe we're going to perform better. Their jaws are negative due to the fact that we're investing in CIB. And CIB, as you understand, I mean, cost a lot to do it. So if we're going to have a second half that is better, it's going to start looking better, but it's going to depend on the cyclicality of the CIB business and some of the still people that are coming into the team that will start to come in, in the next few months. As you know, there is a period of garden leave et cetera. But the main reason is the investment we're doing in CIB, which by in any way is not creating a big investment bank or anything like that. This is basically, as we said, complementing the rest of the business that we have. Our size is not going to be huge. It's the size of a really small boutique, but it's helping us out to beef up and to help us in the remainder of the business. And you can see fees are starting to basically be up due to that fact, okay? In terms of the P&L, it's at easy to understand. The DTAs are basically what we said last year when we started doing the electric vehicles. I mean we signed contracts with some OEMs that are generating the DTAs. And that's why you see that the P&L is affected by that, and it's going to continue due to the fact that we will continue to be absorbing, I mean, that volume. So we have now three things, and this is basically leases on electric vehicles that are creating the DTAs in the U.S., all right? And you're going to see that throughout the year. In terms of the new reporting, it's very important to understand what we're doing. The new reporting is helping us a lot in the way we are managing the business on a day-to-day basis, okay? Because it's making us work together, is making us spend a lot less. In the past, for example -- and let me give you a really stupid example. I mean we used to have 10, 11 different apps in our 10 different banks. Right now, we're just having one app being deployed in all the countries. For example, one app is being deployed. Today, it's being deployed in all of Europe. The last deployment we did was the U.K. and they were deploying Brazil and then we will -- we are deploying also the U.S. So what happens is basically, you use the same around 80/20, and that's the goal that we're basically going through, investing jaws ones and those 80% common, 20% customization for each country. So that basically will enable us in the future through these global platforms to work much better in a much cheaper way. We gave you a pretty good example in what we're doing in acquiring. When the acquiring platform was deployed in Mexico, it took us in 18 months to number two, and you saw the results that I explained, I mean, how EBITDA is growing. And I showed you in the presentation that is helping us quite a lot in terms of positioning ourselves to be very competitive and with really high margins in every single market. And jaws 1 platform, the one that is being deployed. Now this platform is being deployed down to Chile, is being deployed to Argentina, and they will -- we will deploy it in Europe in the near future. So this is basically helping us to work together and to manage the business in a much better way. Then in terms of how do you see the businesses and the way they're reporting, I mean you're going to start getting used to it because it's going to be a lot easier for you to understand every single business in the way we're managing it. We're reporting now, as you can see, the operational leverage that we're getting by working together in which revenue is going up, cost is staying stable and is giving us a really profitable run. So it's very important that you understand that. Also, let me give you a great example. In CIB, where we have been working together for a long time, the same factories that we use for Mexico, Brazil, Spain or the U.K. are completely the same and it's the same product, and we just made them once. So that basically tells you how we're going to be able -- I mean we have been able to make it a really profitable business with growing revenue every single year and with profitability at around 19% that I gave you. So this is exactly the points that we're doing, and I believe that this will enable us to give a lot more value to our shareholders. There is no way we're going to give you more value if we don't work together and do things in a much cheaper way."

        "text": "Yes, thank you. So two questions for me. The first one is on NII in Brazil. You still maintain the guidance of growth in the high teens for the year. Mid-teens would imply a quarter-on-quarter fall during the second half, if you think this could be the case or not? I mean, because selling rates have been expectations of cuts have been pushed out. So if you can comment on the main drivers of the NII in the coming quarters and also update on the sensitivity of the NII to select rates in Brazil? And the second question is about NII in the U.S. We have seen this is bottoming out in this second quarter, but they have also seen the deposits falling for a couple of quarters now. So you would need to pay up for deposit gathering in the second half of the year or not. In this context, if you can also comment on the plans to launch Openbank, shall we expect there? Because when I look, for example, at the digital consumer bank, the deposits are growing there by 20%, but net interest margin is still falling, despite the shift to retail deposits? So you can comment also on these NII trends here."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you, Francisco. Let me start with Brazil. First of all, as you have seen, I mean, very strong and solid numbers coming from Brazil. NII, once again, a very strong quarter, up more than 3% and it's up more than 22% in the year, okay? What's behind the performance is the combination of the healthy volume growth, the change in mix and lower rates, okay? It is true. First of all, rates outlook has changed. The market is expecting a smaller than initially anticipated rate cut by the year, by year-end, and this ultimately means that NII growth will be a bit less intense than what we thought at the beginning of the year. That's a fact, okay. Having said that, we still expect Brazil NII to grow in the mid-teens mark by the end '24, okay? It's a good performance that should continue in '25. And let me tell you that to take the opportunity that Brazil has delivered a 16% RoTE. We believe that the end of the year should end up between 16% and 17%. A strong profitability improvement is not just relying on NII growth, but on the good delivery on fees also, the cost contention that we have had and expected cost of risk is stable during the year. So I remember very optimistic in Brazil and the ability to continue funding the profitability, as you have seen. In terms of Openbank in the U.S., Openbank will come into the U.S. with the deposit gathering facility towards September, October, okay? We expect that to come. The first phase is the deposit gathering. And I believe it would be quite successful. We had a pretty good plan in place. And then we'll come -- and we'll be improving the platform as we see fit. In terms of deposits, the deposits -- the transactional deposits that SG&A has had remained stable during the year. What is -- what you have seen the movement in deposits in the U.S. is basically the deposits that we have in CIB, which are the ones that we decide on profitability, what's better for us or not. So sometimes because of profitability, we basically let them go and we move out if we see fit. So there is no problem into that, and we will continue to see that working profitability towards every business that we do."

This was post-COVID, and we have historically high profitability levels. This year is going to stay -- this production is going to stay in our books for three years. So it's still in our books in 2024 and it will gradually disappear between '24 and '25. The new business that we are writing in 2024 is at RoTE's of around 20% RoTE was of 2.3%, 2.4%, which is much, much higher than '22 and '23 annual production. So you should expect in 2025, a very substantial pickup in profitability in margins and in profitability in Consumer Europe because of this in and out of the different productions and the fact that there was an abnormally high profitability in the year following COVID."

Let me start with the U.S. To tell you, I believe, I mean, the U.S. revenue is going to continue to do pretty well, but the profitability is always the most difficult in the second part because of seasonality in terms of what happens to us in provisions. So what you're going to see is revenue continue to go up quietly fairly strong. Let's see how we do in fees, as I said, due to the cyclicality of the CIB business, but revenues will be doing fine. In terms of the seasonality, let's see how we do in terms of the provisions, but we believe and the indication that we have had in terms of provisions show us that are coming better. The LTM numbers that we have in provisions for the U.S. are much better than last year. So it's looking well. And so the U.S. shall have a much better year than last year.

Our transformation program is delivering very positive jaws that we expect to maintain, particularly in consumer and retail in 2025. The negative -- the sensitivity to rates in Europe has been much decreased, as I mentioned before, and we should have positive tailwinds coming from NII in South America, both Brazil and Chile. So definitely, operational leverage is we'll continue driving increased profitability. In terms of cost of risk, no signs of deterioration, and looking into the next few quarters, we see no signs that we will require to increase our provisions going forward. So if you put all of these together, again, this means that our profits should continue to increase going forward."

I think that's one strategy you've adopted before, but how comfortable are you that you will not need to do further top-ups in Brazilian cost of risk going forward? And are the top-ups a catch-up? Or can we assume that the top-ups will mean a structurally lower cost of risk in Brazil in the coming years? And then secondly, in the U.K., in the deck, you mentioned that 100% of your hedge income is already locked in for 2024. This suggests that either you do not have any maturities this year or you pre-hedged some of your maturities. If you have been pre-hedging, what proportion of 2025 structural hedge maturities have you pre-hedged and what rate did you look in at given the swap rates have been volatile? And do you expect the tailwind from the structural hedge will overwhelm the headwinds on NII in the U.K. in 2025? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thank you. Okay. Let me go to Brazil, okay? First of all, it's very important to tell you that increase in provision is exclusively linked to the loan growth that we have in the country, okay? Cost of risk, as you have seen, is flat quarter-on-quarter, 4.77% and credit quality in Brazil remains sound and solid. It's very important to understand that the recent vintages that we have are performing very well and no signs of deterioration. So it's performing than we expected. It's very important to understand that we're also changing the mix a little bit on the portfolio. Just to explain you a little bit, for example, credit cards where in '21, we were making around 800,000 to 900,000 credit cards per month. Today, we're just growing by 400,000 credit cards a month and just to our client base. So the important thing and the big change is exactly that we're not going to the open market, which was the 1 that hurt us quite a lot during '22 and '23. So that's exactly the change of mix that is helping us. Also, it's very important to understand that we're very focused on profitability, and we have been very opportunistic, and we used the proceeds of a corporate transaction to further reinforce the balance sheet at this point. And we reiterate that the '24 guidance of delivering is a flattish cost of risk versus '23, okay, excluding the one-offs. So that's what I see in terms of Brazil. In terms of the U.K., Jose, please?"

        "text": "Yes. So as you know, obviously, the strategy is to keep the structural hedge position in line with core deposits to protect the balance sheet ahead of decreasing interest rates. Following the recent increase in market rates and in order to protect the NII, we have accelerated the planned investments for 2024 amongst other measures. So the sensitivity we have today is to a 100% decrease in -- parallel decrease in rates in the U.K. Today is minus GBP 120 million compared to minus GBP 220 million a year ago. So roughly, we have half of the sensitivity today than we had a year ago. The current hedge -- structural hedge is GBP 114 billion, compared with GBP 106 billion in December. So this is related to my comment before. With the duration of 2.5 years in December, it was -- sorry, 2.5 years. In December, it was 2.4 years and the yield is slightly over 2%."

But if I understood correctly, and the message was that in 2025, NII should be roughly aligned with the second half of this year where you already expect NII to drop somewhat towards the mid-single-digit growth in the full year that you are mentioning? And then my second question was actually on the U.S. tax rebates that you have been booking. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on how the rebate works in the sense that -- or basically, for how long is it in place? Is it something that we should also witness next year? And also, is it this federal level rebate or something at the state level? And to what extent the potential changes in -- political changes in the U.S. could drive that to disappear or not.

Even if the rates come down, I think we're probably in the best ever position in that sense. And even as we say, I mean, the NII would slightly come down over the second half. And then we'll see that we will have a pretty good run towards -- let's see how rates basically behave. But I don't know, Jose, if you like to complement, but it's basically..."

The year-on-year growth, '24 against '23 will be somewhere between 5% to 7%. And then next year, NII should be fairly flat relative to the second half of this year, which means that NII should be down slightly low single digits. Because, again -- and this is using the forward rate curves today. So if this was to change, obviously, we would need to update these estimates. But using forward curve rates today, that's our best estimate for NII in Spain next year. And as Hector mentioned, this is thanks to the substantial reduction in NII sensitivity that we have conducted in the Eurozone in the last year, 1.5 years."

        "text": "Carlos. Okay. On your -- on the U.S., let me walk you through exactly what happens. Okay. First of all, let me tell you that it's federal, okay? We don't know if this is going to be sustained. If there is a change of government in the U.S. or not. You -- I mean, I don't want to speculate on that one. Exactly what happens is every single time we do a lease on an electric vehicle, we buy the vehicle in the bank, okay? So what you see is basically a situation in which we own the vehicle. And then we get the cash back or -- sorry, the tax credit and you show the cash credit in 1 lump, okay, during the month in which we do that, right, to be exactly how it goes. So you don't see the impact in the revenue but the impact you see it in the taxes. So that's exactly how it works. I don't know if I'm being correct of -- I mean if I'm being clear in one, the way I'm explaining to you this, but it's exactly how it works, all right? So what we have done is that we have a program what we have signed with the OEMs that we're doing this for, it depends on the -- also the capacity that we have to absorb those ETAs because this is not, I mean, unlimited. This is not, I mean -- we have to have depends on the balance sheet that we have, and we have calculated the number exactly that we can absorb, and this is exactly what we negotiated with the OEMs. I know if you understood the question in the right way, but this is exactly how it works, okay? And we don't know if it's going to happen in the future or not, hopefully, continues to be like that."

Firstly, in the UK, your NII was slightly up quarter-on-quarter in Q2. So just wondering how you see it progressing from here? And is it fair to say that Q1 was probably the low point on NII and it should start building from here supported by the hedge and what is the shape of this into H2 and also into next year? Secondly, just a clarification on your U.S. business. You were talking about some seasonality into the second half of the year in provisions. Could you please explain what is driving this seasonality? And then lastly for Brazil. Also taking into consideration your comments about changing the mix of your business. When do you expect to see a full normalization in cost of risk and around what level would this normalization be? Thank you."

Market is more, more rational, both in the margins and in the betas. And on top of that, cost, as I said, is going to be slightly better than the first half of the year. Q2 in NII is showing signs of improvement, okay? And as I basically explained, and we see that betas are not going to go up so that basically will help us. In terms of revenue, we see mid-to single-digit decrease in NII, down mid-single digits versus last year and fees down low double digit due to the fact that I was explaining about what we're doing with the switcher campaign and the higher cash back. You're going to see that it's going to be much better in '25 because exactly we're preparing the bank towards that. Also, we're very focused on profitability. It's very important that you understand that, okay? We're not using capital below our cost of equity. So we're being very tough on that and that's exactly how we manage that. And then, Jose, I would like to..."

        "text": "A quick comment. The mortgage dynamics in the U.K. seem to suggest that margins in this business will pick up substantially from the fourth quarter of this year into next year, just as an additional comment. Brazil cost of risk, we still believe the cost of risk this year should be somehow below cost of risk last year. Remember that when you look at cost of risk quarter-on-quarter, it was a substantial increase in the fourth quarter when we look at year-on-year X the fourth quarter and we look at cost of risk for the full of 2024, we would expect to see an improvement in the cost of risk. So year-on-year because the fourth quarter will come out in the fourth quarter of this year, you should see the most significant improvement in cost of risk in the fourth quarter. And then provisions in the U.S. are normalizing. Cost of risk this year should be somehow around 2% or slightly below 2%."

In terms of Brazil, we're changing the loan mix, but we are very flexible and very dynamic in the way we change the loan mix over there depending on what we are seeing and how the vintages are behaving, okay? So if we see that Brazil basically, and we're starting to see positive signs of how the mass market basically reacts, is inflation is coming down and we see the rates coming down. We might change the mix again, and we might be a little bit more aggressive. And I couldn't tell you up at this point, what are we going to do because we revised the strategy every single month of what we do and also the pricing okay? So I don't know what the mix is going to be in Brazil in '25, but I must tell you that we're working in a very dynamic way. It's a very dynamic market, and you need to be on top of it, all right? So I couldn't tell you at this point, but I mean, everything basically is -- and we do change the mix to sustain the cost of risk at the reasonable levels, and that's the intent that we have in order to manage that, right?"

In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, rates this year are expected to stay at 10.5% by year-end, but to drop significantly next year and that should help. In addition to the structure of the balance sheet, lower rates next year in Brazil will help not only in terms of NII, but also cost of risk. It will be a gradual improvement. We need to see exactly how we will build the business in 2025 in Brazil, but definitely lower rates should help."

    "transcript": "Jose Garcia Cantera: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings presentation. Like always, the presentation will start with our CEO, with Hector Grisi's comments, followed by my more detailed explanation of the P&L, he will have his concluding remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. Hector, please go ahead.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you very much, Jose. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's presentation, as always, first, I will talk about our results in the context of our strategy, then Jose will review our financial performance in greater detail, and then I will conclude with some final messages as Jose said, we will then open the floor for all your questions. So the main highlights of our results in this first are the following: Q3 was another record quarter for Santander, which continues to demonstrate the benefits from the execution of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reached \u20ac3.3 billion, 12% above the Q3 on '23, on the back of a solid franchise of 171 million customers that continues to increase as we improve our customer experience through simplification, automation and leverage of our global platforms. Profit reached \u20ac9.3 billion in the first nine months, also a record of 14%, supported by strong customer revenue growth across regions and all the global businesses. We achieved this as we invest for the future, and we continue to make excellent progress towards a simpler and more integrated model, which has helped us to improve our efficiency by 229 basis points and increased our RoTE to 16.2%. Finally, our balance sheet remained solid with a sound capital ratio and robust credit quality and contributed to the strong profitable growth, shareholder value creation, and attractive remuneration. Dividend per share increased by 14% and the cash dividend per share will be 39% higher in '24. Going into more detail into our income statement. As always, we present growth rates in both current and constant euros. This quarter, there were no material differences between them year-on-year, but as Jose will explain later there are most significant on the quarter-on-quarter. Our P&L remains strong from top to bottom. Number one, strong top-line supported by all our businesses and regions, NII fees, both at record levels accounted for over 95% of total income, driving the vast majority of our revenue growth. Number two, expenses grew below revenue and inflation, showcasing the possible effects of our transformation -- sorry, the positive effects of our transformation. Three, loan-loss provisions were fairly in line with average lending and credit quality also had an excellent performance. All in all, as shown over time, our results are sustainable and less volatile than peers due to our business and geographical diversification, the high quality of our revenues and a prudent approach to risk. We are on track to exceed the targets we set in January and upgraded in July. Solid business dynamics reported high-single digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved as we accelerate ONE Transformation and increased operational leverage. Cost of risk is expected to remain in line with our '24 target on the back of active risk management, strong labor markets and interest rates dropping in most of our countries. As a reference, year-to-date cost of risk improved to 1.14% even with the additional provisions in Poland in Q2. Our CET1 ratio ended September at 12.5%, and we are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation fully loaded. And our RoTE is already above the target we set for the end of the year. Our execution of ONE Transformation continues to boost our operational leverage, structurally improving both revenue and cost performances, simplifying and automating processes and our active spread management have already contributed 259 basis points of efficiencies, since we started surpassing the levels, which we expected to reach at the end of '25. Our global businesses continue to drive the group's profitability and have delivered 82 basis points in efficiency gains. Finally, our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated 72 basis points inefficiencies so far. Remember that we are focused on going back to basics, offering the best products and user experience to our customers and boosting operational leverage through our global platforms to support value creation for our shareholders based on profitable growth with minimal volatility. This is already reflected in the great performance of our businesses. All of them showed solid revenue growth, retail and consumer and will strongly improve our efficiency ratio, leading to higher RoTE, while CIB and payments reflect our efforts to develop new products and global platforms which has started to deliver results. This is a fantastic example of how our model works. Higher interest rates benefit some of our retail franchises, while other parts of our business perform better under different circumstances. But overall our combination of highly diversified businesses allows us to deliver consistent profitable growth and value creation. The global businesses and the cross collaboration are helping us to extract the full potential from our unique combination of local leadership and global capabilities with a cost of infrastructure that delivers efficiency and scalability. This allows us to reach our '25 profitability targets. In retail, which is at the heart of our banking business, we are working to become the number one bank for customers. Let's look at how ONE Transformation is delivering results. Innovation is key. We're enhancing our digital onboarding and promoting simpler customer journey and better experiences across the bank. For example, in Brazil, we have reduced onboarding time by 50%, which has contributed to a 3% customer growth only this quarter. We are progressing fast towards a common operating model across our banks, which together with automation and digitalization, free stop time of our people to focus on commercial activities on our branches. Dedication of resources to non-commercial activities has dropped by 11%, since we started with ONE Transformation. Deployment of our global platform remains on track. And for example, in the U.K., customer has been migrated to our global app that already operates in Spain, Portugal, Poland and Openbank with great success. As a result, our profit grew 29% year-on-year, with RoTE up 400 basis points to 18.5% on the back of revenue up close to double-digit on good performance of NII and fees with all regions growing especially Europe and South America. Cost is well under control, down 5% in real term, reflecting structural benefits from our transformation and provisions improving and the cost of risk fairly stable at really comfortable levels. Going forward, our improvements in customer experience, the implementation of a common operating model and the deployment of our global tech platform will drive additional customer growth, better efficiency and profitability. In consumer, our priority is to continue expanding our leadership across all our footprint. Our best-in-class global solutions are integrated into our partners' processes. For example, we have integrated our front in Hyundai systems, providing our customers the best digital experience, faster credit approval and time to pay. We are making great progress in our deposit strategy to increase NII stability and reduce the funding cost. Deposits increased 12% year-on-year on the back of our deposit gathering platforms. The deployment of global platforms is key to scale of business, reduce our cost to serve and improve profitability. Last Monday, we reached an important milestone in the U.S. with the nationwide launch of Openbank. In the last four weeks, we have already gathered around \u20ac200 million in deposits and welcomed over 7,000 clients. We also launched Zinia, a co-branded card with Amazon in Germany, and we are deploying a new operational functionality. Consumer continues to grow a strong operational leverage with a 9% net operating income increase and some profit growth on the back of, number one, strong revenue with solid NII performance and 25% fee growth; number two, cost falling 2% in real terms, thanks to our transformation efforts, even as we continue to invest in growth; and third, LLP is normalizing in Europe and in the U.S. in line with expectations. Overall, we continue to see positive operating trends, and we expect them to improve on the back of lower rates and volume growth. We are building a world-class CIB business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to grow profit, while maintaining the same low risk profile. Number one, we are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the U.S., building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across group. Revenue in CIB in the U.S. rose 41% year-on-year and is expected to boost cross-border revenue across the group as we continue to progress on our U.S. build-out initiative. We continue to execute our global markets plan, which is starting to pay off with institutional sales doubling in Europe and more than tripling in the U.S. Number two, we're expanding and sophisticating our centers of expertise, while strengthening our financial sponsor franchise, which is leading to business opportunities in M&A, capital markets and GTB across the group and continues to pay off with several first deals. This quarter, for example, for the first time, we were appointed sole bookrunner for an IPO of a SPAC, and we acted as the lead left underwriter in an LBO transaction with one of the largest industrial focused investment firms and these are just a few examples of a long list. Third, we are driving cross-border revenues on the back of enhanced client solutions and global collaboration. We had a great number of cross-border deals in Q3 such as also resulting from the collaboration of our teams in Mexico and Spain, France and Brazil, Peru and Mexico or Italy and France, among others. CIB reached solid results with revenue up 9% after a record '23 making the first nine months the best ever fees growing at double-digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from client flows. And the best is still to come. Growth will accelerate going forward as we continue to execute our strategy on a global basis. Moving on to Wealth. We continue to build the best wealth and insurance manager in Europe and the Americas. How? Number one, by improving customer relationships through the best customer service and right solutions resulting in double-digit growth in private banking customer and fees. We are shifting our product offering towards value-added solutions, such as discretionary portfolio management, advisory and alternative investments, and this has also supported Spain double-digit increase in the number of private banking customers and a 22% total revenue growth. Number two is promoting collaboration with other businesses, especially with retail and CIB, which is a major driver for growth and allow us to capture network benefits. Collaboration fees increased by 13% year-on-year. Number three is developing global platforms across all the businesses and digitalizing our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and really promote growth. Good examples of this are the recent implementation of a single operating platform from alternative products and the deployment of San Conecta in Mexico and Brazil, which boost the distribution network capabilities and provides real-time information about funds and markets. In summary, we are accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. Attributable profit rose 15% on the back of a strong activity and fees growing at double-digit across the three businesses. Finally, efficiency improved 210 basis points year-on-year and RoTE rose 400 basis points to 81%. Finally, payments. As I already advanced last quarter, we have a unique position on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-wide and merchant acquiring. In merchant, we are one of the largest acquirers in Latin America, Spain and Portugal, with the right balance between growth and profitability. Get the total payments volume and PagoNxt open market revenue keeps growing strongly, which is helping us to consolidate our presence in core market, such as Brazil and Mexico, where we maintain a leadership position. And at the same time, we build up market share in fast-growing markets, such as Chile, where we recently launched Getnet. Our payments hub already processes all type of payments, for example, credit transfers, direct debits or instant payments and international payments for several countries and businesses. We have already migrated 800 million transactions this year. This is 5x more than the same period last year. Also, we continue to deploy part our global cards platform. In Brazil, we currently manage more than 8 million debit cards through [indiscernible], and we are on track to full migration by Q2 '25 to manage around 17 million total cards. In a second phase, we will start with the credit card portfolio. At the same time, we continue to boost our cards proposition through our Risk Data Lab, our solution based on AI. Payments delivered strong results with good revenue trends in both businesses, cost under control and sound credit quality in cards, which drove to a 10% profit growth, excluding the non-recurring items with cost in Q2. PagoNxt EBITDA margin improved to 23% backed by Getnet with one of the best ratios among our competitors. We expect cost efficiency and CapEx optimization to continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. Our capital ratio has improved this year from 12.3% to 12.5% backed by strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and shareholder remuneration. As a result, we continue to grow our value creation, which in terms of TNAV plus EPS increased 14%, which represents around \u20ac10 billion year-on-year, and we are increasing our shareholder remuneration. In September, the Board of Directors approved an interim distribution against H1 '24 results, which is being executed in two equal parts, a cash dividend of \u20ac0.10 per share, which will be paid from the 1st of November and a share buyback program up to \u20ac1.5 billion. This is currently underway. Cash dividend will be 39% higher in '24, and at the same time, since '21, if we include the full amount of the current share buyback program, Santander we have repurchased 12.5% of its outstanding shares. I'll leave you now with Jose, who will get going our financial performance in more detail.\nJose Garcia Cantera: Thank you, Hector. Let me go into more detail the P&L and the capital. As Hector has mentioned, we are yet again reporting record results as our transformation continues to drive operational leverage. Revenue grew 8% on the back of the highest NII and fees in our history and the best efficiency ratio in the last years, boosting the net operating income, which rose 13% year-on-year. Provisions grew only slightly even after the expected normalization in consumer and the Swiss franc provisions in Poland, we recorded in the second quarter, while cost of risk fell in the quarter. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the upward trend in profit, which grew 1% quarter-on-quarter in euros, 5% in constant euros, driven mainly by customer revenue and lower provisions. This quarter, there is an effect from the depreciation of some currencies affecting the quarter-on-quarter comparison, but as you can see in the P&L, the impact year-on-year is not material. Please remember that the last quarter, we decided to take a more conservative approach to value -- to recognizing the value of the results obtained in Argentina. So we began to apply an inflation adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso, which in the quarter was 1,618 compared to the official exchange rate of 1,069 to the euro. And obviously, this is a much more conservative exchange rate than the one used by our peers. This approach caused some distortions in the quarter-on-quarter comparison that I will comment during the presentation only where relevant. Total revenue increased 8% with all businesses and regions growing driven by customer revenue growth, which made up more than 90% of total revenue. This strong growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which continues to grow close to double-digits with good performance in NII and fees, especially in the Americas and also by CIB growing across the three lines of business on the back of good activity levels, mainly in global banking and markets. Consumer revenue also rose supported in this case by volumes and active asset repricing and double-digit growth in fees across our geographies. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, both in private banking and in asset management. Payments is growing at good trends, showing relatively good underlying performance. As both PagoNxt and cards increased, even more so if we exclude the onetime positive fee recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year. Finally, the Corporate Centre's revenue improved on the back of less negative impact from FX hedging. Turning to NII, net interest margin. Most of our revenue came from net interest income, which increased 9% year-on-year, supported by all our businesses and regions, basically due to active price management, particularly in retail in Europe and in consumer and higher volumes and the benefits from negative sensitivity to rates in South America -- in retail, South America, which is now very evident, especially in Brazil and Chile and also good activity levels in our Global Banking business in CIB. NII was resilient quarter-on-quarter, rising 1% in constant euros in a new interest rate environment, particularly driven by retail, but it was up 2% with the vast majority of our countries positively contributing in the quarter, especially Brazil, driven by higher average volumes, Poland due to better spreads and higher volumes and the U.K. supported by good price management. In terms of profitability, we improved our net interest margin year-on-year. This is explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spread focusing on profitability, not market share, which more than outweighed higher funding costs. We were able to contain thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration in Europe and deposit repricing downwards in South America. As we commented last quarter, we have seen a slight deceleration in net interest margin and net interest income in line with our expectations. Please remember that the decrease in net interest margin in the second quarter was due to the prudent adjustment we made to the exchange rate in Argentina. And this quarter, net interest margin was also affected by the hyperinflation account in Argentina and the depreciation of the real and the Mexican peso and to a lesser extent, the beginning of a new interest rate cycle in Europe. Over the last few quarters, we have gradually adapted the sensitivity of our balance sheet to position for this new monetary policy cycle. This and the positive contribution we expect from our consumer businesses put us in a good condition, in a good position to mitigate the effects of margin compression expected in Europe and North America going forward. In an environment of low credit demand in general, we generated another record in fee income, reflecting our transformation efforts to promote connectivity across the group and provide the best customer service. Retail increased as more customers chose Santander as the primary financial service provider. We added 5 million new customers over the last 12 months to a total of 171 million customers. Outstanding performance in consumer, largely driven by increased insurance penetration in Europe. CIB also grew from record levels last year, especially in the U.S. on the bank of strong dynamics in Global Banking. We had a 16% increase in wealth, with all three businesses growing at double-digits, and payments was impacted, as I mentioned before, by the one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter in 2023 in Brazil. Our transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model continued to deliver structural efficiency gains. Our cost-to-income ratio for the nine month period improved to 41.7%, the best level that we have reported in the last 15 years, one of the best in the sector and is already at better levels than the guidance we provided for 2024. Costs declined 1% year-on-year in real terms despite the lagged effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs on our investments in transformation. By business, costs remain very well under control in retail and consumer, which represents 70% of our cost base. More than 90% of the nominal cost increase came from CIB as per our strategy to reinforce our CIB franchise. Costs remain contained in wealth, even with higher commercial activity and were fairly flat in payments even as we invest in global platforms. As we look ahead, structural improvements from our new operating model, which help us achieve our target of maintaining cost to income at around 42% in 2024, while it should improve further next year. Credit quality remains robust, around and across our footprint in line with our expectations with record low unemployment rates in most countries and easing monetary policies. Credit quality improved year-on-year as reflected both in the NPL ratio and lower coverage needs. The NPL portfolio has collateral guarantees and provisions that account for 90% of its total exposure. 12-month cost of risk improved to 1.18%. In our retail and consumer, 12-month cost of risk improved in the quarter. In retail, there were some underlying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved across Europe and remained at very low levels in the U.K. and Portugal. In Brazil, it fell for the second quarter in a row. And in Mexico, it also declined in the quarter following a year of expected normalization. Similarly, in consumer, 12-month cost of risk was impacted year-on-year by the normalization we expected, but it dropped in the quarter to 2.12%. The cost of risk in the first nine months of the year was 1.14%, putting us in good position to end the year comfortably within our target of 1.2%. Finally, turning to capital. Our fully loaded capital ratio remains at a comfortable level backed by strong organic capital generation and significant risk-weighted asset mobilization. This quarter, we generated 43 basis points organically on the back of 52 basis points from profit generation partially offset by risk-weighted asset growth and by minorities, we recorded a 26 basis point charge for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout policy. We had 18 basis points of regulatory charges, mostly related to model updates in low default portfolios. And finally, we had positive impacts from the placement of Santander, Poland and ALCO portfolio valuations, which were offset by impacts on deductions, pensions in the most part -- for the most part. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital profitability and productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.9% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above that of our back book at 16%. Our centralized asset management desk, which aims to optimize capital deployment is achieving outstanding results. In the first nine months of the year, we have disposed of an amount of capital equivalent to \u20ac40 billion in risk-weighted assets, the cost of capital of half of that of new originations. In addition, one-third of our balance sheet that matures every year is being substituted by more profitable new business. The combination of these actions explains the expanding profitability and resilient capital ratio. That's all from my side. Hector, back to you. Thank you.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you, Jose. It is important to say that our progress towards the targets we set for '25 in our last Investor Day is ahead of plan as we continue to leverage our unique competitive advantages and excellent execution of our strategy by our teams. Sound CET1 levels and strong execution of our capital allocation plans, further improving our profitability to about 16% and delivering 14% value creation and increased remuneration to our shareholders. In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are evident. Q3 was another record quarter on the back of strong customer revenue with all regions and businesses contributing, which results in the best nine months profit ever with all-time high NII fees and net operating income at a 19% EPS growth. Sustained progress in our structural changes towards a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale is driving both higher revenue and lower cost to achieve the vast efficiency ratio we have reported for the last 15 years. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder value creation. As a result, we remain on track to exceed the '24 targets we set in January and upgraded last quarter, and we are in a great position to continue growing, increasing profitability and delivering shareholder value creation. The progress of the last 10 years to simplify and align our model in all our businesses and now deploy our own tech stack is already evident. And as we continue to execute our strategy, we will deliver on primary target of double-digit TNAV per share plus EPS growth through the cycle. And now we're very happy to take your questions. Thanks.\nBegona Morenes: So thank you, Hector. Operator, please let's begin the Q&A session, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We have the first question from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Ulargui: Thanks very much. Good morning everyone and thanks very much for the presentation and for taking the questions. We have two, if I may. The first one is on NII, just to get a bit of a better understanding of the moving parts of the NII during the quarter? And also, how should we expect about the group top line group NII in coming quarters? The second one will be on cost outlook. Given the solid performance that we have seen in the quarter, how should we think about cost performance going forward? And as per Jose's comments in the presentation, what kind of improvement should we expect in terms of cost to income for 2025? Thank you.\nHector Grisi Checa: Let me give it a first keep and then Jose basically could be give you a better idea. It's interesting to see that if you see NII in constant, you'll see that it's 1% up, okay? The effect of Argentina is the one that's hitting us in the current euros, okay? It is important to explain, first of all, that the sensitivity of our balance sheet to movements in rates is mostly concentrated in retail and commercial business. This is about 60% of the group balance sheet with some parts showing a really positive sensitivity in Europe and other is a negative one like the one we have in Brazil, as we already know. Europe and Brazil concentrate about 80% to 90% of the rate exposure. Over the past few quarters, we have been very proactively managing and working to reduce the sensitivity of the different balance sheets and position them to lower its environments. For example, in the case of Europe, we have reduced the sensitivity to around 25%. That's one quarter of what was at the beginning of the rate cycle. In places like Brazil, for example, we are taking measures to reduce the sensitivity further by doing some things to the ALCO and also taking some hedges. As you have already seen this year, the retail business is operating leverage is 10 points. We are growing the top line, not just because of higher interest rates, but also because we're changing the operating model, which is the most important part that you guys need to concentrate. We're growing customers, for example, 2.6 million in the third quarter alone. And we are keeping costs flat, which is quite important because that's creating an operating leverage and improving our margins. And this basically think that we will continue improving thanks to, first of all, the geographical and business diversification, the strong focus on capital allocation and the strong focus on profitability that we have up to this point. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement on the margins and then we'll take on cost.\nJose Garcia Cantera: Yes, definitely. Thanks, Hector. So let me explain Argentina in a bit more detail. In June, we used an exchange rate of 1,499 and we explained at the time that we are devaluating depreciating the exchange rate with inflation, independent of the official exchange rate. The official exchange rate as of now is 1,069. for the quarter -- for the end of the quarter, we used 1,618. And remember that when you use 1,618 inflation accounting, you adjust backwards all the accounts to that exchange rate. So we have two impacts on our P&L. One, there is over \u20ac100 million negative quarter-on-quarter increase in the monetary position that comes in other income. And in Argentina, as interest rates come down, and we have a very liquid balance sheet and is invested mostly in bonds. The yield earned on this bond portfolio is lower. And quarter-on-quarter, it is over \u20ac200 million drop in local currency, when you look at local currency, there is over \u20ac200 million drop in the yield coming from these investments. So Argentina actually explains most of the drop in net interest income quarter-on-quarter, but also it means around \u20ac300 million -- over \u20ac300 million impact on total revenue. So as Hector explained, we have been reducing our sensitivity to rates, both in euros and in Brazil, which obviously outside Europe is the highest sensitivity we have. In Europe, we have been buying an increase in the ALCO portfolio. If we look at the total euro ALCO portfolio we have, which is Spain, Portugal and the consumer finance. We have \u20ac50 billion in euro government bonds with an average maturity of over six years and a yield of 3.2%, 3.3%. The second action we took was to float the liabilities, the market liabilities, and we also hedged the repricing of our mortgages in Spain by signing some forward stocks. So this has reduced the sensitivity of the net interest income in euros quite significantly to around a quarter of the sensitivity we had prior to entering this cycle of higher rates. In Brazil, we did the opposite. In Brazil, we are changing the mix of the liabilities and also floating the assets. Net-net, when we look into 2025, for 2024, we see NII down a little bit in current euros, but we see NII up in constant euros. Thanks to these measures that we have discussed. And these estimates are based on forward curve rates -- forward rate curves, sorry.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you, Jose. Ignacio, in terms of cost, it's very important that you understand the following. This is not about a cost cutting exercise. This is about changing the model and the go-to model. We're basically introducing in the whole group. He's talking about, I mean, take a look at the amount of the catalog of products that we have in the group. We have diminished them by almost a third from 10,000 products were down to less than 7,500, for example. We are changing completely the model we're doing a strong simplification. We're doing a lot of automation, but most importantly, by deploying the global platforms we are working together and spending less money on what we do every single day. So ONE Transformation is driving structural efficiency gains and operating leverage. Just a piece of that, the costs grew less than half of the revenue growth. We're delivering positive jobs that are helping to reduce the efficiency to 41.7%, which is 229 basis points lower than a year ago. This is placing us on track to meet the target being at 42% in '24. So we're going to be much better, and we believe that we're going to continue that. The new paradigm is focusing on absolute cost, okay? Our ambition is not to lower cost, it's exactly to lower cost in absolute euro million terms, which is quite important given all the different countries that we operate. It is true that costs are up 2.5%, but we look at the cost performance in real terms. In real terms, costs are down minus 1% year-on-year. That's a remarkable performance although the operating leverage with the strong declines that I described in retail, reflecting the transformation effort and the cost containment in consumer and payments, while we invest in the global platforms and continue to grow, all right? So the higher cost, as Jose explained, reflect also the currency depreciation and the seasonal effects, the salary agreements bonus accrual and CIB is the bulk because we're investing in the business to basically get out of it more revenue and is actually getting there. So in 2024, efficiency ratio is around 42%. We acknowledge this ratio is already at the level we committed for the '25 ID target and all the investments we have been doing will not only help maintain costs flat, but grew the revenue faster. So our ambition is, therefore, to do better than initially planned next year in '25 in the cost to income, as we described. So I don't know if that basically answers your questions.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you. We can take the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.\nFrancisco Riquel: Yes, hello. So thank you for the presentation and taking the questions. First one is on Motor Finance business in the U.K. I know that need time to analyze the recent ruling, but I wondered if you can give an indication of how big the provision needs, whether we are talking about hundreds, billions or and also the impact on the business? And my second question is on capital. If you can update on the regulatory impact spending for this year and next and also on the Basel III impact of up to 50 basis points on a fully loaded basis. Other banks have reduced the impact of the recent regulatory updates. So if you can also comment on this. Thank you.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you, Francisco. Okay. First of all, let me tell you that as you correctly said, it's not possible this time to reliably predict the financial impact of the ruling other elements that affect the financial impact on our accounts. This said, in any event, the potential impact is not expected to be material for the group's financial position, okay? It's very important, nor will affect the achievement of the group financial targets for '24. So if you make the numbers, and we are reiterating the guidance of above 16% that basically tells you where do we believe the number is, okay? So it's very important, and I will reiterate that again, that it will not change our '24 guidance. So that basically gives you a ballpark idea of what do we believe the number should be. I don't know, Jose, I left something out or I think it's quite clear know?\nJose Garcia Cantera: Yes, I think that's perfect.\nHector Grisi Checa: And in terms of -- why don't you go to the capital thing is?\nJose Garcia Cantera: Yes, remember that we estimated a supervisory charges to be between 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. We had 18 in the third quarter. We still believe that it's going to be this 20 to 30 basis points. So this doesn't change our target. So our target for capital for year-end, remember, since the beginning of the year has been between 1,240 to 1,250. We are at 1,250 in the upper end of the range, and we think we could -- we will close the year more or less at this level. For next year, day one Basel III impact basically close to zero, slightly negative or slightly positive, but it's not going to change much. So day one capital ratio for Santander under Basel III will be more or less the same with which we will end 2024 and the fully loaded. And when I mean fully loaded, I mean fully loaded, taking into account all the charges we expect up to 2033. So we are not excluding the 2029 to 2033 charges. So fully, fully, fully loaded, we think the impact is going to be 40 basis points, which means that we will be on day one above the 12% that we set as our target. Fully loaded capital above 12% on the day one fully loaded. Thank you, [indiscernible]. Next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAlvaro Serrano: So, can you hear me okay?\nJose Garcia Cantera: Yes, go ahead.\nAlvaro Serrano: Can you hear me? Yes, sorry. Yes, I just had two follow-up questions really, one on capital generation. So you've given basically a very limited impact for the next 10 years, which you're already at 12.5%. And with the mobilization you're doing on the balance sheet, it does look like you generate -- you're going to generate capital above the 12.5% you're currently sitting on. So the question is, as we think about '25, '26 are you willing to operate in a range of 12.5%, 13%, let's say? Or do you expect to grow into that 12.5% or would you consider sort of increasing distributing any excess or increasing the payout? I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that capital generation if we do have that excess capital generation? And on -- and I apologize to follow-up on the Santander U.K. that's the only explanation in my view, why the share price might be down this morning. You've been quoted Jose saying that it's less than \u20ac600 million. And I understand it's not an impact for 2024, but it might be an impact beyond that. So any details you can give us on the book if it's new cars, the size of the book or any details that make you confident that we're looking at a relatively manageable number, that would be great. Thank you.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you, Alvaro. Okay. Let me explain you a little bit what is very important. I mean, as you know, Jose explained exactly what we're doing in terms of rotating the balance sheet, okay? You've got to understand that we're changing completely the model of the bank in the world we used to. The bank used to consume a huge amount of RWAs to generate profits, okay? We're changing the model in a way. And the most important thing of that changing the model is becoming the number one bank to our clients. But becoming that, basically, you generate quite a lot of revenue by something different than just used RWAs in order to generate those. That basically explains you the good fees momentum that we're having. And you're going to continue to see that over in the future, all right? So if we continue changing this model use less capital to become actually much more profitable that basically will tell you that we could be able to accumulate much more capital that we're doing today, all right? We feel really comfortable that we can manage the bank very well at these levels of capital, but I do believe that we will be accumulating capital. Also, as we have a tremendous capacity to generate assets. We also have now with the asset desk in place to amend those capacity to move those assets out of the books, right? So -- and by the way, if you saw what Jose said, we are doing so and making money on top of it. Also, we're servicing, we're getting fees and servicing the assets that we sell. So it's over one in the sense. So the model of the bank is changing in that sense, and it's becoming much more profitable and less dependent on capital. So yes, I believe that capital generation will be much better, and we believe that we could be accumulating more capital on organic way in the future. On the U.K., Jose, I don't know if you want to also comment something on capital?\nJose Garcia Cantera: No, I think capital, you answered perfectly. Alvaro, the issue is complex. I think just let me remind you some of the things that we need to clarify in the next few months. We need to clarify the perimeter of commissions. We need to clarify the vintages because the ruling talks up between 2005 to 2024. The FCA focus is between 2014 to 2021, the percentage of redress, the claim rate, the compensatory interest. So there are many moving parts. The ruling has been taken to the Supreme Court. We expect the FCA report in May. So there are many moving parts. We are analyzing this. And obviously, we will make a very conservative assumption once we are able to come to a conclusion on all these variables that need to be put into the estimation. However, we are very confident that, as Hector explained the impact, and I'm talking about what we will charge in the next few weeks with this conservative approach, will not be material for the group, and we will still meet our objectives, our return on tangible equity target for the year, which is 16% or slightly above 16%. And that's all we can say. What happens with the FCA report in May, that's basically speculation. So obviously, we will make a decision based on the actual ruling based on if we have time to take into consideration the Supreme Court guidance on this, and in any case, obviously, the provisioning that we will take will be a conservative provision.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Alvaro. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Reale: Hi, good morning. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions from me, please. The first one is on the outlook for loan growth in Brazil. If I look at loans were flat quarter-on-quarter in local currency, which is perhaps not particularly encouraging for the NII outlook in the context of rate tax in the region. Can you talk about your expectations for loan growth here? And what this means for NII in Brazil? And maybe could you also please remind us what the time lag is with respect to repricing between assets and liabilities in Brazil, I understand your liability were price is much faster than assets. If you could remind us how many months in lag that is? And my second question is with respect to the U.S. profitability. I mean this is a part of your business that's negatively correlated to rates. You've been adding at least a number of investments or corporate bankers in the region, which is showing good momentum in fees. Could you maybe just talk us through the key P&L line items and if you see these numbers as sustainable going forward, please. Thank you.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you, Antonio. Let me go a little bit, I mean, through the Brazil situation, okay, to tell you a little bit what's going on. It's very important that you understand the following. In Brazil, also, we are changing a little bit the model that we have today. As you know, we used to use very hardly RWAs. We used to basically give out a lot of loans. Now we're changing a little bit the way we do things. We are basically focused on profitability, okay? Laser focus on profitability, which is basically changing a little bit of mix, also changing a little bit, I mean, the way we manage and we're managing the loan portfolio as a portfolio by division. We used to basically grow in every single segment. Now we're not doing so. We're basically looking at the segments that basically have the best profitability and the best cost of risk in equal. So we're being very choosy in the way we manage that and we're doing that all along the group. Also, we're very much focused on increasing the amount of clients and the amount of transactional clients that gives deposits and have their deposits with us, also their payrolls. And it's quite important to understand that, that basically is going to improve margins because we're improving the funding of overall of the franchise in Brazil, okay? NII, if you see this is good quarter, it's up more than 3% in the quarter. It is more than 22% in year-on-year. What's behind the performance, as I told you, healthy volume growth, changing the mix and the lower rates because we're doing and increasing the number of clients. If you remember in my presentation, I talked about the new onboarding that basically is very competitive and is basically getting us much more clients. It is true that the rate outlook has changed, but now the market is having some rate hikes that will mean the NII growth will be a bit less intense than we expected. And we thought at the beginning of the year. But nevertheless, we still expect Brazilian real to grow around the mid-teens marked by the end of '24, and we will have further growth in '25. And if we continue with our strategy and gaining clients and getting more deposits at a good place, I think we could be better off, okay? And let me take the opportunity also to flag the opportunity that Brazil has delivered almost a 17% RoTE. This is strong profitability improvement. It's not just reliant on NII growth, but also it's very important, the good delivery on fees because also, as I explained, we're becoming the number one bank to our clients. So selling other products, insurance, some of the things that are basically helping us out. Also, it's very important to take a look at the cost contention that we have had and also a stable cost of risk in the year. I believe that -- and I don't believe, I really remain very optimistic on Brazil and the ability to continue expanding its profitability through '25, okay? I don't know, Jose, if you'd like to go in detail in terms of the liabilities?\nJose Garc\u00eda Cantera: Yes. So liabilities in Brazil basically reprice automatically with interbank rates, almost 100% of the liabilities are linked to the interbank rates, 60% of the assets mature in 12 months. So that gives you a sensitivity of the positive sensitivity -- sorry, negative sensitivity we have to write in Brazil.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you. Let me go into the U.S., Antonio. So it's very important to understand, first of all, that we are not a full-fledged commercial bank in the U.S. We are focused on the businesses we are focused, okay? We are focused mainly in our consumer business. The consumer business, as you say has negative sensitivity to rates. That's exactly why we launched Openbank there. And we're also using SBNA, our commercial bank to fund that all right? We've been also changing the mix in a very strong way. I was looking at the numbers in terms of the new mix we have. And as you're talking about a mix that is 42% with FICOs really on the prime and near prime level, okay? And we're decreasing the amount of risk that we have to deep so prime and subprime. So that basically makes combination and it's going to give you a pretty good idea of what we're doing there. In terms of consumer, it's very important that you understand that, I mean, as you know, we are at scale player. We are also leveraging the relationship we have with the OEMs and we were able to capture very good agreements with INEOS, Lotus, Tesla and Mitsubishi. It's very important for you to understand that some of these changes in the P&L, you're not going to see them at the revenue level due to the fact that a lot of this is basically done, for example, on the electrical vehicles. And electrical vehicles, we're buying them because it's mostly leasing. So that basically tells you that it's not going to appear on the revenue line, but you see it on the page back we have on the tax that we get back for the electric vehicles. So that basically changes a little bit the outlook. But all in all, I really see that the U.S. will continue to thrive over the next year or so, okay? Also in the commercial side, the business is doing well. We have this expertise. We also you know that we have the JV with the FDIC, which has been tremendously successful and I think will continue so. I have had a solid performance. And then you talk about the CIB advisory services. CIB just grew 41% year-on-year in terms of the fees that we are collecting on that business. But also, you don't see how the U.S. is helping the rest of the business to thrive. If you take a look at the fees and CIB Europe also are being pushed up by all the businesses we are doing by using the U.S. teams to help us out, getting some of our new business that we didn't use to get. Also in Latin America, if you take a look at, for example, not just cross-border M&A, but if you take a look at what we've been doing in DCM, you will see that we have become one of the three most important players in DCM in that market just because of the expertise we got into the table. So when the Mexican UMS did a \u20ac7 billion transaction at the beginning of the year, we're one of the four banks, and we're the only non-American bank in the game. So those are the particular things that are happening to us given that now we have with the local strength that we have, we're combining the global expertise that we're bringing on to the table. And wealth or also, we have a leading brand in Latin America. That business is basically working as a Swiss clock. So I really do believe that the U.S. will continue to thrive very good outlook for '25 and really good numbers coming up in terms of the P&L we see there.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Antonio. The next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Marta Sanchez Romero from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMarta Sanchez Romero: Good morning. Thank you. My first question is the healthy leading market share in loan to deposit over the past year. We have basically made mandatory changes on top of the segment. Do you foresee a change of strategy we mean going more topical. But how do you see loan reposition going forward? My second question is on the U.S. deposits. So the cost and the volumes are flat in the quarter. We just only launched Openbank in the country. On your website, you said are paying 11x the national average for deposit? How much do you expect in terms of volumes to gain from your Openbank franchise and where do you see the cost above -- and just quickly [indiscernible] effective corporate tax rate for 2025. I understood that there are changes on the tax study. Thank you.\nHector Grisi Checa: We couldn't hear you the first question at all. So could you repeat that one. Sorry about that. And the second question was about the U.S., but we lost part of it.\nMarta Sanchez Romero: So quickly on Spain, Sorry, it's just like the -- sorry for that. So on Spain, you've been using market share now on deposit over the past year. You have made management changes at the top. So do you expect to change our strategy, more risk appetite? Where do you see loans and deposit -- deposits going forward in Spain? Secondly, in the U.S., so you've launched Openbank, so far, your volumes and cost of deposits are flat in the quarter. How much deposits do you expect to bring to the platform? And where do you see the cost going forward? And sorry, the effective tax rate in the U.S. Thank you. Sorry.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you, Martha. Let me go ahead. In terms of the manage changes we have done to Spain, basically, they're not going to change the plan that we had before is we're going to basically very much focus on profitability. That's number one. We're also changing the model. Spain is one of the most important places where we believe we have an opportunity on ONE Transformation, okay, due to the fact that we believe there is a huge opportunity of simplification, automation in what we have there. A lot of -- if you compare one of our branches for example in Portugal versus our branches in Spain, 90% of what we do in a branch in Portugal, it's basically taking care of clients. 50% of what we do in Spain is taking care of incidence problems, different situations, et cetera. So it's very important that we do that simplification and then transformation and automation that we need to do on the back in Spain, so we make our business much more reliable, much more efficient and with a much better cost structure. Thirdly, we are, as you know, deploying the global platforms and Spain is one of the places that we're going to be concentrated the most in the near term, all right? So it's quite important to understand that we will continue doing that and we will continue basically focusing on managing the deposit betas as we have done, right? So very much concentrated on that. Getting new clients. It's very important to acknowledge that for the seventh consecutive month, we have grown on clients in Spain in a mature market that basically tells you that the model is working that exactly we're delivering on what we believe is the right thing to do. So we will continue to do as we have been doing in the past in terms of transforming Spain in what we need to do, but also with global platforms, we're going to be able to be much more competitive, more and more efficient and better for our clients. Also, this structure of being the number one bank to our clients is very important in Spain because this basically will allow us to sell them more products. One product that is very important, and we are punching below our weight, is insurance, for example, in which some of our competitors are much more bigger than us in that sense. So there is a huge opportunity of where we can do that. Also, if you take a look on CIB. CIB, we have had a really interesting and important lever, given that we're using our U.S. teams to support what we're doing here in Spain. So that is helping us out quite a lot. And we've been actually number one in the market for the whole year. So Spain will continue, as we say. In terms of the tax rate in the U.S\u2026\nMarta Sanchez Romero: Yes, please.\nHector Grisi Checa: No, no. I wanted to talk a little bit, I mean, I believe that '24 in all in all, is going to be a strong year for Spain. We remain optimistic of NII. We see growing in high-single-digit, together with customer growth, as I told you, and higher transactionality. And will drive our revenue up about double-digit. The efficiency ratio will continue improving, and we see the cost of risk below 50 basis points by year-end, okay, and also strong improvements in RoTE to a level well above 20%. So Jose, if you would like to come into the U.S.\nJose Garc\u00eda Cantera: Just quickly, Marta. This year, the tax rate is going to be more or less close to zero. Actually, we're going to actually have a slight credit from the sale of EVs and from here, it should gradually normalize as we do less EVs and more contribution from other businesses. So we could think of like around 10% next year maybe 15% the next year. So gradually normalizing at that pace at more or less 10% next year, 15% in the following year.\nBegona Morenes: Okay, thanks. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank BPI. Please proceed.\nCarlos Peixoto: Yes. Hi, good morning. A couple of questions from my side as well. Firstly, on the U.K. NII outlook. We saw a good recovery in the third Q. We actually saw improvements in loan yields and also lower deposit costs. I was wondering if you see this trend prevailing into the fourth Q and into 2025. Should we expect margin expansion to prevail? Or should we expect it to stabilize the customer spread to stabilize more or less around these levels, just basically how do you see the outlook for NII in the U.K.? Then if I may pick up a bit on the interest rate sensitivity questions that were raised before. You mentioned that you lowered the NII sensitivity in 20% to 25% of what it was prior to the change in rate cycle. I was just wondering if you could update us on exactly where the sensitivity lies now particularly for Spain, but also for some of the larger geographies, that would be much appreciated. Thank you very much.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you, Carlos. Okay. On the U.K., I would like to tell you, I mean, I think it's one of the countries that we have one of the greatest opportunities in terms of ONE Transformation. We have a very good advantage of simplifying. That's something that we are very concentrated on also the automation of what we're doing there, we are actually lowering the amount of people that we have. We started the year with 20,000 people. We're going to end up with 18,000. So simplification and automation is well underway. And then as I said on the presentation, it's quite important that we already start deploying the global platforms. OneApp came in U.K. just about. We did the big bank and change all our clients there, and it's becoming really helpful in order to gain new clients helping us in the deposit base and also helping us in terms of NPS, okay? It is important to say that we believe that we have much better market economic dynamics, okay, lending activity, we see it picking up. We are very much also focused on profitability in that market as well. We see more rational behavior of the U.K. banks, better pricing on the new loans, plus better pricing of deposits. We are proactively managing deposits as I told you, first of all, with the new clients coming in with the new H [ph] account that we launched, that's been helping us. So we reiterate our view that NII will improve in the H2 versus H1, okay, as you have said. We're going to finish '24 with NII down only mid-single-digit instead of the minus 9% that we have reported in the first nine months, and we expect further rate cut in the remaining of '24. But the outlook of '25 is positive in the sense of what we have seen so far.\nJose Garc\u00eda Cantera: So Carlos, in terms of interest rate sensitivity. So let me comment for the main countries for the group as a whole first. In constant euros, as I said, we would expect NII to increase next year, maybe 2%, 3%. In Spain, you've seen a 2.5% interest rate in Europe for the mid of next year of 2025. We would expect a slight decrease in NII in Spain. In the U.K., as Hector just commented a slight increase in NII. In the U.S., we would expect high-single-digit increase; in Mexico, mid- to high single-digit increase; in Brazil, this is quite important. The outlook for interest rates in Brazil is really important to estimate the future evolution of NII, we expect average interest rates in Brazil next year to be around 11%, 11%, 11.5%, with this level of interest rates, NII in Brazil should be up mid-single-digits. And basically -- and finally, in DCB, also high single-digit increase with the level of interest rates that we just talked about. So as I said, if you compare these with the sensitivity in the way up that we had in the countries in Europe, for instance, or in DCB as interest rates were going up, the sensitivity we have in the way going down is significantly lower.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Carlos. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: Hi, thank you for taking my question. First of all, a question of extrapolation. Consensus is forecasting no growth of profits in 2025 versus 2024. You are currently growing profits at 14% year-on-year in the nine months. And I know you usually give guidance in February, but do you think 2025 profits will actually be above 2024 in your view? And the second is a follow-up on the capital aberration we've done before. I'm looking at Slide 23. With our regulatory headwinds, you would have built 35 basis points of capital in one quarter after distribution. Can you confirm with Q4, we should exhaust the bulk of the expected regulatory headwinds? And is the higher profitability than yielding to higher capital buildup versus the 10 basis points per quarter guidance that you have given us? Final thing is a clarification on Basel IV. Before you said that on day 1, CET1 should be flattish. If I remember correctly, there were 20 basis points of impacts this year that should have reversed with Basel IV adoption. Can you clarify that? Thank you.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you, Andrea. Let me give you a little of what we believe. First of all, I must tell you that I have great confidence that we'll deliver. And in some metrics like cost to income over deliver on the financial targets that we set on the Investor Day for the period of '23 to '25, okay. '25 will be better than '24. For '25, we expect to continue to grow revenues, especially fees, as I explained with the new mobile deployment that we're doing. We're going to further improve the operating leverage and we're going to deliver higher profitability. And we will do this how by leveraging further the global and network businesses, okay? We're putting a lot of focus on increasing the network effect. We're doing more with less. First of all, leveraging also our products and global factories, like, for example, from our corporate bank into our commercial banks, what we're doing between CIB and the commercial business on the midsized companies and SMEs. Also ONE Transformation is leveraging platforms that help reduce the cost to serve in retail. We're talking about minus 4% on year-to-year cost per active customer and 6% year-on-year revenue per active customer. So since the start of the program, the number of products, as I said before is down almost 36%, okay. 60% of the products are now digitally available to our customers. That's 9% points up since we started the program, right? In summary, the strategy and business model diversification, disciplined approach to capital allocation, we will, we believe deliver a consistent compound effect that will continue yielding positive results for the years to come. So all in all, yes. Jose, I don't know if you like to comment into the capital markets.\nJose Garcia Cantera: Yes, so let me give you all the components of the capital ratio. And I think you can make your own conclusions here. So on Page 23, we show 43 basis points of organic capital generation post AT1's cost of hedges, et cetera, which includes 19 basis points negative from organic risk-weighted asset growth, which is \u20ac8 billion growth partially neutralized by risk transfer initiatives of around 11 basis points or \u20ac5 billion. Remember that so far this year, we've mobilized \u20ac35 billion to \u20ac40 billion in terms of risk weighted assets. And on markets and others, we have 7 basis points from the sale of Poland. So with this, I think you can conclude both more or less the recurring capital generation, we will be able to have going forward. Obviously, the net risk-weighted asset growth, gross risk-weighted assets net of asset mobilization initiatives is the other key component. Obviously, that excess capital is being -- or that capital has been reinvested at 2.9% return on risk-weighted assets, but obviously risk capital that is being reinvested. Basel IV, you're right. The maturity will the impact -- the negative impact of the 21 basis points or 22 basis points we had in the first quarter of this year will reverse in the first quarter of next year, and this will compensate the other negative impacts, the one impacts that we have, mostly from technical adjustments to low default portfolios, corporate portfolios, et cetera. So net-net, it's obviously 0 is the net of some positives and some negatives. And amongst the positives is this 20 basis points from the maturity we used in derivatives transactions. You are right.\nBegona Morenes: Andrea, thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Cerezo: Hi, good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Sorry, I'm going to come back to capital in particular. If you can give us actually the path of those 40 basis points you have on a fully loaded basis, actually how those cater beyond actually over the next years? And specifically, how much of that is going to follow on 2025? I'm sorry, if you have referred to this actually, but just one clarification. And then related to this, going back basically to what Alvaro was asking before, I mean what is the preferred use of any potential excess capital that you're building you're thinking basically of accelerating growth, spending a little bit of that? Or is a question basically of also considering the possibility of increasing distributions? And then final, on the capital, actually, if I may. What kind of budget for SRTs actually you have per annum in the next two to three years, building up into your capital forecast? Thank you.\nJose Garcia Cantera: Okay. So the 40 basis points, as you remember, we are not affected by the output floor because we use lots of standard models. So that 72.5% limit to the benefit of internal models relative to standard models, we are not affected by that. That is backlog. That's what comes later from 2029 to 2033, if I'm not mistaken. We are mostly affected the 40 basis points is mostly the result of operational risk. That will come over the next four or five years, if I'm not mistaken. So that's how these 40 basis points are going to be added to the phasing in our case. I think Hector already answered the question about the excess capital and budget. On a recurring basis, obviously, the demand for private credit today is enormous. I'm not going to say it's infinite, but it's huge. So obviously, I don't think we are going to have this type of demand as interest rates come down, obviously. But we think that on a recurring basis, we should be able to mobilize somewhere between \u20ac35 billion to \u20ac55 billion in risk-weighted assets. Both obviously, SRTs will only be maybe a third of that, \u20ac15 billion a year. It's reasonable to assume that 10 to 15 will come from SRTs and the other will be from other types of hedges, another type of transactions, asset sales, et cetera, like we did this year. But on a recurring basis, with a more normalized market, \u20ac35 billion, \u20ac40 billion per year is like a reasonable number.\nBegona Morenes: Thank you, Ignacio. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSofie Peterzens: Yes, thank you for taking my question. This is Sofie from JPMorgan. Sorry, do you just go back to the organic capital generation. But on the analyst call that you hosted a few weeks ago, you said -- or you have said that you target net 0 risk-weighted assets growth and 15 basis points, organic capital generation per quarter, is that reasonable to assume going forward? And yes, that would basically be my first question. And then the second question is that M&A is the quite hot topic in Europe at this point in time, if you're going to generate more cash out going forward, how do you think about inorganic growth opportunities, what would be something that you could potentially consider in terms of kind of products or regions? And yes, if you could talk about your thinking about M&A? And then the last question would be around Brazil asset quality. I noticed that the NPL ratio ticked up 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and also coverage came down quite a lot in Brazil. How should we think about this? Thank you.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you, Sofie. Yes, I mean the answer is in organic capital generation, yes, you're right. I mean that's about it, okay? In terms of the inorganic opportunities, I do believe that we have a lot of organic opportunities within the group. I think that the chances and if you make some numbers in terms of what we could do by becoming best-in-class versus the best-in-class in every single market that we operate that basically tells you the huge opportunity that we have in front of us. And we will continue like that. We will concentrate on our changes on the go-to model of the bank. I mean, it's a process that is going to take us at least the next 24 months in order to have also the global platform set in place, et cetera. So we're very much concentrated on that, okay? And that's exactly what all the focus of the group is today. In terms of the Brazil asset quality, as you have seen, I mean, as you have seen, basically, first of all, I must tell you that we have very strong revenue performance, okay? Solid evolution on cost, okay, flat quarter-on-quarter. But we have a really resilient behavior of the credit quality. Cost of risk is stable at 4.78% and the more recent vintages are performing well, and we don't have any signs of deterioration. It's very important that you acknowledge what I explained at the beginning in terms of the change of mix and the change of the work we're looking at the Brazilian portfolio, okay? So as I was telling you before, we used to grow in every single segment of the market. Today, we're not doing so. We're much more focused on profitability and also on the cost of risk that we have. So you're going to see a much better performance of Brazil over the next years because we're exactly doing so, all right? So it's quite important that you see that and you're going to see basically that the outlook that we have for ours towards the end of '24 is a stable cost of risk versus '23 around 4.6%. And as I said, I mean, with the new changes that we're putting in place, et cetera, I think the vintages will perform much better than we expected, okay?\nBegona Morenes: Okay, thanks, Sofie. The next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Britta Schmidt from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nBritta Schmidt: Yes, thank you for taking my questions. A few clarifications. When you talk about earnings growth, does that apply to current euros as well? I'm just asking you regard it, 2%, 3% NOI growth next year in constant euros, and it might be a little bit lower in current euros and that I think would have to drive most of the revenues to deliver positive growth. And then a clarification on the rates. You mentioned 2.5% for Europe. Is that what you expect for the full-year then as well? Or the average expectation for the year? And then lastly, on Portugal on the net interest income, it declined significantly this year as we saw a big deposit cost increase. Is that just a catch-up where the competition and where do you expect deposit cost to go in the future? Thank you.\nJose Garc\u00eda Cantera: So yes, we would expect fee income next year to grow mid-single-digits with cost fairly flattish. So yes, we would expect revenue, operating income to actually increase next year. In terms of interest rates, well, we think 2.5% is the rate that we expect by midyear and then maybe one drop -- one cut more in the second half of the year. So we do not see 2% as a terminal rate in Europe right now. Obviously, we'll see. But in our case, we are not as negative as the market or positive, depending on how you look at it in terms of interest rates. And then cost of deposits, Britta you referred to countries like which countries, Spain, in particular. Sorry, I didn't get who -- which country you were referring to. So we will get back to you after the call. Carlos will give you a call and clarify that. But let me just very quickly in Spain. Obviously, the betas that we ended up this year having this year were much, much lower than the ones that we expected. So we manage our cost of deposits pretty well. Basically, thanks to avoiding the transfer of current accounts to time deposits. As rates come down, those parts of the current accounts that are tied to interbank rates or the Euribor, basically private banking, corporate banking and the large corporations is adjusting as well. So going forward, we should see actually a positive contribution from year-on-year deposit cost in Spain from '24 to '25. Other Euro countries in Portugal, the situation is a little bit more extreme. So in Portugal, we would expect NII to actually go down a little bit more than in Spain next year because there, obviously, the situation is a little bit more extreme than it is in Spain. Thanks, Britta. Next question, please.\nOperator: It comes from the line of Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Hallam: I just have just one question left, and thank you for the color on 2025 NII rate sensitivity. So it's a bit of a follow-up question, but is the sensitivity to lower euro rates linear as rates move lower? Or would the negative drag on NII be larger on European rates if we start to move below your expectations or below 2% policy rates. You mentioned earlier 2.5% at the midyear 2.25% by the end of next year. Would we need to recalibrate the sensitivity if we start to get towards 2% or below 2%?\nJose Garc\u00eda Cantera: Chris, thank you. It also depends on how steep or flat the curve is, a curve that flattens would have a more negative impact on margins that curve that remains steep. So obviously, if rates go well below 2% and approach 0, obviously, from 2 to 0, the impact on margins is greater than from 4% to 2%. So it's not linear. But if rates stay between 2% and 2.5%, I think we are going to have a pretty good outlook in terms of NII because again, the cost of deposits at those levels will gradually approach 0, basically, and we will have at least that 2% to 2.5% margin on the asset side.\nBegona Morenes: Thanks Chris. And the final question, please.\nOperator: The last question comes from the line of Hugo Cruz from KBW. Please go ahead.\nHugo Cruz: Hi, thanks so much for the time. Three quick clarifications, if I may. So first, trading income in Brazil has been quite weak now for a couple of quarters to be negative. Can you give any guidance there? Second, the corporate center NII, should we expect a positive number in Q4? Or again, any guidance you could give? Third, I heard you on the tax rate for the U.S. What does that mean for the group? So can you give guidance on the group tax rate? Thank you.\nJose Garc\u00eda Cantera: Thank you, Hugo. in terms of the trading income, okay, it's in any case, very small in the context of Brazil. Total revenue in -- Brazil's total revenue and it shall not overshadow the very strong operating performance in the quarter and in the improvement in profitability, okay? The client-related trading income has had a strong performance in Q3, okay? However, recent market volatility around the Brazilian real and the yield curve led to an important deterioration in local assets during Q2, following Q3, but we have stabilized those, and I believe that the outlook would be much better. This is a challenging market environment, and we've been basically offsetting this during Q3, and I believe Q4 is going to be much better. NII for the Corporate Center, NII in the corporate center should gradually decrease because of the remuneration of the liquidity that we have at the corporate center. So you should expect NII to reflect the lower rates on the liquidity that we hold at group level. And finally, the tax rate for the group, it should be fairly flat next year, maybe that's below what it will be this year, but just marginally. So for model purposes, we use the same tax rate in '25 than we will have in '24, same tax rate. And I think we've answered all the questions. Thank you very much, everybody. Investor Relations, myself, Hector are at your disposal to answer any follow-up questions that you may have. Looking forward to seeing you over the next few weeks on one-on-ones. And we'll talk to you again for the fourth quarter earnings in January. Thanks, everybody.\nHector Grisi Checa: Thank you very much. Bye-bye.",

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi Checa",
        "text": "Thank you very much, Jose. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's presentation, as always, first, I will talk about our results in the context of our strategy, then Jose will review our financial performance in greater detail, and then I will conclude with some final messages as Jose said, we will then open the floor for all your questions. So the main highlights of our results in this first are the following: Q3 was another record quarter for Santander, which continues to demonstrate the benefits from the execution of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reached \u20ac3.3 billion, 12% above the Q3 on '23, on the back of a solid franchise of 171 million customers that continues to increase as we improve our customer experience through simplification, automation and leverage of our global platforms. Profit reached \u20ac9.3 billion in the first nine months, also a record of 14%, supported by strong customer revenue growth across regions and all the global businesses. We achieved this as we invest for the future, and we continue to make excellent progress towards a simpler and more integrated model, which has helped us to improve our efficiency by 229 basis points and increased our RoTE to 16.2%. Finally, our balance sheet remained solid with a sound capital ratio and robust credit quality and contributed to the strong profitable growth, shareholder value creation, and attractive remuneration. Dividend per share increased by 14% and the cash dividend per share will be 39% higher in '24. Going into more detail into our income statement. As always, we present growth rates in both current and constant euros. This quarter, there were no material differences between them year-on-year, but as Jose will explain later there are most significant on the quarter-on-quarter. Our P&L remains strong from top to bottom. Number one, strong top-line supported by all our businesses and regions, NII fees, both at record levels accounted for over 95% of total income, driving the vast majority of our revenue growth. Number two, expenses grew below revenue and inflation, showcasing the possible effects of our transformation -- sorry, the positive effects of our transformation. Three, loan-loss provisions were fairly in line with average lending and credit quality also had an excellent performance. All in all, as shown over time, our results are sustainable and less volatile than peers due to our business and geographical diversification, the high quality of our revenues and a prudent approach to risk. We are on track to exceed the targets we set in January and upgraded in July. Solid business dynamics reported high-single digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved as we accelerate ONE Transformation and increased operational leverage. Cost of risk is expected to remain in line with our '24 target on the back of active risk management, strong labor markets and interest rates dropping in most of our countries. As a reference, year-to-date cost of risk improved to 1.14% even with the additional provisions in Poland in Q2. Our CET1 ratio ended September at 12.5%, and we are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation fully loaded. And our RoTE is already above the target we set for the end of the year. Our execution of ONE Transformation continues to boost our operational leverage, structurally improving both revenue and cost performances, simplifying and automating processes and our active spread management have already contributed 259 basis points of efficiencies, since we started surpassing the levels, which we expected to reach at the end of '25. Our global businesses continue to drive the group's profitability and have delivered 82 basis points in efficiency gains. Finally, our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated 72 basis points inefficiencies so far. Remember that we are focused on going back to basics, offering the best products and user experience to our customers and boosting operational leverage through our global platforms to support value creation for our shareholders based on profitable growth with minimal volatility. This is already reflected in the great performance of our businesses. All of them showed solid revenue growth, retail and consumer and will strongly improve our efficiency ratio, leading to higher RoTE, while CIB and payments reflect our efforts to develop new products and global platforms which has started to deliver results. This is a fantastic example of how our model works. Higher interest rates benefit some of our retail franchises, while other parts of our business perform better under different circumstances. But overall our combination of highly diversified businesses allows us to deliver consistent profitable growth and value creation. The global businesses and the cross collaboration are helping us to extract the full potential from our unique combination of local leadership and global capabilities with a cost of infrastructure that delivers efficiency and scalability. This allows us to reach our '25 profitability targets. In retail, which is at the heart of our banking business, we are working to become the number one bank for customers. Let's look at how ONE Transformation is delivering results. Innovation is key. We're enhancing our digital onboarding and promoting simpler customer journey and better experiences across the bank. For example, in Brazil, we have reduced onboarding time by 50%, which has contributed to a 3% customer growth only this quarter. We are progressing fast towards a common operating model across our banks, which together with automation and digitalization, free stop time of our people to focus on commercial activities on our branches. Dedication of resources to non-commercial activities has dropped by 11%, since we started with ONE Transformation. Deployment of our global platform remains on track. And for example, in the U.K., customer has been migrated to our global app that already operates in Spain, Portugal, Poland and Openbank with great success. As a result, our profit grew 29% year-on-year, with RoTE up 400 basis points to 18.5% on the back of revenue up close to double-digit on good performance of NII and fees with all regions growing especially Europe and South America. Cost is well under control, down 5% in real term, reflecting structural benefits from our transformation and provisions improving and the cost of risk fairly stable at really comfortable levels. Going forward, our improvements in customer experience, the implementation of a common operating model and the deployment of our global tech platform will drive additional customer growth, better efficiency and profitability. In consumer, our priority is to continue expanding our leadership across all our footprint. Our best-in-class global solutions are integrated into our partners' processes. For example, we have integrated our front in Hyundai systems, providing our customers the best digital experience, faster credit approval and time to pay. We are making great progress in our deposit strategy to increase NII stability and reduce the funding cost. Deposits increased 12% year-on-year on the back of our deposit gathering platforms. The deployment of global platforms is key to scale of business, reduce our cost to serve and improve profitability. Last Monday, we reached an important milestone in the U.S. with the nationwide launch of Openbank. In the last four weeks, we have already gathered around \u20ac200 million in deposits and welcomed over 7,000 clients. We also launched Zinia, a co-branded card with Amazon in Germany, and we are deploying a new operational functionality. Consumer continues to grow a strong operational leverage with a 9% net operating income increase and some profit growth on the back of, number one, strong revenue with solid NII performance and 25% fee growth; number two, cost falling 2% in real terms, thanks to our transformation efforts, even as we continue to invest in growth; and third, LLP is normalizing in Europe and in the U.S. in line with expectations. Overall, we continue to see positive operating trends, and we expect them to improve on the back of lower rates and volume growth. We are building a world-class CIB business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to grow profit, while maintaining the same low risk profile. Number one, we are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the U.S., building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across group. Revenue in CIB in the U.S. rose 41% year-on-year and is expected to boost cross-border revenue across the group as we continue to progress on our U.S. build-out initiative. We continue to execute our global markets plan, which is starting to pay off with institutional sales doubling in Europe and more than tripling in the U.S. Number two, we're expanding and sophisticating our centers of expertise, while strengthening our financial sponsor franchise, which is leading to business opportunities in M&A, capital markets and GTB across the group and continues to pay off with several first deals. This quarter, for example, for the first time, we were appointed sole bookrunner for an IPO of a SPAC, and we acted as the lead left underwriter in an LBO transaction with one of the largest industrial focused investment firms and these are just a few examples of a long list. Third, we are driving cross-border revenues on the back of enhanced client solutions and global collaboration. We had a great number of cross-border deals in Q3 such as also resulting from the collaboration of our teams in Mexico and Spain, France and Brazil, Peru and Mexico or Italy and France, among others. CIB reached solid results with revenue up 9% after a record '23 making the first nine months the best ever fees growing at double-digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from client flows. And the best is still to come. Growth will accelerate going forward as we continue to execute our strategy on a global basis. Moving on to Wealth. We continue to build the best wealth and insurance manager in Europe and the Americas. How? Number one, by improving customer relationships through the best customer service and right solutions resulting in double-digit growth in private banking customer and fees. We are shifting our product offering towards value-added solutions, such as discretionary portfolio management, advisory and alternative investments, and this has also supported Spain double-digit increase in the number of private banking customers and a 22% total revenue growth. Number two is promoting collaboration with other businesses, especially with retail and CIB, which is a major driver for growth and allow us to capture network benefits. Collaboration fees increased by 13% year-on-year. Number three is developing global platforms across all the businesses and digitalizing our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and really promote growth. Good examples of this are the recent implementation of a single operating platform from alternative products and the deployment of San Conecta in Mexico and Brazil, which boost the distribution network capabilities and provides real-time information about funds and markets. In summary, we are accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. Attributable profit rose 15% on the back of a strong activity and fees growing at double-digit across the three businesses. Finally, efficiency improved 210 basis points year-on-year and RoTE rose 400 basis points to 81%. Finally, payments. As I already advanced last quarter, we have a unique position on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-wide and merchant acquiring. In merchant, we are one of the largest acquirers in Latin America, Spain and Portugal, with the right balance between growth and profitability. Get the total payments volume and PagoNxt open market revenue keeps growing strongly, which is helping us to consolidate our presence in core market, such as Brazil and Mexico, where we maintain a leadership position. And at the same time, we build up market share in fast-growing markets, such as Chile, where we recently launched Getnet. Our payments hub already processes all type of payments, for example, credit transfers, direct debits or instant payments and international payments for several countries and businesses. We have already migrated 800 million transactions this year. This is 5x more than the same period last year. Also, we continue to deploy part our global cards platform. In Brazil, we currently manage more than 8 million debit cards through [indiscernible], and we are on track to full migration by Q2 '25 to manage around 17 million total cards. In a second phase, we will start with the credit card portfolio. At the same time, we continue to boost our cards proposition through our Risk Data Lab, our solution based on AI. Payments delivered strong results with good revenue trends in both businesses, cost under control and sound credit quality in cards, which drove to a 10% profit growth, excluding the non-recurring items with cost in Q2. PagoNxt EBITDA margin improved to 23% backed by Getnet with one of the best ratios among our competitors. We expect cost efficiency and CapEx optimization to continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. Our capital ratio has improved this year from 12.3% to 12.5% backed by strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and shareholder remuneration. As a result, we continue to grow our value creation, which in terms of TNAV plus EPS increased 14%, which represents around \u20ac10 billion year-on-year, and we are increasing our shareholder remuneration. In September, the Board of Directors approved an interim distribution against H1 '24 results, which is being executed in two equal parts, a cash dividend of \u20ac0.10 per share, which will be paid from the 1st of November and a share buyback program up to \u20ac1.5 billion. This is currently underway. Cash dividend will be 39% higher in '24, and at the same time, since '21, if we include the full amount of the current share buyback program, Santander we have repurchased 12.5% of its outstanding shares. I'll leave you now with Jose, who will get going our financial performance in more detail."

        "speaker": "Jose Garcia Cantera",
        "text": "Thank you, Hector. Let me go into more detail the P&L and the capital. As Hector has mentioned, we are yet again reporting record results as our transformation continues to drive operational leverage. Revenue grew 8% on the back of the highest NII and fees in our history and the best efficiency ratio in the last years, boosting the net operating income, which rose 13% year-on-year. Provisions grew only slightly even after the expected normalization in consumer and the Swiss franc provisions in Poland, we recorded in the second quarter, while cost of risk fell in the quarter. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the upward trend in profit, which grew 1% quarter-on-quarter in euros, 5% in constant euros, driven mainly by customer revenue and lower provisions. This quarter, there is an effect from the depreciation of some currencies affecting the quarter-on-quarter comparison, but as you can see in the P&L, the impact year-on-year is not material. Please remember that the last quarter, we decided to take a more conservative approach to value -- to recognizing the value of the results obtained in Argentina. So we began to apply an inflation adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso, which in the quarter was 1,618 compared to the official exchange rate of 1,069 to the euro. And obviously, this is a much more conservative exchange rate than the one used by our peers. This approach caused some distortions in the quarter-on-quarter comparison that I will comment during the presentation only where relevant. Total revenue increased 8% with all businesses and regions growing driven by customer revenue growth, which made up more than 90% of total revenue. This strong growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which continues to grow close to double-digits with good performance in NII and fees, especially in the Americas and also by CIB growing across the three lines of business on the back of good activity levels, mainly in global banking and markets. Consumer revenue also rose supported in this case by volumes and active asset repricing and double-digit growth in fees across our geographies. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, both in private banking and in asset management. Payments is growing at good trends, showing relatively good underlying performance. As both PagoNxt and cards increased, even more so if we exclude the onetime positive fee recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year. Finally, the Corporate Centre's revenue improved on the back of less negative impact from FX hedging. Turning to NII, net interest margin. Most of our revenue came from net interest income, which increased 9% year-on-year, supported by all our businesses and regions, basically due to active price management, particularly in retail in Europe and in consumer and higher volumes and the benefits from negative sensitivity to rates in South America -- in retail, South America, which is now very evident, especially in Brazil and Chile and also good activity levels in our Global Banking business in CIB. NII was resilient quarter-on-quarter, rising 1% in constant euros in a new interest rate environment, particularly driven by retail, but it was up 2% with the vast majority of our countries positively contributing in the quarter, especially Brazil, driven by higher average volumes, Poland due to better spreads and higher volumes and the U.K. supported by good price management. In terms of profitability, we improved our net interest margin year-on-year. This is explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spread focusing on profitability, not market share, which more than outweighed higher funding costs. We were able to contain thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration in Europe and deposit repricing downwards in South America. As we commented last quarter, we have seen a slight deceleration in net interest margin and net interest income in line with our expectations. Please remember that the decrease in net interest margin in the second quarter was due to the prudent adjustment we made to the exchange rate in Argentina. And this quarter, net interest margin was also affected by the hyperinflation account in Argentina and the depreciation of the real and the Mexican peso and to a lesser extent, the beginning of a new interest rate cycle in Europe. Over the last few quarters, we have gradually adapted the sensitivity of our balance sheet to position for this new monetary policy cycle. This and the positive contribution we expect from our consumer businesses put us in a good condition, in a good position to mitigate the effects of margin compression expected in Europe and North America going forward. In an environment of low credit demand in general, we generated another record in fee income, reflecting our transformation efforts to promote connectivity across the group and provide the best customer service. Retail increased as more customers chose Santander as the primary financial service provider. We added 5 million new customers over the last 12 months to a total of 171 million customers. Outstanding performance in consumer, largely driven by increased insurance penetration in Europe. CIB also grew from record levels last year, especially in the U.S. on the bank of strong dynamics in Global Banking. We had a 16% increase in wealth, with all three businesses growing at double-digits, and payments was impacted, as I mentioned before, by the one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter in 2023 in Brazil. Our transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model continued to deliver structural efficiency gains. Our cost-to-income ratio for the nine month period improved to 41.7%, the best level that we have reported in the last 15 years, one of the best in the sector and is already at better levels than the guidance we provided for 2024. Costs declined 1% year-on-year in real terms despite the lagged effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs on our investments in transformation. By business, costs remain very well under control in retail and consumer, which represents 70% of our cost base. More than 90% of the nominal cost increase came from CIB as per our strategy to reinforce our CIB franchise. Costs remain contained in wealth, even with higher commercial activity and were fairly flat in payments even as we invest in global platforms. As we look ahead, structural improvements from our new operating model, which help us achieve our target of maintaining cost to income at around 42% in 2024, while it should improve further next year. Credit quality remains robust, around and across our footprint in line with our expectations with record low unemployment rates in most countries and easing monetary policies. Credit quality improved year-on-year as reflected both in the NPL ratio and lower coverage needs. The NPL portfolio has collateral guarantees and provisions that account for 90% of its total exposure. 12-month cost of risk improved to 1.18%. In our retail and consumer, 12-month cost of risk improved in the quarter. In retail, there were some underlying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved across Europe and remained at very low levels in the U.K. and Portugal. In Brazil, it fell for the second quarter in a row. And in Mexico, it also declined in the quarter following a year of expected normalization. Similarly, in consumer, 12-month cost of risk was impacted year-on-year by the normalization we expected, but it dropped in the quarter to 2.12%. The cost of risk in the first nine months of the year was 1.14%, putting us in good position to end the year comfortably within our target of 1.2%. Finally, turning to capital. Our fully loaded capital ratio remains at a comfortable level backed by strong organic capital generation and significant risk-weighted asset mobilization. This quarter, we generated 43 basis points organically on the back of 52 basis points from profit generation partially offset by risk-weighted asset growth and by minorities, we recorded a 26 basis point charge for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout policy. We had 18 basis points of regulatory charges, mostly related to model updates in low default portfolios. And finally, we had positive impacts from the placement of Santander, Poland and ALCO portfolio valuations, which were offset by impacts on deductions, pensions in the most part -- for the most part. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital profitability and productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.9% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above that of our back book at 16%. Our centralized asset management desk, which aims to optimize capital deployment is achieving outstanding results. In the first nine months of the year, we have disposed of an amount of capital equivalent to \u20ac40 billion in risk-weighted assets, the cost of capital of half of that of new originations. In addition, one-third of our balance sheet that matures every year is being substituted by more profitable new business. The combination of these actions explains the expanding profitability and resilient capital ratio. That's all from my side. Hector, back to you. Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Jose. It is important to say that our progress towards the targets we set for '25 in our last Investor Day is ahead of plan as we continue to leverage our unique competitive advantages and excellent execution of our strategy by our teams. Sound CET1 levels and strong execution of our capital allocation plans, further improving our profitability to about 16% and delivering 14% value creation and increased remuneration to our shareholders. In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are evident. Q3 was another record quarter on the back of strong customer revenue with all regions and businesses contributing, which results in the best nine months profit ever with all-time high NII fees and net operating income at a 19% EPS growth. Sustained progress in our structural changes towards a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale is driving both higher revenue and lower cost to achieve the vast efficiency ratio we have reported for the last 15 years. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder value creation. As a result, we remain on track to exceed the '24 targets we set in January and upgraded last quarter, and we are in a great position to continue growing, increasing profitability and delivering shareholder value creation. The progress of the last 10 years to simplify and align our model in all our businesses and now deploy our own tech stack is already evident. And as we continue to execute our strategy, we will deliver on primary target of double-digit TNAV per share plus EPS growth through the cycle. And now we're very happy to take your questions.

        "text": "Let me give it a first keep and then Jose basically could be give you a better idea. It's interesting to see that if you see NII in constant, you'll see that it's 1% up, okay? The effect of Argentina is the one that's hitting us in the current euros, okay? It is important to explain, first of all, that the sensitivity of our balance sheet to movements in rates is mostly concentrated in retail and commercial business. This is about 60% of the group balance sheet with some parts showing a really positive sensitivity in Europe and other is a negative one like the one we have in Brazil, as we already know. Europe and Brazil concentrate about 80% to 90% of the rate exposure. Over the past few quarters, we have been very proactively managing and working to reduce the sensitivity of the different balance sheets and position them to lower its environments. For example, in the case of Europe, we have reduced the sensitivity to around 25%. That's one quarter of what was at the beginning of the rate cycle. In places like Brazil, for example, we are taking measures to reduce the sensitivity further by doing some things to the ALCO and also taking some hedges. As you have already seen this year, the retail business is operating leverage is 10 points. We are growing the top line, not just because of higher interest rates, but also because we're changing the operating model, which is the most important part that you guys need to concentrate. We're growing customers, for example, 2.6 million in the third quarter alone. And we are keeping costs flat, which is quite important because that's creating an operating leverage and improving our margins. And this basically think that we will continue improving thanks to, first of all, the geographical and business diversification, the strong focus on capital allocation and the strong focus on profitability that we have up to this point. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement on the margins and then we'll take on cost."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia Cantera",
        "text": "Yes, definitely. Thanks, Hector. So let me explain Argentina in a bit more detail. In June, we used an exchange rate of 1,499 and we explained at the time that we are devaluating depreciating the exchange rate with inflation, independent of the official exchange rate. The official exchange rate as of now is 1,069. for the quarter -- for the end of the quarter, we used 1,618. And remember that when you use 1,618 inflation accounting, you adjust backwards all the accounts to that exchange rate. So we have two impacts on our P&L. One, there is over \u20ac100 million negative quarter-on-quarter increase in the monetary position that comes in other income. And in Argentina, as interest rates come down, and we have a very liquid balance sheet and is invested mostly in bonds. The yield earned on this bond portfolio is lower. And quarter-on-quarter, it is over \u20ac200 million drop in local currency, when you look at local currency, there is over \u20ac200 million drop in the yield coming from these investments. So Argentina actually explains most of the drop in net interest income quarter-on-quarter, but also it means around \u20ac300 million -- over \u20ac300 million impact on total revenue. So as Hector explained, we have been reducing our sensitivity to rates, both in euros and in Brazil, which obviously outside Europe is the highest sensitivity we have. In Europe, we have been buying an increase in the ALCO portfolio. If we look at the total euro ALCO portfolio we have, which is Spain, Portugal and the consumer finance. We have \u20ac50 billion in euro government bonds with an average maturity of over six years and a yield of 3.2%, 3.3%. The second action we took was to float the liabilities, the market liabilities, and we also hedged the repricing of our mortgages in Spain by signing some forward stocks. So this has reduced the sensitivity of the net interest income in euros quite significantly to around a quarter of the sensitivity we had prior to entering this cycle of higher rates. In Brazil, we did the opposite. In Brazil, we are changing the mix of the liabilities and also floating the assets. Net-net, when we look into 2025, for 2024, we see NII down a little bit in current euros, but we see NII up in constant euros. Thanks to these measures that we have discussed. And these estimates are based on forward curve rates -- forward rate curves, sorry."

        "text": "Thank you, Jose. Ignacio, in terms of cost, it's very important that you understand the following. This is not about a cost cutting exercise. This is about changing the model and the go-to model. We're basically introducing in the whole group. He's talking about, I mean, take a look at the amount of the catalog of products that we have in the group. We have diminished them by almost a third from 10,000 products were down to less than 7,500, for example. We are changing completely the model we're doing a strong simplification. We're doing a lot of automation, but most importantly, by deploying the global platforms we are working together and spending less money on what we do every single day. So ONE Transformation is driving structural efficiency gains and operating leverage. Just a piece of that, the costs grew less than half of the revenue growth. We're delivering positive jobs that are helping to reduce the efficiency to 41.7%, which is 229 basis points lower than a year ago. This is placing us on track to meet the target being at 42% in '24. So we're going to be much better, and we believe that we're going to continue that. The new paradigm is focusing on absolute cost, okay? Our ambition is not to lower cost, it's exactly to lower cost in absolute euro million terms, which is quite important given all the different countries that we operate. It is true that costs are up 2.5%, but we look at the cost performance in real terms. In real terms, costs are down minus 1% year-on-year. That's a remarkable performance although the operating leverage with the strong declines that I described in retail, reflecting the transformation effort and the cost containment in consumer and payments, while we invest in the global platforms and continue to grow, all right? So the higher cost, as Jose explained, reflect also the currency depreciation and the seasonal effects, the salary agreements bonus accrual and CIB is the bulk because we're investing in the business to basically get out of it more revenue and is actually getting there. So in 2024, efficiency ratio is around 42%. We acknowledge this ratio is already at the level we committed for the '25 ID target and all the investments we have been doing will not only help maintain costs flat, but grew the revenue faster. So our ambition is, therefore, to do better than initially planned next year in '25 in the cost to income, as we described. So I don't know if that basically answers your questions."

First one is on Motor Finance business in the U.K. I know that need time to analyze the recent ruling, but I wondered if you can give an indication of how big the provision needs, whether we are talking about hundreds, billions or and also the impact on the business? And my second question is on capital. If you can update on the regulatory impact spending for this year and next and also on the Basel III impact of up to 50 basis points on a fully loaded basis. Other banks have reduced the impact of the recent regulatory updates. So if you can also comment on this. Thank you."

First of all, let me tell you that as you correctly said, it's not possible this time to reliably predict the financial impact of the ruling other elements that affect the financial impact on our accounts. This said, in any event, the potential impact is not expected to be material for the group's financial position, okay? It's very important, nor will affect the achievement of the group financial targets for '24. So if you make the numbers, and we are reiterating the guidance of above 16% that basically tells you where do we believe the number is, okay? So it's very important, and I will reiterate that again, that it will not change our '24 guidance. So that basically gives you a ballpark idea of what do we believe the number should be. I don't know, Jose, I left something out or I think it's quite clear know?"

      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia Cantera",
        "text": "Yes, remember that we estimated a supervisory charges to be between 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. We had 18 in the third quarter. We still believe that it's going to be this 20 to 30 basis points. So this doesn't change our target. So our target for capital for year-end, remember, since the beginning of the year has been between 1,240 to 1,250. We are at 1,250 in the upper end of the range, and we think we could -- we will close the year more or less at this level. For next year, day one Basel III impact basically close to zero, slightly negative or slightly positive, but it's not going to change much. So day one capital ratio for Santander under Basel III will be more or less the same with which we will end 2024 and the fully loaded. And when I mean fully loaded, I mean fully loaded, taking into account all the charges we expect up to 2033. So we are not excluding the 2029 to 2033 charges. So fully, fully, fully loaded, we think the impact is going to be 40 basis points, which means that we will be on day one above the 12% that we set as our target. Fully loaded capital above 12% on the day one fully loaded. Thank you, [indiscernible]. Next question, please?"

So you've given basically a very limited impact for the next 10 years, which you're already at 12.5%. And with the mobilization you're doing on the balance sheet, it does look like you generate -- you're going to generate capital above the 12.5% you're currently sitting on. So the question is, as we think about '25, '26 are you willing to operate in a range of 12.5%, 13%, let's say? Or do you expect to grow into that 12.5% or would you consider sort of increasing distributing any excess or increasing the payout? I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that capital generation if we do have that excess capital generation? And on -- and I apologize to follow-up on the Santander U.K. that's the only explanation in my view, why the share price might be down this morning. You've been quoted Jose saying that it's less than \u20ac600 million. And I understand it's not an impact for 2024, but it might be an impact beyond that. So any details you can give us on the book if it's new cars, the size of the book or any details that make you confident that we're looking at a relatively manageable number, that would be great. Thank you."

      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi Checa",
        "text": "Thank you, Alvaro. Okay. Let me explain you a little bit what is very important. I mean, as you know, Jose explained exactly what we're doing in terms of rotating the balance sheet, okay? You've got to understand that we're changing completely the model of the bank in the world we used to. The bank used to consume a huge amount of RWAs to generate profits, okay? We're changing the model in a way. And the most important thing of that changing the model is becoming the number one bank to our clients. But becoming that, basically, you generate quite a lot of revenue by something different than just used RWAs in order to generate those. That basically explains you the good fees momentum that we're having. And you're going to continue to see that over in the future, all right? So if we continue changing this model use less capital to become actually much more profitable that basically will tell you that we could be able to accumulate much more capital that we're doing today, all right? We feel really comfortable that we can manage the bank very well at these levels of capital, but I do believe that we will be accumulating capital. Also, as we have a tremendous capacity to generate assets. We also have now with the asset desk in place to amend those capacity to move those assets out of the books, right? So -- and by the way, if you saw what Jose said, we are doing so and making money on top of it. Also, we're servicing, we're getting fees and servicing the assets that we sell. So it's over one in the sense. So the model of the bank is changing in that sense, and it's becoming much more profitable and less dependent on capital. So yes, I believe that capital generation will be much better, and we believe that we could be accumulating more capital on organic way in the future. On the U.K., Jose, I don't know if you want to also comment something on capital?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia Cantera",
        "text": "No, I think capital, you answered perfectly. Alvaro, the issue is complex. I think just let me remind you some of the things that we need to clarify in the next few months. We need to clarify the perimeter of commissions. We need to clarify the vintages because the ruling talks up between 2005 to 2024. The FCA focus is between 2014 to 2021, the percentage of redress, the claim rate, the compensatory interest. So there are many moving parts. The ruling has been taken to the Supreme Court. We expect the FCA report in May. So there are many moving parts. We are analyzing this. And obviously, we will make a very conservative assumption once we are able to come to a conclusion on all these variables that need to be put into the estimation. However, we are very confident that, as Hector explained the impact, and I'm talking about what we will charge in the next few weeks with this conservative approach, will not be material for the group, and we will still meet our objectives, our return on tangible equity target for the year, which is 16% or slightly above 16%. And that's all we can say. What happens with the FCA report in May, that's basically speculation. So obviously, we will make a decision based on the actual ruling based on if we have time to take into consideration the Supreme Court guidance on this, and in any case, obviously, the provisioning that we will take will be a conservative provision."

If I look at loans were flat quarter-on-quarter in local currency, which is perhaps not particularly encouraging for the NII outlook in the context of rate tax in the region. Can you talk about your expectations for loan growth here? And what this means for NII in Brazil? And maybe could you also please remind us what the time lag is with respect to repricing between assets and liabilities in Brazil, I understand your liability were price is much faster than assets. If you could remind us how many months in lag that is? And my second question is with respect to the U.S. profitability. I mean this is a part of your business that's negatively correlated to rates. You've been adding at least a number of investments or corporate bankers in the region, which is showing good momentum in fees. Could you maybe just talk us through the key P&L line items and if you see these numbers as sustainable going forward, please. Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Antonio. Let me go a little bit, I mean, through the Brazil situation, okay, to tell you a little bit what's going on. It's very important that you understand the following. In Brazil, also, we are changing a little bit the model that we have today. As you know, we used to use very hardly RWAs. We used to basically give out a lot of loans. Now we're changing a little bit the way we do things. We are basically focused on profitability, okay? Laser focus on profitability, which is basically changing a little bit of mix, also changing a little bit, I mean, the way we manage and we're managing the loan portfolio as a portfolio by division. We used to basically grow in every single segment. Now we're not doing so. We're basically looking at the segments that basically have the best profitability and the best cost of risk in equal. So we're being very choosy in the way we manage that and we're doing that all along the group. Also, we're very much focused on increasing the amount of clients and the amount of transactional clients that gives deposits and have their deposits with us, also their payrolls. And it's quite important to understand that, that basically is going to improve margins because we're improving the funding of overall of the franchise in Brazil, okay? NII, if you see this is good quarter, it's up more than 3% in the quarter. It is more than 22% in year-on-year. What's behind the performance, as I told you, healthy volume growth, changing the mix and the lower rates because we're doing and increasing the number of clients. If you remember in my presentation, I talked about the new onboarding that basically is very competitive and is basically getting us much more clients. It is true that the rate outlook has changed, but now the market is having some rate hikes that will mean the NII growth will be a bit less intense than we expected. And we thought at the beginning of the year. But nevertheless, we still expect Brazilian real to grow around the mid-teens marked by the end of '24, and we will have further growth in '25. And if we continue with our strategy and gaining clients and getting more deposits at a good place, I think we could be better off, okay? And let me take the opportunity also to flag the opportunity that Brazil has delivered almost a 17% RoTE. This is strong profitability improvement. It's not just reliant on NII growth, but also it's very important, the good delivery on fees because also, as I explained, we're becoming the number one bank to our clients. So selling other products, insurance, some of the things that are basically helping us out. Also, it's very important to take a look at the cost contention that we have had and also a stable cost of risk in the year. I believe that -- and I don't believe, I really remain very optimistic on Brazil and the ability to continue expanding its profitability through '25, okay? I don't know, Jose, if you'd like to go in detail in terms of the liabilities?"

        "text": "Thank you. Let me go into the U.S., Antonio. So it's very important to understand, first of all, that we are not a full-fledged commercial bank in the U.S. We are focused on the businesses we are focused, okay? We are focused mainly in our consumer business. The consumer business, as you say has negative sensitivity to rates. That's exactly why we launched Openbank there. And we're also using SBNA, our commercial bank to fund that all right? We've been also changing the mix in a very strong way. I was looking at the numbers in terms of the new mix we have. And as you're talking about a mix that is 42% with FICOs really on the prime and near prime level, okay? And we're decreasing the amount of risk that we have to deep so prime and subprime. So that basically makes combination and it's going to give you a pretty good idea of what we're doing there. In terms of consumer, it's very important that you understand that, I mean, as you know, we are at scale player. We are also leveraging the relationship we have with the OEMs and we were able to capture very good agreements with INEOS, Lotus, Tesla and Mitsubishi. It's very important for you to understand that some of these changes in the P&L, you're not going to see them at the revenue level due to the fact that a lot of this is basically done, for example, on the electrical vehicles. And electrical vehicles, we're buying them because it's mostly leasing. So that basically tells you that it's not going to appear on the revenue line, but you see it on the page back we have on the tax that we get back for the electric vehicles. So that basically changes a little bit the outlook. But all in all, I really see that the U.S. will continue to thrive over the next year or so, okay? Also in the commercial side, the business is doing well. We have this expertise. We also you know that we have the JV with the FDIC, which has been tremendously successful and I think will continue so. I have had a solid performance. And then you talk about the CIB advisory services. CIB just grew 41% year-on-year in terms of the fees that we are collecting on that business. But also, you don't see how the U.S. is helping the rest of the business to thrive. If you take a look at the fees and CIB Europe also are being pushed up by all the businesses we are doing by using the U.S. teams to help us out, getting some of our new business that we didn't use to get. Also in Latin America, if you take a look at, for example, not just cross-border M&A, but if you take a look at what we've been doing in DCM, you will see that we have become one of the three most important players in DCM in that market just because of the expertise we got into the table. So when the Mexican UMS did a \u20ac7 billion transaction at the beginning of the year, we're one of the four banks, and we're the only non-American bank in the game. So those are the particular things that are happening to us given that now we have with the local strength that we have, we're combining the global expertise that we're bringing on to the table. And wealth or also, we have a leading brand in Latin America. That business is basically working as a Swiss clock. So I really do believe that the U.S. will continue to thrive very good outlook for '25 and really good numbers coming up in terms of the P&L we see there."

Do you foresee a change of strategy we mean going more topical. But how do you see loan reposition going forward? My second question is on the U.S. deposits. So the cost and the volumes are flat in the quarter. We just only launched Openbank in the country. On your website, you said are paying 11x the national average for deposit? How much do you expect in terms of volumes to gain from your Openbank franchise and where do you see the cost above -- and just quickly [indiscernible] effective corporate tax rate for 2025.

In terms of the manage changes we have done to Spain, basically, they're not going to change the plan that we had before is we're going to basically very much focus on profitability. That's number one. We're also changing the model. Spain is one of the most important places where we believe we have an opportunity on ONE Transformation, okay, due to the fact that we believe there is a huge opportunity of simplification, automation in what we have there. A lot of -- if you compare one of our branches for example in Portugal versus our branches in Spain, 90% of what we do in a branch in Portugal, it's basically taking care of clients. 50% of what we do in Spain is taking care of incidence problems, different situations, et cetera. So it's very important that we do that simplification and then transformation and automation that we need to do on the back in Spain, so we make our business much more reliable, much more efficient and with a much better cost structure. Thirdly, we are, as you know, deploying the global platforms and Spain is one of the places that we're going to be concentrated the most in the near term, all right? So it's quite important to understand that we will continue doing that and we will continue basically focusing on managing the deposit betas as we have done, right? So very much concentrated on that. Getting new clients. It's very important to acknowledge that for the seventh consecutive month, we have grown on clients in Spain in a mature market that basically tells you that the model is working that exactly we're delivering on what we believe is the right thing to do. So we will continue to do as we have been doing in the past in terms of transforming Spain in what we need to do, but also with global platforms, we're going to be able to be much more competitive, more and more efficient and better for our clients. Also, this structure of being the number one bank to our clients is very important in Spain because this basically will allow us to sell them more products. One product that is very important, and we are punching below our weight, is insurance, for example, in which some of our competitors are much more bigger than us in that sense. So there is a huge opportunity of where we can do that. Also, if you take a look on CIB. CIB, we have had a really interesting and important lever, given that we're using our U.S. teams to support what we're doing here in Spain. So that is helping us out quite a lot. And we've been actually number one in the market for the whole year. So Spain will continue, as we say. In terms of the tax rate in the U.S\u2026"

We actually saw improvements in loan yields and also lower deposit costs. I was wondering if you see this trend prevailing into the fourth Q and into 2025. Should we expect margin expansion to prevail? Or should we expect it to stabilize the customer spread to stabilize more or less around these levels, just basically how do you see the outlook for NII in the U.K.? Then if I may pick up a bit on the interest rate sensitivity questions that were raised before. You mentioned that you lowered the NII sensitivity in 20% to 25% of what it was prior to the change in rate cycle. I was just wondering if you could update us on exactly where the sensitivity lies now particularly for Spain, but also for some of the larger geographies, that would be much appreciated. Thank you very much."

        "text": "Thank you, Carlos. Okay. On the U.K., I would like to tell you, I mean, I think it's one of the countries that we have one of the greatest opportunities in terms of ONE Transformation. We have a very good advantage of simplifying. That's something that we are very concentrated on also the automation of what we're doing there, we are actually lowering the amount of people that we have. We started the year with 20,000 people. We're going to end up with 18,000. So simplification and automation is well underway. And then as I said on the presentation, it's quite important that we already start deploying the global platforms. OneApp came in U.K. just about. We did the big bank and change all our clients there, and it's becoming really helpful in order to gain new clients helping us in the deposit base and also helping us in terms of NPS, okay? It is important to say that we believe that we have much better market economic dynamics, okay, lending activity, we see it picking up. We are very much also focused on profitability in that market as well. We see more rational behavior of the U.K. banks, better pricing on the new loans, plus better pricing of deposits. We are proactively managing deposits as I told you, first of all, with the new clients coming in with the new H [ph] account that we launched, that's been helping us. So we reiterate our view that NII will improve in the H2 versus H1, okay, as you have said. We're going to finish '24 with NII down only mid-single-digit instead of the minus 9% that we have reported in the first nine months, and we expect further rate cut in the remaining of '24. But the outlook of '25 is positive in the sense of what we have seen so far."

        "speaker": "Jose Garc\u00eda Cantera",
        "text": "So Carlos, in terms of interest rate sensitivity. So let me comment for the main countries for the group as a whole first. In constant euros, as I said, we would expect NII to increase next year, maybe 2%, 3%. In Spain, you've seen a 2.5% interest rate in Europe for the mid of next year of 2025. We would expect a slight decrease in NII in Spain. In the U.K., as Hector just commented a slight increase in NII. In the U.S., we would expect high-single-digit increase; in Mexico, mid- to high single-digit increase; in Brazil, this is quite important. The outlook for interest rates in Brazil is really important to estimate the future evolution of NII, we expect average interest rates in Brazil next year to be around 11%, 11%, 11.5%, with this level of interest rates, NII in Brazil should be up mid-single-digits. And basically -- and finally, in DCB, also high single-digit increase with the level of interest rates that we just talked about. So as I said, if you compare these with the sensitivity in the way up that we had in the countries in Europe, for instance, or in DCB as interest rates were going up, the sensitivity we have in the way going down is significantly lower."

You are currently growing profits at 14% year-on-year in the nine months. And I know you usually give guidance in February, but do you think 2025 profits will actually be above 2024 in your view? And the second is a follow-up on the capital aberration we've done before. I'm looking at Slide 23. With our regulatory headwinds, you would have built 35 basis points of capital in one quarter after distribution. Can you confirm with Q4, we should exhaust the bulk of the expected regulatory headwinds? And is the higher profitability than yielding to higher capital buildup versus the 10 basis points per quarter guidance that you have given us? Final thing is a clarification on Basel IV. Before you said that on day 1, CET1 should be flattish. If I remember correctly, there were 20 basis points of impacts this year that should have reversed with Basel IV adoption. Can you clarify that? Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Andrea. Let me give you a little of what we believe. First of all, I must tell you that I have great confidence that we'll deliver. And in some metrics like cost to income over deliver on the financial targets that we set on the Investor Day for the period of '23 to '25, okay. '25 will be better than '24. For '25, we expect to continue to grow revenues, especially fees, as I explained with the new mobile deployment that we're doing. We're going to further improve the operating leverage and we're going to deliver higher profitability. And we will do this how by leveraging further the global and network businesses, okay? We're putting a lot of focus on increasing the network effect. We're doing more with less. First of all, leveraging also our products and global factories, like, for example, from our corporate bank into our commercial banks, what we're doing between CIB and the commercial business on the midsized companies and SMEs. Also ONE Transformation is leveraging platforms that help reduce the cost to serve in retail. We're talking about minus 4% on year-to-year cost per active customer and 6% year-on-year revenue per active customer. So since the start of the program, the number of products, as I said before is down almost 36%, okay. 60% of the products are now digitally available to our customers. That's 9% points up since we started the program, right? In summary, the strategy and business model diversification, disciplined approach to capital allocation, we will, we believe deliver a consistent compound effect that will continue yielding positive results for the years to come. So all in all, yes. Jose, I don't know if you like to comment into the capital markets."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia Cantera",
        "text": "Yes, so let me give you all the components of the capital ratio. And I think you can make your own conclusions here. So on Page 23, we show 43 basis points of organic capital generation post AT1's cost of hedges, et cetera, which includes 19 basis points negative from organic risk-weighted asset growth, which is \u20ac8 billion growth partially neutralized by risk transfer initiatives of around 11 basis points or \u20ac5 billion. Remember that so far this year, we've mobilized \u20ac35 billion to \u20ac40 billion in terms of risk weighted assets. And on markets and others, we have 7 basis points from the sale of Poland. So with this, I think you can conclude both more or less the recurring capital generation, we will be able to have going forward. Obviously, the net risk-weighted asset growth, gross risk-weighted assets net of asset mobilization initiatives is the other key component. Obviously, that excess capital is being -- or that capital has been reinvested at 2.9% return on risk-weighted assets, but obviously risk capital that is being reinvested. Basel IV, you're right. The maturity will the impact -- the negative impact of the 21 basis points or 22 basis points we had in the first quarter of this year will reverse in the first quarter of next year, and this will compensate the other negative impacts, the one impacts that we have, mostly from technical adjustments to low default portfolios, corporate portfolios, et cetera. So net-net, it's obviously 0 is the net of some positives and some negatives. And amongst the positives is this 20 basis points from the maturity we used in derivatives transactions. You are right."

If you can give us actually the path of those 40 basis points you have on a fully loaded basis, actually how those cater beyond actually over the next years? And specifically, how much of that is going to follow on 2025? I'm sorry, if you have referred to this actually, but just one clarification. And then related to this, going back basically to what Alvaro was asking before, I mean what is the preferred use of any potential excess capital that you're building you're thinking basically of accelerating growth, spending a little bit of that? Or is a question basically of also considering the possibility of increasing distributions? And then final, on the capital, actually, if I may. What kind of budget for SRTs actually you have per annum in the next two to three years, building up into your capital forecast? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jose Garcia Cantera",
        "text": "Okay. So the 40 basis points, as you remember, we are not affected by the output floor because we use lots of standard models. So that 72.5% limit to the benefit of internal models relative to standard models, we are not affected by that. That is backlog. That's what comes later from 2029 to 2033, if I'm not mistaken. We are mostly affected the 40 basis points is mostly the result of operational risk. That will come over the next four or five years, if I'm not mistaken. So that's how these 40 basis points are going to be added to the phasing in our case. I think Hector already answered the question about the excess capital and budget. On a recurring basis, obviously, the demand for private credit today is enormous. I'm not going to say it's infinite, but it's huge. So obviously, I don't think we are going to have this type of demand as interest rates come down, obviously. But we think that on a recurring basis, we should be able to mobilize somewhere between \u20ac35 billion to \u20ac55 billion in risk-weighted assets. Both obviously, SRTs will only be maybe a third of that, \u20ac15 billion a year. It's reasonable to assume that 10 to 15 will come from SRTs and the other will be from other types of hedges, another type of transactions, asset sales, et cetera, like we did this year. But on a recurring basis, with a more normalized market, \u20ac35 billion, \u20ac40 billion per year is like a reasonable number."

And yes, that would basically be my first question. And then the second question is that M&A is the quite hot topic in Europe at this point in time, if you're going to generate more cash out going forward, how do you think about inorganic growth opportunities, what would be something that you could potentially consider in terms of kind of products or regions? And yes, if you could talk about your thinking about M&A? And then the last question would be around Brazil asset quality.

In terms of the inorganic opportunities, I do believe that we have a lot of organic opportunities within the group. I think that the chances and if you make some numbers in terms of what we could do by becoming best-in-class versus the best-in-class in every single market that we operate that basically tells you the huge opportunity that we have in front of us. And we will continue like that. We will concentrate on our changes on the go-to model of the bank. I mean, it's a process that is going to take us at least the next 24 months in order to have also the global platform set in place, et cetera. So we're very much concentrated on that, okay? And that's exactly what all the focus of the group is today. In terms of the Brazil asset quality, as you have seen, I mean, as you have seen, basically, first of all, I must tell you that we have very strong revenue performance, okay? Solid evolution on cost, okay, flat quarter-on-quarter. But we have a really resilient behavior of the credit quality. Cost of risk is stable at 4.78% and the more recent vintages are performing well, and we don't have any signs of deterioration. It's very important that you acknowledge what I explained at the beginning in terms of the change of mix and the change of the work we're looking at the Brazilian portfolio, okay? So as I was telling you before, we used to grow in every single segment of the market. Today, we're not doing so. We're much more focused on profitability and also on the cost of risk that we have. So you're going to see a much better performance of Brazil over the next years because we're exactly doing so, all right? So it's quite important that you see that and you're going to see basically that the outlook that we have for ours towards the end of '24 is a stable cost of risk versus '23 around 4.6%. And as I said, I mean, with the new changes that we're putting in place, et cetera, I think the vintages will perform much better than we expected, okay?"

I'm just asking you regard it, 2%, 3% NOI growth next year in constant euros, and it might be a little bit lower in current euros and that I think would have to drive most of the revenues to deliver positive growth. And then a clarification on the rates. You mentioned 2.5% for Europe. Is that what you expect for the full-year then as well? Or the average expectation for the year? And then lastly, on Portugal on the net interest income, it declined significantly this year as we saw a big deposit cost increase. Is that just a catch-up where the competition and where do you expect deposit cost to go in the future? Thank you."

In terms of interest rates, well, we think 2.5% is the rate that we expect by midyear and then maybe one drop -- one cut more in the second half of the year. So we do not see 2% as a terminal rate in Europe right now. Obviously, we'll see. But in our case, we are not as negative as the market or positive, depending on how you look at it in terms of interest rates. And then cost of deposits, Britta you referred to countries like which countries, Spain, in particular. Sorry, I didn't get who -- which country you were referring to. So we will get back to you after the call. Carlos will give you a call and clarify that. But let me just very quickly in Spain. Obviously, the betas that we ended up this year having this year were much, much lower than the ones that we expected. So we manage our cost of deposits pretty well. Basically, thanks to avoiding the transfer of current accounts to time deposits. As rates come down, those parts of the current accounts that are tied to interbank rates or the Euribor, basically private banking, corporate banking and the large corporations is adjusting as well. So going forward, we should see actually a positive contribution from year-on-year deposit cost in Spain from '24 to '25. Other Euro countries in Portugal, the situation is a little bit more extreme. So in Portugal, we would expect NII to actually go down a little bit more than in Spain next year because there, obviously, the situation is a little bit more extreme than it is in Spain.

Or would the negative drag on NII be larger on European rates if we start to move below your expectations or below 2% policy rates. You mentioned earlier 2.5% at the midyear 2.25% by the end of next year. Would we need to recalibrate the sensitivity if we start to get towards 2% or below 2%?"

But if rates stay between 2% and 2.5%, I think we are going to have a pretty good outlook in terms of NII because again, the cost of deposits at those levels will gradually approach 0, basically, and we will have at least that 2% to 2.5% margin on the asset side."

Total revenue in -- Brazil's total revenue and it shall not overshadow the very strong operating performance in the quarter and in the improvement in profitability, okay? The client-related trading income has had a strong performance in Q3, okay? However, recent market volatility around the Brazilian real and the yield curve led to an important deterioration in local assets during Q2, following Q3, but we have stabilized those, and I believe that the outlook would be much better. This is a challenging market environment, and we've been basically offsetting this during Q3, and I believe Q4 is going to be much better. NII for the Corporate Center, NII in the corporate center should gradually decrease because of the remuneration of the liquidity that we have at the corporate center. So you should expect NII to reflect the lower rates on the liquidity that we hold at group level. And finally, the tax rate for the group, it should be fairly flat next year, maybe that's below what it will be this year, but just marginally. So for model purposes, we use the same tax rate in '25 than we will have in '24, same tax rate. And I think we've answered all the questions. Thank you very much, everybody. Investor Relations, myself, Hector are at your disposal to answer any follow-up questions that you may have. Looking forward to seeing you over the next few weeks on one-on-ones. And we'll talk to you again for the fourth quarter earnings in January. Thanks, everybody."

    "transcript": "Raul Sinha: [Call Starts Abruptly] everyone, and thank you for joining Santander's 2024 Results Presentation. I'm Raul Sinha, Global Head of Investor Relations and I'm delighted to be here joining our Executive Chair, Ana Bot\u00edn; our CEO, Hector Grisi; and our CFO, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera. Today\u2019s presentation will follow the usual structure for full year presentations. Ana will kick off the presentation by talking about our results and achievements in the context of our strategy. Then Hector will add detail to our financial performance. Finally, Ana will conclude with our outlook for 2025 before opening for Q&A. Ana, over to you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: Thank you, Raul, and welcome, everybody to our full year results presentation. 2024 was another record year, the third consecutive year of record results for Santander. It shows the benefits of our strategy, the resilience of our business model. As we said in 2023, we have entered a new phase of value creation and this has enabled us to deliver or exceed all our key financial targets. Profit reached a record \u20ac12.6 billion, supported by both strong revenue growth and customer growth. We grew 8 million customers. And this happened across all our global businesses in a very balanced way. We have continued to invest for the future and we're making excellent progress towards a more simple and more integrated model through one transformation. This has been instrumental in improvements in efficiency by more than 2 percentage points and increasing our profitability RoTE to 16.3%. Our balance sheet remains solid with a strong capital ratio ends the year at an all-time high of 12.8, reflecting our ability to generate capital organically. Finally, we delivered again strong shareholder value creation with TNAV and dividend per share growing by 14%. And by the way, this is in spite of pressure from currency devaluation in some markets, which was offset by our profitability and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar with our U.S. business acting as a natural hedge against the pressure on the Brazilian Real, for example. So let me just go into a bit more detail on our full year performance. Again, very high quality of results with strong growth in our top-line revenue up 10% in constant euros, and as I said, supported by both customer activity and good delivery across all our businesses. Fee income is up 11% again in constant supported by significant growth in customers, up 8 million and very much the network benefits we are capturing throughout the Group, which already represent about \u20ac20 billion about a third of our revenues are due to being part of the Santander Group. Expenses grew well below revenue, showcasing again the positive effects of our ONE Transformation. And we delivered record net operating income of \u20ac36 billion. Finally, we continue to be prudent in our approach to risk and our cost of risk ended at 1.15% better than our initial guidance for the year. Again, we have shown over time that our results are sustainable and less volatile over the cycle than most of our peers and this is again because we are retail consumer powerhouse with a business model that combines both geographical diversification with business diversification and a strong risk management. You can see here that all of our five global businesses delivered revenue growth, while we improved profitability. The performance of retail consumer reflects the scale and the benefits of our transformation, ONE Transformation improving efficiency but also growing customers. Wealth, CIB and PagoNxt have each delivered improved profitability, again leveraging our network strengths and capabilities. The combination of these global businesses with the geographical diversification places us in a very strong spot for the next year and for the future. We're enhancing our disclosure to allow the market all of you to better forecast our global businesses, in the same way that we have been doing for years internally. I would also highlight that while higher interest rates benefit our retail franchise in Europe, other parts of our business such as consumer and certain developing market geographies will do better with lower rates. And it is this diversification that allows us to deliver current strong results, consistent profitable growth and value creation. Again, our performance this year, the execution of our strategy puts us on track for our 2025 financial targets. On retail, which is the heart of our banking business, we are making very good progress. Our aim is to become the number one bank for our customers. ONE Transformation is delivering excellent results. And by the way, there\u2019s a lot more to come, growing 4 million -- around 4 million active customers with about to 80 million total with lower cost per transaction. We are improving our digital onboarding, digital sales grow by 16%. The number of products has been reduced by almost 40% with special focus on the front book, and this is -- you're going to see benefits of this in the next few years, of course. And you will see that it\u2019s not just on the cost side, but also on revenues for 2025/2026. Second, we are consistently, but relentlessly deploying our global platform. In the UK, for example, customers have been migrated to the new global app that's already up and running in Spain, Portugal and Poland. And again, the global platform rollout and improvements in customer experience will drive additional customer growth with lower absolute cost. In consumer, our priority continues to be delivering the best solutions for our customers, but also improve our competitive advantage on cost across our footprint. You can see here the operational leverage for the year, where we are growing revenues at 6% and decreasing costs by 1%. It's been a groundbreaking year in our transformation and a great example of this is our checkout lending platform, Zinia, which, again, thanks to our scale and teams, we have been able to partner with both Apple and Amazon in Germany. This is absolutely key, not just today but for the future to be where our customers are going to be operating with us under our own brand. We have also successfully launched Openbank in the U.S. and Mexico. Openbank U.S. has gathered \u20ac2 billion of deposits that\u2019s about double what we expected and it's also improving our loan to deposit in the U.S. by about 12 percentage points. It's going to allow us to optimize our U.S. funding structure from the beginning. We are reducing the cost to serve in consumer. It's down significantly, as you can see. And for 2025 and this is key, we are actually expecting consumer to be one of our best-performing divisions in terms of the upside, where the U.S. being one of the countries that most improves the total country P&L. Our other three global businesses, Wealth, CIB and Payments, other ones driving fee growth. We anticipated this to you all in 2023 due to very strong network effects and also leveraging technology. Our corporate bank, we are focused on the markets where we are present with a strong footprint. And as you know, we're delivering good growth in profits. We are maintaining our usual risk profile. In the U.S. in 2024, corporate bank fees have increased by 21% and revenues up by 14%. We are building the best wealth and insurance manager in our footprint, again, leveraging on our network. Wealth revenues up 15% in 2024, with fees up again double-digits across the three business lines. In Payments, we are building the backbone to connect the Group across different businesses and geographies. It's essential in our ONE Transformation. This is a very big market and a growing opportunity. In 2024, Payments volume is up 11%. And the key metric that we committed to EBITDA margin is close to a 30% target for this year for 2025. We're very close to that already. Going forward and especially in an environment of lower rates in Europe, CIB, Wealth and Payments are going to be critical in ensuring our targets for this year, including the fee income growth. So all of this performance, the strong operational and financial performance is driving higher capital generation, double-digit value creation and shareholder return. Our fully loaded CET1 rose to 12.8% at the end of December, January 1, still 12.8%, supported by record organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, increasing remuneration to shareholders and absorbing regulatory impacts. At current prices, share buybacks remain the best way to generate shareholder value since 2021 and including this new share buyback we've announced today for the year on 2024 earnings, we will have repurchased 15% of outstanding shares with a return on investment approximately 18% for our shareholders, and there is more to come. Hector will go into our financial performance in more detail, but let me just briefly given that I only get a chance to be with you once a year, at least formally, remind our -- all of you of our model and our strategy. As I say, this is a marathon. It's not a sprint. And in every single sprint, we're delivering what we committed. And this is because we are delivering numbers and results as we guide to every year, but we're also building the Santander of tomorrow. Our aim is to be the best open financial services platform for all our customers. We are working to become more competitive in a way that few others can replicate. And this is based on a unique combination of a customer base of 173 million customers, a global scale with local leadership and very important, all of this leading to high visibility of our results and predictability through the cycle. And the biggest area of upside even today for Santander comes from the network effect of belonging to the Group across our footprint and through the global business. Our confidence in our guidance stems because a lot of what's coming is under our control. And all of this let me stress in what we do anticipate a much more challenging and volatile macro. Just a few examples of how this is not a power point. This is already delivering numbers and results for our shareholders and for our customers. We -- these are some of the global platforms that are up and running and contributing to the performance and financial performance, which you are seeing and which is increasingly and this will continue to increase, making us different from our peers. These platforms will deliver and partly delivering already best services and better efficiency. Openbank is our digital bank rolled out now in the U.S. and Mexico. Zinia, I mentioned already, in 2024, there were 1.7 million new contracts, and we are signing in new countries with these partners. And Gravity, our core system, where our partner is Google is being offered to third parties through our joint venture, but it has already enabled Santander to reduce our cost per transaction by 10%, but it's obviously helping us to do much more than that in terms of the front-end systems. Again, we are confident we will compound growth throughout the cycle, creating value for our shareholders. Just a brief reminder of how this business model has already delivered the numbers. You can see it here, sustainable earnings growth year-after-year, improvements in profitability. Over the last decade, we have doubled our profit. Actually, we have tripled if you go back to the end of 2013 and a new record again in 2024. We have attracted 56 million new customers to Santander, RoTE our profitability increased to 16.3% from 11% in 2014. And of course, we have steadily built capital throughout this period. I just want to remind us, actually, when I took over, we started with a CET ratio of 8.3%. And of course, the way we calculate capital is not the same. But very importantly, for you, our shareholders -- of our shareholders, we have increased 6x shareholder remuneration. We are now closing at 12.8%, which near the top of our target operating range. And let me just stress operating range, we're not changing our target of over 12%, and this is, as I just mentioned, despite RWA inflation. So last but not least, before I turn over to Hector, this is our North Star, and this is our North Star since 2023. We could not target and commit to TNAV and dividend per share before 2023 for reasons that you all know well. The progress towards the target that we set is well ahead of plan. We continue to be focus on profitability and being very disciplined on capital allocation. Today, we have 87% of RWAs above cost of equity, further improving our profitability to above 16%. So let me now pass to Hector, who will take you over our financial performance in more detail. Hector, please?\nHector Grisi: Yes. Thank you, Ana. We look at our performance in constant currency, including the impact of Argentina, where a conservative approach to FX was adjusted in Q4. This resulted in a positive impact on NII with a negative offset in other income and cost. Let me start by highlighting our strong top-line performance. We achieved double-digit revenue growth, exceeding the targets we provided at the start of the year and even the ones we upgraded during the year. This was underpinned by sound growth in customer activity across the businesses, while reflecting the benefits of our model. The strong increase was mainly supported by the next things. First, our retail business, which continues to grow at double-digits with good performance in both NII and fees. A record year in CIB up 14% on the back of our investments and good activity levels and 15% revenue growth in Wealth driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and a really good performance of Santander Asset Management and Insurance. Consumer and Payments are also showing very good revenue trends with consumers delivering double-digit growth in fees on both PagoNxt and cards growing. More than 80% of the Group's NII comes from our Retail and Consumer businesses. The Group NIIs grew double-digit in 2024 with NIM of driven by asset repricing and controlled cost of deposits. Over the last few quarters, we have proactively managed our interest rate sensitivity to position our balance sheet for the new outlook on interest rates. In Spain, for example, our NII was flat quarter-over-quarter, partly due to our hedges. And in Brazil, our negative sensitivity to 100 basis points rise in rates is now lower at around \u20ac120 million. Going forward, our outlook for 2025, for the Group is similar to what we said in Q3. Excluding Argentina, we expect NII to be slightly up in constant euros and slightly down in current euros based on forward rates. In an environment of low credit demand in general, we generated another record performance in fee income through network effects from all our global businesses. Retail increased driven by the strong performance across our footprint on the back of good commercial dynamics and customer growth. In 2024, we put a greater focus on deploying targeted high value-added products and services, and this is expected to be a positive driver in 2025. In Consumer, we delivered double-digit growth fees across our core markets, driven by insurance and DCB in Europe, Brazil and now too in the U.S., and in 2025, we expect consumer fees to be slightly down due to the impact of the new regulation and insurance. CIB also grew strongly to record levels, supported by all CIB products with the U.S. a top contributor for fees nearly doubled. In Wealth, we delivered a very strong performance with double-digit fee growth backed by record assets under management. Excluding a one-time positive fee recorded in cards in 2023, payment fees were up slightly and are expected to grow strongly during 2025. ONE Transformation is key to why we can continue to get better in every single market, thanks to leveraging our global businesses. We expect sustainable improvements in operating leverage as this is a structural change in our model that will deliver benefits for years to come. Retail and Consumer are leading our transformation, which is delivering structural efficiency gains and operating leverage with cost growth of 1%, well below revenue growth of 9%. These two businesses represent 70% of our cost base and will continue to see lower costs going forward. CIB and Wealth cost increased by 13% year-on-year, showing positive jobs while driving higher fee income and payments operating performance reflects our strategic investments. As a result, our cost-to-income ratio improved from 41.8% for 2024, the best we have ever reported in 15 years and better than our original guidance. There is still more upside over the medium-term from our strategy, both revenue and cost. While we are ahead of our plan on execution of ONE Transformation and global tech capabilities, we have more to do capture network effects across our global businesses. This has delivered 66 basis points of improvements for our cost-to-income ratio with more upside to our original target of 100 basis points to 150 basis points. Retail and Consumer and more than 70% of our earnings and have significant upside. The rest of our earnings come from Wealth, CIB and Payments, which are fee-driven and will play to our network strengths. Our balance sheet, as you can see is rock solid. Credit quality is stable across our footprint ahead of our expectations with low unemployment and easing monetary policies in most of the countries, except for Brazil. Credit quality improved year-on-year as reflected in both NPL ratio and lower coverage needs. NPL ratio was 3.05%, improving both year-on-year and Q-on-Q. The NPL portfolio has collateral warranties and provisions that account for around 90% of its total exposure. The cost of risk improved to 1.15% better than our target of around 1.2% for the year. In our retail business, 12-month cost of risk improved year-on-year to 0.92%, with sound underlying trends across all the countries. In Brazil, we have grown credit at a slower pace than our peers and have made improvements to our portfolio underwriting over the past few years. Meanwhile, in consumer, 12-month cost of risk finished at 2.16% in line with the normalization expected in 2024, supported by the good portfolio behavior in the U.S. auto as we had expected since the beginning. Moving on to capital, where we delivered an exceptional outcome in Q4. Our CET1 ratio grew by 30 basis points in the quarter, backed by a strong organic capital generation. We have been working on accelerating our capital generation for some time. This quarter, we generated 82 basis points organically in the back of the profit generation and RWA modification. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.9%, equivalent to an RoTE of 23%. We have reached 87% of RWAs with returns above the cost of equity, up from 40% in 2015 and well above our target of 85% in 2025. Our asset desk is achieving exceptional results during the year. We disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to \u20ac60 billion in RWAs. The combination of these actions, explain expanding profitability and the good performance on capital. All in all, we are in a new phase of value creation driven by higher profitability. Looking back at the period since 2016, our value creation has clearly accelerated. And since 2022, we have been able to generate, on average, 15% value to our shareholders. This is driven mainly by the step-up in our profitability and helped by our diversification. Our exposure to the U.S. dollar through our U.S. businesses has acted as a natural hedge against depreciation of the LatAm currencies. Let me highlight the sensitivity of our equity to foreign currency, which clearly shows that currency depreciation in Brazil and Mexico is at least partly offset by our exposure to the stronger U.S. dollar working as a natural hedge. That's all from my side. Ana, over to you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: Thank you very much, Hector. So let me just briefly sum up. Our performance in 2024 once again confirms our consistent delivery on our plans. We deliver what we say we will deliver in every single plan and every single year on the key financial metrics for the Group. We are on track to either achieve or exceed our financial targets set in 2023. 2024 was another record year for Santander. Our results show the benefits from our strategy, the resilience of our business model, which again allows us to deliver through the cycle despite volatility. So looking ahead, we are confident that our strategy works. It's evident in the numbers and that it will continue to drive sustainably higher returns. This is reflected in the targets you can see on the slide, for 2025, which are based on a more volatile context. We do expect volatility, uncertainty, and a challenging environment for the next year. Our macro outlook includes a mild tariff war at lower euro rates, also a strong dollar, stronger dollar. We expect to deliver resilient revenue despite these lower rates and FX, around the same as this year, \u20ac62 billion. It means we will be growing in constant currency and supported by mid to high-single-digit growth in fees in constant euros. Our aim this year is to reduce costs in absolute terms year-on-year in euros, again, positive operating leverage in 2025, in spite of these lower rates, mostly in Europe. We are expecting a stable cost of risk at the Group level with improvements in some markets offsetting others. And again, all of this will lead to increased profitability with returns above 17% on the same basis as we guided in 2023, exceeding that top end of our Investor Day. And I just want to flag that from now on, we will report RoTE post AT1, which is what most of our peers do. With this more conservative lens, we are targeting 16 -- about 16.5%, as you can see. And this again, is post AT1s. Very importantly, given the strong outlook for capital progress and profitability, we are targeting to distribute \u20ac10 billion in share buybacks to our shareholders for 2025 and 2026, out of 2025, 2026 earnings. This will consist of distributing in line with our existing policy, around 50% of our reported profit, which will be distributed approximately 50% in cash dividends and 50% in share buybacks. As you know, we've announced the second buyback on 2024 earnings today at \u20ac1.6 billion. And second, excess capital in the two years, so 2025 and 2026 excess capital following our annual results and of course, our capital hierarchy, which we can go into later. And again, as always, subject to regulatory approvals and the performance we are outlining to you today. Very importantly, we will no longer set a maximum price level for our share buybacks. We will no longer set a maximum price level for our share buybacks, reflecting our improved profitability and improvement ahead. I would like to end by saying; again, our North Star will continue to be delivering double-digit growth in TNAV and dividend per share through the cycle. So with that, we are here to answer your questions, which I think, Raul, you will be managing.\nRaul Sinha: Thank you, Ana. Can we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We already have the first question from the line of Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Ulargui: Thanks very much for the presentation, and thanks for taking my question. First of all, I just wanted to thank you very much for the improvement in the financial target disclosure and the fact that you are using this RoTE plus AT1s. Just going to the questions, I have two questions today. After the announcement on the extraordinary distributions, just wanted to get further color on the trade-offs that you see between organic and inorganic growth? How excess capital ranks in terms of management priorities in 2025 and 2026, especially in the context of the M&A that we are seeing in the European banking sector? Second thing is, when I just looked at the results of ONE Transformation that is also very good, I just wanted to see how much more the Group's cost to income can improve from here? Thank you very much.\nAna Bot\u00edn: Thank you, Ignacio. So yes, it's important to remind -- and this is not different, but how we are thinking about the capital allocation going forward in the anticipated higher profitability and excess capital. So first of all, our capital allocation framework has, as I said already been a fundamental pillar of our strategy and the results we're delivering and we have been very disciplined and strict. So first, we prioritize profitable organic growth, investments across our businesses. We see ourselves as a compounder. So again, this organic growth creates a compounding effect on earnings, returns, book value and distributions. Second, this is followed, of course, by ordinary dividends and share buybacks to our shareholders. In terms of inorganic capital deployment, we are very clear that it has to be complementary to our strategic aims and generate attractive financial returns that have to be ahead that surpass those of any organic investments or share buybacks. And last but not least, and this is what we announced today, any incremental capital that exceeds our targets, our target range actually. And again, I want to be clear that we are not changing the target for capital above 12%. We are saying, as you've seen in the guidance that we will be at 13% in 2025. So any incremental capital following this hierarchy that I just described will be returned as additional remuneration to shareholders. In terms of cost, and I think I said that and the CEO said that also, this is incredibly important because our transformation -- ONE Transformation still has a lot of upside, especially in the retail and consumer areas that are 70% of our PAT and 70% of our cost. ONE Transformation is already delivering. You can see that in Hector slide where you can see that our cost basically flat across retail consumer with the top-line growing. But very importantly, we've grown 8 million customers. This is something you will see in the next few years that we have a strategy and a model with ONE Transformation that scales. We don't have to increase cost to grow customers and grow revenues. I said it also in my presentation that the fact that we have reduced our product on offer and retail by almost 40%, you're going to see the effects of that on the cost base, by the way, also on the revenue side in 2025 and 2026. And critical to all of this is that we are aligning our business and operating model and deploying our own tech platforms. This is going to help much more down the road, okay? Just to give you an example, Gravity, our core system, which drives a lot of the efficiencies and the front-end customer tech platforms, is operating in 30% of the Group, okay? We expect to be at 60% by the end of 2025. This is hugely important. So again, new paradigm for 2025, we are focusing on absolute cost base going down versus 2024 despite FX and inflation, this is something we feel very confident about. Given this is important, I don't know if you want to mention maybe Hector, a couple of the precise numbers on the different global divisions?\nHector Grisi: Yes. Thank you, Ana. As Ana has said, I mean, what is very important to understand is ONE Transformation is just starting, okay? Let me provide you a little bit more color on the cost evolution in the quarter by businesses and also the 2025 outlook. First of all, I mean, as you can see, in 2024, cost increased by 4% year-on-year, but in real terms, cost only grew 1%, okay? That's basically thanks to the operating leverage in retail and the cost containment that we have done in consumer despite the investments and growth that we have been able to do. So it's important to say that we are basically changing the engine while flying the plane at the same time. Retail and Consumer represents around 70% of the Group costs were flattish, while the revenue was up 9%. CIB and Wealth that's around 20% of the Group cost and they used to increase by 13%, as I said in the presentation, with positive jobs and showing sustainable fee income growth around 21%. That's basically -- what is doing, the investments we're doing are actually representing much more growth in the businesses. The remaining 10% is Payments, which increased by 8% year-on-year, but that reflects our strategic investments. Let me go directly, I mean, retail and on 2025, we expect cost down versus 2024 in current euros, and we expect to reiterate or improve the guidance that we provided for each business at the last Investor Day. So that's retail cost to income below the early target of less than 42% and flat ex-Argentina, so that our -- that was basically around 39.7%. Consumer cost to income is down, and it's going to be less than 40% and CIB is going to be below 45%. Thank you.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks, Hector. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question from Marta Sanchez from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMarta Sanchez: Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is about the UK. When you say that the market is core, does it also specifically apply to the retail bank to the ring-fenced entity? And if that's the case, where do you see sustainable returns in an environment where you have to compete against stronger deposit franchises and new entrants with deep pockets. My second question is on the U.S. You've delivered $1.2 billion this year of net profit, but you're still benefiting from EV tax credits. I think you've mentioned on the call that you expect the U.S. to be the largest contributor to earnings growth in 2025. Could you be a little bit more specific about how much you expect it to contribute, what are the levers and what is the tax return -- sorry, the tax rate assumed? And then just quickly a clarification on capital, the threshold for surplus capital distribution is now 13%. Thank you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: So we're not -- let me answer the last one first. We're not putting a threshold. We've said we will be at 13% by the end of this year. The buybacks will happen in 2025, 2026. I have explained the hierarchy. So it will depend on what organic growth we will have, we're going to be very mindful as we have in terms of the reference being buybacks for shareholders, organic growth, supporting our franchise. It's hard to be so precise. We don't have a crystal ball. What we do have is a track record that shows that in challenging times, we do better than our peers. We are confident that we can deliver the Group targets that we just said. So let me just UK, U.S. So in terms of the UK, first is that the outlook for our business in the UK, which is 88% retail, continues to be very resilient, and we are committed to the UK. Just as a number, UK retail within the Group is 9% and UK retail; we're expecting to do better. So again, a good outlook for our business in the UK. And by the way, UK NII has bottomed out in the second half of 2024. And we expect that to be slightly up next year. Second is crucial to our results and performance in the UK is, of course, our mortgage -- we're mortgage lender essentially. And what we are seeing is that asset quality continues to be resilient. We are being very conservative in terms of how we stress. I think we stress around 8%, maybe Hector or Jos\u00e9 can confirm that, but be that's a number, so we are very -- we have very strong underwriting criteria, and that is essential for our returns. And third, what we are very confident is that Hector has explained it for ONE Transformation. We can do much more in the UK by leveraging the global platforms, bringing our global scale to benefit the UK. We have already migrated the UK to Gravity and some of the improvements are going to be ahead as we improve customer experience but also reduce the cost to serve. So again, there is more upside to our profitability. It remains a core market, as we have said. On the U.S., so I want to first say that we are very committed to having a strict capital allocation. This is really important for us and has been important throughout. The UK has been top of all our countries, all our geographies over the last decade and top also the last five years. This is really important because we are committed and have been on this capital allocation and returns in euros to our shareholders. Part of that is the strong dollar. And it is a natural hedge against and even more now that the earnings are going up. So that's the first point. The second is that we refocused our strategy in the U.S. a couple of years ago, and we were very clear. We're not trying to be all things to all people. We want to deliver profitable growth anchored on four pillars. First, our consumer bank. That is 70% of what the U.S. as a geography is and it continues to improve consumer will be one of our best-performing divisions in terms of the delta, and that is not just the U.S. but also Consumer Europe, with lower rates, Consumer, which is about 20% of our PAT, we'll do better and will improve profitability driven by results in the U.S. We're not going to give a specific number, but it's hundreds of millions more if you do the math. Very importantly, the launch of Openbank is going to help us optimize funding and even more so in the context of maybe not so much lower dollar rates. In terms of the corporate bank, it's been hugely accretive to our network. If you look at our corporate bank within the Group, most of the returns are coming in country, so over half of our corporate bank is actually Brazil and Spain. The U.S. is helping us to leverage that network. We've said we will not materially increase capital allocation, and it's been a very significant driver of fee growth in the U.S., corporate investment banking is up 81% year-on-year. And finally, we have a very profitable, again, very much focused on our LatAm franchise wealth business. So we will continue to allocate organic capital to the United States and to the Americas.\nMarta Sanchez: A specific question on taxes.\nAna Bot\u00edn: Taxes, yes, either Hector or Jose on taxes.\nHector Grisi: Let me just complement a little bit, I mean, what Ana was saying. I mean, in the UK, just to give you an idea in terms of you were asking revenue is going to be up mid-single-digits, and we expect a lot of around 11%, okay? I'm talking in constant. We have no view on FX at this point, okay? It's very important also to tell you that, I mean, we have 40 million clients in the UK. We're starting to sell different products to them. As Ana said, we have a basically mortgage franchise over there, but we're starting doing some other businesses with them. We're starting to do credit cards, cards are starting to grow. It's the second largest market in the world. So we'll start to cross-sell into that client base. And that basically is helping us out to have a much better franchise and we have the capabilities to do it because we have a business at scale that allow us to do so. In terms of the U.S. just give you, I mean, in terms of guidance that you were asking, I mean, we see revenue up high-single-digit, okay? And accounting RoTE will be around circa 10%. If you adjust the RoTE because of the excess capital that we have, we're talking about 14%. So it's quite good. And in regards of what the tax -- on the tax, I understand, I mean, I explained to you very well the situation due to the fact that what we're doing in terms of leasing, we're not really going to find out exactly the numbers until we see how we're going to allocate that one throughout the year, so.\nAna Bot\u00edn: Yes.\nHector Grisi: Okay, all right. Thank you.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks. Thanks, Marta. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from the line of Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.\nFrancisco Riquel: Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on capital. I wanted to ask you about the 13% CET1 target for 2025. If that 13% already includes any special share buyback beyond the ordinary distributions that we should expect in 2025 or if the special share buybacks will be back-end loaded to 2026. And in this context, I wonder if you can guide us on the organic generation that we should expect in 2025, particularly also on the plans for risk transfers this year? And also on any negative regulatory impacts, Basel IV other impacts, DTAs in Brazil, et cetera. And my second question is about Brazil. How do you see your business hoping in a higher Selic environment? What is your appetite for loan growth? How big can squeeze on margins from the higher rates, how sensitive the cost of risk to the Selic and you can update also on your transformation plans here in this market? Thank you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: So on capital, let me just give you a high level and then Jos\u00e9 maybe can give you more detail, or Hector. But let me just reiterate. We will distribute excess capital and our capital hierarchy is what we have -- what I said earlier. Organic growth, distributions, discipline in inorganic and extraordinary over those times. So again, we have a lot of organic opportunity that is profitable. We cannot know how much of that is going to happen. Point number two, we are not changing our target for capital. It will remain above 12%. Our operating range will be between 12% to 13% and the excess buybacks over the ordinary buyback and cash distributions will be during 2025 and 2026. We are not going to be more precise than that. Again, go back to the hierarchy, and we want to have -- and we want to deliver the best possible for our shareholders. We have that optionality given our model. In terms of the regulatory letter, do you want to Hector or who wants to\u2026\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: Sorry. Sorry, Paco. So in terms of risk-weighted asset growth, we would expect ordinary business-driven risk-weighted asset growth of around 4% to 5%, mostly compensated by asset mobilization initiatives. So net, we would expect to see very little risk-weighted asset growth, maybe 1% or 2%. Regulatory charges, we expect to have a figure close to 2024. And again, there is a high degree of uncertainty here because of the technical notes that need to be released by the EDA but a bit more, a bit less than what we have seen this year.\nAna Bot\u00edn: Okay. Let me give you the high level on Brazil. Let me just first say that with or without Brazil, we will deliver on our guidance. That's what we've done for the last 10 years. In terms of the Group, let me remind you, \u20ac62 billion approximately flat cost, stable cost of risk with an RoTE after AT1s of 16.5%. In terms of Brazil retail business, which is the one sensitive to moving rates, and these are numbers that with the additional transparency on the global business, you can actually hopefully have as much confidence in that we will deliver as we do as a management team. So Retail Brazil contributes about 38% of Brazil net profit, and that is 7% --7% of the overall Santander Group attributable profit. The rest of our global businesses in Brazil, which contribute more than 60% Consumer, Corporate, Payments and Wealth, we expect to continue to do well. By the way, this is more or less the same as for all the other countries, i.e., for the group, 50% roughly of our bottom line, 60% of our balance sheet is Retail. All the other businesses, I said that in my presentation, should grow revenues more than -- much more than Retail next year. So this is part of the work we've done in ONE Transformation in Consumer. It's part of the work we're doing with our network businesses, leveraging on our customer relationships. All in all, what we expect is Brazil RoTE to be stable in 2025 as a country driven by higher customer revenues and especially fee income, contained cost, and this is really important. ONE Transformation will also be very important in Brazil with a flat cost to income roughly in 2025. And very important, we have structurally improved the quality of our balance sheet in 2022 and have been prudent on growth. Thank you.\nRaul Sinha: We have the next question, please.\nOperator: Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Hallam: Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. First of all, Ana, I appreciate the color you gave earlier on the strategy in the U.S. When you see and hear the messaging around potentially a more accommodating regulatory backdrop in that market, how does that impact the business in the U.S.? And where does that create opportunities? And how could that potentially impact your strategy in the U.S., if at all? And then, secondly, perhaps more of a modeling question. Looking at Q4, there was a higher-than-usual level of other gains and losses and provisioning. And I think the full year number of \u20ac4.8 billion was up significantly year-over-year. Can you just walk through what is it in that line? And how much of that is investment into future efficiency improvements, restructuring, et cetera? And where should that line item trend across 2025 and 2026? Thank you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: Okay. So on the U.S., I've said that many times, operating context matters. So yes, other things equal, if the operating context improves in the U.S., that will naturally drive better returns, other things equal vis-\u00e0-vis other regions. So we cannot be too specific right now. We really don't know what's going to happen, but everybody and ourselves included is anticipating a better operating context for banks in the United States, which again, other things equal, should drive over time, at least, increased capital allocation, as I've said before, I mean, our investment in the U.S. has always and even more now since we are in a growth mode, leverage the Group. If on top of that, we get a better environment, we should do better. And that's what I said before; the U.S. asset geography will be one of the biggest upsides in our P&L without being too specific. But I think we said that the RoTE, Hector said it, he said 14%, I would say, Hector respectively between 14% to 15%, adjusted RoTE, I hope you agree on that. So yes, 14% to 15%, and the reason is very simple. Consumer business is 70% and that already is higher and what's dragging down this year, but not next year. And of course, with very positive contribution is the CIB investment, which, as I said, is leveraging the network. In terms of other, I would let either Hector or Jos\u00e9 to answer in a bit more detail. But yes, in that other, there are some one-offs, for example, over \u20ac300 million, if I remember correctly, in PagoNxt restructuring. This is going to drive a much better performance in our Payments division next year. Again, that's going to be one of the biggest upsides. So we are very -- we have been very disciplined not just with our -- where do we put our capital in terms of lending, but where do we put our capital in terms of growth. We decided to get out of acquiring in Europe that is going to drive a much better performance by focusing on our core markets and acquiring, which is mostly LatAm. There's a couple of things that are recurring there and a couple of others that are not. So maybe do you want to take that, Hector?\nHector Grisi: Sure, Ana. I mean, to complete what Ana said in 2024, the following one-offs events impacted our P&L especially. I mean in Q1 2024, we had a higher temporary levy on the revenue margin in Spain, that's \u20ac335 million. In Q2 2024, I mean the write-down that she was explaining about PagoNxt, in Q3, \u20ac70 million related to the Fundacion, and in Q4 2024, that's \u20ac260 million provision taken for the situation with the motor in the UK. So all in all, that's basically it, and we don't expect any of those to basically repeat themselves, maybe just, I mean, in terms of the tax levy in Spain that we will be basically being impacted on the first quarter of this year.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks very much, Hector. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAlvaro Serrano: Hi, good morning. I've got a couple of follow-ups on one on capital and another one on the global platforms. On capital, there's a sort of a trend globally seems like around deregulation. I just wanted to pick your brain, Ana, maybe on how do you think that's going to manifest itself for Santander because ultimately, I heard cross guiding for another close to 60 basis points capital headwinds this year, similar to last year. Obviously, there was a press report earlier this week where you've taken the ECB to court [ph] around the DTAs in Brazil. So can you maybe sort of give us your latest thoughts on how regulators are going to treat the banks going forward? And in particular, how do you see that playing out for Santander? And second, on platforms on your Consumer and Retail, I think your cost to income is now 40%. I've heard your comments during the call; could you maybe walk us through which countries still need to roll out Gravity from here? And when we think about how low are those costs and all those -- that cost income can go, who do you benchmark yourself against. Can you give us an idea of how good it can get, thank you, medium-term, it doesn't have to -- I heard your targets for this year. Thank you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: So Alvaro that is a tricky question. You're asking me what the regulators are going to do. I wish I knew. But I would say that for the first time in 10 years, the probability, and I've said it publicly, I've said it in many different occasions in recent meetings, including, I think, in yours, I think, first, Europe has built \u20ac300 billion in capital, something like this over the banks last few years. The fact that we have built capital in many cases, twice. I mean our economic capital, we've said many times is lower than our current targets, and we will keep those targets, of course, because it's something which the market and regulators have surprised us. So we don't -- we are -- we don't want to be surprised. As we said, 12 to 13 is a big buffer on buffers. But I would say that, again, for the first time in 10 years, and especially given the outlook for the U.S. regulation being, I would say, less rather than more, means that at least, and this is, again, what I've said, let's take a pause, not just on regulation, but how you interpret regulation. We need to be able to compete on a level playing field. DTAs in Brazil, even in the case of a dissolving the bank have value, the direct claim against the government. We feel very strongly that puts us at a disadvantage as we compete with the U.S. and local banks in Brazil. So it's not a big number, by the way. It's more a question of principle because every single bank in Europe has similar issues. So I do think we should be in a more predictable area, but there's still CRR, there's still models, and so we want to make sure that. And the big difference is that in spite of that, given our strong profitability outlook, the change in the model, the fact a lot depends on us. That's why we are saying we are aiming for additional distributions beyond the regular distributions. In terms of retail and the platforms, you've seen it in -- we call ONE Transformation for the whole business model across the five divisions, but the biggest upside is on retail and consumer. You've seen that. I think Hector just gave you some numbers. There's a lot of upside. Gravity is an enabler. It's not the biggest contributor to scaling. The fact that you have Gravity allows you to bring through APIs; a lot of the other products that we are building, a lot of the other benefits of being cloud native, Payments is another one Payments Hub, which is still being rolled out. So a lot of the work is about aligning business model, aligning the organization and then comes the technology. And that is why we see a lot of upside in our retail consumer platform, basically bringing together 170 million customers, which, we have about 4 million companies, commercial corporates, but a lot of that is retail consumer.\nHector Grisi: Alvaro, just really quickly, I mean, as Ana was saying, just Retail and Consumer and are the ones that are the most important ones. I mean in terms of cost to income, Retail and Consumer is going to be around flat in terms of cost to income. And Consumer basically is going to be down low-single-digits, okay? So that's what we are seeing for 2025. Thank you.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks very much, Alvaro. We have the next question, please.\nOperator: Next question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: Thank you for taking my questions and I'll start with your guidance. Consensus is over \u20ac1 billion behind your minimum guidance for 2025 profits. Do you see further growth in 2026 over 2025? And where is consensus too conservative from your standpoint? Second question is on ONE Transformation. A bit of a follow-up to what Alvaro just asked. But where are the next geographies you're planning to roll the plan out to? And given you're now looking at absolute numbers, how much do you think ONE Transformation will save in absolute euro billion at full phasing? And final, in capital, 13% CET1 is what we hoped to convince the market on Santander's capital strength. I hear you on the maintaining 12% to 13% operating level. But are you amending the 10 to 15 basis points organic CET1 client per quarter, which was based on a much lower profitability and approach to risk-weighted assets. And Jos\u00e9, can you please make explicit what sort of regulatory hurdles we are expecting 40 basis points given you said they will be similar to 2024? Thank you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: So the answer to your first question, without being very specific on numbers is we will grow our bottom line and we will grow our profitability in 2025. And I think I can say that our expectation is this will continue in 2026, 2027. You will get a lot more detail in our next Investor Day, which we expect to do towards the end of this year or beginning of next year. The model still has a lot of upside. As I've said today, we're only scratching the surface of our potential as a Group in a context that we do anticipate and we count would be volatile more challenging, we are saying we will grow profits and profitability with stable cost in euros and costs coming down and stable cost of risk. So again, yes, Santander will continue to deliver increasing profits and profitability with all the evidence and with all the, obviously, market assumptions we're making. So yes, in terms of ONE Transformation, at the end, we are aiming to grow customers, grow revenues and improve efficiency. This is not about cost savings. This is about changing fundamentally how we operate the bank. We are working across the bank to make sure there's end-to-end accountability for example. The same way we're building payments hub or Gravity, we're going to build investments and others. What this means is that you're going to see the savings, not just in one country, but in the global business benefiting all the countries. This is a very important difference. As I said before, by being part of Santander, we are generating \u20ac20 billion already today of network efficiencies. This is how we will generate further efficiencies. Today, we're still building investment products in Openbank, in Retail, in Wealth. As of next month, we're going to have and Hector, please confirm this because that's actually between both of us. But under Hector, once we create a single investments platform across the Group, we're going to save money, we're going to build a better investment platform, and we're going to grow faster. And so you need to think of this by global businesses. Having said that, what is, at the end, the bottom line best performing division next year? In terms of the delta, Retail will be more or less flat in terms of profitability because, yes, rates matter. Not as much as people think because if you go country by country, it's only 50%, roughly, 55%:45%. That is retail. And of that, there is diversification by country. So again, you'll see absolute cost savings across the divisions and some of that will benefit one countries more than other. Maybe Hector, you want to add to that briefly in terms of in a minute. But in terms of capital, just going regulatory hurdles, maybe Jos\u00e9, you can take that more detail one, 12% to 13% is our operating range. We've been very clear on that. 13% is not a new minimum, but it is where we want to be by the end of this year. We will distribute excess capital following a capital hierarchy of more or less organic profitable growth. And again, that's difficult to predict. We want to make sure we maximize shareholder value creation, 10, 15 basis points per quarter that is actually much more than that now. But why don't I let you answer that?\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: Yes. Hi, Andrea, in terms of the regulatory charges, it's a combination of lots of small things in terms of model reviews and updates, inspections and the potential impacts from the RTS is published by the EBA. And in terms of 10% to 15% per quarter, we are not changing that. I think we have great growth opportunities, as I discussed. And the growth -- the most important thing is not evenly distributed throughout the year. So it's the growth in capital as we saw this year, it's sort of happen tend to concentrate towards the end of the year, second quarter and fourth quarter.\nHector Grisi: Thank you, Andrea. Just to complement to what Ana was saying. There's three very important points, and I'm going to be very brief. I mean, first of all, we're becoming the number one bank to our customers. That's basically the most important change of the model. That's why you see fees growing. And if you analyze country by country, you're going to see -- for example, in Retail, this is the biggest change that -- and that's why we basically guiding you mid-high single-digit growth in terms of fees, okay? That's a change of the model. Remember that also change of the model is not just a platforms is basically simplification, which is helping us and is dropping the amount of products. Now we just offered more than 50 products to our customers, we still have a lot of the backlog, but we're automatizing all of that. So automation is another very important part. And then, the deployment of the platforms where, for example, we finished the deployment of OneApp, all of Europe. You see the results of NPS on the UK. Now it's coming down to Brazil. Mid-part of the year is going to be in Mexico and then it's coming down to Chile and Argentina. And that you're going to be basically see the results, which will improve, first of all, again, being number one bank to our customers; and second, the fee generations. Thank you.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks very much, Hector. We have the next question, please.\nOperator: Next question from the line of Cecilia Romero from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nCecilia Romero: Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on the results. My first one is in your growth strategy. Where do you see the most significant opportunities for expansion and growth over the next two years geographically, you talked about the U.S., but is there any other countries where you see the bank gaining in scale for example, Mexico? Also, I wanted to ask you on the quarter in regards to the very different dynamics that we're seeing in Portugal and Spain NII. Spain was flat and Portugal at minus 11%. Could you explain why such a divergent trend? And is this what we're going to see in 2025, a resilient NII in Spain and NII in Portugal following double-digit. And could you please let us know what your rate assumption is in this guidance? Thank you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: So in terms of growth for the next couple of years, and again, we are looking at this by global businesses. So -- and I will give you detail by country within the global business. In terms of growth, and this is important. Retail will not grow much in the next year. 2026, we'll see what happens to growth and revenues. We are putting much more emphasis at least for now on profitability. We've grown 8 million customers. We're growing the top-line, not just because of the euro rates benefit this year, but also because 8 million customers is a lot of customers. So again, given the context, our top-line in Retail will not grow as much in 2025. Within that, there will be differences as I've said. If you look at -- within Retail, what are the countries that will grow more or less, I mean, obviously, in the euro area will grow less because of the impact, but fees will grow to compensate partly and 50% of our businesses that are not Retail will all grow the top-line and the bottom line, including consumer in the U.S. and Europe. That is why I said the U.S. will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the lower rates, even I want to stress, not as low as probably the market thinks. I will let maybe Jos\u00e9 give some of the assumptions behind these numbers. In terms of NII in Spain and Portugal, let me go back again to the global business, and I will tell you within that. So if you look at Retail, the countries that will grow will not be the European countries, top-line, I'm saying profitability will be the same, maybe a bit lower in some of them and higher in others within Retail. Overall, the Retail -- and again, the four big countries are roughly 70% of Retail. The other 50% is not sensitive to higher rates -- sorry, it's not rate sensitive, but that's at least as well, if not better, again, given the investments with a lower rate environment. For Spain, you can give the -- maybe the guidance for Spain, which is one of the guidance we're going to give.\nJos\u00e9Garc\u00edaCantera: Okay. So let me very quickly go through the measures we've taken to decrease the interest rate sensitivity in the eurozone. We have taken three very important measures. One, we have an ALCO portfolio that has grown -- has been created in the last year and a half. Right now in the eurozone, we have a total of \u20ac67 billion of government bonds. The second, we implemented hedges on the asset side of the balance sheet, particularly mortgages through forward starts that go up to two years. And we also increased the percentage of liabilities at variable rates. With this, if you look at NII in Spain in the fourth quarter, which basically concentrates on the retail business, you see a negative impact of around 2% from volumes and also margins that decreased around 17%. But this was compensated by the positive impacts of these measures that I just mentioned. Hedges added around \u20ac100 million to NII and the ALCO portfolio around \u20ac180 million to the NII. That's why NII in the quarter was basically flat. Going forward, NII in Spain, again, which is mostly and primarily concentrated in the Retail business. If rates stay and stabilize at around 2%, we would expect to see NII in Spain to drop between 5% to 6% next year. So that is the sensitivity. But let me reiterate again that we have decreased the percentage of assets and liabilities subject to rates in Spain. In December 2022, 70% of -- 76% of assets was floating, 46% of liabilities was floating. In December 2024, only 64% of assets were floating and 51% of liabilities were floating. So we decreased the sensitivity on the asset side while increase the sensitivity on the liability side. So we are much better prepared for lower rates.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks very much, Jos\u00e9. We have the next question, please.\nOperator: Next question from the line of Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank. Please go ahead.\nCarlos Peixoto: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll shift the question a bit to Mexico. So you had a relatively good performance in the quarter. And I was wondering how do you see -- how do you expect evolution in terms of loan volumes and also in NII into 2025? And whether you have any sensitivity to any impacts that potential tariffs, which were not delayed for a month, but let's see what happens there. Well, basically, your views on how could that affect overall activity in the country, particularly in the global various CIB business in Mexico, which by the way, if you could tell us how much it accounts for Mexico contribution to be interesting. And then, just as a small clarification on the capital organic generation that you mentioned before, the 10 basis points to 15 basis points per quarter. I just wanted to understand if that's already net generation from -- net of the regulatory impact, the 60 basis points you mentioned? Or is that before the regulatory impact? Thank you very much.\nAna Bot\u00edn: So again, let me just reiterate, and I'll get to Mexico in a minute, but we have significant business and geographic diversification. Mexico, like other countries is roughly 50%, I think probably between 45% to 55% is Retail and the percentage of revenue and roughly also bottom line of Mexico when Retail is 12% and Mexico is around 15% of the total. So again, not a huge contribution on Retail, which is going to be the one most sensitive to volumes. Half of our business, and I'll let Hector go into that in more detail is with Corporates and Affluent. We have a lot of high-quality business in Mexico. Actually, the biggest opportunity is in the Retail, i.e., in the mass market. We have also launched Openbank there to take advantage of that. And we have been very prudent in terms of our lending much more than other peers we have focused over the last few months actually on a higher quality segment. So clearly, the Mexican economy could be more affected than others, but it should not have a significant impact on our expected delivery. So maybe you want to give a bit more color on Mexico?\nHector Grisi: I think you explained it very well, Ana. I mean, the fact of the matter is that we have been, I would say, prudent given the environment in Mexico we've been growing a lot less than our competitors because we believe that it was important to be conservative. We are very much concentrated on going towards the part of the portfolio that has collateral. We've been concentrated a lot more on auto loans on mortgages and will be decreasing. Even though we have been growing in Consumer, not as much as the rest of the market. So I basically very comfortable of what are we doing there. And I believe that the guidance that I can give you, given that we are including a mild trade war, we're talking about Mexico in terms of revenue, up high-single digits, okay? And in terms of RoTE between around 20% to 22%, again, is in constant no view on FX, okay? Thank you.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00edaCantera: It's pre-regulatory charges.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks very much, Jos\u00e9. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from the line of Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSofie Peterzens: Yes. Hi, this is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my questions. So just going back to the guidance, I know you have now given guidance for net interest income in Spain, but it will be down 5% to 6% if rates are 2%. You also gave guidance for the UK and Mexico. But with the third quarter results, you gave guidance kind of on a country-by-country level for net interest income. Would that be possible to also get now for 2025? And then, my second question would be, I know you've mentioned that UK is the core part of Santander, but and you focus on organic growth. But if you could kind of talk about M&A how you view your peers that are heavily involved in M&A? Do you think that will change the European banking landscape and how do you see Santander better positioned in a landscape where you have more M&A and how will you kind of evaluate any opportunities that arise potentially in Portugal, potentially elsewhere in Europe. So if you could comment on this. Thank you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: So we're going to give -- just on your first question, thank you. We are not going to give detailed NII by country. We're going to give most of the countries, and Jos\u00e9 can explain that. I'd like to go back to what we are committing and it's on the last slide or I think the last slide in the presentation. Revenues in euros \u20ac62 billion, roughly the same as this year, mid-high single-digit growth in fees. And then by divisions, I think we have given also and I think Hector has mentioned, retail, which is 50% of the group flat revenues and more or less flat returns, consumer. Again, mostly 90% of that is Europe and the U.S., revenues up mid-single digit and profitability improving significantly, including in the U.S. Our Corporate Bank, which is about 20% of our profits and 14% of our revenues. Revenue is up, profitability improving to 20%, which is roughly where we said would be by this year, wealth 10%, payments a big delta because of the restructuring. So I think that is much more detail we\u2019ve given you, and I think I don\u2019t -- I cannot add much more on that. In terms of the UK and M&A, I want to say several things. First, we do not need to buy yourself to allocate capital to the more interesting opportunities for Santander shareholders where we combine profitability growth franchise, and that\u2019s what we are doing in a very dynamic way across our footprint. In terms of how we think about this, I want to go back to what I said, I think, at the beginning of the call in terms of how we think about capital allocation in a context where we anticipate excess capital given the higher profitability we have been very strict and very disciplined. First, we prioritize profitable organic growth and investments across our current footprint. Santander, this is how you should think about. We are a compounder. We\u2019re going to compound earnings, returns, book value and distributions. Second is ordinary dividends and distributions, including buybacks. Third, inorganic. Let me just say this again. It must be complementary to our strategic aims, generate attractive financial returns, which means that they have to surpass those of organic investments or share buybacks. And then -- and this is the first time in 10 years, we anticipate excess capital given our plans. I want to reiterate again, we are very good at predicting within a range of 2% to 3% on average the last 10 years. Actually, you can go back more. Some of our shareholders know this. Every quarter, we have very little earnings volatility. This perception of volatility is not based on fact, it\u2019s based on perception. So again, any incremental capital that exceeds our target range operating -- we\u2019re not actually -- sorry, no, that exceeds the other opportunities I just mentioned would be returned as additional remuneration and that\u2019s how we think about inorganic. Let me just say that the framework in Europe. It\u2019s not there for cross-border M&A, and that is why you\u2019re seeing some of our peers that don\u2019t have alternative profitable growth looking more at in-market M&A, but that\u2019s not where we are.\nRaul Sinha: Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from the line of Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Reale: Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Antonio from Bank of America. Just two questions for me, please. So you\u2019ve introduced this new commitment to pay \u20ac10 billion buybacks over 2025 and 2026. You talked about shifting capital within the group rather than asset sales, and this has been an important part of your strategy. Maybe can you talk a little bit more about that point to give us a sense of the flexibility that you retain to shift capital across the group, meet your profit guidance and still achieve the buyback commitment should the macro picture worsen just to get a sense of the flexibility that you retain there on the capital optimization. And the second point, you\u2019ve mentioned the group is highly diversified. You\u2019ve given, I think, a very good overview of your expectations for 2025 across products. Can I just go back to Brazil? And could you share the same for the region. It\u2019s a relatively large share of your group and it\u2019s a market focus region, particularly dig more into the link between net interest margins, loan origination and affordability, ultimately reflecting cost of risk for Brazil and maybe the measures that you\u2019ve put in place at your local unit to go through the cycling cycle, please. Thank you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: So I mean, just to give you some color on organic capital across the group. So we started working on this 10 years ago. We didn\u2019t have the tools to manage regulatory capital. We\u2019re always very good at managing economic capital. Today, we have a very dynamic capital allocation strategy. So we shift on a weekly basis where we put more or less capital, depending on the opportunities. Of course there\u2019s a franchise consideration. I mean, why would we write lots of mortgages in Spain below 2% when I can get much better value in mortgages in Mexico. This is one of the reasons that giving guidance very specifically on countries is not something that we\u2019re very keen on because we will deliver at the group level, and we\u2019re making more and more profits, an increasing profitability because we are managing in a dynamic way. We do not have a crystal ball, right? We don\u2019t know what the peers are going to. We don\u2019t know exactly what the rates are going to be. So we managed this it reports to the Chief Investment Officer to the CFO and to the CEO who have topped down managing this with the global business in the countries. This is really the huge advantage you have with Santander, 87%, and we are prioritizing profitability ahead of growth. But as I said, 8 million customers, new customers in the context of focusing on profitability. Can you imagine, once we are at the levels and our operating platform is more competitive, which it will be, we can have organic growth for many years to go. So yes, that is what we do every day. That\u2019s I don\u2019t want to exaggerate, but every week. So going back to that, and I defer to Hector or Jose, but on Brazil, I think we\u2019ve said. So Brazil as a country, I think Hector has said it, but if not, let me reiterate, we expect revenue to go up and more or less stable returns. That is where we see Brazil. But let me just be very clear that, as I said before, if you look at the retail business and how much of the retail business, which is 50% and the most sensitive one, to what rates might do or not, Retail Brazil is about 23%.\nHector Grisi: 22%.\nAna Bot\u00edn: No, Retail Brazil is 23% of retail -- of the group, right? Half of the top line in the business of Brazil is non-retail, roughly. And that is not sensitive to rates. Obviously, cost of risk matters, but that is something which we\u2019ve also been diversifying. So again, Brazil should do about the same as this year in terms of profitability with higher revenues and the 50% that is not retail, which is not rate sensitive, being one of the drivers in Brazil this year.\nHector Grisi: Just to complement what Ana said, okay, it\u2019s very important that Brazil is the place that you can see where we\u2019re changing the model. In terms of NII, being -- I mean, being not the driver, but actually being fees the driver in the sense that we\u2019re doing things, okay? Deposit and fees, it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re concentrated on. We have changed the mix of the portfolio. This base Mexico, basically making us most resilient to rates and has reduced the sensitivity to higher rates through the hedging. We are 100% hedged for 2025 on the P&L in Brazil. So it\u2019s very important that you know that, okay? It\u2019s also important to tell you that the current yield curve stepping we have a similar smaller impact than previously expected, as I told you, and as of December, a 100 basis point upward move on the selling has an impact of around \u20ac120 million of NII. So we\u2019re pretty much hedged all the structure is basically in place. And we believe that on credit quality, even though we remain vigilant over the past few years [indiscernible] has grown lending is lower than peers, and we have tightening the underwriting criteria. So the current economic forecast for GDP and growth to slow, but we remain positive during the year. On cost of risk in an adverse case scenario, due to changes in the portfolio. We see the cost of risk to perform marginally weaker than in 2024, but really not changing the outlook for the overall cost of the risk. This is exactly going back to what Ana was saying. It doesn\u2019t impact the rest of the group, it\u2019s quite small, and it doesn\u2019t change overall picture. Diversification is the essence in the group.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks very much, Hector. Since we\u2019re running out of time, can we take the last two questions, please? And the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Britta Schmidt from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nBritta Schmidt: Yes. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Just to make sure that we interpret the payout guidance correctly in timing, I guess, is relevant here. You guide to a 13% CET1 ratio after 50% ordinary payouts and 60 basis points of regulatory headwinds. And you would consider dropping below that with excess distribution in 2025, but not to go below 12.5% pro forma. And then the second question is just on Brazil again, on the DTA or DTCs rather, why has the ECB now changed its view on this? Has anything been recorded in the Q4 CET1? And what is the maximum remaining risk here in an outpost decision? Or is the decisions maintained? Thank you.\nAna Bot\u00edn: Okay. So let me just be clear. We will not be below 13% this year. Our intention is to operate at 13%. But we are leaving ourselves flexibility depending on the capital hierarchy, I described, organic profitable growth, which we\u2019re very keen to make sure we take advantage of distributions, making sure that any inorganic, which we\u2019re not counting on for any of the distributions, everything we\u2019re saying is organic growth, organic distributions, et cetera. Being more than buybacks, et cetera. So again, we are aiming to be at 13% and have some flexibility going forward between the 12% and 13%, being always above 12%, which is where we are. In terms of the -- I\u2019ll let Jose answer the one on the DTAs. The reason we are contesting this is because we believe that level playing field, an asset, which in Brazil is valid, full claim against the government where other banks operating in the country, U.S. or local banks have a different treatment. We think that, that does not make sense. It\u2019s a question of principle. The effect is not going to be much up or down. Jose?\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: No. The deduction of Brazilian monetizable DTAs from capital was already taken in the fourth quarter. So if this ruling is not in favor, basically maintains ECB\u2019s interpretation, there will not be impact. There will be no impact on capital.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks very much, Jos\u00e9. Very clear. Can we have the last question, please?\nOperator: Last question from the line Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Cerezo: Hey, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ve got two on the asset mobilization efforts. The first one is if you can give us some detail on the breakdown of those measures, both from a geographical point of view in terms of the loan books, basically, you\u2019re using to accelerate capital optimization. And the second question is, if you have any internal limits in terms of how much you can do per annum? And if you can see any regulatory constraints in terms of amounts actually you can do at some point in the future? Thank you.\nJose Garcia Cantera: Thank you, Ignacio. The -- around a third of what we do is hedges, one-third is asset disposals and a third more or less is SRTs is synthetic securitizations. We do this in all geographies. Obviously, synthetic securitizations is mostly in developed economies in hard currency, but the other strategies we are doing in all geographies. As long as we are not the best tenors, the best holders of some of the assets we originate, and someone is willing to buy these assets below our cost of capital, we will to -- we will continue mobilizing the assets. Last year, the average cost of equity at which we mobilize the assets was around 8% compared with our cost of capital of whatever, 14% or 15% or whatever. So as long as that\u2019s the case, we will continue to mobilize the assets. Now going forward, as we optimize the back book, most mobilization will be related to the front book. So you should expect to see a gradual reduction in the total amount because it will be most related to front book, not so much as it\u2019s been the case so far to the back book.\nRaul Sinha: Thanks very much, Jose. With that, we are at the end of the Q&A session. I will hand back to Ana to conclude.\nAna Bot\u00edn: So thank you so much, Raul. Thank you, everybody. I just want to reiterate, we\u2019re only scratching the surface of our potential as a group. We believe 2025 will be more challenging, will be volatile. We are preparing for things to be exciting even rocky maybe at times this year. And we are very confident that our strategy is working, that our model is going to mean that we are going to do better than peers this year in what -- again, we know is not going to be an easy year. So thank you again, and see you soon.\nRaul Sinha: This completes our call. We look forward to catching up with all of you in our usual road shows, and we will reach out to anybody who didn\u2019t answer, managed to ask a question separately offline as well. Thanks very much.",

        "text": "Thank you, Raul, and welcome, everybody to our full year results presentation. 2024 was another record year, the third consecutive year of record results for Santander. It shows the benefits of our strategy, the resilience of our business model. As we said in 2023, we have entered a new phase of value creation and this has enabled us to deliver or exceed all our key financial targets. Profit reached a record \u20ac12.6 billion, supported by both strong revenue growth and customer growth. We grew 8 million customers. And this happened across all our global businesses in a very balanced way. We have continued to invest for the future and we're making excellent progress towards a more simple and more integrated model through one transformation. This has been instrumental in improvements in efficiency by more than 2 percentage points and increasing our profitability RoTE to 16.3%. Our balance sheet remains solid with a strong capital ratio ends the year at an all-time high of 12.8, reflecting our ability to generate capital organically. Finally, we delivered again strong shareholder value creation with TNAV and dividend per share growing by 14%. And by the way, this is in spite of pressure from currency devaluation in some markets, which was offset by our profitability and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar with our U.S. business acting as a natural hedge against the pressure on the Brazilian Real, for example. So let me just go into a bit more detail on our full year performance. Again, very high quality of results with strong growth in our top-line revenue up 10% in constant euros, and as I said, supported by both customer activity and good delivery across all our businesses. Fee income is up 11% again in constant supported by significant growth in customers, up 8 million and very much the network benefits we are capturing throughout the Group, which already represent about \u20ac20 billion about a third of our revenues are due to being part of the Santander Group. Expenses grew well below revenue, showcasing again the positive effects of our ONE Transformation. And we delivered record net operating income of \u20ac36 billion. Finally, we continue to be prudent in our approach to risk and our cost of risk ended at 1.15% better than our initial guidance for the year. Again, we have shown over time that our results are sustainable and less volatile over the cycle than most of our peers and this is again because we are retail consumer powerhouse with a business model that combines both geographical diversification with business diversification and a strong risk management. You can see here that all of our five global businesses delivered revenue growth, while we improved profitability. The performance of retail consumer reflects the scale and the benefits of our transformation, ONE Transformation improving efficiency but also growing customers. Wealth, CIB and PagoNxt have each delivered improved profitability, again leveraging our network strengths and capabilities. The combination of these global businesses with the geographical diversification places us in a very strong spot for the next year and for the future. We're enhancing our disclosure to allow the market all of you to better forecast our global businesses, in the same way that we have been doing for years internally. I would also highlight that while higher interest rates benefit our retail franchise in Europe, other parts of our business such as consumer and certain developing market geographies will do better with lower rates. And it is this diversification that allows us to deliver current strong results, consistent profitable growth and value creation. Again, our performance this year, the execution of our strategy puts us on track for our 2025 financial targets. On retail, which is the heart of our banking business, we are making very good progress. Our aim is to become the number one bank for our customers. ONE Transformation is delivering excellent results. And by the way, there\u2019s a lot more to come, growing 4 million -- around 4 million active customers with about to 80 million total with lower cost per transaction. We are improving our digital onboarding, digital sales grow by 16%. The number of products has been reduced by almost 40% with special focus on the front book, and this is -- you're going to see benefits of this in the next few years, of course. And you will see that it\u2019s not just on the cost side, but also on revenues for 2025/2026. Second, we are consistently, but relentlessly deploying our global platform. In the UK, for example, customers have been migrated to the new global app that's already up and running in Spain, Portugal and Poland. And again, the global platform rollout and improvements in customer experience will drive additional customer growth with lower absolute cost. In consumer, our priority continues to be delivering the best solutions for our customers, but also improve our competitive advantage on cost across our footprint. You can see here the operational leverage for the year, where we are growing revenues at 6% and decreasing costs by 1%. It's been a groundbreaking year in our transformation and a great example of this is our checkout lending platform, Zinia, which, again, thanks to our scale and teams, we have been able to partner with both Apple and Amazon in Germany. This is absolutely key, not just today but for the future to be where our customers are going to be operating with us under our own brand. We have also successfully launched Openbank in the U.S. and Mexico. Openbank U.S. has gathered \u20ac2 billion of deposits that\u2019s about double what we expected and it's also improving our loan to deposit in the U.S. by about 12 percentage points. It's going to allow us to optimize our U.S. funding structure from the beginning. We are reducing the cost to serve in consumer. It's down significantly, as you can see. And for 2025 and this is key, we are actually expecting consumer to be one of our best-performing divisions in terms of the upside, where the U.S. being one of the countries that most improves the total country P&L. Our other three global businesses, Wealth, CIB and Payments, other ones driving fee growth. We anticipated this to you all in 2023 due to very strong network effects and also leveraging technology. Our corporate bank, we are focused on the markets where we are present with a strong footprint. And as you know, we're delivering good growth in profits. We are maintaining our usual risk profile. In the U.S. in 2024, corporate bank fees have increased by 21% and revenues up by 14%. We are building the best wealth and insurance manager in our footprint, again, leveraging on our network. Wealth revenues up 15% in 2024, with fees up again double-digits across the three business lines. In Payments, we are building the backbone to connect the Group across different businesses and geographies. It's essential in our ONE Transformation. This is a very big market and a growing opportunity. In 2024, Payments volume is up 11%. And the key metric that we committed to EBITDA margin is close to a 30% target for this year for 2025. We're very close to that already. Going forward and especially in an environment of lower rates in Europe, CIB, Wealth and Payments are going to be critical in ensuring our targets for this year, including the fee income growth. So all of this performance, the strong operational and financial performance is driving higher capital generation, double-digit value creation and shareholder return. Our fully loaded CET1 rose to 12.8% at the end of December, January 1, still 12.8%, supported by record organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, increasing remuneration to shareholders and absorbing regulatory impacts. At current prices, share buybacks remain the best way to generate shareholder value since 2021 and including this new share buyback we've announced today for the year on 2024 earnings, we will have repurchased 15% of outstanding shares with a return on investment approximately 18% for our shareholders, and there is more to come. Hector will go into our financial performance in more detail, but let me just briefly given that I only get a chance to be with you once a year, at least formally, remind our -- all of you of our model and our strategy. As I say, this is a marathon. It's not a sprint. And in every single sprint, we're delivering what we committed. And this is because we are delivering numbers and results as we guide to every year, but we're also building the Santander of tomorrow. Our aim is to be the best open financial services platform for all our customers. We are working to become more competitive in a way that few others can replicate. And this is based on a unique combination of a customer base of 173 million customers, a global scale with local leadership and very important, all of this leading to high visibility of our results and predictability through the cycle. And the biggest area of upside even today for Santander comes from the network effect of belonging to the Group across our footprint and through the global business. Our confidence in our guidance stems because a lot of what's coming is under our control. And all of this let me stress in what we do anticipate a much more challenging and volatile macro. Just a few examples of how this is not a power point. This is already delivering numbers and results for our shareholders and for our customers. We -- these are some of the global platforms that are up and running and contributing to the performance and financial performance, which you are seeing and which is increasingly and this will continue to increase, making us different from our peers. These platforms will deliver and partly delivering already best services and better efficiency. Openbank is our digital bank rolled out now in the U.S. and Mexico. Zinia, I mentioned already, in 2024, there were 1.7 million new contracts, and we are signing in new countries with these partners. And Gravity, our core system, where our partner is Google is being offered to third parties through our joint venture, but it has already enabled Santander to reduce our cost per transaction by 10%, but it's obviously helping us to do much more than that in terms of the front-end systems. Again, we are confident we will compound growth throughout the cycle, creating value for our shareholders. Just a brief reminder of how this business model has already delivered the numbers. You can see it here, sustainable earnings growth year-after-year, improvements in profitability. Over the last decade, we have doubled our profit. Actually, we have tripled if you go back to the end of 2013 and a new record again in 2024. We have attracted 56 million new customers to Santander, RoTE our profitability increased to 16.3% from 11% in 2014. And of course, we have steadily built capital throughout this period. I just want to remind us, actually, when I took over, we started with a CET ratio of 8.3%. And of course, the way we calculate capital is not the same. But very importantly, for you, our shareholders -- of our shareholders, we have increased 6x shareholder remuneration. We are now closing at 12.8%, which near the top of our target operating range. And let me just stress operating range, we're not changing our target of over 12%, and this is, as I just mentioned, despite RWA inflation. So last but not least, before I turn over to Hector, this is our North Star, and this is our North Star since 2023. We could not target and commit to TNAV and dividend per share before 2023 for reasons that you all know well. The progress towards the target that we set is well ahead of plan. We continue to be focus on profitability and being very disciplined on capital allocation. Today, we have 87% of RWAs above cost of equity, further improving our profitability to above 16%. So let me now pass to Hector, who will take you over our financial performance in more detail. Hector, please?"

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Yes. Thank you, Ana. We look at our performance in constant currency, including the impact of Argentina, where a conservative approach to FX was adjusted in Q4. This resulted in a positive impact on NII with a negative offset in other income and cost. Let me start by highlighting our strong top-line performance. We achieved double-digit revenue growth, exceeding the targets we provided at the start of the year and even the ones we upgraded during the year. This was underpinned by sound growth in customer activity across the businesses, while reflecting the benefits of our model. The strong increase was mainly supported by the next things. First, our retail business, which continues to grow at double-digits with good performance in both NII and fees. A record year in CIB up 14% on the back of our investments and good activity levels and 15% revenue growth in Wealth driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and a really good performance of Santander Asset Management and Insurance. Consumer and Payments are also showing very good revenue trends with consumers delivering double-digit growth in fees on both PagoNxt and cards growing. More than 80% of the Group's NII comes from our Retail and Consumer businesses. The Group NIIs grew double-digit in 2024 with NIM of driven by asset repricing and controlled cost of deposits. Over the last few quarters, we have proactively managed our interest rate sensitivity to position our balance sheet for the new outlook on interest rates. In Spain, for example, our NII was flat quarter-over-quarter, partly due to our hedges. And in Brazil, our negative sensitivity to 100 basis points rise in rates is now lower at around \u20ac120 million. Going forward, our outlook for 2025, for the Group is similar to what we said in Q3. Excluding Argentina, we expect NII to be slightly up in constant euros and slightly down in current euros based on forward rates. In an environment of low credit demand in general, we generated another record performance in fee income through network effects from all our global businesses. Retail increased driven by the strong performance across our footprint on the back of good commercial dynamics and customer growth. In 2024, we put a greater focus on deploying targeted high value-added products and services, and this is expected to be a positive driver in 2025. In Consumer, we delivered double-digit growth fees across our core markets, driven by insurance and DCB in Europe, Brazil and now too in the U.S., and in 2025, we expect consumer fees to be slightly down due to the impact of the new regulation and insurance. CIB also grew strongly to record levels, supported by all CIB products with the U.S. a top contributor for fees nearly doubled. In Wealth, we delivered a very strong performance with double-digit fee growth backed by record assets under management. Excluding a one-time positive fee recorded in cards in 2023, payment fees were up slightly and are expected to grow strongly during 2025. ONE Transformation is key to why we can continue to get better in every single market, thanks to leveraging our global businesses. We expect sustainable improvements in operating leverage as this is a structural change in our model that will deliver benefits for years to come. Retail and Consumer are leading our transformation, which is delivering structural efficiency gains and operating leverage with cost growth of 1%, well below revenue growth of 9%. These two businesses represent 70% of our cost base and will continue to see lower costs going forward. CIB and Wealth cost increased by 13% year-on-year, showing positive jobs while driving higher fee income and payments operating performance reflects our strategic investments. As a result, our cost-to-income ratio improved from 41.8% for 2024, the best we have ever reported in 15 years and better than our original guidance. There is still more upside over the medium-term from our strategy, both revenue and cost. While we are ahead of our plan on execution of ONE Transformation and global tech capabilities, we have more to do capture network effects across our global businesses. This has delivered 66 basis points of improvements for our cost-to-income ratio with more upside to our original target of 100 basis points to 150 basis points. Retail and Consumer and more than 70% of our earnings and have significant upside. The rest of our earnings come from Wealth, CIB and Payments, which are fee-driven and will play to our network strengths. Our balance sheet, as you can see is rock solid. Credit quality is stable across our footprint ahead of our expectations with low unemployment and easing monetary policies in most of the countries, except for Brazil. Credit quality improved year-on-year as reflected in both NPL ratio and lower coverage needs. NPL ratio was 3.05%, improving both year-on-year and Q-on-Q. The NPL portfolio has collateral warranties and provisions that account for around 90% of its total exposure. The cost of risk improved to 1.15% better than our target of around 1.2% for the year. In our retail business, 12-month cost of risk improved year-on-year to 0.92%, with sound underlying trends across all the countries. In Brazil, we have grown credit at a slower pace than our peers and have made improvements to our portfolio underwriting over the past few years. Meanwhile, in consumer, 12-month cost of risk finished at 2.16% in line with the normalization expected in 2024, supported by the good portfolio behavior in the U.S. auto as we had expected since the beginning. Moving on to capital, where we delivered an exceptional outcome in Q4. Our CET1 ratio grew by 30 basis points in the quarter, backed by a strong organic capital generation. We have been working on accelerating our capital generation for some time. This quarter, we generated 82 basis points organically in the back of the profit generation and RWA modification. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.9%, equivalent to an RoTE of 23%. We have reached 87% of RWAs with returns above the cost of equity, up from 40% in 2015 and well above our target of 85% in 2025. Our asset desk is achieving exceptional results during the year. We disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to \u20ac60 billion in RWAs. The combination of these actions, explain expanding profitability and the good performance on capital. All in all, we are in a new phase of value creation driven by higher profitability. Looking back at the period since 2016, our value creation has clearly accelerated. And since 2022, we have been able to generate, on average, 15% value to our shareholders. This is driven mainly by the step-up in our profitability and helped by our diversification. Our exposure to the U.S. dollar through our U.S. businesses has acted as a natural hedge against depreciation of the LatAm currencies. Let me highlight the sensitivity of our equity to foreign currency, which clearly shows that currency depreciation in Brazil and Mexico is at least partly offset by our exposure to the stronger U.S. dollar working as a natural hedge. That's all from my side. Ana, over to you."

        "text": "Thank you very much, Hector. So let me just briefly sum up. Our performance in 2024 once again confirms our consistent delivery on our plans. We deliver what we say we will deliver in every single plan and every single year on the key financial metrics for the Group. We are on track to either achieve or exceed our financial targets set in 2023. 2024 was another record year for Santander. Our results show the benefits from our strategy, the resilience of our business model, which again allows us to deliver through the cycle despite volatility. So looking ahead, we are confident that our strategy works. It's evident in the numbers and that it will continue to drive sustainably higher returns. This is reflected in the targets you can see on the slide, for 2025, which are based on a more volatile context. We do expect volatility, uncertainty, and a challenging environment for the next year. Our macro outlook includes a mild tariff war at lower euro rates, also a strong dollar, stronger dollar. We expect to deliver resilient revenue despite these lower rates and FX, around the same as this year, \u20ac62 billion. It means we will be growing in constant currency and supported by mid to high-single-digit growth in fees in constant euros. Our aim this year is to reduce costs in absolute terms year-on-year in euros, again, positive operating leverage in 2025, in spite of these lower rates, mostly in Europe. We are expecting a stable cost of risk at the Group level with improvements in some markets offsetting others. And again, all of this will lead to increased profitability with returns above 17% on the same basis as we guided in 2023, exceeding that top end of our Investor Day. And I just want to flag that from now on, we will report RoTE post AT1, which is what most of our peers do. With this more conservative lens, we are targeting 16 -- about 16.5%, as you can see. And this again, is post AT1s. Very importantly, given the strong outlook for capital progress and profitability, we are targeting to distribute \u20ac10 billion in share buybacks to our shareholders for 2025 and 2026, out of 2025, 2026 earnings. This will consist of distributing in line with our existing policy, around 50% of our reported profit, which will be distributed approximately 50% in cash dividends and 50% in share buybacks. As you know, we've announced the second buyback on 2024 earnings today at \u20ac1.6 billion. And second, excess capital in the two years, so 2025 and 2026 excess capital following our annual results and of course, our capital hierarchy, which we can go into later. And again, as always, subject to regulatory approvals and the performance we are outlining to you today. Very importantly, we will no longer set a maximum price level for our share buybacks. We will no longer set a maximum price level for our share buybacks, reflecting our improved profitability and improvement ahead. I would like to end by saying; again, our North Star will continue to be delivering double-digit growth in TNAV and dividend per share through the cycle. So with that, we are here to answer your questions, which I think, Raul, you will be managing."

First of all, I just wanted to thank you very much for the improvement in the financial target disclosure and the fact that you are using this RoTE plus AT1s. Just going to the questions, I have two questions today. After the announcement on the extraordinary distributions, just wanted to get further color on the trade-offs that you see between organic and inorganic growth? How excess capital ranks in terms of management priorities in 2025 and 2026, especially in the context of the M&A that we are seeing in the European banking sector? Second thing is, when I just looked at the results of ONE Transformation that is also very good, I just wanted to see how much more the Group's cost to income can improve from here? Thank you very much."

        "speaker": "Ana Bot\u00edn",
        "text": "Thank you, Ignacio. So yes, it's important to remind -- and this is not different, but how we are thinking about the capital allocation going forward in the anticipated higher profitability and excess capital. So first of all, our capital allocation framework has, as I said already been a fundamental pillar of our strategy and the results we're delivering and we have been very disciplined and strict. So first, we prioritize profitable organic growth, investments across our businesses. We see ourselves as a compounder. So again, this organic growth creates a compounding effect on earnings, returns, book value and distributions. Second, this is followed, of course, by ordinary dividends and share buybacks to our shareholders. In terms of inorganic capital deployment, we are very clear that it has to be complementary to our strategic aims and generate attractive financial returns that have to be ahead that surpass those of any organic investments or share buybacks. And last but not least, and this is what we announced today, any incremental capital that exceeds our targets, our target range actually. And again, I want to be clear that we are not changing the target for capital above 12%. We are saying, as you've seen in the guidance that we will be at 13% in 2025. So any incremental capital following this hierarchy that I just described will be returned as additional remuneration to shareholders. In terms of cost, and I think I said that and the CEO said that also, this is incredibly important because our transformation -- ONE Transformation still has a lot of upside, especially in the retail and consumer areas that are 70% of our PAT and 70% of our cost. ONE Transformation is already delivering. You can see that in Hector slide where you can see that our cost basically flat across retail consumer with the top-line growing. But very importantly, we've grown 8 million customers. This is something you will see in the next few years that we have a strategy and a model with ONE Transformation that scales. We don't have to increase cost to grow customers and grow revenues. I said it also in my presentation that the fact that we have reduced our product on offer and retail by almost 40%, you're going to see the effects of that on the cost base, by the way, also on the revenue side in 2025 and 2026. And critical to all of this is that we are aligning our business and operating model and deploying our own tech platforms. This is going to help much more down the road, okay? Just to give you an example, Gravity, our core system, which drives a lot of the efficiencies and the front-end customer tech platforms, is operating in 30% of the Group, okay? We expect to be at 60% by the end of 2025. This is hugely important. So again, new paradigm for 2025, we are focusing on absolute cost base going down versus 2024 despite FX and inflation, this is something we feel very confident about. Given this is important, I don't know if you want to mention maybe Hector, a couple of the precise numbers on the different global divisions?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Yes. Thank you, Ana. As Ana has said, I mean, what is very important to understand is ONE Transformation is just starting, okay? Let me provide you a little bit more color on the cost evolution in the quarter by businesses and also the 2025 outlook. First of all, I mean, as you can see, in 2024, cost increased by 4% year-on-year, but in real terms, cost only grew 1%, okay? That's basically thanks to the operating leverage in retail and the cost containment that we have done in consumer despite the investments and growth that we have been able to do. So it's important to say that we are basically changing the engine while flying the plane at the same time. Retail and Consumer represents around 70% of the Group costs were flattish, while the revenue was up 9%. CIB and Wealth that's around 20% of the Group cost and they used to increase by 13%, as I said in the presentation, with positive jobs and showing sustainable fee income growth around 21%. That's basically -- what is doing, the investments we're doing are actually representing much more growth in the businesses. The remaining 10% is Payments, which increased by 8% year-on-year, but that reflects our strategic investments. Let me go directly, I mean, retail and on 2025, we expect cost down versus 2024 in current euros, and we expect to reiterate or improve the guidance that we provided for each business at the last Investor Day. So that's retail cost to income below the early target of less than 42% and flat ex-Argentina, so that our -- that was basically around 39.7%. Consumer cost to income is down, and it's going to be less than 40% and CIB is going to be below 45%. Thank you."

        "speaker": "Marta Sanchez",
        "text": "Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is about the UK. When you say that the market is core, does it also specifically apply to the retail bank to the ring-fenced entity? And if that's the case, where do you see sustainable returns in an environment where you have to compete against stronger deposit franchises and new entrants with deep pockets. My second question is on the U.S. You've delivered $1.2 billion this year of net profit, but you're still benefiting from EV tax credits. I think you've mentioned on the call that you expect the U.S. to be the largest contributor to earnings growth in 2025. Could you be a little bit more specific about how much you expect it to contribute, what are the levers and what is the tax return -- sorry, the tax rate assumed? And then just quickly a clarification on capital, the threshold for surplus capital distribution is now 13%. Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Ana Bot\u00edn",
        "text": "So we're not -- let me answer the last one first. We're not putting a threshold. We've said we will be at 13% by the end of this year. The buybacks will happen in 2025, 2026. I have explained the hierarchy. So it will depend on what organic growth we will have, we're going to be very mindful as we have in terms of the reference being buybacks for shareholders, organic growth, supporting our franchise. It's hard to be so precise. We don't have a crystal ball. What we do have is a track record that shows that in challenging times, we do better than our peers. We are confident that we can deliver the Group targets that we just said. So let me just UK, U.S. So in terms of the UK, first is that the outlook for our business in the UK, which is 88% retail, continues to be very resilient, and we are committed to the UK. Just as a number, UK retail within the Group is 9% and UK retail; we're expecting to do better. So again, a good outlook for our business in the UK. And by the way, UK NII has bottomed out in the second half of 2024. And we expect that to be slightly up next year. Second is crucial to our results and performance in the UK is, of course, our mortgage -- we're mortgage lender essentially. And what we are seeing is that asset quality continues to be resilient. We are being very conservative in terms of how we stress. I think we stress around 8%, maybe Hector or Jos\u00e9 can confirm that, but be that's a number, so we are very -- we have very strong underwriting criteria, and that is essential for our returns. And third, what we are very confident is that Hector has explained it for ONE Transformation. We can do much more in the UK by leveraging the global platforms, bringing our global scale to benefit the UK. We have already migrated the UK to Gravity and some of the improvements are going to be ahead as we improve customer experience but also reduce the cost to serve. So again, there is more upside to our profitability. It remains a core market, as we have said. On the U.S., so I want to first say that we are very committed to having a strict capital allocation. This is really important for us and has been important throughout. The UK has been top of all our countries, all our geographies over the last decade and top also the last five years. This is really important because we are committed and have been on this capital allocation and returns in euros to our shareholders. Part of that is the strong dollar. And it is a natural hedge against and even more now that the earnings are going up. So that's the first point. The second is that we refocused our strategy in the U.S. a couple of years ago, and we were very clear. We're not trying to be all things to all people. We want to deliver profitable growth anchored on four pillars. First, our consumer bank. That is 70% of what the U.S. as a geography is and it continues to improve consumer will be one of our best-performing divisions in terms of the delta, and that is not just the U.S. but also Consumer Europe, with lower rates, Consumer, which is about 20% of our PAT, we'll do better and will improve profitability driven by results in the U.S. We're not going to give a specific number, but it's hundreds of millions more if you do the math. Very importantly, the launch of Openbank is going to help us optimize funding and even more so in the context of maybe not so much lower dollar rates. In terms of the corporate bank, it's been hugely accretive to our network. If you look at our corporate bank within the Group, most of the returns are coming in country, so over half of our corporate bank is actually Brazil and Spain. The U.S. is helping us to leverage that network. We've said we will not materially increase capital allocation, and it's been a very significant driver of fee growth in the U.S., corporate investment banking is up 81% year-on-year. And finally, we have a very profitable, again, very much focused on our LatAm franchise wealth business. So we will continue to allocate organic capital to the United States and to the Americas."

        "text": "Let me just complement a little bit, I mean, what Ana was saying. I mean, in the UK, just to give you an idea in terms of you were asking revenue is going to be up mid-single-digits, and we expect a lot of around 11%, okay? I'm talking in constant. We have no view on FX at this point, okay? It's very important also to tell you that, I mean, we have 40 million clients in the UK. We're starting to sell different products to them. As Ana said, we have a basically mortgage franchise over there, but we're starting doing some other businesses with them. We're starting to do credit cards, cards are starting to grow. It's the second largest market in the world. So we'll start to cross-sell into that client base. And that basically is helping us out to have a much better franchise and we have the capabilities to do it because we have a business at scale that allow us to do so. In terms of the U.S. just give you, I mean, in terms of guidance that you were asking, I mean, we see revenue up high-single-digit, okay? And accounting RoTE will be around circa 10%. If you adjust the RoTE because of the excess capital that we have, we're talking about 14%. So it's quite good. And in regards of what the tax -- on the tax, I understand, I mean, I explained to you very well the situation due to the fact that what we're doing in terms of leasing, we're not really going to find out exactly the numbers until we see how we're going to allocate that one throughout the year, so."

If that 13% already includes any special share buyback beyond the ordinary distributions that we should expect in 2025 or if the special share buybacks will be back-end loaded to 2026. And in this context, I wonder if you can guide us on the organic generation that we should expect in 2025, particularly also on the plans for risk transfers this year? And also on any negative regulatory impacts, Basel IV other impacts, DTAs in Brazil, et cetera. And my second question is about Brazil. How do you see your business hoping in a higher Selic environment? What is your appetite for loan growth? How big can squeeze on margins from the higher rates, how sensitive the cost of risk to the Selic and you can update also on your transformation plans here in this market? Thank you."

We will distribute excess capital and our capital hierarchy is what we have -- what I said earlier. Organic growth, distributions, discipline in inorganic and extraordinary over those times. So again, we have a lot of organic opportunity that is profitable. We cannot know how much of that is going to happen. Point number two, we are not changing our target for capital. It will remain above 12%. Our operating range will be between 12% to 13% and the excess buybacks over the ordinary buyback and cash distributions will be during 2025 and 2026. We are not going to be more precise than that. Again, go back to the hierarchy, and we want to have -- and we want to deliver the best possible for our shareholders. We have that optionality given our model. In terms of the regulatory letter, do you want to Hector or who wants to\u2026"

So in terms of risk-weighted asset growth, we would expect ordinary business-driven risk-weighted asset growth of around 4% to 5%, mostly compensated by asset mobilization initiatives. So net, we would expect to see very little risk-weighted asset growth, maybe 1% or 2%. Regulatory charges, we expect to have a figure close to 2024. And again, there is a high degree of uncertainty here because of the technical notes that need to be released by the EDA but a bit more, a bit less than what we have seen this year."

        "text": "Okay. Let me give you the high level on Brazil. Let me just first say that with or without Brazil, we will deliver on our guidance. That's what we've done for the last 10 years. In terms of the Group, let me remind you, \u20ac62 billion approximately flat cost, stable cost of risk with an RoTE after AT1s of 16.5%. In terms of Brazil retail business, which is the one sensitive to moving rates, and these are numbers that with the additional transparency on the global business, you can actually hopefully have as much confidence in that we will deliver as we do as a management team. So Retail Brazil contributes about 38% of Brazil net profit, and that is 7% --7% of the overall Santander Group attributable profit. The rest of our global businesses in Brazil, which contribute more than 60% Consumer, Corporate, Payments and Wealth, we expect to continue to do well. By the way, this is more or less the same as for all the other countries, i.e., for the group, 50% roughly of our bottom line, 60% of our balance sheet is Retail. All the other businesses, I said that in my presentation, should grow revenues more than -- much more than Retail next year. So this is part of the work we've done in ONE Transformation in Consumer. It's part of the work we're doing with our network businesses, leveraging on our customer relationships. All in all, what we expect is Brazil RoTE to be stable in 2025 as a country driven by higher customer revenues and especially fee income, contained cost, and this is really important. ONE Transformation will also be very important in Brazil with a flat cost to income roughly in 2025. And very important, we have structurally improved the quality of our balance sheet in 2022 and have been prudent on growth. Thank you."

First of all, Ana, I appreciate the color you gave earlier on the strategy in the U.S. When you see and hear the messaging around potentially a more accommodating regulatory backdrop in that market, how does that impact the business in the U.S.? And where does that create opportunities? And how could that potentially impact your strategy in the U.S., if at all? And then, secondly, perhaps more of a modeling question. Looking at Q4, there was a higher-than-usual level of other gains and losses and provisioning. And I think the full year number of \u20ac4.8 billion was up significantly year-over-year. Can you just walk through what is it in that line? And how much of that is investment into future efficiency improvements, restructuring, et cetera? And where should that line item trend across 2025 and 2026? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Ana Bot\u00edn",
        "text": "Okay. So on the U.S., I've said that many times, operating context matters. So yes, other things equal, if the operating context improves in the U.S., that will naturally drive better returns, other things equal vis-\u00e0-vis other regions. So we cannot be too specific right now. We really don't know what's going to happen, but everybody and ourselves included is anticipating a better operating context for banks in the United States, which again, other things equal, should drive over time, at least, increased capital allocation, as I've said before, I mean, our investment in the U.S. has always and even more now since we are in a growth mode, leverage the Group. If on top of that, we get a better environment, we should do better. And that's what I said before; the U.S. asset geography will be one of the biggest upsides in our P&L without being too specific. But I think we said that the RoTE, Hector said it, he said 14%, I would say, Hector respectively between 14% to 15%, adjusted RoTE, I hope you agree on that. So yes, 14% to 15%, and the reason is very simple. Consumer business is 70% and that already is higher and what's dragging down this year, but not next year. And of course, with very positive contribution is the CIB investment, which, as I said, is leveraging the network. In terms of other, I would let either Hector or Jos\u00e9 to answer in a bit more detail. But yes, in that other, there are some one-offs, for example, over \u20ac300 million, if I remember correctly, in PagoNxt restructuring. This is going to drive a much better performance in our Payments division next year. Again, that's going to be one of the biggest upsides. So we are very -- we have been very disciplined not just with our -- where do we put our capital in terms of lending, but where do we put our capital in terms of growth. We decided to get out of acquiring in Europe that is going to drive a much better performance by focusing on our core markets and acquiring, which is mostly LatAm. There's a couple of things that are recurring there and a couple of others that are not. So maybe do you want to take that, Hector?"

In Q2 2024, I mean the write-down that she was explaining about PagoNxt, in Q3, \u20ac70 million related to the Fundacion, and in Q4 2024, that's \u20ac260 million provision taken for the situation with the motor in the UK. So all in all, that's basically it, and we don't expect any of those to basically repeat themselves, maybe just, I mean, in terms of the tax levy in Spain that we will be basically being impacted on the first quarter of this year."

On capital, there's a sort of a trend globally seems like around deregulation. I just wanted to pick your brain, Ana, maybe on how do you think that's going to manifest itself for Santander because ultimately, I heard cross guiding for another close to 60 basis points capital headwinds this year, similar to last year. Obviously, there was a press report earlier this week where you've taken the ECB to court [ph] around the DTAs in Brazil. So can you maybe sort of give us your latest thoughts on how regulators are going to treat the banks going forward? And in particular, how do you see that playing out for Santander? And second, on platforms on your Consumer and Retail, I think your cost to income is now 40%. I've heard your comments during the call; could you maybe walk us through which countries still need to roll out Gravity from here? And when we think about how low are those costs and all those -- that cost income can go, who do you benchmark yourself against. Can you give us an idea of how good it can get, thank you, medium-term, it doesn't have to -- I heard your targets for this year. Thank you."

        "speaker": "Ana Bot\u00edn",
        "text": "So Alvaro that is a tricky question. You're asking me what the regulators are going to do. I wish I knew. But I would say that for the first time in 10 years, the probability, and I've said it publicly, I've said it in many different occasions in recent meetings, including, I think, in yours, I think, first, Europe has built \u20ac300 billion in capital, something like this over the banks last few years. The fact that we have built capital in many cases, twice. I mean our economic capital, we've said many times is lower than our current targets, and we will keep those targets, of course, because it's something which the market and regulators have surprised us. So we don't -- we are -- we don't want to be surprised. As we said, 12 to 13 is a big buffer on buffers. But I would say that, again, for the first time in 10 years, and especially given the outlook for the U.S. regulation being, I would say, less rather than more, means that at least, and this is, again, what I've said, let's take a pause, not just on regulation, but how you interpret regulation. We need to be able to compete on a level playing field. DTAs in Brazil, even in the case of a dissolving the bank have value, the direct claim against the government. We feel very strongly that puts us at a disadvantage as we compete with the U.S. and local banks in Brazil. So it's not a big number, by the way. It's more a question of principle because every single bank in Europe has similar issues. So I do think we should be in a more predictable area, but there's still CRR, there's still models, and so we want to make sure that. And the big difference is that in spite of that, given our strong profitability outlook, the change in the model, the fact a lot depends on us. That's why we are saying we are aiming for additional distributions beyond the regular distributions. In terms of retail and the platforms, you've seen it in -- we call ONE Transformation for the whole business model across the five divisions, but the biggest upside is on retail and consumer. You've seen that. I think Hector just gave you some numbers. There's a lot of upside. Gravity is an enabler. It's not the biggest contributor to scaling. The fact that you have Gravity allows you to bring through APIs; a lot of the other products that we are building, a lot of the other benefits of being cloud native, Payments is another one Payments Hub, which is still being rolled out. So a lot of the work is about aligning business model, aligning the organization and then comes the technology. And that is why we see a lot of upside in our retail consumer platform, basically bringing together 170 million customers, which, we have about 4 million companies, commercial corporates, but a lot of that is retail consumer."

Do you see further growth in 2026 over 2025? And where is consensus too conservative from your standpoint? Second question is on ONE Transformation. A bit of a follow-up to what Alvaro just asked. But where are the next geographies you're planning to roll the plan out to? And given you're now looking at absolute numbers, how much do you think ONE Transformation will save in absolute euro billion at full phasing? And final, in capital, 13% CET1 is what we hoped to convince the market on Santander's capital strength. I hear you on the maintaining 12% to 13% operating level. But are you amending the 10 to 15 basis points organic CET1 client per quarter, which was based on a much lower profitability and approach to risk-weighted assets. And Jos\u00e9, can you please make explicit what sort of regulatory hurdles we are expecting 40 basis points given you said they will be similar to 2024? Thank you."

        "text": "So the answer to your first question, without being very specific on numbers is we will grow our bottom line and we will grow our profitability in 2025. And I think I can say that our expectation is this will continue in 2026, 2027. You will get a lot more detail in our next Investor Day, which we expect to do towards the end of this year or beginning of next year. The model still has a lot of upside. As I've said today, we're only scratching the surface of our potential as a Group in a context that we do anticipate and we count would be volatile more challenging, we are saying we will grow profits and profitability with stable cost in euros and costs coming down and stable cost of risk. So again, yes, Santander will continue to deliver increasing profits and profitability with all the evidence and with all the, obviously, market assumptions we're making. So yes, in terms of ONE Transformation, at the end, we are aiming to grow customers, grow revenues and improve efficiency. This is not about cost savings. This is about changing fundamentally how we operate the bank. We are working across the bank to make sure there's end-to-end accountability for example. The same way we're building payments hub or Gravity, we're going to build investments and others. What this means is that you're going to see the savings, not just in one country, but in the global business benefiting all the countries. This is a very important difference. As I said before, by being part of Santander, we are generating \u20ac20 billion already today of network efficiencies. This is how we will generate further efficiencies. Today, we're still building investment products in Openbank, in Retail, in Wealth. As of next month, we're going to have and Hector, please confirm this because that's actually between both of us. But under Hector, once we create a single investments platform across the Group, we're going to save money, we're going to build a better investment platform, and we're going to grow faster. And so you need to think of this by global businesses. Having said that, what is, at the end, the bottom line best performing division next year? In terms of the delta, Retail will be more or less flat in terms of profitability because, yes, rates matter. Not as much as people think because if you go country by country, it's only 50%, roughly, 55%:45%. That is retail. And of that, there is diversification by country. So again, you'll see absolute cost savings across the divisions and some of that will benefit one countries more than other. Maybe Hector, you want to add to that briefly in terms of in a minute. But in terms of capital, just going regulatory hurdles, maybe Jos\u00e9, you can take that more detail one, 12% to 13% is our operating range. We've been very clear on that. 13% is not a new minimum, but it is where we want to be by the end of this year. We will distribute excess capital following a capital hierarchy of more or less organic profitable growth. And again, that's difficult to predict. We want to make sure we maximize shareholder value creation, 10, 15 basis points per quarter that is actually much more than that now. But why don't I let you answer that?"

Hi, Andrea, in terms of the regulatory charges, it's a combination of lots of small things in terms of model reviews and updates, inspections and the potential impacts from the RTS is published by the EBA. And in terms of 10% to 15% per quarter, we are not changing that. I think we have great growth opportunities, as I discussed. And the growth -- the most important thing is not evenly distributed throughout the year. So it's the growth in capital as we saw this year, it's sort of happen tend to concentrate towards the end of the year, second quarter and fourth quarter."

I mean, first of all, we're becoming the number one bank to our customers. That's basically the most important change of the model. That's why you see fees growing. And if you analyze country by country, you're going to see -- for example, in Retail, this is the biggest change that -- and that's why we basically guiding you mid-high single-digit growth in terms of fees, okay? That's a change of the model. Remember that also change of the model is not just a platforms is basically simplification, which is helping us and is dropping the amount of products. Now we just offered more than 50 products to our customers, we still have a lot of the backlog, but we're automatizing all of that. So automation is another very important part. And then, the deployment of the platforms where, for example, we finished the deployment of OneApp, all of Europe. You see the results of NPS on the UK. Now it's coming down to Brazil. Mid-part of the year is going to be in Mexico and then it's coming down to Chile and Argentina. And that you're going to be basically see the results, which will improve, first of all, again, being number one bank to our customers; and second, the fee generations. Thank you."

Where do you see the most significant opportunities for expansion and growth over the next two years geographically, you talked about the U.S., but is there any other countries where you see the bank gaining in scale for example, Mexico? Also, I wanted to ask you on the quarter in regards to the very different dynamics that we're seeing in Portugal and Spain NII. Spain was flat and Portugal at minus 11%. Could you explain why such a divergent trend? And is this what we're going to see in 2025, a resilient NII in Spain and NII in Portugal following double-digit. And could you please let us know what your rate assumption is in this guidance? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Ana Bot\u00edn",
        "text": "So in terms of growth for the next couple of years, and again, we are looking at this by global businesses. So -- and I will give you detail by country within the global business. In terms of growth, and this is important. Retail will not grow much in the next year. 2026, we'll see what happens to growth and revenues. We are putting much more emphasis at least for now on profitability. We've grown 8 million customers. We're growing the top-line, not just because of the euro rates benefit this year, but also because 8 million customers is a lot of customers. So again, given the context, our top-line in Retail will not grow as much in 2025. Within that, there will be differences as I've said. If you look at -- within Retail, what are the countries that will grow more or less, I mean, obviously, in the euro area will grow less because of the impact, but fees will grow to compensate partly and 50% of our businesses that are not Retail will all grow the top-line and the bottom line, including consumer in the U.S. and Europe. That is why I said the U.S. will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the lower rates, even I want to stress, not as low as probably the market thinks. I will let maybe Jos\u00e9 give some of the assumptions behind these numbers. In terms of NII in Spain and Portugal, let me go back again to the global business, and I will tell you within that. So if you look at Retail, the countries that will grow will not be the European countries, top-line, I'm saying profitability will be the same, maybe a bit lower in some of them and higher in others within Retail. Overall, the Retail -- and again, the four big countries are roughly 70% of Retail. The other 50% is not sensitive to higher rates -- sorry, it's not rate sensitive, but that's at least as well, if not better, again, given the investments with a lower rate environment. For Spain, you can give the -- maybe the guidance for Spain, which is one of the guidance we're going to give."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jos\u00e9Garc\u00edaCantera",
        "text": "Okay. So let me very quickly go through the measures we've taken to decrease the interest rate sensitivity in the eurozone. We have taken three very important measures. One, we have an ALCO portfolio that has grown -- has been created in the last year and a half. Right now in the eurozone, we have a total of \u20ac67 billion of government bonds. The second, we implemented hedges on the asset side of the balance sheet, particularly mortgages through forward starts that go up to two years. And we also increased the percentage of liabilities at variable rates. With this, if you look at NII in Spain in the fourth quarter, which basically concentrates on the retail business, you see a negative impact of around 2% from volumes and also margins that decreased around 17%. But this was compensated by the positive impacts of these measures that I just mentioned. Hedges added around \u20ac100 million to NII and the ALCO portfolio around \u20ac180 million to the NII. That's why NII in the quarter was basically flat. Going forward, NII in Spain, again, which is mostly and primarily concentrated in the Retail business. If rates stay and stabilize at around 2%, we would expect to see NII in Spain to drop between 5% to 6% next year. So that is the sensitivity. But let me reiterate again that we have decreased the percentage of assets and liabilities subject to rates in Spain. In December 2022, 70% of -- 76% of assets was floating, 46% of liabilities was floating. In December 2024, only 64% of assets were floating and 51% of liabilities were floating. So we decreased the sensitivity on the asset side while increase the sensitivity on the liability side. So we are much better prepared for lower rates."

And whether you have any sensitivity to any impacts that potential tariffs, which were not delayed for a month, but let's see what happens there. Well, basically, your views on how could that affect overall activity in the country, particularly in the global various CIB business in Mexico, which by the way, if you could tell us how much it accounts for Mexico contribution to be interesting. And then, just as a small clarification on the capital organic generation that you mentioned before, the 10 basis points to 15 basis points per quarter. I just wanted to understand if that's already net generation from -- net of the regulatory impact, the 60 basis points you mentioned? Or is that before the regulatory impact? Thank you very much."

Mexico, like other countries is roughly 50%, I think probably between 45% to 55% is Retail and the percentage of revenue and roughly also bottom line of Mexico when Retail is 12% and Mexico is around 15% of the total. So again, not a huge contribution on Retail, which is going to be the one most sensitive to volumes. Half of our business, and I'll let Hector go into that in more detail is with Corporates and Affluent. We have a lot of high-quality business in Mexico. Actually, the biggest opportunity is in the Retail, i.e., in the mass market. We have also launched Openbank there to take advantage of that. And we have been very prudent in terms of our lending much more than other peers we have focused over the last few months actually on a higher quality segment. So clearly, the Mexican economy could be more affected than others, but it should not have a significant impact on our expected delivery. So maybe you want to give a bit more color on Mexico?"

We are very much concentrated on going towards the part of the portfolio that has collateral. We've been concentrated a lot more on auto loans on mortgages and will be decreasing. Even though we have been growing in Consumer, not as much as the rest of the market. So I basically very comfortable of what are we doing there. And I believe that the guidance that I can give you, given that we are including a mild trade war, we're talking about Mexico in terms of revenue, up high-single digits, okay? And in terms of RoTE between around 20% to 22%, again, is in constant no view on FX, okay? Thank you."

So just going back to the guidance, I know you have now given guidance for net interest income in Spain, but it will be down 5% to 6% if rates are 2%. You also gave guidance for the UK and Mexico. But with the third quarter results, you gave guidance kind of on a country-by-country level for net interest income. Would that be possible to also get now for 2025? And then, my second question would be, I know you've mentioned that UK is the core part of Santander, but and you focus on organic growth. But if you could kind of talk about M&A how you view your peers that are heavily involved in M&A? Do you think that will change the European banking landscape and how do you see Santander better positioned in a landscape where you have more M&A and how will you kind of evaluate any opportunities that arise potentially in Portugal, potentially elsewhere in Europe. So if you could comment on this. Thank you."

We're going to give most of the countries, and Jos\u00e9 can explain that. I'd like to go back to what we are committing and it's on the last slide or I think the last slide in the presentation. Revenues in euros \u20ac62 billion, roughly the same as this year, mid-high single-digit growth in fees. And then by divisions, I think we have given also and I think Hector has mentioned, retail, which is 50% of the group flat revenues and more or less flat returns, consumer. Again, mostly 90% of that is Europe and the U.S., revenues up mid-single digit and profitability improving significantly, including in the U.S. Our Corporate Bank, which is about 20% of our profits and 14% of our revenues. Revenue is up, profitability improving to 20%, which is roughly where we said would be by this year, wealth 10%, payments a big delta because of the restructuring. So I think that is much more detail we\u2019ve given you, and I think I don\u2019t -- I cannot add much more on that. In terms of the UK and M&A, I want to say several things. First, we do not need to buy yourself to allocate capital to the more interesting opportunities for Santander shareholders where we combine profitability growth franchise, and that\u2019s what we are doing in a very dynamic way across our footprint. In terms of how we think about this, I want to go back to what I said, I think, at the beginning of the call in terms of how we think about capital allocation in a context where we anticipate excess capital given the higher profitability we have been very strict and very disciplined. First, we prioritize profitable organic growth and investments across our current footprint. Santander, this is how you should think about. We are a compounder. We\u2019re going to compound earnings, returns, book value and distributions. Second is ordinary dividends and distributions, including buybacks. Third, inorganic. Let me just say this again. It must be complementary to our strategic aims, generate attractive financial returns, which means that they have to surpass those of organic investments or share buybacks. And then -- and this is the first time in 10 years, we anticipate excess capital given our plans. I want to reiterate again, we are very good at predicting within a range of 2% to 3% on average the last 10 years. Actually, you can go back more. Some of our shareholders know this. Every quarter, we have very little earnings volatility. This perception of volatility is not based on fact, it\u2019s based on perception. So again, any incremental capital that exceeds our target range operating -- we\u2019re not actually -- sorry, no, that exceeds the other opportunities I just mentioned would be returned as additional remuneration and that\u2019s how we think about inorganic. Let me just say that the framework in Europe. It\u2019s not there for cross-border M&A, and that is why you\u2019re seeing some of our peers that don\u2019t have alternative profitable growth looking more at in-market M&A, but that\u2019s not where we are."

So you\u2019ve introduced this new commitment to pay \u20ac10 billion buybacks over 2025 and 2026. You talked about shifting capital within the group rather than asset sales, and this has been an important part of your strategy. Maybe can you talk a little bit more about that point to give us a sense of the flexibility that you retain to shift capital across the group, meet your profit guidance and still achieve the buyback commitment should the macro picture worsen just to get a sense of the flexibility that you retain there on the capital optimization. And the second point, you\u2019ve mentioned the group is highly diversified. You\u2019ve given, I think, a very good overview of your expectations for 2025 across products. Can I just go back to Brazil? And could you share the same for the region. It\u2019s a relatively large share of your group and it\u2019s a market focus region, particularly dig more into the link between net interest margins, loan origination and affordability, ultimately reflecting cost of risk for Brazil and maybe the measures that you\u2019ve put in place at your local unit to go through the cycling cycle, please.

        "text": "So I mean, just to give you some color on organic capital across the group. So we started working on this 10 years ago. We didn\u2019t have the tools to manage regulatory capital. We\u2019re always very good at managing economic capital. Today, we have a very dynamic capital allocation strategy. So we shift on a weekly basis where we put more or less capital, depending on the opportunities. Of course there\u2019s a franchise consideration. I mean, why would we write lots of mortgages in Spain below 2% when I can get much better value in mortgages in Mexico. This is one of the reasons that giving guidance very specifically on countries is not something that we\u2019re very keen on because we will deliver at the group level, and we\u2019re making more and more profits, an increasing profitability because we are managing in a dynamic way. We do not have a crystal ball, right? We don\u2019t know what the peers are going to. We don\u2019t know exactly what the rates are going to be. So we managed this it reports to the Chief Investment Officer to the CFO and to the CEO who have topped down managing this with the global business in the countries. This is really the huge advantage you have with Santander, 87%, and we are prioritizing profitability ahead of growth. But as I said, 8 million customers, new customers in the context of focusing on profitability. Can you imagine, once we are at the levels and our operating platform is more competitive, which it will be, we can have organic growth for many years to go. So yes, that is what we do every day. That\u2019s I don\u2019t want to exaggerate, but every week. So going back to that, and I defer to Hector or Jose, but on Brazil, I think we\u2019ve said. So Brazil as a country, I think Hector has said it, but if not, let me reiterate, we expect revenue to go up and more or less stable returns. That is where we see Brazil. But let me just be very clear that, as I said before, if you look at the retail business and how much of the retail business, which is 50% and the most sensitive one, to what rates might do or not, Retail Brazil is about 23%."

In terms of NII, being -- I mean, being not the driver, but actually being fees the driver in the sense that we\u2019re doing things, okay? Deposit and fees, it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re concentrated on. We have changed the mix of the portfolio. This base Mexico, basically making us most resilient to rates and has reduced the sensitivity to higher rates through the hedging. We are 100% hedged for 2025 on the P&L in Brazil. So it\u2019s very important that you know that, okay? It\u2019s also important to tell you that the current yield curve stepping we have a similar smaller impact than previously expected, as I told you, and as of December, a 100 basis point upward move on the selling has an impact of around \u20ac120 million of NII. So we\u2019re pretty much hedged all the structure is basically in place. And we believe that on credit quality, even though we remain vigilant over the past few years [indiscernible] has grown lending is lower than peers, and we have tightening the underwriting criteria. So the current economic forecast for GDP and growth to slow, but we remain positive during the year. On cost of risk in an adverse case scenario, due to changes in the portfolio. We see the cost of risk to perform marginally weaker than in 2024, but really not changing the outlook for the overall cost of the risk. This is exactly going back to what Ana was saying. It doesn\u2019t impact the rest of the group, it\u2019s quite small, and it doesn\u2019t change overall picture. Diversification is the essence in the group."

And you would consider dropping below that with excess distribution in 2025, but not to go below 12.5% pro forma. And then the second question is just on Brazil again, on the DTA or DTCs rather, why has the ECB now changed its view on this? Has anything been recorded in the Q4 CET1?

Being more than buybacks, et cetera. So again, we are aiming to be at 13% and have some flexibility going forward between the 12% and 13%, being always above 12%, which is where we are. In terms of the -- I\u2019ll let Jose answer the one on the DTAs. The reason we are contesting this is because we believe that level playing field, an asset, which in Brazil is valid, full claim against the government where other banks operating in the country, U.S. or local banks have a different treatment. We think that, that does not make sense. It\u2019s a question of principle. The effect is not going to be much up or down. Jose?"

And the second question is, if you have any internal limits in terms of how much you can do per annum?

We do this in all geographies. Obviously, synthetic securitizations is mostly in developed economies in hard currency, but the other strategies we are doing in all geographies. As long as we are not the best tenors, the best holders of some of the assets we originate, and someone is willing to buy these assets below our cost of capital, we will to -- we will continue mobilizing the assets. Last year, the average cost of equity at which we mobilize the assets was around 8% compared with our cost of capital of whatever, 14% or 15% or whatever. So as long as that\u2019s the case, we will continue to mobilize the assets. Now going forward, as we optimize the back book, most mobilization will be related to the front book. So you should expect to see a gradual reduction in the total amount because it will be most related to front book, not so much as it\u2019s been the case so far to the back book."

    "transcript": "Raul Sinha : Good morning all, and welcome to the Santander Q1 2025 Results Call. We are joined today by Hector Grisi, our CEO; and Jose Garcia-Cantera, our CFO. We will start with a brief presentation on our Q1 results and then open the floor for questions. Hector, over to you.\nHector Grisi: Thanks, Raul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Santander's results presentation. Today's presentation will follow the usual structure. Number one, first, I will talk about our results with a special focus on the performance of our global businesses. Jose, our CFO, will then give a deep dive on the financials and I will conclude with some final remarks before opening up for Q&A. We have entered the last year of our strategic cycle well ahead of our plan. Capital allocation, which is further improving our profitability to 15.8% post AT1 and our CET1 ratio to 12.9% with 87% of RWA generating returns above our cost of equity. Given our solid progress building capital, our diversified earnings and improving profitability will reiterate our target to distribute up to \u20ac10 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks for '25/'26 subject to regulatory approvals. Remember that we no longer set a maximum price for our buybacks reflecting our confidence on the group's potential in terms of profitability and value creation. Q1 was another record quarter for Santander, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reached a new record of \u20ac3.4 billion, 19% higher than Q1 '24 with all of our businesses growing. On the back of our solid franchise of 175 million customers that continues to achieve this as we continue to invest for the future through One Transformation and making excellent progress towards a simpler and more integrated model. This has helped us to improve our efficiency by around 1 point and increase our ROTE was 81% by almost 2 points to 15.8%. Our balance sheet remains solid with a strong CET1 capital ratio within a plus dividend per share growing 14.5% despite the depreciates across our footprint. Going into more detail line growth, with revenue up 5% in cost and euros, supported by NII, which increased 4%, excluding Argentina, which, as Jose will explain later, is causing some disturbances and also by record fees, up almost double digits, supported by significant growth of our 9 million customers, the network benefits that we are capturing through our global businesses. Number two, expenses grew below revenue and inflation, showcasing the positive effects from a transformation. We reiterate our target of lower cost in current euros in '25. Third, we are once again demonstrating the sustainability of our results with 7% growth in net operating income. Fourth, our prudent approach to risk is also evident in our robust credit quality trends with cost of risk that is consistently improving quarter after quarter. Fifth, finally, we have the impact from the different treatment of the Spanish banking tax that this year, we're accruing quarterly through taxes. Even excluding in volumes, as we have shown over time, our results are sustainable and less volatile than peers. This is because we are mainly a retail consumer bank with a business model that combines businesses and geographical diversification with a prudent approach in executing our transformation, which continues to boost our operational leverage, structurally improving both revenue and cost performances. Simplifying and automating processes and our active spread management have already contributed 253 basis points of efficiencies since we started surpassing the levels which we expected to reach by the end of -- to represent more than 70% of our revenue have significant upside as we progress on the implementation among platforms. 75 basis points of efficiency improvements with more upside to our original target of 100 to 150 basis points. Performance of our businesses with all of them delivering both revenue and profit growth. Retail's performance reflects our scale and the benefits of our transformation which significantly improved efficiency. Ease of expertise to grow our U.S. franchise without changing the risk profile. Revenue grew 8% to another quarterly record supported by the good performance in the U.S. and client flows, demonstrating the benefits of our strategy. Wealth continued to grow strongly, improving in both efficiency and profitability and in payments we are seeing good activity trends as reflected in double-digit revenue growth, both in PagoNxt and [ cards ] to face the challenges for '25. Higher interest rates benefit some of our retail franchises, while other parts of our business such as CIB, consumer and some emerging markets performed better with lower rates. It is this diversification that allows us to deliver recurrent strong results, consistent profitable growth and value creation even under very different environments. Overall, the later start of the year, the execution of our strategy and our diversification puts us on track to achieve our profitability targets for full year '25. In retail, which is at the heart of our banking business, we are progressing in our aim to become the #1 bank. Process automation and customer experience, we gain their principality. Today, we have 3.5 million more active customers than a year ago. We have reduced the numbers of products by 40% in the last year and 51% with a special focus on the front book. Today, our digital sales are 23% higher than last year, and our cost to serve has dropped by 5%. The implementation of our global platform progresses at pace. We have completed the integration of Gravity in Chile which improves the digital channel performance, reducing the response time and significantly has sold. Retail profit grew strongly year-on-year, driven by solid revenue, both NII and fees across most of our countries, weak cost improving, reflecting our transformation efforts. Going forward, we expect that our global platform rollout and improvements in the consumer and customer experience will drive additional customer growth and lower cost in euros. In Consumer, we continue to advance in our priority to become the preferred choice of our partners and customers by delivering the best solutions and increasing our cost competitive advantage across all of our footprint. First, we are converging towards global platforms. This quarter, we launched Openbank in Mexico with a full value proposition and we opened a branch in Germany. In the U.S., we have announced a multiyear partnership with Verizon offering their customers saving accounts. These initiatives are part of our focus on deposit gathering to lower funding costs as reflected in our deposit increase of 12% year-on-year while we continue to improve our customer experience. Second, we are working to grow and consolidate partnerships, offering global and best-in-class solutions integrated into our partners' processes. [ Sinia ], we are promoting the network effect, aligning the businesses with the group's operating model and becoming more agile through the simplification and automation of processes. Grew in line with inflation even after our efforts on transformation, which are supporting double-digit customer deposit growth. During the year in CIB, we are building a world-class business to better serve our corporate and institutional clients while maintaining the #1 running our advisory capabilities in the U.S. parties to accelerate growth across the group. Revenue in CIB in the U.S. rose 23% year-on-year and is expected to boost cross-border revenue group and vice versa. Second, we are strengthening our position in our core markets, leveraging our centers of expertise. A good example of this is a record quarter in global markets with revenue up 23% on the back of the investments we made and cross-selling opportunities with global transactional banking and global banking. Third, fostering collaboration with other businesses is also key. CIB provides FX solutions to retail, product development and structuring to wealth and a full suite of products, including capital markets and adviser to a new record high an RoTE of around 22%, reflecting our focus on profitability and capital discipline. In wealth, we are building the best wealth and insurance manager in Europe and the Americas. First, in Private Banking, we remain focused on expanding our fee business by promoting value-added solutions, leveraging our best-in-class portfolio advisory capabilities. We have created a new global family office team, and we have expanded our ultra high net worth global team offering world-class specialized wealth management services. Second, in asset management, we progressed in the implementation of an advisory model for retail customers across countries, supported by a global investment platform that offers enhanced customer experience. Third, in insurance, we are developing a retirement, which we are offering an integrated value proposition while we expand high-growth verticals, such as health and motor. Fourth, in collaboration with other businesses is of the essence in wealth, and it is a major driver for growth. Collaboration fees increased by 10% year-on-year. In summary, all this supports growth and high profitability levels. Profit rose double digits on the back of strong activity and double-digit fee growth across all the 3 businesses. Efficiency ratio improved close to 1.5 points year-on-year and ROTE stands at close to 70%, where we have a unique position on both sides of the value chain. In merchant acquiring, we are one of the largest acquirers in Latin America, Spain and Portugal with the right balance between growth and profitability. GAAP net total payments volume kept growing. We currently manage more than 16 million debit cards through Plard with already authorized more than 160 million transactions per month. Payment delivered a strong quarter, with double-digit revenue growth year-on-year, both in cards and PagoNxt and cost of control, which drove 30% profit growth. Finally, PagoNxt EBITDA margin improved to around 29% backed by Getnet, with one of the best ratios among our competitors. We expect cost efficiency and CapEx optimization to continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. Our strong operational and financial performance is improving profitability and driving double-digit value creation for the eighth consecutive quarter. RoTE was [ 15.8% ], up close to 2 points year-on-year, reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Earnings per share rose to above \u20ac0.21 supported by strong profit generation and a lower number of shares following the ongoing buyback programs. As a result, we continue to grow our value creation. In [ loss ] cash EPS increased 14.5%, reflecting our disciplined capital allocation and again, the impact of our share buybacks. Buybacks remain one of the most effective ways to generate shareholder value. Since '21 and including the full share buyback that is currently underway, we will have bought back 14% of our outstanding shares, providing a return on investment of approximately 20% to our shareholders. I will leave you now with Jose, who will go into our financial performance in more detail.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. Starting with income statement as we normally do, we present growth rates. This quarter, there was a difference of around 4 to 5 percentage points between both mainly due to the depreciation of the profit of last year. As Hector said, our transformation continues to drive operational leverage. We had a strong top line performance with sound underlying trends as revenue grew 5% and reached a new record high for the fourth quarter in a row. Performance in costs towards our objective for 2025. As you can see, Argentina introduces some distortions between different lines of the net interest income is affected by a sharp decrease in interest rates, for around \u20ac600 million year-on-year. And in other income, there is a benefit from lower hyperinflation adjustment for a similar amount. Cost of risk remained fairly stable in the quarter supported by robust labor markets and prudent risk management. Last year, we charged the temporary levy on revenue earned in Spain in full in the first quarter through other results. This year, it is charged in the tax line on an accrual basis, improve double digits, not only at the group level but also in almost all the global businesses. Finally, on the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the upward trend in profit, which grew 4% this quarter, on the back of positive customer activity. Please also remember that the last quarter, we had a full positive impact from the FX accounting of the Argentine peso. This also produces some distortions quarter-on-quarter that I will comment on during the presentation only were relevant. 5%, which puts us on track to meet the target for the year we provided last quarter. This was underpinned by growth in [indiscernible]. All of our global businesses concluded by another record quarter in CIB, up 8% driven especially by global markets and our growth initiatives in the U.S. We grew 14% in wealth, with record assets under management and strong commercial trends. Payments was up 15% with double-digit growth in net interest income and fees, both in PagoNxt and cards on the back of higher activity. Retail and Consumer also showed very good figures. In retail, particularly due to a strong net fee income across most countries and in consumer on the back of net interest income growth mainly in the U.S. favorable interest rate environment. More than [ 80% ] interest income comes from retail and consumer business retail, most evident in the U.K. and Mexico consumer. It was also supported by continued profitable growth across most [indiscernible]. And finally, also by our focus on adapting the sensitivity of our balance sheet to the new cycle of interest rates. A good example of this is retail NII which increased across most countries and remained flat in Spain and Brazil in the context of unfavorable interest rates. Net interest income was resilient also quarter-on-quarter flat when we exclude Argentina for similar reasons, which also explained the performance of net interest margin, which fell only 7 basis points year-on-year without Argentina and was flat in the quarter. This performance is slightly better than our guys, however, as forward rate curves remain very volatile in all jurisdictions. We reiterate our guidance. We generated another record period of net fee income, reflecting our transformation efforts to promote services of strong activity with a higher share of more value-added services. Retail showed good performance across the footprint. CIB grew even further up from record levels last year as we continue executing our growth initiatives, particularly in Global Banking in the U.S. and GTB globally. We had a 16% increase in wealth with a strong growth in all business lines, backed by record assets under management. We had double-digit growth in payments, both in PagoNxt and cards, supported by high activity levels as net total payments volume increased 14% and card spending rose 7% year-on-year. As we guided in last quarter results presentation, this year, consumer is affected by the impact of a new insurance regulation in Germany, which has been offset by strong free growth in [ DCB ]. You mention is key to understanding why we can continue to get better in every single market, leveraging our global businesses leverage as we further implement the structural changes to our model. These improvements are already very evident as demonstrated by the trends in our efficiency ratio, which is consistently getting better quarter after quarter and remains one of the best in the sector. But more importantly, by the evolution of cost in absolute terms. Retail and Consumer are leading our transformation, which is delivering structural efficiency gains with revenue improving and costs flat. These 2 businesses represent 70% further the benefits of One Transformation going forward. CIB, wealth and payments are more fee-driven. Costs grew 6%, showing positive operating jaws with double-digit fee increase, as I have just explained. As a result, our efficiency ratio closed at 14.8% in the quarter amongst the best we have reported in the past 15 years. The risk profile of our balance sheet remains low with robust credit quality across our footprint on the back of low employment and easing monetary policies in general. Loan loss provisions increased year-on-year, mainly due to our efforts to reduce NPLs and some deterioration in Brazil in the context of higher rates and inflation. Credit quality continued to improve year-on-year as reflected both in the P&L ratio than 14%. So much of our portfolio has collateral guarantees and provisions that account for more than 80% of total exposure. Cost of risk dropped year-on-year to 1.14% and was fairly stable in the quarter. Retail and consumer represent 80% of the group's loan loss provisions. In retail, it improved year-on-year across all our main countries and was flat in the quarter, with significant improvement in Mexico, compensating the weaker performance in Brazil. In conductively stable, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter with notable improvements in the U.S., where we are seeing favorable payment rates, higher car prices and an improved labor market year-on-year. As of today, we are not seeing any significant deterioration in employment rates and our credit quality remains stable. Moreover, it is [ imperils ] is a good example of it. Nevertheless, it is too early to make conclusions regarding the new geopolitical event, but as long as labor markets alerts to our cost of risk target. Moving on to capital. As you know, we have been working on improving our capital productivity and accelerating our capital generation for some time. This quarter, we delivered exceptional growth again, generating 10 basis points to 12.9% at the top end of the operating range we disclosed during last results presentation and already very close to our 13% guidance for 2025. We generated 33 basis points of net organic capital after having absorbed 24 basis points of profitable risk-weighted asset growth, while we had a positive impact from securities portfolios to compensate shareholder remuneration accrual, some regulatory charges as well as to accumulate capital. As we have already mentioned in the past, there was no impact from Basel III implementation on day 1. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable opportunities and leverage our global asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation produced a new book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.8% in the quarter, equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 22%, well above that of our back book. All these actions explain the increasing profitability and great capital performance. That's all from my side. Hector, over to you.\nHector Grisi: Thanks, Jose. As you have seen, this is a great start of the year. We are well on track to achieve our '25 targets, targets that we reiterate. Good business dynamics supported by revenue increase backed by all our businesses with fees growing high single digits at the same time that will reduce the cost in euro terms. Cost of risk improved and it's also in line with our target of around -- as we profitably grow our business organically, accrued shareholder distribution and absorbed some regulatory impacts. In a Q1 that is normally lower, affected by day count and seasonality in consumer and South America, our ROTE grew year-on-year to 15.8% on track to reach our target of around 16.5% in '25. In summary, very positive trends, which we expect to consolidate in the coming quarters, even in an environment of high uncertainty. As Jose has mentioned, it is precisely in periods of hiring instability when our diversification becomes more evident, acting as a stabilizer. This is key and represents one of our competitive advantages that differentiate us some others.\nRaul Sinha : Thanks, Hector. Operator, could we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We already have the first question from the line of Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan.\nSofie Peterzens: We think about net interest income going forward. We had across your core market. So if you could talk about the NII outlook going forward. And my second question would be, if you could just discuss how you got to think about it more organically and equally, how do you think about kind of your business areas? Anything that want to reduce your exposure to clearly lay around asset disposals and M&A.\nHector Grisi: Okay, Sofie. First of all, I think it's important to say that we have a lot of confidence that we can achieve what we have said in terms of the ROTE target of 16.5% under the new economic scenario, okay? I mean, given to the NII. Our business model, first of all, it's important for you to know, has a high degree of earnings predictability despite the macro volatility we have seen. For example, and as you were asking, I'm reiterating the NII guidance despite the outlook for rates being lower than we previously anticipated. Rate count that would be 16.3% normalized. So in that sense, we believe that we will continue in that regard. Excluding Argentina, we reiterate the NII. We believe there's going to be slightly up in constant euros and year-on-year current euros. We're assuming end rates at around 1.5% by the end of '25. The current outlook is around \u20ac0.169. So I believe we are able to get it. It's important to acknowledge that the ALCO portfolio has grown to \u20ac152 billion in the whole group, that's around \u20ac7.5 billion more quarter-on-quarter. Most of the group's sensitivity to rates is concentrated on retail, it's 60% of the loan book, but we have drivers that offset each other. So in that regard, I believe that we have control over it. Retail NII is positive even with the decline of the NIM, thanks to the hedging strategy that we -- in Brazil, session to lower rates, outlook is improving right. We expected a peak of around \u20ac60 million, that's \u20ac120 million. So we continue to proactively manage, and we believe that we're going to deliver what we have said. In that regard, begin for you, okay? I know we acknowledge a recent speculation about the regarding a potential transaction involving Santander Polska. I can tell you that this is a great bank has a great 22% routing and we have interest from several parties, and we are currently in discussions with [ Erste ] for the potential sale of the 49% stake. The discussions will lead to an agreement with them. And in any event, completion of any transaction, we will be subject to closing conditions and different things and regulatory approvals, et cetera. So if required, we will make a further announcement. But at this point, I would like to discuss any asset disposals or anything like that. We have a fiduciary duty to review anything that comes, and this is exactly what we're doing. I don't know, Jose, if you'd like to comment anything else.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: Nothing. You explained very well. We've reduced net interest income sensitivity. We've continued to with the strategy that we started last year. So right now, we have less than half the NII sensitivity we have in euros and in the Brazilian trade in our NII guidance even in rates in Europe go as low as 1.5% by year-end.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas.\nIgnacio Ulargui: The first one is if you could give us a bit more color on how we think -- should we think about group cost evolution throughout the GRS? This the run rate that we should expect or incremental efficiency so that further decline to the cost line? And the second thing -- second question is related to DCB Europe. So performance in the quarter has been a bit more difficult consensus was going forward. How should we think about the performance of the unit in the year? How much is the current or would be seen as a one-off in the net profit of 1Q.\nHector Grisi: In terms of cost, it's very important to understand what we're doing. Cost is a result of the strategy we have and the change of the model that we are executing right now, okay? It's important to tell you that we reiterate our guidance to deliver the lower cost in current euros versus '25 versus '24 despite the potential inflation headwinds and the FX pressure in the current macro environment. Costs were 2% higher year-on-year in Q1 in constant euros, where they declined 1% in current euros. You have lower cost in retail, as I said, lower by One Transformation. It's very important for you to understand the operating leverage that we're generating in which the model is allowing us to generate actually more revenue while we maintain cohorts. It is important also to say and it's important that you acknowledge that we are a consumer and a retail bank. And in that regard, that's exactly what we're working on to lower the cost of the operation. We're investing a lot in the platforms, and that also will allow us to basically have lower cost in the future. And you are only seeing the beginning of what we're doing. If you look in detail, our retail and consumer, as I was saying, 70% of the group cost is flattish and revenue grew in terms of the operational leverage that we're getting. CIB, wealth and payments is around 30% of the group cost in terms of everything that we're doing. And we see sustainable fee income of around 13% year-on-year, and we continue to infer positive operating leverage across all the group. So in that sense, I do believe that we will continue to increment efficiencies in years to come. And much more while the model is being implemented and where we are basically deploying all the platforms, which right now, I could tell you is probably, I would call it a transition year because we're actually changing the engine at the same time we're flying the plane due to the fact that we have still some of our platforms working and this is going to take probably the next 18 to 24 months. On DCB Europe, okay, it's important to tell you the facts. It's important to tell you, first of all, that NII continues to do very well and is on track to benefit from the lower rates in the future. Also important to say that market share is growing with the current OEMs that we represent. Fee income was impacted because of regulatory change in Germany, which we indicated last quarter, if you remember. And this has now been rebased by the regulatory changes. Impairments were higher, driven by -- partly by a mix of the items, including Germany, but we are not concerned about the credit elimination is meeting the returns hurdles and returns will improve with lower rates. Remember that in the past, part of the stock is at lower rates that we are originating today. So that basically is helping us out. And the cost of risk normalization and the potential macro model adjustment, especially in Germany should peak in '25, all right? So I don't know if you want anything else or Jose anything to add?\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: No. I think the NII was up year-on-year, which I think is a great performance. Our brands are doing very well relative to others. We're gaining market share. So I think -- and obviously, the impact on fees from Germany is a one-off. So it's a rebase of the fee line going forward. So I think the return on tangible equity in the year was double digits, and we feel comfortable that we can keep -- improve the returns going forward.\nRaul Sinha: Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question comes from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca.\nAndrea Filtri: You confirmed you are negotiating the sale of the stake in your Polish bank. Can you and how you would intend to deploy the proceeds. By selling only 49% and could the buyer eventually receive exemption from a mandatory bid on minorities. Second question on your digital transformation, which is proceeding ahead of targets. And what percentage of full delivery, do you feel you are right now? And when will you be able to rightsize staff for the new business model? And finally, can you elaborate on the high other provisions in U.K. and on the outlook for Brazilian cost of risk.\nHector Grisi: So I will take the number 1 that I ask Jose to help me in the percentage of the full delivery and then we'll comment also on the U.K. and in Brazil, okay? So in Poland, there is not much I can say at this point. As you know, we have a [indiscernible] as I said, to basically review any offer that comes and we're exactly doing that. So as of today, there is not much I can tell you about what's going on. Once the transaction, if it evolute or not, we will basically give you all the details on banking system that we are developing everywhere. And we are increasing the speed at which global deployed, at least important what I said just before, Andreas. We are not at the transit. We are running the old platforms together with deploying the new platforms and that basically doesn't help a lot in the cost or it in some cases that basically is also because we are gaining market share and we're gaining customers. Just we gained 9 million customers in a year. So that basically tells you that the model is working and clients are liking what we're doing. In terms of what we're doing or what's going on in the Brazilian cost of risk, I'd be very brief, first of all, okay, it's important to understand that we are taking actions to strengthen the balance sheet. First of all, as I explained last quarter, we're changing the mix towards lower risk portfolio. It's less payroll and unsecured lending is down 10% year-on-year, and we're also increasing collateralized products, which basically are much better in terms of cost of risk, but doesn't have those high margins that we have. Also, we have tightened quite a lot underwriting criteria. In a scale of 1 to 10, we moved from 6, 7 up to 8 and higher. So it's exactly what I was telling you about. So what you're going to see is that over time, the Brazilian cost of risk is going to get better, probably today, I would say if you look at the rates. The rates went all the way from 2%, and we're almost going to get to 15%. So that affects a little bit of the portfolio in that sense. And also the calendar effect in DCB, lower working days in the quarter that impacted the loan renegotiations. Whatever at the end, we see better performance in retail though to the cautious and we also remain it, all right? So in that sense, in Brazil, I believe that we have seen okay. And I believe the fee outlook in the next quarter as well. So the U.K. is performing quite well and we already mentioned in what we're doing there. And we have seen a very good behavior in terms of all in all, the operations on the bank and the portfolio.\nOperator: Next question from Francisco Riquel from Alantra.\nFrancisco Riquel: Yes. So I want to ask about the U.S. which has surprised positively this first quarter. So several questions to assess the quality of the bit, if you allow me. So cost of funding is falling. So how much is because of Openbank deposit gathering and all out. The loan yield is also going up despite the lower rates. So -- and I thought you were shifting out of subprimal rate. The cost of risk is falling, but the economic expectations have wasn't in the U.S.? So shall we expect any model adjustments related to IFRS 9 in coming quarters. And then the tax rate, if the first quarter could be extrapolated for the year. Overall, the net profit contribution, about \u20ac400 million is a big deviation versus consensus forecast. How sustainable is this quarterly run rate for the rest of the year?\nHector Grisi: Okay. First of all, it's important to understand there is always seasonality in the U.S., and we have always a much better first part of the year towards the second part of the year. And that's mainly all the details of what you have asked. First of all, I could tell you that we have -- we set adjusted the ROTE target of 81 of 15%, okay? We believe the outlook of the U.S. business has not fundamentally a 4% year-on-year in terms of the particular things is the cost of funding, yes, is getting better. Just to tell you that we have \u20ac3.5 billion more in the past also, it's important to tell you that the behavior of much better than expected at around 60% that is much better than we expected. It was all the way to 90%. It's still at around 60% to 65%, all right? It's important to tell you that CIB build-out continues to be a significant driver for fee growth is talking -- we're talking about 47% growth outlook for the U.S. and to be able to get to the numbers that we have discussed.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: Sorry, Paco very quickly. So the increase in the yield of loans which year-on-year is 21 basis points is coming because of the drop in low yield loans in commercial banking and in corporate investment banking. In fact...\nRaul Sinha: Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley.\nAlvaro Serrano: I've got two questions, one on strategic growth priorities and second on capital. You just discussed U.S., and I wonder if that's a strategic growth priority market for you and where I'm coming from is obviously I realized Poland is up in the air, but if it does go ahead, you're going to be well above 13% CET1. And from a strategic point of view, I just want to understand what are the -- redeploy that capital product gaps, how do you think about sort of the medium-term sort of growth priorities by markets considering the discussions we're having. And the second question points model headwinds in the quarter. I guess this might be for Jose is the 60 basis points still what you expect for the full year and how many SRT or capital efficiencies, RWAs savings have you done in the curve.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: Going on. In terms of SRT, the market has not really been very much a private credit market at prices which are a little bit better than the prices we had in the first quarter of last year. Total asset mobilization was around \u20ac2.8 billion. So obviously, it was significantly lower than -- and we -- obviously, there is seasonality in SRT and asset pubilization because it takes time to prepare the different assets to be sold. We should see a substantial acceleration of asset mobilization in the second quarter already and towards the end of the year as a growth much closer to 0 every quarter from now on.\nHector Grisi: So Alvaro, going back to your questions in terms of capital deployment, what we see. First, it's very important to understand that the U.S. is a really important growth market for us. We are still, as I said, very much concentrated on delivering that 15% royalty. And we will continue to deploy capital into the U.S. as long as it's profitable. It's very important, and I'm going to give you the hierarchy in terms of where do we deploy capital. First of all, we'll concentrate on organic growth, okay? Because organic growth we've been having is above 20%. So we will continue to do that, and we will concentrate again on organic growth. It's very important also that we are deploying money to the buybacks, as you have seen the returns that we have done. I said, I mean we have repurchased over 14% of the capital and returns at around 20%, so quite good. And we're going to be very much concentrated on running the businesses we are doing it today. I think that's the most important thing is concentrated and focused on continuing the growth on our own businesses and continue with the transformation. That's the best way to deploy our capital and to get the best returns to our shareholders, which I believe we're delivering in a quite a strong way.\nRaul Sinha: Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Marta Sanchez Romero from Citi.\nMarta S\u00e1nchez Romero: My first question is on the U.K. What is the rationale of a potential spin-off of your motor finance business. We read something, but on how the business is going there? You've been rolling out Openbank. So how many deposits have you been gaining under that franchise? Just what you're seeing generally in terms of loan detection, et cetera. And if you were to do you think you have the political cloud and just the right size to buy anything without obstacles?\nHector Grisi: I mean what we're doing in the motor finance business is exactly what we're doing in the rest of the world. I mean we are actually doing that in every single one of our units due to the fact that it's very important to have them separate from the rest and fund it in a different way. That's why we call it the consumer bank, and that's why Openbank is together with the consumer bank because that's secular thing of many of the different markets we operate. And you're going to see us continuously doing it in that trend, okay? So it's part of the strategy there. And I believe it's the right strategy given what was going on in Europe. We have been -- as you know, DCB Europe has been independent all along, and we have been able to grow it very well. Also, it's interesting to know that we have been able to find out that this business can be without having a retail bank. And the same thing we're doing in Colombia without having the retail bank and doing this combination. So -- and we have been able to really grow in an important way in these countries with just this business. So we believe that managing it independently makes a lot of sense and allow us to go into further countries. As you know, we are in 28 countries right now with the auto business. We continue to be a big auto lender. We really believe in that business, and we will continue to do so in that regard. In terms of Mexico, the Mexican business, as you know, Mexico is actually the one that is most more affected, not by the tariffs bought by what happens to the U.S., okay? So Mexico is very dependent on the U.S. economy. And if the U.S. basically has a hard time, Mexico has a harder time because 1/3 of the economy is the U.S. exports. You're talking about above \u20ac500 billion in terms of exports at Mexico as to the U.S. with a GDP of \u20ac1.8 trillion. So that basically gives you a perspective on the size of it and how dependent is Mexico on that. Nevertheless, the Mexican economy is doing quite well, is at a very good level of unemployment, and we have seen a very good behavior for our credit portfolio. The cost of risk is actually behaving much better than we expected. And also, we have not seen the local economy down bad. The other way around, we have seen consumption and everything going very well. So we are positive on Mexico, positive on growth and positive on the long term in Mexico. Now going back to your question, we are very much concentrated on the organic growth that we have there. We will continue to invest in such things as Openbank. Openbank is doing quite well. It's just starting, as you know, and is actually getting very good momentum. We're growing customers every single week. And actually, I must tell you that we are doing a little better than our competitors in terms of clients coming in week per week. So and also deposits coming in at a good way. We are giving a better treatment in terms of the we are paying a lot a little bit more on deposits of what we pay in Santander, and that basically is enabling us to increase the client base there but we are normalizing it as we speak. So in that sense, what I could tell you, Mexico, we will continue pushing on organic growth and continue managing our bank the way we have been, and we believe that we have really good room for growth in that market.\nRaul Sinha: Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank.\nCarlos Peixoto: Hi. Good morning, some of them have already been answered, but I would probably focus the discussion on when you throughout the year? And if I might extrapolate everything to the rest of the auto bank whether the ongoing uncertainties caused by tariffs and the potential downgrades of macroeconomic expectations could lead to a revision of provisioning models inputs? And could that trigger some sort of additional provisioning over the coming quarters?\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: I'll take both questions. NII in Spain. Remember that at the end of the year, we said NII might go down mid-single digit, 6%, 7%. At that time, we thought rates could -- the terminal rate in 2025 could be around 2%. As I just mentioned, we've been working very hard to decrease interest rate sensitivity, lengthening the duration of the ALCO portfolio \u20ac34 billion of government bonds yielding 3.3% at an average maturity of 7 years. On top of that, in the euro zone, we have a total of \u20ac61 billion in government securities. So the interest rates in euros is very much reduced. So even if rates were to go down and as long as we estimate where we had it at the beginning of the year. In terms of cost of risk in Spain, we expect cost of risk to be below 50 basis points in my presentation. The key variable is unemployment is the labor markets. Obviously, GDP needs to be updated in the models, but the impact of a downgrade or slower GDP growth, it's very, very -- it's very small compared to the impact of unemployment. So as long as labor markets remain what they are, and they are very strong everywhere, we don't see for the year. Again, remember that this \u20ac115 million comprises different behaviors, countries where cost of risk is going to be very much flat like in Mexico. Countries where cost of risk could be a bit better like in the U.S. or Spain, countries that are normalizing from negative cost of risk to very low but still positive cost of risk like the U.K. and countries where we expect a slight deterioration in cost of risk, as Hector mentioned in Brazil. So -- but net-net, \u20ac115 million is still our central scenario.\nRaul Sinha: Could we please have the next question, operator?\nOperator: Next question from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous.\nBritta Schmidt: In Brazil, I'd be quite interested in your thoughts on what you think about the new product payable initiative throughout which has received some pickup. Are you intending to participate in this? And how do you think this will impact competition and margins for personal lending business overall? And then secondly, maybe you can give us the quotas FX mortgage charges and also whether you've got any updates on the U.K. motor finance case or the numbers that you indicated in previous calls?\nHector Grisi: So Britta, in terms of the U.K. motor, I mean, we believe that we are at the right place. We haven't seen any reason basically to increase it, and we believe that, that's going to be around the number that we need to have. And we're not -- we don't have any plans basically to modify it at this point.\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: I'll take the other 2 questions. U.K., the mortgage market. Well, in terms of volumes, year-on-year, we've seen volumes up 3% and actually a substantial increase in net interest margin in the U.K. The yield on loans in our case, is mostly mortgages, as you know, it was 3.83% in the first quarter of last year and is 4.19% in the first quarter of this year. So a substantial improvement in pricing and also better outlook for volumes. So we are quite constructive on the outlook for activity in the U.K. On the liability side, at the same time, yield on deposits is down from 2.23% last year to 1.99% this year, and that is what explains the very good evolution of net interest margin in the U.K. And in Brazil, the new legislation on payroll lending. Well, this will clearly widen the possibilities. I think this is going to make the market more attractive, it's extending the possibility to many -- still don't have the details. And I think details. So I think we need to wait for the details to really have a good assessment of what this could mean for the country as a whole, for the banking system and for Santander. But generally speaking, it's a good move for activity.\nRaul Sinha: Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question from Cecilia Romero from Barclays.\nCecilia Romero: Just a follow-up on Marta's question on Mexico. Move on to gain an approval for a banking license in Mexico this past month. Do you see any impact in the competitive landscape from this, especially for your digital bank in the country.\nHector Grisi: What I would say is I think that it's pretty good news for us that these guys basically turn themselves in a fully licensed bank because then they have to tie with the same rules as we do as a bank. So in that regard, we are happy that they turn themselves into a fully fledged bank. The competition right now in the market is very tough, very competitive and we believe that we have all the tools needed to be able to compete at the head-to-head against any competitor in the market.\nRaul Sinha: The next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Next question from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS.\nIgnacio Cerezo: The first one is if you can give us some information on when we should be expecting you to take the decision on extraordinary capital distribution between '25 and '26, how that extraordinary distribution is going to be split between both years? Second one is if you can share the fully loaded capital number in the quarter, not just the Phase 1. And third, if you can provide an update in terms of the hedging per unit you do in terms of FX for the P&L?\nHector Grisi: Okay. In terms of the extraordinary capital distributions, we'll do as we see fit. We see it much more towards the year '26. The important fact that we are doing now is basically very much concentrated in delivering the capital numbers. As Jose explained to you last quarter, basically, what we need to absorb in terms of the regulatory items, et cetera, ones that basically that's have been covered, we will continue to build up, and we will tell you exactly when the extraordinary capital distributions will happen, okay?\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: About the fully loaded number. Again, we -- I have to give you a range because the technical notes that the EBA will publish can have a substantial impact long term. We're talking to 2030 to 2033. But I'm referring to the conversion fact, the credit conversion factors and the uncommitted credit lines which we are still pending a final note on that. So the fully loaded could range somewhere between 25 to 40, 45 basis points. Today, we see more sort of towards the low end of that range, around 25 to 30 basis points. In our case, most of that impact will come in the next 3 to 5 years at most. So we would expect -- and this is related -- so our central scenario again is that we could have from -- moving from facing to fully loaded, something around 5 basis points per year for the next 5 years. And then longer term, depending on everything related to credit, which is mostly 2029 to 2033. There could be an additional factor. But for us, that should be very small compared to what the industry could see.\nHector Grisi: Sorry, Ignacio. I think we missed your hedging question. Would you mind repeating that?\nIgnacio Cerezo: Give us an update on how much of the different units P&L you're hedging for next years?\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: No, right now for 2025, everything is hedged. So the expected profits from all countries, with the exception of Argentina, we cannot hedge Argentina, but for most for all other countries, the P&L is hedging. And as you know, we always fully hedge the capital ratio. That's it. It means the excess capital using European capital rules in each country above the group's capital level, in this case, 12.9%.\nRaul Sinha: Operator, could we have the last question, I believe.\nOperator: Last question from Pablo de la Torre from RBC.\nPablo de la Torre: I had two more on the U.K. I think the first one was Santander U.K. was a signatory to a letter to the chancellor requesting the abolition of the ring-fencing regime here in the U.K. Could you please provide more color on what the actual financial impact you would expect from the ring fencing regime being discontinued? And then more on the trends in the U.K. in the quarter and I guess could you just update us on the structural hedge and the shape of NII for the rest of the year that you see in the U.K.?\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera: Okay. So let me take the second question first. Structural hedge is almost \u20ac110 billion at a yield of 2.47%, 2.5% to round it up. We would expect NII to go up in the U.K. low single digits, in line with volumes up also low single digits. So generally, the same guidance that we gave at the end of the first quarter. The ring fencing. Well, we are convinced not only in the U.K. but in Europe that banks can contribute a lot more to improving competitiveness in Europe and in the U.K. and contributing to growth. And we think that having a simpler framework to operate will help but that applies to the U.K. and that applies to Europe as well. In terms of what impact this could have on us is negligible. So this is not a question of an impact in the near term. It's just that a simpler operating framework in Europe and in the U.K. should help banks contribute more to improving productivity and growth in the U.K. and in Europe.\nRaul Sinha : Thanks very much, Jose, for that. Thank you, everybody, for all your questions. The whole IR team is available ops. We thank you for your time, and wish you a very good day.",

        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "Thanks, Raul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Santander's results presentation. Today's presentation will follow the usual structure. Number one, first, I will talk about our results with a special focus on the performance of our global businesses. Jose, our CFO, will then give a deep dive on the financials and I will conclude with some final remarks before opening up for Q&A. We have entered the last year of our strategic cycle well ahead of our plan. Capital allocation, which is further improving our profitability to 15.8% post AT1 and our CET1 ratio to 12.9% with 87% of RWA generating returns above our cost of equity. Given our solid progress building capital, our diversified earnings and improving profitability will reiterate our target to distribute up to \u20ac10 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks for '25/'26 subject to regulatory approvals. Remember that we no longer set a maximum price for our buybacks reflecting our confidence on the group's potential in terms of profitability and value creation. Q1 was another record quarter for Santander, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reached a new record of \u20ac3.4 billion, 19% higher than Q1 '24 with all of our businesses growing. On the back of our solid franchise of 175 million customers that continues to achieve this as we continue to invest for the future through One Transformation and making excellent progress towards a simpler and more integrated model. This has helped us to improve our efficiency by around 1 point and increase our ROTE was 81% by almost 2 points to 15.8%. Our balance sheet remains solid with a strong CET1 capital ratio within a plus dividend per share growing 14.5% despite the depreciates across our footprint. Going into more detail line growth, with revenue up 5% in cost and euros, supported by NII, which increased 4%, excluding Argentina, which, as Jose will explain later, is causing some disturbances and also by record fees, up almost double digits, supported by significant growth of our 9 million customers, the network benefits that we are capturing through our global businesses. Number two, expenses grew below revenue and inflation, showcasing the positive effects from a transformation. We reiterate our target of lower cost in current euros in '25. Third, we are once again demonstrating the sustainability of our results with 7% growth in net operating income. Fourth, our prudent approach to risk is also evident in our robust credit quality trends with cost of risk that is consistently improving quarter after quarter. Fifth, finally, we have the impact from the different treatment of the Spanish banking tax that this year, we're accruing quarterly through taxes. Even excluding in volumes, as we have shown over time, our results are sustainable and less volatile than peers. This is because we are mainly a retail consumer bank with a business model that combines businesses and geographical diversification with a prudent approach in executing our transformation, which continues to boost our operational leverage, structurally improving both revenue and cost performances. Simplifying and automating processes and our active spread management have already contributed 253 basis points of efficiencies since we started surpassing the levels which we expected to reach by the end of -- to represent more than 70% of our revenue have significant upside as we progress on the implementation among platforms. 75 basis points of efficiency improvements with more upside to our original target of 100 to 150 basis points. Performance of our businesses with all of them delivering both revenue and profit growth. Retail's performance reflects our scale and the benefits of our transformation which significantly improved efficiency. Ease of expertise to grow our U.S. franchise without changing the risk profile. Revenue grew 8% to another quarterly record supported by the good performance in the U.S. and client flows, demonstrating the benefits of our strategy. Wealth continued to grow strongly, improving in both efficiency and profitability and in payments we are seeing good activity trends as reflected in double-digit revenue growth, both in PagoNxt and [ cards ] to face the challenges for '25. Higher interest rates benefit some of our retail franchises, while other parts of our business such as CIB, consumer and some emerging markets performed better with lower rates. It is this diversification that allows us to deliver recurrent strong results, consistent profitable growth and value creation even under very different environments. Overall, the later start of the year, the execution of our strategy and our diversification puts us on track to achieve our profitability targets for full year '25. In retail, which is at the heart of our banking business, we are progressing in our aim to become the #1 bank. Process automation and customer experience, we gain their principality. Today, we have 3.5 million more active customers than a year ago. We have reduced the numbers of products by 40% in the last year and 51% with a special focus on the front book. Today, our digital sales are 23% higher than last year, and our cost to serve has dropped by 5%. The implementation of our global platform progresses at pace. We have completed the integration of Gravity in Chile which improves the digital channel performance, reducing the response time and significantly has sold. Retail profit grew strongly year-on-year, driven by solid revenue, both NII and fees across most of our countries, weak cost improving, reflecting our transformation efforts. Going forward, we expect that our global platform rollout and improvements in the consumer and customer experience will drive additional customer growth and lower cost in euros. In Consumer, we continue to advance in our priority to become the preferred choice of our partners and customers by delivering the best solutions and increasing our cost competitive advantage across all of our footprint. First, we are converging towards global platforms. This quarter, we launched Openbank in Mexico with a full value proposition and we opened a branch in Germany. In the U.S., we have announced a multiyear partnership with Verizon offering their customers saving accounts. These initiatives are part of our focus on deposit gathering to lower funding costs as reflected in our deposit increase of 12% year-on-year while we continue to improve our customer experience. Second, we are working to grow and consolidate partnerships, offering global and best-in-class solutions integrated into our partners' processes. [ Sinia ], we are promoting the network effect, aligning the businesses with the group's operating model and becoming more agile through the simplification and automation of processes. Grew in line with inflation even after our efforts on transformation, which are supporting double-digit customer deposit growth. During the year in CIB, we are building a world-class business to better serve our corporate and institutional clients while maintaining the #1 running our advisory capabilities in the U.S. parties to accelerate growth across the group. Revenue in CIB in the U.S. rose 23% year-on-year and is expected to boost cross-border revenue group and vice versa. Second, we are strengthening our position in our core markets, leveraging our centers of expertise. A good example of this is a record quarter in global markets with revenue up 23% on the back of the investments we made and cross-selling opportunities with global transactional banking and global banking. Third, fostering collaboration with other businesses is also key. CIB provides FX solutions to retail, product development and structuring to wealth and a full suite of products, including capital markets and adviser to a new record high an RoTE of around 22%, reflecting our focus on profitability and capital discipline. In wealth, we are building the best wealth and insurance manager in Europe and the Americas. First, in Private Banking, we remain focused on expanding our fee business by promoting value-added solutions, leveraging our best-in-class portfolio advisory capabilities. We have created a new global family office team, and we have expanded our ultra high net worth global team offering world-class specialized wealth management services. Second, in asset management, we progressed in the implementation of an advisory model for retail customers across countries, supported by a global investment platform that offers enhanced customer experience. Third, in insurance, we are developing a retirement, which we are offering an integrated value proposition while we expand high-growth verticals, such as health and motor. Fourth, in collaboration with other businesses is of the essence in wealth, and it is a major driver for growth. Collaboration fees increased by 10% year-on-year. In summary, all this supports growth and high profitability levels. Profit rose double digits on the back of strong activity and double-digit fee growth across all the 3 businesses. Efficiency ratio improved close to 1.5 points year-on-year and ROTE stands at close to 70%, where we have a unique position on both sides of the value chain. In merchant acquiring, we are one of the largest acquirers in Latin America, Spain and Portugal with the right balance between growth and profitability. GAAP net total payments volume kept growing. We currently manage more than 16 million debit cards through Plard with already authorized more than 160 million transactions per month. Payment delivered a strong quarter, with double-digit revenue growth year-on-year, both in cards and PagoNxt and cost of control, which drove 30% profit growth. Finally, PagoNxt EBITDA margin improved to around 29% backed by Getnet, with one of the best ratios among our competitors. We expect cost efficiency and CapEx optimization to continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. Our strong operational and financial performance is improving profitability and driving double-digit value creation for the eighth consecutive quarter. RoTE was [ 15.8% ], up close to 2 points year-on-year, reflecting the high levels of new business profitability. Earnings per share rose to above \u20ac0.21 supported by strong profit generation and a lower number of shares following the ongoing buyback programs. As a result, we continue to grow our value creation. In [ loss ] cash EPS increased 14.5%, reflecting our disciplined capital allocation and again, the impact of our share buybacks. Buybacks remain one of the most effective ways to generate shareholder value. Since '21 and including the full share buyback that is currently underway, we will have bought back 14% of our outstanding shares, providing a return on investment of approximately 20% to our shareholders. I will leave you now with Jose, who will go into our financial performance in more detail."

        "speaker": "Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera",
        "text": "Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. Starting with income statement as we normally do, we present growth rates. This quarter, there was a difference of around 4 to 5 percentage points between both mainly due to the depreciation of the profit of last year. As Hector said, our transformation continues to drive operational leverage. We had a strong top line performance with sound underlying trends as revenue grew 5% and reached a new record high for the fourth quarter in a row. Performance in costs towards our objective for 2025. As you can see, Argentina introduces some distortions between different lines of the net interest income is affected by a sharp decrease in interest rates, for around \u20ac600 million year-on-year. And in other income, there is a benefit from lower hyperinflation adjustment for a similar amount. Cost of risk remained fairly stable in the quarter supported by robust labor markets and prudent risk management. Last year, we charged the temporary levy on revenue earned in Spain in full in the first quarter through other results. This year, it is charged in the tax line on an accrual basis, improve double digits, not only at the group level but also in almost all the global businesses. Finally, on the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the upward trend in profit, which grew 4% this quarter, on the back of positive customer activity. Please also remember that the last quarter, we had a full positive impact from the FX accounting of the Argentine peso. This also produces some distortions quarter-on-quarter that I will comment on during the presentation only were relevant. 5%, which puts us on track to meet the target for the year we provided last quarter. This was underpinned by growth in [indiscernible]. All of our global businesses concluded by another record quarter in CIB, up 8% driven especially by global markets and our growth initiatives in the U.S. We grew 14% in wealth, with record assets under management and strong commercial trends. Payments was up 15% with double-digit growth in net interest income and fees, both in PagoNxt and cards on the back of higher activity. Retail and Consumer also showed very good figures. In retail, particularly due to a strong net fee income across most countries and in consumer on the back of net interest income growth mainly in the U.S. favorable interest rate environment. More than [ 80% ] interest income comes from retail and consumer business retail, most evident in the U.K. and Mexico consumer. It was also supported by continued profitable growth across most [indiscernible]. And finally, also by our focus on adapting the sensitivity of our balance sheet to the new cycle of interest rates. A good example of this is retail NII which increased across most countries and remained flat in Spain and Brazil in the context of unfavorable interest rates. Net interest income was resilient also quarter-on-quarter flat when we exclude Argentina for similar reasons, which also explained the performance of net interest margin, which fell only 7 basis points year-on-year without Argentina and was flat in the quarter. This performance is slightly better than our guys, however, as forward rate curves remain very volatile in all jurisdictions. We reiterate our guidance. We generated another record period of net fee income, reflecting our transformation efforts to promote services of strong activity with a higher share of more value-added services. Retail showed good performance across the footprint. CIB grew even further up from record levels last year as we continue executing our growth initiatives, particularly in Global Banking in the U.S. and GTB globally. We had a 16% increase in wealth with a strong growth in all business lines, backed by record assets under management. We had double-digit growth in payments, both in PagoNxt and cards, supported by high activity levels as net total payments volume increased 14% and card spending rose 7% year-on-year. As we guided in last quarter results presentation, this year, consumer is affected by the impact of a new insurance regulation in Germany, which has been offset by strong free growth in [ DCB ]. You mention is key to understanding why we can continue to get better in every single market, leveraging our global businesses leverage as we further implement the structural changes to our model. These improvements are already very evident as demonstrated by the trends in our efficiency ratio, which is consistently getting better quarter after quarter and remains one of the best in the sector. But more importantly, by the evolution of cost in absolute terms. Retail and Consumer are leading our transformation, which is delivering structural efficiency gains with revenue improving and costs flat. These 2 businesses represent 70% further the benefits of One Transformation going forward. CIB, wealth and payments are more fee-driven. Costs grew 6%, showing positive operating jaws with double-digit fee increase, as I have just explained. As a result, our efficiency ratio closed at 14.8% in the quarter amongst the best we have reported in the past 15 years. The risk profile of our balance sheet remains low with robust credit quality across our footprint on the back of low employment and easing monetary policies in general. Loan loss provisions increased year-on-year, mainly due to our efforts to reduce NPLs and some deterioration in Brazil in the context of higher rates and inflation. Credit quality continued to improve year-on-year as reflected both in the P&L ratio than 14%. So much of our portfolio has collateral guarantees and provisions that account for more than 80% of total exposure. Cost of risk dropped year-on-year to 1.14% and was fairly stable in the quarter. Retail and consumer represent 80% of the group's loan loss provisions. In retail, it improved year-on-year across all our main countries and was flat in the quarter, with significant improvement in Mexico, compensating the weaker performance in Brazil. In conductively stable, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter with notable improvements in the U.S., where we are seeing favorable payment rates, higher car prices and an improved labor market year-on-year. As of today, we are not seeing any significant deterioration in employment rates and our credit quality remains stable. Moreover, it is [ imperils ] is a good example of it. Nevertheless, it is too early to make conclusions regarding the new geopolitical event, but as long as labor markets alerts to our cost of risk target. Moving on to capital. As you know, we have been working on improving our capital productivity and accelerating our capital generation for some time. This quarter, we delivered exceptional growth again, generating 10 basis points to 12.9% at the top end of the operating range we disclosed during last results presentation and already very close to our 13% guidance for 2025. We generated 33 basis points of net organic capital after having absorbed 24 basis points of profitable risk-weighted asset growth, while we had a positive impact from securities portfolios to compensate shareholder remuneration accrual, some regulatory charges as well as to accumulate capital. As we have already mentioned in the past, there was no impact from Basel III implementation on day 1. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable opportunities and leverage our global asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation produced a new book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.8% in the quarter, equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 22%, well above that of our back book. All these actions explain the increasing profitability and great capital performance. That's all from my side. Hector, over to you."

Good business dynamics supported by revenue increase backed by all our businesses with fees growing high single digits at the same time that will reduce the cost in euro terms. Cost of risk improved and it's also in line with our target of around -- as we profitably grow our business organically, accrued shareholder distribution and absorbed some regulatory impacts. In a Q1 that is normally lower, affected by day count and seasonality in consumer and South America, our ROTE grew year-on-year to 15.8% on track to reach our target of around 16.5% in '25. In summary, very positive trends, which we expect to consolidate in the coming quarters, even in an environment of high uncertainty. As Jose has mentioned, it is precisely in periods of hiring instability when our diversification becomes more evident, acting as a stabilizer. This is key and represents one of our competitive advantages that differentiate us some others."

        "text": "Okay, Sofie. First of all, I think it's important to say that we have a lot of confidence that we can achieve what we have said in terms of the ROTE target of 16.5% under the new economic scenario, okay? I mean, given to the NII. Our business model, first of all, it's important for you to know, has a high degree of earnings predictability despite the macro volatility we have seen. For example, and as you were asking, I'm reiterating the NII guidance despite the outlook for rates being lower than we previously anticipated. Rate count that would be 16.3% normalized. So in that sense, we believe that we will continue in that regard. Excluding Argentina, we reiterate the NII. We believe there's going to be slightly up in constant euros and year-on-year current euros. We're assuming end rates at around 1.5% by the end of '25. The current outlook is around \u20ac0.169. So I believe we are able to get it. It's important to acknowledge that the ALCO portfolio has grown to \u20ac152 billion in the whole group, that's around \u20ac7.5 billion more quarter-on-quarter. Most of the group's sensitivity to rates is concentrated on retail, it's 60% of the loan book, but we have drivers that offset each other. So in that regard, I believe that we have control over it. Retail NII is positive even with the decline of the NIM, thanks to the hedging strategy that we -- in Brazil, session to lower rates, outlook is improving right. We expected a peak of around \u20ac60 million, that's \u20ac120 million. So we continue to proactively manage, and we believe that we're going to deliver what we have said. In that regard, begin for you, okay? I know we acknowledge a recent speculation about the regarding a potential transaction involving Santander Polska. I can tell you that this is a great bank has a great 22% routing and we have interest from several parties, and we are currently in discussions with [ Erste ] for the potential sale of the 49% stake. The discussions will lead to an agreement with them. And in any event, completion of any transaction, we will be subject to closing conditions and different things and regulatory approvals, et cetera. So if required, we will make a further announcement. But at this point, I would like to discuss any asset disposals or anything like that. We have a fiduciary duty to review anything that comes, and this is exactly what we're doing. I don't know, Jose, if you'd like to comment anything else."

        "text": "In terms of cost, it's very important to understand what we're doing. Cost is a result of the strategy we have and the change of the model that we are executing right now, okay? It's important to tell you that we reiterate our guidance to deliver the lower cost in current euros versus '25 versus '24 despite the potential inflation headwinds and the FX pressure in the current macro environment. Costs were 2% higher year-on-year in Q1 in constant euros, where they declined 1% in current euros. You have lower cost in retail, as I said, lower by One Transformation. It's very important for you to understand the operating leverage that we're generating in which the model is allowing us to generate actually more revenue while we maintain cohorts. It is important also to say and it's important that you acknowledge that we are a consumer and a retail bank. And in that regard, that's exactly what we're working on to lower the cost of the operation. We're investing a lot in the platforms, and that also will allow us to basically have lower cost in the future. And you are only seeing the beginning of what we're doing. If you look in detail, our retail and consumer, as I was saying, 70% of the group cost is flattish and revenue grew in terms of the operational leverage that we're getting. CIB, wealth and payments is around 30% of the group cost in terms of everything that we're doing. And we see sustainable fee income of around 13% year-on-year, and we continue to infer positive operating leverage across all the group. So in that sense, I do believe that we will continue to increment efficiencies in years to come. And much more while the model is being implemented and where we are basically deploying all the platforms, which right now, I could tell you is probably, I would call it a transition year because we're actually changing the engine at the same time we're flying the plane due to the fact that we have still some of our platforms working and this is going to take probably the next 18 to 24 months. On DCB Europe, okay, it's important to tell you the facts. It's important to tell you, first of all, that NII continues to do very well and is on track to benefit from the lower rates in the future. Also important to say that market share is growing with the current OEMs that we represent. Fee income was impacted because of regulatory change in Germany, which we indicated last quarter, if you remember. And this has now been rebased by the regulatory changes. Impairments were higher, driven by -- partly by a mix of the items, including Germany, but we are not concerned about the credit elimination is meeting the returns hurdles and returns will improve with lower rates. Remember that in the past, part of the stock is at lower rates that we are originating today. So that basically is helping us out. And the cost of risk normalization and the potential macro model adjustment, especially in Germany should peak in '25, all right? So I don't know if you want anything else or Jose anything to add?"

So I think -- and obviously, the impact on fees from Germany is a one-off. So it's a rebase of the fee line going forward. So I think the return on tangible equity in the year was double digits, and we feel comfortable that we can keep -- improve the returns going forward."

So in Poland, there is not much I can say at this point. As you know, we have a [indiscernible] as I said, to basically review any offer that comes and we're exactly doing that. So as of today, there is not much I can tell you about what's going on. Once the transaction, if it evolute or not, we will basically give you all the details on banking system that we are developing everywhere. And we are increasing the speed at which global deployed, at least important what I said just before, Andreas. We are not at the transit. We are running the old platforms together with deploying the new platforms and that basically doesn't help a lot in the cost or it in some cases that basically is also because we are gaining market share and we're gaining customers. Just we gained 9 million customers in a year. So that basically tells you that the model is working and clients are liking what we're doing. In terms of what we're doing or what's going on in the Brazilian cost of risk, I'd be very brief, first of all, okay, it's important to understand that we are taking actions to strengthen the balance sheet. First of all, as I explained last quarter, we're changing the mix towards lower risk portfolio. It's less payroll and unsecured lending is down 10% year-on-year, and we're also increasing collateralized products, which basically are much better in terms of cost of risk, but doesn't have those high margins that we have. Also, we have tightened quite a lot underwriting criteria. In a scale of 1 to 10, we moved from 6, 7 up to 8 and higher. So it's exactly what I was telling you about. So what you're going to see is that over time, the Brazilian cost of risk is going to get better, probably today, I would say if you look at the rates. The rates went all the way from 2%, and we're almost going to get to 15%. So that affects a little bit of the portfolio in that sense. And also the calendar effect in DCB, lower working days in the quarter that impacted the loan renegotiations. Whatever at the end, we see better performance in retail though to the cautious and we also remain it, all right? So in that sense, in Brazil, I believe that we have seen okay. And I believe the fee outlook in the next quarter as well. So the U.K. is performing quite well and we already mentioned in what we're doing there. And we have seen a very good behavior in terms of all in all, the operations on the bank and the portfolio."

So -- and I thought you were shifting out of subprimal rate. The cost of risk is falling, but the economic expectations have wasn't in the U.S.? So shall we expect any model adjustments related to IFRS 9 in coming quarters. And then the tax rate, if the first quarter could be extrapolated for the year.

And we will continue to deploy capital into the U.S. as long as it's profitable. It's very important, and I'm going to give you the hierarchy in terms of where do we deploy capital. First of all, we'll concentrate on organic growth, okay? Because organic growth we've been having is above 20%. So we will continue to do that, and we will concentrate again on organic growth. It's very important also that we are deploying money to the buybacks, as you have seen the returns that we have done. I said, I mean we have repurchased over 14% of the capital and returns at around 20%, so quite good. And we're going to be very much concentrated on running the businesses we are doing it today. I think that's the most important thing is concentrated and focused on continuing the growth on our own businesses and continue with the transformation. That's the best way to deploy our capital and to get the best returns to our shareholders, which I believe we're delivering in a quite a strong way."

You've been rolling out Openbank. So how many deposits have you been gaining under that franchise? Just what you're seeing generally in terms of loan detection, et cetera. And if you were to do you think you have the political cloud and just the right size to buy anything without obstacles?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Hector Grisi",
        "text": "I mean what we're doing in the motor finance business is exactly what we're doing in the rest of the world. I mean we are actually doing that in every single one of our units due to the fact that it's very important to have them separate from the rest and fund it in a different way. That's why we call it the consumer bank, and that's why Openbank is together with the consumer bank because that's secular thing of many of the different markets we operate. And you're going to see us continuously doing it in that trend, okay? So it's part of the strategy there. And I believe it's the right strategy given what was going on in Europe. We have been -- as you know, DCB Europe has been independent all along, and we have been able to grow it very well. Also, it's interesting to know that we have been able to find out that this business can be without having a retail bank. And the same thing we're doing in Colombia without having the retail bank and doing this combination. So -- and we have been able to really grow in an important way in these countries with just this business. So we believe that managing it independently makes a lot of sense and allow us to go into further countries. As you know, we are in 28 countries right now with the auto business. We continue to be a big auto lender. We really believe in that business, and we will continue to do so in that regard. In terms of Mexico, the Mexican business, as you know, Mexico is actually the one that is most more affected, not by the tariffs bought by what happens to the U.S., okay? So Mexico is very dependent on the U.S. economy. And if the U.S. basically has a hard time, Mexico has a harder time because 1/3 of the economy is the U.S. exports. You're talking about above \u20ac500 billion in terms of exports at Mexico as to the U.S. with a GDP of \u20ac1.8 trillion. So that basically gives you a perspective on the size of it and how dependent is Mexico on that. Nevertheless, the Mexican economy is doing quite well, is at a very good level of unemployment, and we have seen a very good behavior for our credit portfolio. The cost of risk is actually behaving much better than we expected. And also, we have not seen the local economy down bad. The other way around, we have seen consumption and everything going very well. So we are positive on Mexico, positive on growth and positive on the long term in Mexico. Now going back to your question, we are very much concentrated on the organic growth that we have there. We will continue to invest in such things as Openbank. Openbank is doing quite well. It's just starting, as you know, and is actually getting very good momentum. We're growing customers every single week. And actually, I must tell you that we are doing a little better than our competitors in terms of clients coming in week per week. So and also deposits coming in at a good way. We are giving a better treatment in terms of the we are paying a lot a little bit more on deposits of what we pay in Santander, and that basically is enabling us to increase the client base there but we are normalizing it as we speak. So in that sense, what I could tell you, Mexico, we will continue pushing on organic growth and continue managing our bank the way we have been, and we believe that we have really good room for growth in that market."

At that time, we thought rates could -- the terminal rate in 2025 could be around 2%. As I just mentioned, we've been working very hard to decrease interest rate sensitivity, lengthening the duration of the ALCO portfolio \u20ac34 billion of government bonds yielding 3.3% at an average maturity of 7 years. On top of that, in the euro zone, we have a total of \u20ac61 billion in government securities. So the interest rates in euros is very much reduced. So even if rates were to go down and as long as we estimate where we had it at the beginning of the year. In terms of cost of risk in Spain, we expect cost of risk to be below 50 basis points in my presentation. The key variable is unemployment is the labor markets. Obviously, GDP needs to be updated in the models, but the impact of a downgrade or slower GDP growth, it's very, very -- it's very small compared to the impact of unemployment. So as long as labor markets remain what they are, and they are very strong everywhere, we don't see for the year. Again, remember that this \u20ac115 million comprises different behaviors, countries where cost of risk is going to be very much flat like in Mexico. Countries where cost of risk could be a bit better like in the U.S. or Spain, countries that are normalizing from negative cost of risk to very low but still positive cost of risk like the U.K. and countries where we expect a slight deterioration in cost of risk, as Hector mentioned in Brazil. So -- but net-net, \u20ac115 million is still our central scenario."

And we're not -- we don't have any plans basically to modify it at this point."

        "text": "I'll take the other 2 questions. U.K., the mortgage market. Well, in terms of volumes, year-on-year, we've seen volumes up 3% and actually a substantial increase in net interest margin in the U.K. The yield on loans in our case, is mostly mortgages, as you know, it was 3.83% in the first quarter of last year and is 4.19% in the first quarter of this year. So a substantial improvement in pricing and also better outlook for volumes. So we are quite constructive on the outlook for activity in the U.K. On the liability side, at the same time, yield on deposits is down from 2.23% last year to 1.99% this year, and that is what explains the very good evolution of net interest margin in the U.K. And in Brazil, the new legislation on payroll lending. Well, this will clearly widen the possibilities. I think this is going to make the market more attractive, it's extending the possibility to many -- still don't have the details. And I think details. So I think we need to wait for the details to really have a good assessment of what this could mean for the country as a whole, for the banking system and for Santander. But generally speaking, it's a good move for activity."

So in that regard, we are happy that they turn themselves into a fully fledged bank. The competition right now in the market is very tough, very competitive and we believe that we have all the tools needed to be able to compete at the head-to-head against any competitor in the market."

Second one is if you can share the fully loaded capital number in the quarter, not just the Phase 1. And third, if you can provide an update in terms of the hedging per unit you do in terms of FX for the P&L?"

The important fact that we are doing now is basically very much concentrated in delivering the capital numbers. As Jose explained to you last quarter, basically, what we need to absorb in terms of the regulatory items, et cetera, ones that basically that's have been covered, we will continue to build up, and we will tell you exactly when the extraordinary capital distributions will happen, okay?"

        "text": "About the fully loaded number. Again, we -- I have to give you a range because the technical notes that the EBA will publish can have a substantial impact long term. We're talking to 2030 to 2033. But I'm referring to the conversion fact, the credit conversion factors and the uncommitted credit lines which we are still pending a final note on that. So the fully loaded could range somewhere between 25 to 40, 45 basis points. Today, we see more sort of towards the low end of that range, around 25 to 30 basis points. In our case, most of that impact will come in the next 3 to 5 years at most. So we would expect -- and this is related -- so our central scenario again is that we could have from -- moving from facing to fully loaded, something around 5 basis points per year for the next 5 years. And then longer term, depending on everything related to credit, which is mostly 2029 to 2033. There could be an additional factor. But for us, that should be very small compared to what the industry could see."

And then more on the trends in the U.K. in the quarter and I guess could you just update us on the structural hedge and the shape of NII for the rest of the year that you see in the U.K.?"

We would expect NII to go up in the U.K. low single digits, in line with volumes up also low single digits. So generally, the same guidance that we gave at the end of the first quarter. The ring fencing. Well, we are convinced not only in the U.K. but in Europe that banks can contribute a lot more to improving competitiveness in Europe and in the U.K. and contributing to growth. And we think that having a simpler framework to operate will help but that applies to the U.K. and that applies to Europe as well. In terms of what impact this could have on us is negligible. So this is not a question of an impact in the near term. It's just that a simpler operating framework in Europe and in the U.K. should help banks contribute more to improving productivity and growth in the U.K. and in Europe."
