Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Good morning in London and good afternoon in Hong Kong. I’ve got Ewen with me today and I wanted to start by sharing on screen our purpose, ambition and our four strategic pillars: the focus on our strengths, to digitise at scale, to energise for growth and to lead the transition to net zero. I will return to these in a moment, but first I’ll run through some highlights before Ewen takes you through our financial performance. We’ve had a good start to the year. I’ve seen excellent energy within the business, strong collaboration and a determination to get things done for our customers. I’m very grateful to all of my colleagues for the way they’ve managed growing demand since the turn of the year and for the single-minded way they’ve helped our customers to capture both present and future opportunities. There are many parts of the world where the pandemic remains a very real part of people’s lives. Our thoughts are with the people of India in particular and we’re working hard to support our colleagues and customers in India through this very tough time. In terms of our financial performance, our good performance, supported by a net release of expected credit losses, delivered reported pre-tax profits of $5.8 billion, which were up 79% on last year’s first quarter. We strengthened our lending pipelines across our Personal and Commercial Banking businesses, which bodes well for our future revenue. Our cost and RWA programmes remain on track, with $443 million of quarterly cost-programme savings, and $9 billion of gross RWA savings in the quarter. We retained a strong capital ratio of 15.9%, with further growth in both deposits and lending. Pointing out a few highlights on slide 3, a combination of our digital campaigns and growing customer confidence saw strong credit card sales growth in Hong Kong. We saw good mortgage growth, with drawdowns up 60% in the UK and 37% in Hong Kong. Our wealth strategy got off to a strong start, with 23% growth in overall wealth balances. We attracted $13 billion of net new money into Private Banking in the quarter and $11 billion of net new money into Asset Management. We saw good loan-volume growth in Commercial Banking and month-by-month increases in lending approvals, with nearly double the approvals in March of any one month in 2020. Global Banking and Markets had a good quarter, supported by strong customer activity in capital markets. We led more than $567 billion of capital markets financing across global debt and equity markets and syndicated loans, including around $40 billion of social and Covid-19 response bonds, which is around 29% of the total market. This was a global performance, with good profitability in all regions, and growth of $3.2 billion in profits booked outside of Asia compared with last year’s first quarter. Moving to slide 4, I said in February that our growth and transformation plans were already in motion, and you can see the evidence of that here. Under Focusing on our Strengths, we’ve already grown Wealth balances in Asia by 18% year on year. We’ve grown our Asia Wealth FTEs by more than 600, including around 100 new client-facing wealth planners in mainland China, and we’ve grown trade-finance lending in Asia by around $3 billion, mainly in China and Hong Kong. Under Digitise at Scale, we started to integrate our market-leading PayMe app in Hong Kong into merchant checkouts, and officially launched HSBC Kinetic for SMEs in the UK, with around 6,000 customers already signed up. Under Energise for Growth, we’re applying all that we’ve learned through lockdown, combined with our digital investment, to improve the way we work. We’re moving to a hybrid model wherever possible, giving our people the flexibility to work in a way that suits both them and their customers. We will need less office space as a result and we have a plan to reduce our global office footprint by more than 3.6 million square feet, or around 20%, by the end of 2021. We’re also relocating three of our global business CEOs to Asia on a permanent basis, taking them closer to our customers and to the core of our business. On the transition to net zero, we’ve published details of the climate resolution that we’ll put to shareholders at our AGM in May. We are one of the founder members of the Global Net Zero Banking Alliance that launched last week. We maintained our leadership position in sustainable finance, following a record quarter for global ESG bond issuance, and we’re piloting a new tool in the UK to help SMEs better understand their ESG performance and to prepare to take action. It’s early days, but we’re carrying good momentum into the second quarter. Ewen will now take you through our results.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon, all. We had a good quarter against a backdrop of ultra-low rates; reported post-tax profits of $4.6 billion – that’s up 82% on last year’s first quarter; and an annualised return on tangible equity of 10.2%. Adjusted revenues were down 3% on last year’s first quarter, largely due to the impact of ultra-low interest rates, but there were notably good performances in some segments, including Asia Wealth in Wealth and Personal Banking, Asia Trade Finance in Commercial Banking, and Capital Markets and Advisory, Global Debt Markets, and Equities in Global Banking and Markets. Relative to the first quarter of 2020, adjusted revenues also benefited from the reversal of negative insurance market impacts and Global Banking and Markets valuation adjustments. Expected credit losses had a $435 million net release. This reflects both an improved economic outlook for our central scenarios and, in the UK and the US, lower probabilities attached to downside scenarios. Operating expenses were up 3%. This was due to a shift in variable pay accruals to reflect quarterly profitability. We remain on track to deliver our target of broadly stable costs for the year ex the bank levy, subject to final decisions on the variable pay pool later in the year. Lending and deposit balances were both up 1%, with confidence in higher loan growth in the remainder of the year. Our common equity tier 1 ratio remains stable at 15.9%, and our tangible net asset value per share of $7.78 was up three cents on the fourth quarter, with retained profits more than offsetting negative reserve movements. Turning to slide 6 and looking at first-quarter adjusted revenues across the three global businesses, in Wealth and Personal Banking revenues were down 1% on a year ago, Wealth Management revenues grew by just under $1 billion due to the turnaround in insurance market impacts from a big loss last year, and a good performance in equity and mutual fund sales in Hong Kong. Personal Banking revenues fell by $890 million, due to the impact of low interest rates on deposit margins. Commercial Banking revenues were 14% lower, due mainly to the impact of low interest rates on Global Liquidity and Cash Management, but with a good bounce-back in trade balances in the quarter and growing confidence in the lending pipeline for the coming quarters. In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were up 10%, with strong performances in Global Debt Markets and Equities, up 52% and 55% respectively, and Capital Markets and Advisory, up more than 100%. Just to remind you, we’ve no significant exposure to SPACs, where some peer banks benefited from exceptionally high activity levels in the first quarter. On slide 7, net interest income was $6.5 billion, down 14% against the first quarter of 2020 on a reported basis. On rates, the net interest margin was 121 basis points, down one basis point on the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the fall in HIBOR during the first quarter. On volumes, we saw continued good volume growth in mortgages in both Hong Kong and the UK, and strong commercial applications that we expect to translate into volumes in the coming quarters. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, despite some continuing rolling impact of last year’s shift in interest rates, we expect volume growth to support net interest income at levels broadly in line with the first quarter. On the next slide, non interest income was $6.8 billion, up 15% against last year’s first quarter, but noting last year was negatively impacted by volatile items due to Covid-19. Overall, non-interest income stabilised in the quarter compared with falls over the previous three quarters. Wealth and Personal Banking, and Global Banking and Markets benefited from higher volumes, better equity and mutual fund sales and stronger capital market activity. FX revenues were down year on year, but this was still a good performance against an exceptional first quarter of 2020. Commercial Banking was down slightly, reflecting lower trade and payment volumes, due to the continuing impact of Covid-19 on activity levels. Looking forward, we expect customer activity and fee income to continue to recover as economic activity recovers, although this remains subject to the impact of new Covid-19 variants and the continuing success we’ve seen to date in the rollout of a global vaccination programme. On the next slide, we had a net release of $435 million of expected credit losses in the quarter. This compares with a £3.1 billion charge in the first quarter of 2020. The net release was across all global businesses and reflected an improvement in the economic outlook, notably in the UK, including the reduction in downside probabilities. Last year’s first quarter included a large charge related to one single-name corporate exposure in Singapore, but this year’s first quarter was still very benign for stage 3 charges, particularly on the wholesale side. We’re retained ECL uncertainty overlays of $1.5 billion, broadly the same as the fourth quarter, recognising the risks that still exist from the pandemic. But based on the current economic outlook, we now expect the ECL charge for the full year to be below our medium- term through-the-cycle planning range of 30-40 basis points. Turning to slide 10, first-quarter adjusted operating costs were $220 million higher than the same period last year. This was driven by higher performance-related pay accrual of $474 million, primarily due to a shift in accruing a higher percentage of variable pay this quarter relative to the first quarter of 2020. We made a further $443 million of cost programme savings in the quarter, with an associated cost-to-achieve of $319 million. To date, our cost programmes have achieved annualised saves of some $2.2 billion against our target of $5- 5.5 billion, with cumulative cost-to-achieve spend of $2.2 billion. We’re not softening our vigorous approach on costs. We continue to expect our 2021 costs to be broadly in line with 2020, excluding the benefit from a reduced bank levy. This is subject to final decisions on our variable pay pool later in the year, which will be primarily driven by the pre-tax profitability of the Group. Turning to capital on slide 11, the impact of profit generation in the quarter was offset by fair value movements and other deductions, including around 10 basis points for foreseeable dividends. As a result, our common equity tier 1 ratio was unchanged at 15.9%. In line with our shift to a payout-ratio approach going forward, the deduction for foreseeable dividends was based on one quarter of the 2020 15-cent dividend. We expect to make the same capital deduction in the next two quarters, based on the same trailing-dividend assumption. But to be clear, we’re not signalling with this our 2021 dividend intentions. Excluding FX movements, risk-weighted assets fell by $6 billion in the first quarter, due to changes to our portfolio mix, and methodology and model updates. To remind you, we do expect some common equity tier 1 headwinds going forward from regulatory changes. These haven’t changed from the full year. So in summary, against the backdrop of ultra-low interest rates, this was a strong quarter for us, our best in reported profits since the onset of Covid-19, and an annualised return on tangible equity of 10.2%. While the results were flattered by a net release of ECLs, we saw strong performances across various parts of the bank, with continued strength in Asia, despite the impact of a very low HIBOR, and a material recovery in profitability outside of Asia. As we look out, there remain heightened levels of uncertainty, particularly driven by the continuing emergence of Covid-19 variants, so expect us to retain a conservative position on capital funding and liquidity for the time being. However, based on the first-quarter performance and the strengthened economic outlook, Noel and I are more optimistic about this year, albeit cautiously, than we were at our full-year results in mid-February. With that,",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Ed Firth,Kbw,"Good morning, everybody. I just had two questions. The first was on capital. I was surprised that the capital ratio wasn’t stronger, given the earnings beat and risk- weighted assets falling. I just wondered if you could give us some more colour around ‘Other’ movements – I think it was a minus-40-basis-point hit in the chart – exactly what’s driving that and how we might expect that to progress going forward. And then the second question was restructuring charges seem to be running some way lower than you were perhaps informally guiding to at the full year. Should we expect those to pick up during the rest of the year, and can you give us any colour on how that might end up?",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"On restructuring charges, we’re not changing our full-year guidance we gave at full-year results. You’re right: Q1 was unusually low, so yes, you should expect those to pick up as the year progresses. On capital, a few things: there were deductions for fair value reserve movements on cash flow and negative FX movements. There was a higher deduction for BoCom as its profits increased and, again, note that we talk about a 10-basis- point deduction for the foreseeable dividend, which is new for us, but represents a change in policy because we’ve shifted to a payout-ratio policy.",False,0.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Fahed Kunwar,Redburn,"Morning. Just a couple of questions. The first one is on margins. You gave colour on this, Ewen, during the call, but they’re down in all your major regions. Just to understand, how much of that is lower rates feeding through – previously lower rates and slightly lower HIBOR? And is there anything on competitive pressure that’s pushing those margins down or is it all about the background yield curve and rates? The second question is just on the writeback. It does look like a lot of the writebacks were in the UK, particularly UK commercial – a) Is that right? Were they mainly UK commercial? And b)what did you see that was driving that? Was it an outlook on the vaccine rollout or was it specific data points that you were seeing on the UK corporates or UK personal, if that was the case? Thank you.",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"On NIM, it was, I think, almost exclusively driven by the shift in yield curves. We’ve broadly repriced all of our liabilities now. And on the asset side, we’re seeing some opportunity for margin expansion. So for example, in the UK, we increased margins to try and slow down some of the inflow that we were seeing, and we have, for several quarters, seen some opportunity to reprice in Asia on the commercial side, so we do think that we are now close to troughing on NIM. HIBOR clipped it a little bit further in Q1, but as you know that translates very rapidly into the books, given the short-dated nature of assets of liabilities in Hong Kong. And for net interest income, loan growth in Q1 was mid-twos percent, and we’re signalling that we expect mid-single-digit growth over the full year, so that does imply much higher growth rates and lending volumes in the remaining three quarters, which we’ve got confidence in, given the pipelines that we can see, which should help support net interest income over the remainder of the year, even if there is still some residual NIM pressure coming from the roll-off of books as a result of last year’s interest-rate shift. On writebacks, you’re right. There was a larger writeback in commercial, particularly in UK commercial. I think. In part, that reflected the very large reserve build-up that we had last year. Overall, there were various things going on which made this an unusual quarter for us. Firstly, we had very low stage 3 losses of around about $300 million or so in the quarter, which was unusually low, we think, And secondly, on stage 1 and stage 2, two things, really: an improvement in our economic forecast for central scenarios in most places that we do business, coupled with, as you know, we went into the full year with very large probabilities, particularly in the UK, against downside scenarios, which we have reduced on the back of a very successful vaccination programme here. We’re also seeing that in the US and we would expect to see that in other markets as the vaccine programmes ramp up elsewhere.",False,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Omar Keenan,Credit Suisse,"Good morning. Thank you for the questions. My question is that, with the Wealth and Personal Banking rationalisation in France and the US, I was just wondering what the appetite might be to use released risk-weighted assets to potentially exit capital to add portfolios in your other markets where it might make sense. I’m noting here that a large global bank has put up consumer balances for sale in about 13 markets. So I was just wondering what your view is of where markets might overlap in those geographies and where HSBC might think it makes sense to be bigger rather than smaller. Thank you.",True,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Omar, thank you. As you know, our primary focus in the WPB business is to grow our Wealth part of that business and, therefore, we are looking at opportunities for both organic and bolt-on, inorganic opportunities, but it’s primarily focused on wealth businesses, either acquiring product or distribution capability in wealth management, in insurance, in private banking. That’s the primary focus, rather than just a geographic expansion of retail banking capability. So we’re more focused on that for opportunity. And it will be Asia-based, largely.",False,2.0,0

It’s really just you’re focused on an organic strategy –",True,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Well, we would use capital to do an M&A deal, but what we’re buying is less retail banking assets and more wealth management capabilities. So we will use freed-up capital if we see bolt-on-acquisition opportunities. But as I say, it’s more around wealth management capabilities than it is retail banking capabilities. We will look at opportunities as they emerge.",False,2.0,0

So will it eat into some of the excess capital? Yes, but it will be relatively modest, if we choose to do anything.",False,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Omar Keenan,Credit Suisse,"Could I maybe just ask a follow-up on that? So having said that, and just bearing in mind your comments from last quarter around not to expect buybacks this year, could you perhaps paint the path for us towards returning excess capital which HSBC is clearly building?",True,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"So I think we’ve been clear on our distribution policy and certainly our dividend policy. We said we’re going to shift to a 40-55% payout ratio from next year. That’s going to be all cash. This year, we’re going to transition towards that. We were close to an 80% payout ratio last year. We do expect, subject to seeing how the second quarter goes, to be in a position to pay an interim dividend in the middle of the year and then re-evaluate whether or not we’ll shift the quarterly dividends at the end of this year. On buybacks, we continue to have no current intention to do buybacks this year. You know that we’ve used buybacks in the past, so they’re certainly something that we do actively consider as a tool of capital management, and we are committed to active capital management. We do think at the moment that, when we look at consensus versus where we are, we do see RWA growth probably being a tad higher than is in most people’s models. We see loan growth being fuller than I think all of you currently are modelling. That’s on the back, I think, of very strong growth what we continue see in mortgages across the UK and Hong Kong, a commercial pipeline that is building nicely. And just in context, in one of the slides, you’ll see that our commercial pipeline is running close to 50% higher than it was in Q4 in Q1. And we do think other segments like consumer credit will bounce back as we recover out of Covid. There are about $20 billion of regulatory headwinds that we see this year. Offsetting that is the $30 billion or so of RWA rundown that we expect. We’re making good progress on that. We did about $9 billion in the first quarter. And the last thing is we’re still cautious on credit- rating migration, particularly as some of the government support packages roll off here in the UK, for example, as furlough rolls off and what impact that has on credit later in the year. So yes, we are probably slightly more cautious on capital and excess capital than would be in your numbers at the moment.",False,2.0,0

First, on credit quality, you released $0.7 billion from stage 1 and 2 reserves in Q1. I think you flagged $6.8 billion still left on balance sheet. Your guidance, if I take the bottom of your range of 30 basis points, below would suggest a full-year charge of somewhere around $3 billion or lower. I just wondered: that guidance in itself, what does that imply in terms of further stage 1 and 2 releases for the rest of 2021? Then I know you’ve already touched on this – I was going to ask you to then expand on your thoughts about when the government programmes actually do end. What are your thoughts on releases over a two-to-three-year period? That was the first question and I have a second one on costs, please.",True,3.0,0

If we were to stick to the central economic scenario, I would think you would see some of that get released this year, maybe some of it get released in the first half of next year. I think we’re going to continue to be pretty cautious about how we do release. We’re not expecting a repeat of Q1 in terms of further ECL performance during the remainder of the year. And there still is a pretty broad array of outcomes, I think, depending on how we progress out of Covid. And there are a few risks on the horizon, particularly around new variants and whether any of those become vaccine-resistant. So where we land below 30 basis points, we’ll see, but you should assume that, within that, we’re confident that we will end up below 30 basis points.",False,3.0,0

We’re optimistic, we’re seeing good signs, but it’s still relatively early days for the vaccination programme, and that’s why we’ve wanted to retain around 70% of the provisions that we created last year. We’ve had a very good stage 3 quarter in Q1, with only $300 million of stage 3 charges. That’s below the normal trend line that one would expect.

If I annualise Q1 this year, I’m looking at 3% growth. I’m just trying to get a feel for where your confidence is coming from. Is this just incremental cost savings or are you really building in an expectation that this performance- related pay is going to push us away from that broadly stable? If it is performance-related, that’s not a bad thing either, necessarily, but I’m just trying to get a feel for how confident you are, really, on that broadly stable target.",True,3.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"So in the first quarter, there was about a £300-400 million adjustment due to us taking a higher accrual for variable pay compared to Q1 last year. So I think, if you back that number out, what you’ll see is that we were broadly flat costs in the quarter, and you would expect the variable-pay accrual, other things being equal, to be a few hundred million dollars lower for the remaining quarters of the year, which I think gives you confidence in that statement. All we’re signalling on the variable-pay accrual – I think, what we saw as part of the full-year results, as you will all know, there was a very different approach across the sector in terms of performance pay. We took our pool down by close to 20% for the full year, but we saw some peers, particularly US peers and particularly some European peers who were concentrated on the wealth and investment banking space, pay in very different places. So we’re just cognisant of the fact that, for competitive reasons, we may need to top up our current pool assumptions as the year progresses, but that would only be done in the context of improved profitability. But absent that change – and, again, in context, we paid about $2.8 billion in variable pay last year, so you can do your own maths and size what that risk is, but absent that, we’re very confident that we’re on track to deliver broadly flat costs this year.

I have two. Firstly, on RWAs, and then just briefly to come back on costs. I just want to check on the RWAS and your commentary that you see RWAs being higher than consensus. Is that a reference beyond 2021? As we look at Q1, quite an encouraging quarter, if you take the FX and gross saves, so given where we start Q2, further gross saves to come, it didn’t strike me that consensus looked particularly higher in 2021, but perhaps you’re more cautious in terms of credit migration and the volume growth. I just want to check if it’s a 2021 or beyond story there. And then the second question, just on costs, coming back to your commentary on performance, I think initially you said it would be driven by PBT, so I was interested: was that more weighted to pre-provision profit or to impairments materially low but below medium-term cost of risk? Could that be a factor or is it more competitive pressures that you just talked to that would drive that? Thank you.",True,4.0,0

I just wanted to come back on the point on cost, please. I just wanted to understand more how it will evolve going forward, because, from what you’re saying, it sounds as if, to the extent that revenues are being led by areas like Wealth and Markets, that will drive potentially higher variable compensation and, therefore, higher expenses than you’d been guiding for. But am I right to say, if revenue growth hands off to more balance-sheet-led-type NII in Commercial Banking, we wouldn't see that?",True,5.0,0

So we had assumed revenue growth going forward in 2021 and 2022 and beyond and, therefore we had assumed a growth in profit and, therefore, we had assumed a growth in variable pay to match that path. And that was all inherent in the cost statements we made back in February. So we have put into our future forecast a growth in VP to match the growth in the P&L that we expect to see. What I think you saw in Q1 is a particularly strong performance in Q1 that was over and above that underlying curve that gets us to that 10% RoTE. Now, if that over-performance continues in future quarters, then maybe that assumed growth in VP will be higher in the future than was in that original assumption, but so too would be the PBT and so too would be the revenue. So don’t assume there isn’t a growth in VP inherent in the plans that underpinned the journey to a 10% RoTE. Does that make sense?",False,5.0,0

Let me also be clear: we started that journey of investing in our Wealth businesses last year. And that was investing in a buildout of our product capability to make sure we had good product capability on the shelf in Asia, and an investment in distribution. So we launched the Pinnacle initiative in China as an example. But we were also investing in Private Banking, in our Insurance business. We were investing in both physical manpower to drive that growth in wealth managers, but we were also investing in digital infrastructure. So our Insurance business in Hong Kong particularly launched a lot of new initiatives last year, new products, digital-based, supported by extra salespeople, and that’s what’s been driving the growth of our Wealth revenues in Asia. It’s not just market sentiment or market valuations that are driving that growth; underlying growth is coming through. Now, we still have more to do. We recruited an extra 600 wealth managers in Asia in the first quarter alone, 100 of those in China as part of an expansion of our Pinnacle opportunities. Where are we getting the business? How are we sourcing the Wealth opportunity? Well, I’m pleased to say we’re sourcing a lot of it from our existing client base. Around about 60% of the net new money that goes into our Private Bank comes from Commercial Banking clients and Global Banking clients. The owners of those businesses are putting their personal wealth with us. The same is true of Asset Management. Around 75% of the net new money for Asset Management is coming from internal HSBC clients. So it’s true organic growth at an underlying level, not just growth in assets as a consequence of market revaluation of those assets. There is an element of that in Q1 as markets revalued, but there’s a lot of it coming from underlying growth.",False,6.0,0

The first one is just on loan book, loan demand. I was trying to understand a couple of points. Firstly, how sustainable do you think this current activity spike in the UK mortgage market is? You and all the UK banks have benefited from very strong mortgage pipelines and pricing, so I’m just wondering, tying that into your overall comments on loan demand, as to what you’re assuming happens to that for the rest of the year. And then, just related to that, I suspect there’s an element of pent-up demand in other areas of loans in the UK as well as probably across your footprint as well, so to balance that, if you could you talk a little bit about where you see pent-up demand in loan growth. Thanks.",True,7.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210427-1q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,1,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Let me deal with the retail banking business first. I think, in the UK, it’s true that there is strong activity at the moment. There’ll undoubtedly be an element of that which is driven by the stamp duty holidays that were put in place and that are likely to come to an end shortly. But I also believe there are some structural changes taking place in the UK, in that the housing market in the UK, I think, will remain active for quite a period of time, as the housing stock is continuing to be built out. So I think there’s an underlying growth curve there and there’s a potential temporary growth curve as a consequence of the stamp duty holiday. I think we’ll see a pickup in activity of consumer lending – unsecured lending and credit card activity – in the second half of the year, not just in the UK but across the world. If you just take our own balance sheet, we grew our deposit balances by around about $170 billion last year. Now, an element of that $170 billion will turn into cash spend by consumers and businesses in the second half of this year – or already started but will continue to pick up. So I think you’re going to see traditional unsecured lending and credit card activity increase in the second half of this year. Hong Kong remains strong demand on mortgage growth, and we’re pleased on that. More broadly into the wholesale business, what I saw at the end of last year, particularly in Q4, was a lot of activity from corporate borrowers seeking facility renewals or facility extensions to get their balance sheet ready for the upturn in the economy as they started to see vaccines come on stream, but I didn’t see that translate into loan drawdowns in Q4 of last year. I have started to see that take place in Q1 of this year. So for example, the trade balance sheet in Asia grew by $3 billion in the first quarter of this year. That’s an indication of underlying economic growth and, if the vaccine programmes continue as they currently are, you could assume that that trend will continue and could well pick up. And then, more generally, there was a starting to see a drawdown in those facilities that were negotiated at the end of last year taking place in Q1, so overall, our Commercial Banking balance sheet grew by $2 billion in Q1 of this year, and our Personal Banking loan book grew as well. So I think it’s early stage of growth and I could expect the trend to pick up over the next three quarters.",False,7.0,0

I just had a follow-up on your earlier comments on margin outlook from year-end. I was just wondering if you could shed a bit of light on how we should think of NIM progression here for the main business lines – Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and in particular the UK ring- fenced bank. I was just wondering if it’s fair to assume that the bulk of rate-cut impacts has by now fed through in Hong Kong and if, from here, we should see stability and, if anything, at some point, some gradual growth and that, if anything, some of the remaining margin pressures coming through from structural hedge rollover, in particular in the UK. And I was just wondering: should we assume margins to remain broadly flat in terms of 1Q level, what we have seen, or is your guidance of – I think you said earlier that 1Q NII is broadly representative of the full year, if I understand right – that that implied that, combined with loan growth, you would expect some further margin compression heading into 2021? And then just a follow-up on capital.

We talked previously about $1 billion of interest-rate pressure coming from lower rates into 2021, and then HIBOR did drop meaningfully in the first quarter; it has remained broadly stable in the second quarter at the levels of the first quarter so far, so we do think we are getting towards the trough of NIM pressure. But it would be a big call to say that Q1 was the trough. I still think there will be an element of pressure into the second quarter. And then volume growth then provides us confidence that the impact on net interest income is negligible. The other thing I would say about the growth is it will be back-end-loaded as we go progressively through the year and as confidence builds during the year and, therefore, you won’t get as much of that benefit into 2021, but you will get all of that benefit into 2022. So I talked about earlier assuming that the Q1 net interest income was a good guide to the annualised net interest income for the full year, but you should take away from that, therefore, that we’re also confident about decent net interest-income growth into 2022. On Hong Kong, most of the impact of lower HIBOR gets translated into our books within three months, so equally the reverse is true. If we were to get back to a better short-term HIBOR curve, we would see that very rapidly translate into improved net interest income in Hong Kong.

I’ve got Ewen with me today, and I’ll hand over to him shortly to go through the detail of our Q2 performance. First, though, I’ll start with a summary of the key highlights, our progress against our transformation plans, and in particular what we’re seeing with respect to growth. For the second quarter a good operating performance, supported by a net release of expected credit losses, delivered reported pre-tax profits of $5.1 billion, up $4 billion on last year’s second quarter. We saw a return to profitability in all regions in the first half, including good performances in both Europe and the US. Our UK business performed well, with a record quarter for mortgages in Q2. We’ve generated good momentum behind our growth and transformation plans, and made important decisions on exiting our mass-market retail business in the US and our retail business in France. Our RWA and cost reduction programmes are both on track. Our Asia Wealth strategy is gaining traction, with strong growth in Wealth Balances. We’re seeing promising signs of early growth in both lending volumes and fee income, particularly in Asia, and we’ve retained a strong capital ratio of 15.6%, which enables us to declare an interim dividend of 7 cents per share for the first half of the year. The next two slides look at the growth we’re starting to see, particularly in Asia. In Wealth and Personal Banking we’ve already seen strong traction in our Asia Wealth business, with Global Wealth balances up more than $250 billion – or 18% – in the last 12 months. This was driven chiefly by growth in assets under management rather than deposits. We’ve expanded our Asia Wealth franchise, recruiting around 600 new frontline colleagues, and growing affluent and high-net-worth customers in Asia by 7%. While it’s early days, we’re seeing promising productivity data from our Pinnacle Wealth planners in mainland China, with exciting momentum within the business. Because of that, we’re accelerating our rollout of Pinnacle to five new cities in mainland China, and planning to hire 100 more wealth planners this year than we had originally planned. In Commercial Banking, pipeline growth is starting to translate into lending, with $8 billion of loan volume growth since the start of the year. Our approved lending limits in Asia are up 100% on last year’s second half, and 70% on pre-pandemic levels. These include renewals, refinancing, and new facilities. There are also signs of a recovery in Asia Trade, with $6.7 billion of trade finance lending growth in the first half. In Global Banking and Markets, we’ve made good progress repositioning the franchise for growth. The proportion of RWAs allocated to Asia in GBM is now 6% higher than the same point last year, with around a third of non-Asia RWAs supporting revenue booked in Asia. Collaboration with other businesses is a big part of the GBM growth story, with collaboration revenue up 6% against last year’s first half. This was supported by investment in new digital market platforms, which are helping to support our Asia Wealth strategy. Slide 4 goes deeper on the lending growth we’re starting to see. We’re seeing strong mortgage growth globally, with Hong Kong drawdowns up 56% year-on-year, and a record quarter for UK mortgages. Card balances are starting to recover in Hong Kong, the UK and elsewhere, up around $1 billion quarter-on-quarter. In Commercial Banking we’re seeing approved lending limit growth translating into term lending, with loans up 2% versus the first quarter. Trade balances are up 9%, and we continue to capture market share in both Hong Kong and Singapore. We’re also continuing to grow our lending pipeline in Hong Kong and Asia, which bodes well for future quarters. Moving to slide 5, both our US and European business saw a rebound in profits, and both are now well advanced in their transformations. The US made around $500 million of pre-tax profits, up from around $100 million in last year’s first half. Risk-weighted assets in the US are now 16% lower than at the same point last year, and costs are down around $100 million year- on-year. We’ve announced the sale of our US mass market retail business, which is an important milestone in the reshaping of our US portfolio, and we’ve also now completed the migration of fixed income derivatives trading book from New York to London. In Europe we’ve delivered $1.4 billion of pre-tax profits after recording a loss in last year’s first half. Compared with a year ago we’ve reduced RWAs by 16% and costs by 3%, which includes a $149 million increase in variable pay. We’ve also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to sell our French retail business. Both our US and European business are much better positioned to grow than at the start of the year. Slide 6 looks at our second pillar, Digitise at Scale. Our technology spending is now 18% higher than the same period in 2018, and 4% higher than last year’s first half. This is making us a better and stronger bank, both operationally and in terms of the customer experience, and providing material operating leverage as we grow the business. The proportion of payments that go straight through without manual intervention now stands at 96.7%. We’re reducing account opening times, for example, including first direct, where it now takes 10 minutes to open an account instead of 10 days, and we’ve introduced e-signature for over 200 processes in Hong Kong, substantially reducing both processing time and the use of physical forms. When launching and scaling new digital products, our multi-currency Global Money account launched last year in the US, and is now live in both Singapore and the UAE. We’ve launched Kinetic in the UK, which already has more than 10,000 users, and a 4.8 App Store rating. We’re simplifying and automating trade finance. By 2023 our digital trade transformation aims to reduce 60 bespoke systems down to just five. Clients and counterparties can already agree the wording of guarantees digitally, which is then fulfilled seamlessly in our back office, significantly reducing both time and effort. In supply chain finance we can now digitally on- board suppliers in two days rather than eight, helping clients to support their suppliers and increase the resilience of their supply chains. These are big innovations, with a real-world impact for our customers. Slide 7 looks at Energise for Growth, our third pillar. Our move to hybrid working is now well underway, with a 10% reduction in our global office footprint since the start of 2020. Three of our Global Business CEOs are in the process of relocating to Asia, and we made a number of key leadership appointments in Asia in the first half of the year. We’re aiming to build a more diverse business. We’ve signed up to the WEF’s Partnering for Racial Justice in Business, and the UN LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business. We’ve also increased the proportion of female leaders to more than 31%, but we’ve still much more to do. We’ve hired more than 650 new graduates from 48 different countries, more than half of whom are female. Slide 8 looks at our final pillar, the Transition to Net Zero. I was delighted and grateful that 99.7% of our shareholders backed our special resolution on climate change at our AGM in May. That was a strong endorsement of our climate strategy, which has, at its core, a commitment to support our customers on their transition to low carbon. We’re continuing to provide strong support to our customers on their transition journeys, taking part in more sustainable financing in the first half of 2021 than in the whole of 2020. We’re working closely with our own suppliers to help them improve their climate reporting, so that we can become net zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030. We’re building partnerships to unlock new climate solutions and make them investable, joining forces with WWF and the World Resources Institute to bring new projects and technologies into commercial scale. Overall, it’s still relatively early in the life of our growth and transformation plans, but I’m pleased with our progress so far. Ewen will now take you through our results and update you on our targets.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210803-interim-results-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,2,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon, all. We had another solid quarter, reported pre-tax profits of $5.1 billion. That’s up almost five-fold on last year’s second quarter, with an annualised return on tangible equity of 9.4% for the first half. Adjusted revenues were down 10% on last year’s second quarter, due largely to the impact of the current rate environment, together with the comparison against a very strong Global Markets second quarter last year. Importantly, we think we’re now close to the trough in year-on-year revenues, with volume growth in our lending businesses and our Wealth franchises driving our recovery in the coming quarters. Expected credit losses were a $284 million net release, second quarter in a row of net releases. This reflects a continued improvement in the economic outlook for our central scenarios, less extreme downside scenarios, given the progress in global vaccinations, and exceptionally low stage three charges in both the first and second quarters. We still retain $2.4 billion of the stage one and two ECL reserve build-up we made in 2020. Operating expenses were up 4%. This was due to both higher performance-related pay accrual and higher technology spend. Despite this, we remain on track to deliver our target of broadly stable operating costs for the year ex the bank levy, subject, of course, to final decisions on the variable pay pool later in the year. Lending and deposit balances were up 2% and 1% respectively, as lending growth spread for us beyond mortgages and Retail Banking and trade finance into Commercial Banking, with increased confidence in higher loan growth in the second half of the year. Our common equity tier one ratio was down nearly 30 basis points at 15.6%, due primarily to our dividend accrual. Our tangible net asset value per share of $7.81 was up three cents on the first quarter, and we’ve declared an interim dividend of seven cents per share for the first half of the year. We remain on track to deliver all of our medium-term targets, including rebuilding to a return on tangible equity of at least 10%. Turning to slide 10, we’re continuing to shift the balance of the group’s focus towards Asia through capital reallocation and the build-up of capabilities and people. However, as other regions start to recover from Covid-19 lows, we’re also seeing much improved earnings diversity, with profitability in all regions during the half. Europe has gone from loss-making in last year’s first half to generating 22% of group profits in the first half of this year. This included a strong contribution from our UK ring-fenced bank, which saw revenue growth of 12% in Wealth and Personal Banking and 7% in Commercial Banking. There were also good signs of recovery elsewhere, including the Middle East, the US and Mexico. We’re also now seeing more balanced profitability across our global businesses. Each business is now generating roughly a third of group profits in the first half, with a particularly strong recovery in Commercial Banking. Turning to slide 11 and looking at the second quarter, adjusted revenues across the three Global Businesses, in Wealth and Personal Banking revenues were down 4% on a year ago. Wealth Management revenues grew by $187 million, due mainly to an increase in the value of new business written in insurance and mutual fund sales growth in Hong Kong. Personal Banking revenues fell by $161 million due to the impact of low interest rates on deposit margins. Commercial Banking revenues were 4% lower, due mainly to the impact of low interest rates on Global Liquidity and Cash Management, but with good growth in trade balances in the quarter and early signs of growth across other Commercial lending. In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were down 23%. This was largely due to slower customer activity and lower volatility in the fixed income markets, as compared with a particularly strong Global Markets performance in the same period last year. On slide 12, net interest income was $6.6 billion, down 5% against the second quarter of 2020 on a reported basis, but stable compared with the first quarter of 2021. On rates, the net interest margin was 120 basis points, down one basis point on the first quarter, primarily reflecting lower asset yields, which more than offset lower funding costs. On volumes, we saw continued good loan growth and mortgages in Hong Kong and the UK, and strong Commercial applications that have started to translate into drawdowns. For the remainder of the year we’re seeing signs that net interest income has now stabilised, and we expect loan growth to support net interest income in the second half. On the next slide, non-interest income was $5.9 billion, down 11% against last year’s second quarter due to the exceptionally strong Global Markets performance in the second quarter last year, However, we saw good fee income progression in all our businesses against last year’s second quarter, with strong performances in Wealth, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, and Capital Markets and Advisory. We expect customer activity and fee income to continue to strengthen as economic activity recovers, although the recovery path obviously remains uncertain as a result of Covid-19 variance. On the next slide, we’ve reported a net release of $284 million of expected credit losses in the quarter, compared with a $4.2 billion charge in the second quarter of 2020. The net release was across all Global Businesses. This reflected an improved economic outlook, together with stage three charges that remained very low in the quarter. Recognising the risks that still exist from the pandemic, we’re continuing to hold around $2.4 billion of our 2020 Covid-19 uplift to stage one and two ECL reserves. Based on the current economic outlook we now expect the ECL charge for the full year to be materially lower than our medium term through-the-cycle planning range of 30 to 40 basis points, with the potential, even, for a net release for full-year 2021, and further stage one and two releases in the first half of 2022. Turning to slide 15, second quarter adjusted operating costs were $297 million higher than the same period last year. This was driven by a higher performance-related pay accrual of $367 million, and a $204 million increase in technology investment. We made a further $484 million of cost programme savings compared with the prior year, with an associated cost to achieve of $499 million. To date, our cost programmes have achieved savings of $2 billion relative to our year-end 2022 target of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, with cumulative costs-to-achieve spend of $2.7 billion. Despite higher second quarter costs we continue to expect our 2021 adjusted operating costs, excluding the benefit from a reduced bank levy, to be broadly in line with 2020. Turning to capital on slide 16, our common equity tier one ratio was 15.6%, down 27 basis points in the quarter. This reflected an increase in RWAs from lending growth, including a short-term increase of around $10 billion from IPO loans in Hong Kong, together with a decrease in capital, including a $3.5 billion accrual for dividends. As signalled at the time of our first quarter results, we will include a deduction each quarter for dividend accruals. For the half year that deduction was 17 cents, based on 47.5% of our first half EPS of 36 cents, which is the midpoint of our 40% to 55% target payout ratio. To reiterate my comments from last quarter, this shouldn’t be read as a signal or a forecast of our 2021 dividend intentions. The dividend accrual is purely a formulaic calculation that will true up at the full-year based on the results and outlook at the time. Reflecting the current improved economic outlook and improved operating environment in many of our markets, we now expect to move to our target payout range in 2021. We retain the flexibility to adjust earnings per share for non-cash significant items, and in 2022 we also intend to exclude the losses on the sale of our French retail banking operations. When thinking about the payout ratio for 2021, we’ll attach a lower weight to unusually low ECL charges or credits as part of this year’s earnings per share, together with a desire to see further progress from 2021 and dividends per share in 2022 and beyond. Excluding FX movements, risk-weighted assets rose by $13.5 billion in the second quarter, driven by growth in Asia and the IPO loans already mentioned. We now expect low single-digit percentage growth in risk-weighted assets for the full year. On the next slide, due to changes in the underlying calculation methodology we’ve updated our risk-weighted assets targets on a like-for-like basis from $100 billion to $110 billion. So far, we’ve made around $85 billion of transformation saves and remain fully on track to meet our target. On slide 18, it’s still early days in terms of our 2022 targets, but we’ve made good progress so far. We’re on track to meet our cost and risk-weighted assets savings targets, and we remain confident that we’re on track for a return on tangible equity at or above 10% over the medium term. The shift to higher return areas is underway, and we’re starting to see results from the growth opportunities we’ve identified. As mentioned, we now intend to move to our target payout ratio in 2021. As a reminder, our dividend policy aims to deliver sustainable cash dividends while retaining the flexibility to invest and grow in the business in the future, supplemented by additional shareholder distributions if appropriate. In summary, this was another solid quarter for us. A near fivefold increase in pre-tax profits on the same period last year, with good earnings diversity across the group and evidence of strong execution in all areas of strategy. While the results were materially flattered by net release of ECLs, we can see early signs of a broadening recovery in lending, with volume growth translating into revenue growth as our net interest margin stabilises, and growth in fee income across our businesses. Despite uncertainty on the pace of recovery from here we remain on track with all of our medium-term targets, and, with that, our ability to achieve cost of capital returns and to fund attractive growth.

If I can just start with comments you made on the risk cost outlook in particular as we head into 2022, given the current economic outlook, could there be a scenario that risk costs could also undershoot the 30 to 40 basis points through-the-cycle range as we head into 2022, just considering the management overlays still in place? Related to that, one thing in terms of how we should think of scope for capital return. I know there are comments in the presentation about the potential for a step up in capital return. I think the dividend guidance is clear. How should we think about the scope for potential buybacks? Is that becoming increasingly a possibility, particularly as we head into 2022, and is that a key instrument in terms of how we should think about getting that common equity tier one ratio back to a level of 14 to 14.5, which is the target range? Thank you.",True,0.0,0

So on ECLs in 2022, I talked about earlier of having $2.4 billion of stage one and stage two reserves that we built up from last year still in place. That’s around 60% of the reserve built up we put in place last year. We do think that that will unwind, or – to the extent that that unwinds it will unwind over probably the following four quarters, so there will be some benefit into the first half of 2022. I don’t think that we’ll begin to normalise on expected credit losses at this point until the second half of 2022. On capital distributions – and I’ll give a slightly fuller answer, given that I’m sure that there will be several questions around this – relative to the comments I made at the start of the year around our capital position and capital distributions, I think sitting today we are in a stronger position relative to what we thought. We’ve seen a much improved credit outlook. It’s our second quarter of reserve releases and an expectation that we’re going to continue to see additional releases over the coming four quarters. We’ve also had much lower credit rating migration than what we thought, leading to lower risk-weighted asset growth relative to what we thought a few months ago, so our common equity tier one ratio today is stronger than where we thought we’d be and the outlook is better. We know that we’ve got some known knowns in terms of capital headwinds. Software intangibles, which is around 25 basis points of benefit, we expect to get removed from the beginning of 2022. If you look in combination, I think there’s around about 10 basis points of aggregate hit from the sales of our French and US Retail Banking franchises that will impact us into 2022 and 2023 and we’ve got various regulatory-driven uplifts of around about $40 billion uplift in risk weighted assets over the next 18 months. But equally, we know that we’ve just accrued under our accrual policy 17 cents of dividend versus the 7 cents that we’ve just declared and we’ve still got at least $25 billion of RWA reductions in our RWA run-down programme. We are committed to paying a sustainable and healthy dividend while continuing to progressively normalise our common equity tier one capital position over the next 18 months. Buybacks will be one way for us to think about normalising and using our surplus capital and we’ll continue to keep buybacks under review in the coming quarters. And I would note that that tonality is different to what we said in previous quarters. As you’ll recall, at full year we said that we wouldn’t contemplate buybacks this year. We’re now saying that we’ll keep it under review.",False,0.0,0

A couple of questions from my side as well. Perhaps one just to follow up, Ewen, on your comment. How would you define surplus capital for HSBC? I’m conscious you’re talking about potential for growth opportunity, after a very long period of time, coming back onto the table and obviously you do have a very strong capital positions with writebacks to come, but also potential to deploy that capital. So it’s quite difficult from the outside to understand how much might be structurally excess surplus capital, so any thoughts on how we could go about doing that – that would be helpful. The second one is just to come back to the comment around NII stabilisation. If I look at some of the moving parts within that – the HBAP NIM down three basis points in the quarter, again the UK NIM is down three basis points and quite a few of your UK peers are talking about NIM pressure to come. And there’s 9 billion-odd of IPO funding here in Q2 as well. So I was just trying to understand what gives you the confidence that NII has finally stabilised. Is that more driven by the fact that you’re seeing this card balance pickup and you think that’s probably likely to be NIM accretive loan book coming down the pipe or is there something in these Q2 trends that’s perhaps overstating the pressures? Thanks.",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210803-interim-results-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,2,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"So on use of capital, firstly, obviously we’ve got organic growth. I think we’re still sticking to our target of mid-single digit loan growth over the next coming quarters into 2022 and I’ll come back to that in terms of where we’re seeing that growth. We also have been public about the fact that we are thinking about a number of small bolt-on acquisitions, which are almost exclusively centred on the Asian wealth space and I would use the word ‘bolt- on’ quite carefully. We are not looking at anything material, but in aggregate we are looking at three or four opportunities in the wealth space across Asia at the moment. I think our distribution policy as it relates to dividends is very clear. The 40% to 55% payout range – as I said, for this year I think you should expect us to be at the lower end of that range because of the unusual benefit that we will have had from the ECLs this year and then buybacks on top of that. So I think you can do the maths and know what we’re solving for. The only thing that you won’t have on that is the bolt-on acquisitions, but if you think of three or four smaller bolt-on acquisitions of, say, $0.5 billion each – will help in relation to that maths. On net interest income stabilisation, I think we’ve seen HIBOR now broadly stabilise. If I look at second quarter of this year, the average one-month HIBOR rate was nine basis points. I think in Q3 so far it’s been around eight basis points, so we are troughing now. I think if you look at the underlying growth, we had $16 billion of loan growth in the second quarter. You can take about 9 billion of that away for the Hong Kong IPO loans. You can add back three because we shifted the US portfolio that we’re selling into held for sale and there was probably up to 5 billion of GBM run-off – Global Banking and Markets run-off in the loan portfolio, particularly in the non-ring-fenced bank. So we think we grew the underlying loan portfolio by about $10-15 billion, which is about 1% to 1.5% growth in the quarter, which is 4% to 6% growth for the full year, which is very much in that run rate that I talked about. You’re right that there may be some modest income pressure in the UK, but I think you saw this quarter in the UK lending growth more than offset any decline in net interest margin and we continue to remain confident about our ability to grow faster than peers in the UK, particularly in mortgages.",False,1.0,0

I was really going to push you a bit more on the dividend policy. I think you’ve explained it fairly well now that, obviously, if we see a big increase in – I see the consensus payout I think this year is 50%, but it sounds like you’re going to see earnings beat because of the very low impairment number and, therefore, you’re going to let the payout ratio drift down towards the bottom and, I guess as things normalise, the payout drifts back up again. This is just not really just saying you’ve got a progressive dividend policy. I’m just wondering do you actually need this target payout range. What purpose does that serve now? Should we just be thinking you’re looking to maintain a progressive dividend, which you can increase each year? And secondly, I was going to also focus a little bit onto the NII guidance and whether the fact that you’re not specifically talking about NIM is indicative that you are expecting now more NIM pressure and it sounds like you are, but again, I wonder if you could talk to that relating to signs of maybe slower growth in Asia. Maybe it’s going to take longer for interest rates to normalise than we thought only a month or two ago. I wonder if you could just talk to that as well please. Thanks.",True,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210803-interim-results-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,2,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Firstly, on dividend policy, I don’t think we’ve said that we have a progressive dividend policy. We’ve said that we’ve got a 40% to 55% payout. I think obviously we’re conscious of the market’s desire to have a progressive dividend policy, but it's not an official part of our policy. So we would expect, having said that, that we would ideally like 2022 dividends to be higher than 2021 dividends. So in the first half of this year, again, we accrued 17 cents versus the 7 cents we declared. We had an EPS of 36 cents in the first six months and we paid out 7, so we’ve paid out just under 20% of our earnings in the first half. So mathematically we do expect a more substantial payout in the second half of this year and we would anticipate that 2022 dividends should be higher than 2021 dividends without committing to a progressive dividend policy. On net interest income, I don’t think we’re going to see in aggregate much NIM pressure from here. Equally, I’m loath to call the bottoming out of NIM and you know I hate forecasting it for you, but I do think the combination of any relevant NIM pressure from here coupled with stronger loan growth means that we are close to getting back into a cycle now of seeing net interest income grow – and I think certainly by the time we get into 2022 we’ll definitely see net interest income grow, given NIM will definitely have I think stabilised by then. And on rates, again, relative to where we were six months ago where our planning position was that we were unlikely to see any policy rate rises probably until the very back end of 2023 or more certainly 2024, I think we’re much more enthusiastic now that we may begin to see policy rates rising led by the UK from mid-2022 onwards and certainly 2023 benefiting materially from higher policy rates.",False,2.0,0

We’re not having to trade margin to get that volume growth. There is one area where there is a lot of activity and that’s UK mortgages, but even there the margins we’re generating on UK mortgages are above the back book margins, albeit they’re slightly lower today than they would have been three or six months ago. But they’re still well above the back book margins. So we’re not seeing a trade-off on margin for new business relative to volume in any significant degree. And then on dividend policy, I just want to remind you we put the dividend payout ratio at 40% to 55% because we wanted to get the balance right between distributing capital to generate a decent return for our investors, but also retaining sufficient capital to fund future growth and future opportunities and to the extent that those future growth opportunities are not there, either organically or inorganically, then we’ll consider buybacks or capital return. But if we do see growth, then we have the ability to fund that growth through retention of capital and our previous policy probably didn’t get that balance right.

I’ll take that or certainly the first one. On Wealth bolt-ons, we’re clearly looking at pan-Asia. We believe we have good organic growth opportunities with the platform we have in Hong Kong and, therefore, Hong Kong would be primarily organic growth. We’re organically investing in China to grow our Wealth business there and we’ve given you the plans for that – recruiting an additional 3,000 people over the medium term with already 600 done in the first – up until the first half this year. If you’re looking at, therefore, where the bolt-ons are likely to be, they’re likely to be rest of Asia. In terms of capabilities, we’re looking at both product and distribution capabilities to accelerate our organic growth plans there. We’re willing to invest organically in the rest of Asia, but if we can find some bolt-on acquisitions that can accelerate those organic investment plans, that would be helpful. We are looking at three to four as we speak and they are a combination of product and distribution capabilities being acquired in areas such as insurance, high net worth wealth management and asset management, so those would be the primary areas of focus. On mortgage growth, Ewen can fill you in a bit more on that, but just for clarity, our share of mortgages in the UK was below our natural footprint share of customers in the UK and what we’re doing is rebuilding to a more natural mortgage market share to match the market share of customers we have in the UK and the banking market. So yes, we’re taking market share from others, but it’s to rebuild to where we believe we should be more naturally positioned.",False,3.0,0

If you look at our current account market share by value – and we’ve got a more affluent customer base – we have about a 13% to 14% share of current accounts. Our stock share is currently 7.4% of mortgages. We are and have been consistently growing our flow share in excess of our stock share. We grew flow share around 8.5%, 8.6% in the quarter – about 100 basis points higher than our stock share. And why are we able to do that? Partly, it’s because if you went back a few years, we didn’t have established broker distribution, which as you know, is around 70% of the market in terms of distribution. Over the last few years we’ve fully built out broker distribution and we’re sitting on a lot of excess liquidity in the UK business, which went up even further during Covid. We think the returns on new business are highly attractive, so I think you should expect us to continue to target higher growth in the mortgage market if we can continue to take share of the type of margins that we are currently seeing.",False,3.0,0

Just firstly on costs, you flagged the step up in variable pay this quarter, but your full-year cost guidance is unchanged, so I’m just trying to understand if that’s just a timing issue in the variable pay or whether the mix of the costs in your full-year guidance is perhaps slightly different to what you first thought. That would be the first question. Second question on Wealth – if I look at life insurance manufacturing, investment distribution, the life insurance manufacturing number obviously has some benefit from market movements. That makes up quite a big chunk of the revenue contribution this quarter. If we were to strip that out, do you think that’s a more normalised base level this quarter?

Not all of that increase in variable pay is a timing issue. Some of it is an increase in the variable pay accrual relative to what we thought, but yeah, the mix shift I think, Andy, is because we had anticipated in the second half that there were various line items that we would begin to see a return to normalisation from Covid that we think is going to be much slower than what we previously anticipated. So, generally costs associated with running the bank, like travel, printing, office premises and the like I think are going to run a few hundred million lower than what we previously anticipated for this year, which offsets a slightly higher accrual into the variable pay pool, so that’s why we’re still confident and committing to the flat cost target. On Wealth, I think, you have to bifurcate between the domestic Hong Kong business and what you see there is actually the Hong Kong business is doing okay and better than in previous quarters. And effectively, the international business, particularly the mainland China business, which continues to be significantly impacted because of the closure of the border – we don’t expect that border to reopen until Q4 at the earliest, so I wouldn’t describe this quarter as a normalised quarter for insurance.

Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of follow-ups – the first one was on margin. Mix has been dilutive to NIM given the strength in secured. I just wondered when you think about your loan growth and the 1% and 1.5% quarterly underlying and that being consistent with your expectations going forward, within that we should be assuming it’s still going to be tilted slightly more towards secured. We can then obviously keep an eye on rates and other factors to come to a judgement on NIM, but just helpful to think about how much of that loan growth just to flow through into NI growth. And then just going back to distributions and timing, you’re at 15.6% now; RWA growth in the second half looks like $10 to 20 billion, so 20, 30 basis points of capital drag. Dividend, of course, should be much lower in the second half unless earnings surprise to the upside, so it feels like capital shouldn’t move an awful lot in the second half, even pro forma for the accrual.

Presentation Transcripts\2021\210810-fixed-income-call-transcript interim.pdf,HSBC,2021,2,Carlo Pellerani,Group Treasurer,"Hi, everyone. This is Carlo. I’m joined today by Richard O’Connor, our head of Investor Relations; and Greg Case, Head of Debt Investor Relations; together with Richard Boyns, Head of Capital Management. I joined HSBC in March after about nine years at UBS. I know a few of you but I’m looking forward to meeting the rest of you hopefully in person soon in the future. In my first few months at HSBC, I have found the organisation to be full of opportunities. We have a tremendous franchise, and that is also true in the financial resources space, which is the bread and butter of what we do in Treasury. We have a very strong set of resources, and one of the key opportunities for us in the future is to look at how we optimise across all of these. I’m sure you will have spent the last few days going through our results, so what I plan on doing going to refer to any of the slides. So today I’ll speak a little bit about the quarter, our strategic delivery and our financial resources. So first, on the quarter, as you saw, we generated a pre-tax profit of $5.1 billion for the quarter, $4 billion up year on year, and that included a release of $300 million of ECLs taking the year-to-date ECL release to $700 million. And as a reminder, we still retain about $2.4 billion of the ECLs we had built out during the post-COVID period. Second, in terms of strategy, we are making very good progress across all the four priorities that Noel has set out, which as a reminder, were to focus, to digitise, to energise and to transition. You will see in the announcement from Monday’s pages across all four, so we’re very, very happy on how that is progressing. Alongside that, we are well on track to meet the financial resource commitments that we had made, including the reductions in cost and RWA. In terms of financial resources, we have increased our loans by about 2% for the quarter, driven both by mortgages and higher trade finance balances, and our deposits have gone up by about 1% in the quarter. In terms of capital, we continue to have a very, very strong capital position. Our CET1 ratio is 15.6% – we have the declared an interim dividend of 7 cents per share for the first half of the year, and we remain very comfortably above MDA - by 4.7 percentage points. In terms of liquidity, we also have a very, very strong liquidity position. We have about $850 billion of gross HQLA across the group. You will have seen that we have announced a technical adjustment in our calculation of our LCR that is takes the ratio down to 134%. The calculation adjustment reduces the ratio by about 10 percentage points and the methodology is intended to better capture transferability challenges of liquidity across the group, but just to stress that still represents a significant surplus of liquidity across the group. We have over $200 billion of surplus HQLA across the different entities of the group. And finally, to talk about funding, in terms of AT1, you would have seen us in the market issuing about $2 billion of AT1 in year to date. We have also redeemed $2 billion, and this is in line with the guidance that we have provided in – broadly expect us to issue for refinancing. We have no additional plans for AT1 at the moment. Tier 1, likewise, we have very limited interest in that instrument for the moment, and you shouldn’t expect us to be in the market anytime soon. In the MREL space [senior holdco], our guidance for the year is $15 billion, as it was at the beginning of the year. You will have seen we issued about $7 billion during the last six months, INTERNAL and you would have seen as well that we have started to venture in some of the locations that we haven’t in the past. We had inaugural transactions in both HKD and in CNY. Diversification is something that we will deliberately continue to pursue, with the aim of trying to take a little of pressure off the most natural markets, in particular the USD markets. This issuance takes our MREL ratio to 30.6%, significantly above our 28% or so requirement that we have. And finally, from an OpCo perspective, subsidiaries have very little funding needs, and OpCo issuances will continue to be relatively rare. So just to wrap it up before we open for questions, we feel that this was another solid quarter: good earnings diversification across the group, and, perhaps more importantly, making very strategic progress on all our medium-term goals. On that note, we can open up for questions. Q&A",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210810-fixed-income-call-transcript interim.pdf,HSBC,2021,2,Lee Street,Citi,"Hello. Good afternoon, all. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I’ve got a couple for you, please. Firstly, as the new treasurer, you talk about ‘lots of opportunities’. Do you have any thoughts on what HSBC could do to make itself a bit more efficient, or what potentially might change or be different under your stewardship? Secondly, Pillar 3 capital instruments disclosures – you’ve got quite a few instruments that only work as capital until June of 2025. Any thoughts on to what extent are they a serious impediment to resolution after June of ’25, and are there any fixes to get around that? And then finally, I suppose on a similar vein or similar theme, you’ve got quite a lot of operating company or HSBC Bank plc Tier 2 paper. I think I’m correct in stating that this obviously that won’t work for MREL after this year-end, but still works as Tier 2 from a capital perspective, so any thoughts around how efficient that is for you as a form of capital instrument as one looks ahead? They would be my three questions. Thank you very much.",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\210810-fixed-income-call-transcript interim.pdf,HSBC,2021,2,Carlo Pellerani,Hsbc,"Thank you, Lee. So from an opportunities perspective, when you look across all the financial resources – capital, liquidity, funding, and also NII – what you can see is that historically, HSBC has had significant surpluses across all the metrics, so what we’re trying to do is to make sure that the financial resources are fully deployed and aligned with our strategy, so we are putting a strong spotlight on each of the resources, and we are looking systematically at having too little resources or too much resources, and trying to have the best deployment for all of those. I can give you an example if you are interested in each of those, but one that perhaps is most obvious is on the liquidity side. As I mentioned, we have $200 billion-plus of surplus liquidity across the group. A lot of that liquidity is not necessarily a bad thing. If you receive surplus deposits and those deposits are not costing you, it’s not necessarily a bad thing, but then what happens is those deposits in some entities generate capital requirements. If those entities are leveraged constrained, in other entities you have MREL requirements that are also leverage requirements, so there is a cost to those deposits even if they price at zero, so what we’re doing is we’re putting a spotlight on all the resources. We’re making sure that those operate adequately for each of the businesses and each of the clients that are providing them, and then we’re trying to find the best way of aligning them to the strategy of the Group. On your second question on let’s call it ‘legacy instruments and resolution’ - this space is of course extremely complicated, and the way I would describe it is there are three dimensions that have to be taken into account simultaneously. One is the regulatory dimension. You would have seen, of course, comments by the Bank of England and PRA about it. We are in communication with them. Obviously, I cannot comment on this private discussion, but that is an ongoing communication. I would stress that this is not a space, from a regulatory perspective, that is black and white necessarily. Remember that, when those instruments were issued, they were fully compliant, and somehow their rules are changing, so that is a discussion we’re having with a supervisor and a regulator. Second, there is of course the practicality dimension. We need to see what is the practicality of potentially dealing with those instruments. The most challenging example perhaps is the New York law instruments where there isn’t a magical solution that we have found for them. INTERNAL So there are practical considerations that are perhaps challenging for us to affect change in those instruments. And then finally are the economics of these transactions. Some of those economics are relatively easy for you from the outside to understand. Clearly, we have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders, and we will look to act economically over time, but some of the dynamics are a bit difficult to observe externally because, depending on whether we have or not hedged those instruments, whether, to the extent that we have hedges, those are hedge accounted or not, the economics for us internally may not necessarily be the ones that you’re expecting externally. So long story short, you have a triangle with those three dimensions, and depending how these dimensions align, then what we will look to do. I can’t comment on the discussions we’re having with the supervisor and regulator. You will see us making a statement during June next year when this is public. We’ll make a self-assessment on resolvability this coming October. And on your third question, yes, I guess at the moment that an instrument stops qualifying from a regulatory perspective, and it changes, if you want, in the stack, then of course the economics of that instrument change, so to the extent that you had an instrument that was more junior, that drops from the stack, then you need to look at the pricing of that instrument in the context of replacement – more senior instrument, so that will be taken into account together with the practicality of potentially affecting that instrument in the market at all times.",False,0.0,0

That’s helpful, and just one quick follow-up there – you suggested the discussions with the PRA that are ongoing, they’re private; I fully understand. Did you say the first that we would hear back would be June next year, or would you expect to, for example, in your Pillar 3 capital instruments disclosed at the year-end, to disclose the ultimate treatment – just because my understanding was this all needed to be wrapped up by the year-end when the grandfathering period ends, so what would be your best guess on when you first might be communicating back to us on all of this?",True,0.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2021\210810-fixed-income-call-transcript interim.pdf,HSBC,2021,2,Violeta Baraboi,Societe Generale,"Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you very much for having this call. Three questions on my side, if I may – the first one would be the China-Hong Kong political situation. Has there been any commercial impact? We haven’t heard anything about it on the equity call, and there have been things in the press about state-owned companies reducing activity with HSBC, if you could give us a bit of colour on that. Then the second question is about your NPL ratio. So currently, we have it at 1.8% in Stage 3 and it’s unchanged this year to date. Do we think that they’ve already peaked, and if not, when do you think that this ratio might peak, and how far are we away from that peak currently? And then the third question is about Stage 2 NPLs. They’re still quite elevated at 15% of the book, and we’ve seen with other banks that most of them have seen reductions in Stage 2, and for some, that there have been significant reductions. Therefore, the question is: are we going to slowly track back to ’19 levels, at around 7% to 8%, or do we think it’s going to stay elevated for a while? Yeah, that’s it on my side. Thank you very much. RICHARD O’CONNOR, HSBC: Thanks, Violeta. It’s Richard O’Connor here. I’ll start with all three and let Carlo chip in. On the first one, the China-Hong Kong situation, clearly nothing much to say. You’ve seen the Hong Kong and China results for the last 12, 18 months. They’ve been highly respectable. We’ve at least maintained market share, had yet another good mortgage performance based on credit performance, and we’re taking market share in Hong Kong. Ditto in Mainland China: good growth in the book there, heavy investments in the wealth business is showing early signs of bearing fruit. We’re not going to comment on any individual INTERNAL one of them, be them state-owned or other, but we’re on a very good pipeline of deals and transactions, including from the government on bond issuance in China. We’ve also won licences, a fintech licence, the first foreign fintech licence – and we’re looking to expand particularly that wealth franchise, as we said, into five more cities. So results are very solid, customer engagement very strong, very resilient results, and economically you can see that Hong Kong and China continue to perform well, despite some challenges from Covid that we’ve seen in the last week in China, unfortunately, and hopefully that situation improves. So yeah, we continue to invest heavily, and the business continues to perform well. We obviously want to perform even better. That’s why we’re investing more heavily in the business, and those investments are showing good signs of traction. We strive for very good relationships with the regulating governments at all levels in China and have very good engagement with them. On the 1.8% Stage 3, I’ll give you two contradictory answers. You saw that the Stage 3 charges in Q2 were very, very low. In fact, they were zero of that $400 million recovery. We don’t think you should expect that every quarter, as we said to the equity analysts. You do sometimes get a bit of bumpiness in our Stage 3 charges, and indeed our Stage 3 balances, but with that, obviously, seeing that Stage 3 NPL being broadly stable, and ultimately not a lot in the pipeline. So with the comment that it can be volatile, we’re hopeful that as economies improve, and over the next 12, 18 months, you do see those Stage 3 balances come down, again with the proviso that, at the early stage of the economic cycle, sometimes you get some late-stage impairments as economies start to come out of difficult economic situations. I’ll just give you one example. Obviously, in the UK, we’re seeing people coming off furlough. Companies are starting to pay down effective government debt, so there’s still some incentives out there, but generally you’re seeing Stage 3 NPLs very stable, and we’re hoping they can touch down from what’s already a very respectable level over the coming courses. I’ll just correct your names on Stage 2. It’s not Stage 2 NPLs; it’s Stage 2 balances which, as you say, are quite high at 15% of the book. They did come down slightly in Q2, and again, we would expect that to continue if, as we all expect, the economies recover over the coming quarters. It’s difficult to compare banks on a like-for-like basis because we certainly do quite a lot of overlays when we look at Stage 2 balances, so I personally wouldn’t compare each bank by bank. Look at the trends. Look at the commentary. Look at the overall condition of the book, and the condition of our book is good. It’s been very, very solid through the last 12, 18 months, and we expect that to continue, and net-net would expect the Stage 2 overlays to reduce, but each bank has a slightly different methodology, and we think our Stage 2 overlays to get to that 15% are higher than some of our peer banks.",True,1.0,0

So the MREL requirements for us, as you saw, is the most binding of three dimensions: the RWA, the leverage requirements, or the sum of the parts. At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, we see both the leverage requirements and the sum of the parts being equally binding. If you decompose the sum of the parts into its components, then you will see that, in each of the different resolution groups, leverage is also one of the important drivers so, even if you get to a position where leverage in aggregate didn’t become binding, it might be binding in the sum of the parts, bottom-up calculation. So you almost need to do the calculation bottom up and then try to figure out what it is. Of course, when you are at the margin of where we are, the sum of the parts or leverage is the most binding, then perhaps there is a little bit of stickiness to the calculation.

We like to call ourselves an ‘MPE-plus’ group. What that basically means is that the group issues MRELs top down and distributes to the entity, but the fact that we have three resolution groups – at least in theory, that could be advantageous from a resolution perspective, because it gives our supervisors an optionality that perhaps other groups do not have, and the optionality is to either hold the group together or to resolve it as three separate groups. At least at the beginning, in that hypothetical resolution scenario that ensues, holding the groups together has a big advantage because you preserve value, you avoid chaos, it’s better from a systemic perspective and from a market-wide perspective, and then it buys you time to allow you to extract the most value to the group and to minimise the impact that it may have into the system. Then in terms of – if that is the target point, then the question is, what is the advantage or disadvantage in going either SPE or purely MPE, if any? And then do remember that there are a lot of parties involved in this discussion, their interests in each of the different regions, so at the moment, we have a situation where potentially everyone has the best possible solution because there is optionality.

So in the case of the US, we are disposing about $3 billion of loans and about $10 billion of deposits with $1.8 billion of RWA. So from a specifics, that means that basically, all else equal, there is an $8 billion funding gap that needs to be compensated for. It’s not exactly that because there are surpluses and the requirements are different, but that is high-level the way to look at it. In the case of France, it’s actually quite balanced. Customer lending is $25.5 billion and deposits $22.4 billion, so the way it happens is you look at what is being transferred. You look at the resulting effects on all the financial resources plus also on the economics of your natural hedging that you had in place, and then you rebalance, but there isn’t anything meaningful coming out of both of them. There isn’t anything significant from a debtholder perspective to mention. The only thing I would point out – that it would be our intention to try to move the covered bond programmes to the buyers in France.

So I think you need to look at it in the context of the entity or entities concerned and the fact is a) it’s good news that we are exiting these mass retail operations, but we’re not exiting France or the US – remain substantial economies. We invest heavily in both. There is very strong connectivity with the rest of the group based on multinational business, Wholesale and Markets business in both, obviously Paris being the centre of our Eurozone activities and the US being INTERNAL the biggest capital market in the world.

We cannot quite discuss specific bonds. So what are the things that I could say that are helpful? I think the first thing is just to restate what you said – if the security locally doesn’t have regulatory eligibility, so, of course, going back to what I was saying earlier, the economics of the security has to be assessed against the replacement cost of a more senior note and hence a cheaper note. Having said that, the spreads on those securities are relatively cheap. It gives you long-term optionality. So the way to think about it is, to the point you’re making, you assess the surplus liquidity you have, you assess what are the additional expectations you have, in time you try to project that, and then you decide whether there is any need for this security or indeed there is a value in keeping it.

Ewen is going to take the bulk of the call today and he will do that in future Q1 and Q3 announcements. For today though, let me start by saying that I’m really pleased with our third quarter performance. We’ve had a strong quarter of profit generation across all regions, supported by another quarter of net ECL releases, but most pleasing is the underlying revenue growth we’re now seeing across the business. We feel that we’re turning the corner on revenue after absorbing interest rate impacts over the last few quarters. We’ve got strong fee growth in all businesses. In Global Banking and Markets, revenue is starting to stabilise and that’s against a backdrop of a large managed reduction in risk-weighted assets and lending balances, as we indicated back in February 2020. In terms of customer behaviour, we’re seeing a strong deposit performance without any material drawdown on the liquidity that we built up over the last two years. The lending market was softer than we anticipated in the quarter, particularly in corporate loans, but the pipelines that we built up position us well for when companies start investing in both the recovery and the low-carbon transition. On capital, as our revenue starts to normalise, we’ve also looked to normalise our capital position. Capital returns to shareholders will be a big component of this and I’m pleased to announce a share buyback of $2 billion, which we expect to start shortly. On our strategy, we’re executing with exactly the kind of pace I promised in February. We’ve made some important announcements in the quarter, including the acquisition of AXA Singapore. This complements our existing Singapore business very well and accelerates the build out of our product and distribution capabilities in one of the world’s most important wealth markets. Pre COP26 we’ve been working incredibly hard with clients, governments and our industry peers on accelerating the low-carbon transition. We’re working with a range of partners to finds new ways to open the sustainable finance market for projects and investors. A fortnight ago we announced a pioneering partnership with Temasek to create a debt financing platform for sustainable infrastructure in southeast Asia. This, I believe, provides an important model for others to follow. This is just one of a number of sustainability partnerships that we hope to announce in the coming weeks and I look forward to updating you on those shortly. In terms of the financial industry’s contribution, the taskforce of international banks that I’ve been privileged to chair over the recent months just released a guide for banks on setting and delivering net zero targets. This is an unprecedented collaboration and makes an important contribution to help all banks operationalise the targets they’ve set, and, importantly, to bring consistency and coherence for our customers, regulators and investors. I’m really excited about the months ahead. There’s real dynamism and optimism within the business and we’re focused on delivering growth in the areas we targeted. With the added benefit of interest rate rises on the horizon, we’re in a strong position moving into 2022. With that, I’ll hand over to Ewen to take us through the detail.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2021\211025-3q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,3,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks Noel and good morning or afternoon all. We had another good quarter. Reported pre-tax profits of $5.4 billion, up 76% on last year’s third quarter with an annualised return on tangible equity of 9.1% for the year to date. Adjusted revenues were down 1% on last year’s third quarter, but up 1% excluding certain volatile items, with a welcome return to more consistent top-line growth across most of our business lines. Expected credit losses were a $659 million net release – our third quarter in a row of net releases, with net releases for the year to date of some $1.4 billion. We still retained 31% of stage one and two ECL reserve buildout we made in 2020. Operating expenses were broadly stable. Increases in investment and technology spend were offset by the impact of our cost-saving initiatives, but due to some inflationary pressures, ongoing investment into growth and additional costs due to the impact and timing of recently announced M&A activity, we now expect our adjusted costs for 2021 and 2022 to remain broadly stable at around $32 billion, excluding the UK bank levy. Lending balances were down by $6 billion or 1%. This was due to the repayment of $14 billion of short-term IPO lending in Hong Kong. Stripping out the impact of the IPO loans, lending grew by $8 billion or 3% annualised during the quarter, with further good growth in mortgage lending and trade finance. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was up 30 basis points at 15.9%, primarily due to a reduction in risk-weighted assets. We now intend to reach our target for common equity tier 1 of 14% to 14.5% by the end of 2022. This will reflect a combination of some regulatory-driven RWA impacts, balance sheet growth and capital return. Today’s $2 billion buyback announcement is part of this commitment to accelerate the normalisation of our common equity tier 1 position. Our tangible net asset value per share of $7.81 was unchanged on the second quarter. Turning to slide 4, we’re seeing good signs of growth returning across our global businesses. In Wealth and Personal Banking, we’ve continued to grow Asian net new money in private banking and asset management. We’ve increased the value of new business in insurance by 59% year on year. We’ve hired 450 new wealth planners in Pinnacle, our new Chinese insurance venture. We’ve kept our UK flow mortgage share comfortably above our stock share and we’ve made good progress on new customer acquisition. In Commercial Banking, we’re seeing encouraging trends in global trade, with good market share growth in key markets, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, and we’ve maintained a strong business pipeline, with $64 billion of new approved limits. In Global Banking and Markets, we saw more stable revenue compared to a strong performance in the third quarter last year, with good revenue growth in both Securities Services and Equities, and GBM’s performance was achieved despite a 7% reduction in risk-weighted assets year on year. Looking geographically, in Asia we’re seeing strong underlying revenue trends. Excluding insurance market impacts, revenues were up 7% quarter on quarter and 5% year on year, and in the UK ring-fenced bank revenues were up 2% quarter on quarter and 6% year on year, with fee income up 25% over the third quarter last year. Finally and importantly, we’re delivering on our goal to be a leader in the transition to net- zero. We’ve helped issue $170 billion of green bonds year to date, including leading on a number of pioneering green bond offerings, such as the first UK green gilt, and we’re making good progress against the commitments we made in our AGM special resolution in May. Turning to slide 5 and looking at third quarter adjusted revenues as a whole, in Wealth and Personal Banking headline revenues were down 3% on a year ago, but, excluding insurance market impacts, Wealth revenues grew by $145 million or 7%. This was mainly due to higher fee income in asset management and private banking, together with insurance sales growth. Personal Banking revenues fell by $31 million due to the continuing impact of low interest rates on deposit margins. Commercial Banking revenues were 4% higher, driven by higher fee income across all products and growth in trade lending and deposit balances. In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were down 3%. This was due to slower customer activity in fixed income markets versus a strong third quarter last year. However, Equities benefitted from both higher client activity and volatility in Asia and Securities Services grew due to higher fee income and assets under custody. Slide 6 shows the revenue trend quarter on quarter, with growth in all three global businesses, excluding insurance market impacts. This has been driven by a combination of more stable net interest income, together with good fee income growth across all our businesses, up 10% year on year. We’re increasingly confident that we’re turning the corner on revenue growth. Commercial Banking has grown, Wealth and Personal Banking has grown in Wealth and stabilising in Retail Banking, and Global Banking and Markets is close to that inflection point now that the bulk of its planned RWA reductions in the business are now complete. With the expectation of policy rate rises from 2022 onwards, we’re now confident in seeing sustained revenue growth for this coming year and beyond, which together with strong cost control will help drive a sustained improvement in core returns and operating jaws. On slide 7, net interest income was $6.6 billion, up 2% against the third quarter of 2020 on a reported basis and broadly stable compared with the second quarter of 2021. On rates, the net interest margin was 119 basis points, down 1 basis point on the second quarter, primarily reflecting changes in balance sheet mix and continued weakness in HIBOR. Lending volumes were down on the quarter, but, excluding the repayment of IPO loans, lending grew by $8 billion, with continued good loan growth in mortgages in Hong Kong and the UK, together with the ongoing growth in our global trade franchise. For 2022, with our net interest margins stabilising, policy rate rises on the horizon and loan growth building, we’re increasingly confident on the outlook for net interest income. On the next slide we reported a net release of $659 million of ECLs in the quarter, compared with an $823 million charge in the third quarter of 2020. The net release was across all our global businesses, reflecting a more stable economic outlook, together with stage three charges that remain very low. Despite the net releases, we continue to retain a conservative outlook on risk. We still hold $1.2 billion or 31% of our 2020 COVID-19 uplift to stage one and two ECL reserves. For the full year, we now expect net releases to be broadly in line with the net release in the first nine months, with perhaps a very modest net release in the fourth quarter after stage three charges. For 2022, we continue to expect the ECL charge for the full year to be lower than our medium-term through the cycle planning range of 30 to 40 basis points, with more modest ECL releases expected to continue into the first half of 2022, albeit with an expected net charge after stage three impairments. Turning to slide 9, third quarter adjusted operating costs were broadly stable on the same period as last year. A $263 million increase in technology spending and a $340 million increase in investment and other costs were offset by a further $600 million of cost programme savings compared with the prior year, with an associated cost to achieve of $400 million. To date our cost programmes have achieved savings of $2.6 billion relative to our end 2022 target of at least $5 billion in cost savings, and cumulative cost-to-achieve spend to date has been $3.1 billion, with an intention to still spend $7 billion through the end of 2022. In terms of outlook, with some inflationary and performance-related pay pressures, ongoing investment spend and additional cost due to the impact and timing of recently announced acquisitions and disposals, we now expect 2021 and 2022 adjusted costs, excluding the UK bank levy, to be around $32 billion. This is relative to our previous FX adjusted guidance of $31.3 billion for 2022, which included the bank levy. Turning to capital on slide 10, our common equity tier 1 ratio was 15.9%, up 30 basis points in the quarter. This reflected a decrease in risk-weighted assets from lower short-term lending, favourable asset quality movements and FX, partially offset by a decrease in CET1, including around $1.7 billion for foreseeable dividends. Excluding FX movements, risk- weighted assets fell by $14.4 billion in the third quarter, driven by lower short-term IPO loan exposures in Hong Kong and positive movements in asset quality. In the third quarter we made a regulatory deduction of 20 basis points for foreseeable dividends in the quarter. This was based on 47.5% of our third quarter EPS of 18 cents, which is the mid-point of our 40% to 55% target pay-out ratio. The dividend accrual for 2021 so far is $3.8 billion after payment of the 7 cent per share interim dividend. Please remember that this is not guidance of our full year 2021 dividend intentions. The dividend accrual is purely a formulaic calculation that we’ll true up at the full year based upon the results and outlook at the time. When thinking about the pay-out ratio for 2021 we’ll attach a much lower rate to unusually low ECLs as part of our EPS this year, together with a desire to see higher dividends per share in 2022 relative to 2021. We intend to normalise our common equity tier 1 ratio over the coming quarters to be back within our 14% to 14.5% target range by the end of 2022, driven by a combination of balance sheet growth, capital returns and regulatory impacts. Various things to note for your capital modelling through the end of 2022: we expect today’s buyback announcement, the loss and sale of our French retail banking operations, and the reversal of the current software capitalisation benefit to each impact our common equity tier 1 ratio by around 25 basis points and we also expect some $20 billion to $35 billion of regulatory-driven RWA uplifts in 2022. So, in summary, this was another good quarter. Good earnings diversity across the group, a broad base return to top-line growth in most of our businesses and continued strong control on costs. While the results were flattered by net ECL releases, we’re happy to be turning the corner on revenue. With robust lending platforms, growth in trade and mortgage balances, and the likelihood of earlier pipeline rate rises than previously anticipated, we’re increasingly confident on the revenue growth outlook for 2022. We’ve included a few IFRS 17 slides in the appendix. We intend to go through this in more detail on our follow-up call on Wednesday for sell-side analysts. Overall, we expect an initial downside adjustment to our Insurance profits of around two thirds and a smaller percentage adjustment to insurance’s tangible equity. Importantly, there’ll be no significant impact on the group’s regulatory capital and there’ll be no impact on the dividend flows from our insurance businesses to the group. Despite inflationary cost pressures and the impact of IFRS 17 implementation, we remain confident in achieving returns at or above our cost of capital over the next three years, together with delivering attractive growth and attractive capital returns. Finally, we’re looking to normalise our common equity tier 1 ratio over the coming quarters, of which today’s buyback announcement is an important first step. With that, Sharon, if we could please open",False,-1.0,1

I’ll start with one on the buybacks and then one on costs. So when you come out and quantify the $2 billion-plus buyback, can you just give us the metrics that you’re using to size that, how you’re thinking about this buyback but also buybacks going forward, and basically the KPIs and the decision- making process on the magnitude of those? The second question is on the cost outlook, where you’ve slightly changed your guidance and also the definition you’re using. I think versus your old guidance it’s $31.5 billion and then, adjusting for the levy, it looks like you’ve taken up the cost guidance by about $800 million. So can you just give a breakdown of what the moving parts are in the increase? How much of it is due to the timing around the M&A and divestments versus how much is inflationary pressures and how much is higher compensation related to performance-related pay? Thank you.",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\211025-3q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,3,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, so on buybacks, Andy, as you would expect, it’s part art and part science. Our capital position is obviously in a much better place than we had anticipated at the start of the year when we had said, ‘No buybacks for this year’. We’ve had a combination of much higher profitability than we expected because of much lower ECLs – net releases – and lower cost-to-achieve being expensed through the P&L. And risk-weighted assets have also been lower than we anticipated, partly because of lower growth, but also because of lower credit rating migration. Wiithin today’s announcement is a commitment to get back to 14% to 14.5% by the end of 2022. We are committed to using excess capital if we can’t find attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We’ve previously talked on inorganic about wanting to spend up to $2 billion in M&A. We’ve announced a deal in Singapore – AXA Singapore – for just over $500 million, so that will give you some colour of the extent of M&A activity that you might see over the next year or so. I do think that we are likely to see, if we achieve what we think we’ll achieve next year, some further buyback activity in 2022. On costs, I think your numbers are broadly right if you add about $300 million for M&A. In terms of the roughly $0.5 billion and upwards pure cost, the bulk of that is compensation related and, you’re right, part of it is variable pay, but I would put it all in the bucket of compensation costs being higher. Broadly, our total wage bill is about $19 billion out of the $32 billion of total costs, so 2.5% is about $0.5 billion of extra compensation cost. Whether you put it into fixed pay or variable pay, I think we are seeing sustained wage growth pressure globally at the moment, but in terms of the incremental amount that we’ve put into the variable pay pool this year, it’s significantly more than offset by the increase in profitability that we’ve seen.",False,0.0,0

And, clearly, we’ve given some indications on our view of trading performance next year being positive and it would be right to have an appropriate level of variable pay at that point in time. In the event that that trading performance next year does not materialise, then we have some flexibility on the variable pay, but it’s right to also signal that there’s some fixed pay inflation pressures in the market generally within financial services at this point in time. So the extra top up on cost is a combination of fixed pay and variable pay as a consequence of the external environment and the trading performance of the bank.",False,0.0,0

Just a quick follow-up on costs and then one on revenue. You mentioned, Ewen, about $300 million of the increase guidance is M&A related. Can you give us an estimate of how much that M&A activity might add to the revenue over the next two to three years, just to get a sense? And then, just on revenue, you’re clearly more positive on the revenue outlook. You’ve flagged a number of areas. You didn’t really comment, I don’t think, on the outlook for the net interest margin. I look at your consensus and it only has an increase from Q3 right out to the end of 2020, so you have about 7 basis points. And if I just take your own rate sensitivity and multiply it by what’s being discounted by the market, there’d obviously be a multiple of 7 basis points. I wonder if you could comment on the outlook for NIM specifically, please. Thank you.",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\211025-3q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,3,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks. So on costs, look, in the near term I think AXA Singapore will add about $300 million to revenues and $300 million to costs. Obviously, we would expect that picture to move over time, but if you plug in $300 million into 2022 on the revenue side. On NIM, you know I’m at pains not to provide a NIM forecast, but if you looked at current consensus it does look low, relative to the consensus policy rate rises that we now see in the markets. Just as a reminder, our biggest single sensitivity is the UK, where a 25-basis-point rise would add about $500 million of income in the first year, and secondly, Hong Kong. It does look like, in the UK, we will see two, three rate rises between now and the end of 2022, coming potentially as early as the next month or so. Hong Kong may be a bit slower, but one of the clear offsets to the guidance we’re giving on cost today is the fact that we do think we’re going to see earlier and stronger rate rises than we’ve previously anticipated. We lost about $7 billion over the last two years or so, as a result of the shift down in interest rates, so it’s had a very, very material impact on us. We do think, with the policy rate outlook at the moment, a consensus that we should start to claw back a meaningful amount of that in the next two to three years.",False,1.0,0

Maybe firstly, just staying on the revenue line, I just wanted to understand the pandemic impacts that are still washing through your various businesses in terms of holding back the revenue lines. I was wondering if you could comment on the Wealth business in Hong Kong in light of all the travel restrictions, how you think the performance in this quarter has been held back and how that might shift over the next year or so. Also, in trade, obviously you’ve flagged a very strong improvement in trade balances, but there’s a lot of uncertainty around, clearly, what’s happening with trades, so any thoughts on the outlook there would be helpful. Then just a broader second question on China real estate. Thank you for the disclosure. I think we all get your first-order impacts and exposures are relatively limited, but I was wondering what you think about the second-order impacts on your business in the mainland, given defaults have spread beyond single name into quite a few developers now. How do you see that impacting the rest of your book and the rest of your business?",True,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\211025-3q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,3,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Maybe I’ll start off, and then Noel, you can add some comments then on trade and commercial real estate after I’ve finished. On Hong Kong, with the border being shut, you can see some direct impacts on things like insurance franchise. We’re not as exposed to others like Pru and AIA to the mainland Chinese insurance market, but it is a meaningful kicker to the performance of our insurance franchise in Hong Kong. Having said that, I think the value of new business in Q3 was in line with Q3 pre-pandemic. You can see certain sectors in Hong Kong continuing to suffer. The biggest border is the Hong Kong- mainland China border, rather than the international border for Hong Kong, given that pre- pandemic about 50 million mainland Chinese were visiting Hong Kong in any given year. We would expect, as that border progressively reopens – and it’s been much slower than we would have anticipated six or nine months ago – that we will just see an incremental benefit coming through to the Hong Kong business. On trade, despite supply chain disruptions, I think we’re pretty pleased with the recovery that we’re seeing in that business. People are holding higher working capital balances at the moment, consistent with the uncertainty that exists in supply chains, but we do view that as a temporary feature of the global economy at the moment, and that we will get back to more normality and more sustained growth in 2022. On the China real estate market, we’ve just been through, as you would expect, a pretty intensive review of our Chinese real estate exposure, including the provision we’ve got against it. Just to repeat what we’ve said today, we’ve got no direct exposure to red list borrowers. We’re pretty comfortable with the exposure overall. In aggregate, our commercial real estate in China is less than $20 billion in the context of a trillion-dollar loan portfolio. I think the other thing you should read in, Raul, is the fact that we’re doing the buyback today, and the size that we’re doing it, is that we’re reasonably confident about where we’re sitting in terms of our outlook. Noel, I don’t know whether you want to add anything.",False,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\211025-3q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,3,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Ironically, on trade there is a feature that the more uncertain global economics are is normally the time when trade finance is in demand, because of uncertainty over the supply chain and uncertainty over the credit environment. We’ve seen strong growth in trade balances. Part of that is a function of economic rebound. Part of that I think is a function of working capital cycles are longer today than they were pre-pandemic because of the tensions in the supply chain and the bottlenecks. Part of that is people tend to use documentary credit more in uncertain times than open account, and therefore they turn more to the financial services sector to finance trade in a structured manner rather than financing trade in an unstructured open account methodology. The fourth ingredient is, frankly, that we are taking market share in trade in Asia in particular, particularly Hong Kong and Singapore. Those four dynamics, I think, are leading to very strong double-digit growth in trade. I think if you look at our trade balances from the end of last year to the end of September we’re up around about 18%, 20%. If you do a year-on-year comparison, September to September, I think we’re maybe in mid-20% growth in trade, particularly in Asia. It’s those four factors, I think, that are playing into the trade performance. On China, the only other comment I’d make is there is second-order risk in whenever there’s a market adjustment of that size taking place in a particular industry sector, particularly one as important as commercial real estate. I think we’re pretty comfortable with our position and we’re staying very close to any potential second-order risks, but I’ll reinforce what Ewen said: we feel comfortable with our position in our bank in China. It’s performing well. It’s had a good nine months, and we’re well positioned on commercial real estate from a primary risk point of view. We think we’re well positioned on any second-order risk, but I’d be foolish if I said there was no second-order risk. It potentially exists for all of us.",False,2.0,0

You gave us some data in the second quarter about credit card balances growing, but I haven’t seen it so far this quarter. I wonder if you could talk to us about what you’re seeing in unsecured. You mentioned within the NIM that there was a negative mix shift which hurt the NIM. At what point will that mix shift change? As unsecured consumer starts to grow, presumably you’d start to see a positive benefit. Any colour you could provide around that would be appreciated.",True,3.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\211025-3q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,3,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Firstly on NIM, two things were going on, I think, to push it down by a basis point in the quarter. Firstly, HIBOR drifted down by a couple of basis points over the quarter. We do hope we’re now at the trough of that, but – and there’s a mix shift with both a higher propensity of lower spread mortgage lending, and the fact that we’re continuing to increase our liquidity of reserves at the moment. The unsecured was probably up about $1 billion underlying in the quarter for both – across Hong Kong and UK, and about half and half across the two markets. What we are seeing is credit card spending come back up closer to pre-pandemic levels, but what we’re not seeing yet are the balances go up in line with that. I think that should happen over time, but at the moment, whether it’s commercial customers or personal customers – and we’re seeing the same thing in UK mortgages, for example – people are paying down debt when they can, and I think that’s just a sign of confidence at the moment that we would expect to continue to improve as we continue to move away from the depths of COVID.",False,3.0,0

You gave a bit of colour that quite a lot of the optimism is coming from the higher expected interest rates in some of your markets.

With NIM stabilising we’re probably going to see about 3% loan growth this year. We would expect mid-single-digit low growth next year, so you would expect a healthy increase in net interest income next year with or without rate rises. We’re seeing very good growth on fee income as we come out of COVID. I think it’s up 10% year- on-year. Yeah, the core business at the moment is seeing very good, attractive growth. Interest rate rises will just come on top of that. In terms of where we’re growing, Noel said earlier that we’re taking share in trade. We’re up a couple of percentage points of share over the last year, both in Hong Kong and Singapore. We’re continuing to grow the UK mortgage share above stock share. I think we were about a percent ahead of stock share in the quarter. We’re growing the private bank, I think ahead of peers, particularly Credit Suisse in Asia at the moment.

The first one was back on costs, and then one on RWAs. So on cost, Ewen, you briefly alluded to it before the previous question, the link with the interest rate outlook. How much is the new guidance intertwined with market inflation and interest rate expectations? Or, to put it another way, if policy rates don’t move higher in line with market expectations should we expect you to come in lower than that guidance? The second question on RWAs: the consensus is nearly $70 billion higher by the end of next year than where we sit today. I appreciate that there’s some regulatory headwinds on the horizon that you’ve flagged, and you’ve now delivered the majority of the gross RWA saves that you’re guided to by the end of next year. Do the market RWA expectations, I think of $900 billion next year, look a little too conservative, given the starting point and what you’re seeing currently in terms of lack of credit migration?",True,4.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\211025-3q-2021-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2021,3,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"On cost, yeah, they are connected, but not a direct line between the inflationary pressure that we’re seeing coming through the cost structure and the fact that we expect to see earlier policy rate rises. To give everyone assurance, we are actively managing our cost base in line with what we previously thought. We’re still committed to taking out $5 billion of costs over the period to the end of 2022, and we’ve done just over half of that so far. But, on a $19 billion wage bill, if you see each percentage point is another $190 million of cost. Relative to where we were at the start of the year, we’re definitely seeing more inflation. The offset for that should be policy rate rises coming earlier and stronger. If they do, that will comfortably offset the inflationary pressure we’re seeing on costs, but we are not going soft on costs just because we think that there is a potential of rate rises. That’s not how we’re operating the business. On RWAs, I think we’ve given you pretty much all of the inputs to model. I guess we’re more confident on the RWA growth outlook, lending growth outlook for next year, than I think’s currently in consensus. We’ve got it to mid-single-digit loan growth. We’ve given you the impacts on regulatory capital. You can plug in your own numbers in terms of – we’ve given you our distribution policy on dividends, so the only things that you don’t have is what the profitability is going to be next year, what buybacks we’re going to do, and even on inorganic we’ve tried to give you a steer as to the total quantum of financial inorganic that we may do as well.",False,4.0,0

I’ve got a few questions on rate sensitivity, please. I was hoping you could give some colour around deposit betas in your rate sensitivity disclosure, especially for the UK and Hong Kong, given one of your peers reassessed their UK rate sensitivity based on a more realistic assumption of what deposit betas are likely to be, and any colour that you can give on the proportion of deposits that are contractually linked to market rates in both those markets would be very helpful.

I think over the longer term typically we work on the basis of about a 40% to 50% deposit beta, but in the very, very short term with the first rate rise, I think it’ll be much lower than that.

Most of my questions have been asked, actually, but a couple of points of clarification. Thanks very much for the IFRS 17 disclosure on the insurance business. In terms of the two-thirds PBT impact that you expect in 2023, I guess that insurance profit that we would be making that adjustment to, are we talking – is it around a $1.5 billion hit that we should be looking for reported PBT in 2023? Any clarification there would be really helpful. And then just a second on the cost-to-achieve. I know you’re sticking with the guidance for $7 billion, but it does imply that actually you’re going to do a lot next year. Could you help us understand exactly why you’ve not been able to spend it so far, and what you are going to be doing next year with that?",True,6.0,0

But just again, just to repeat on IFRS 17, there’s no impact on dividend flow from the insurance companies to the group. There’s no impact on group common equity tier 1. The timing of earnings recognition has changed, so fundamental economics we don’t think has changed. The other thing that – on tangible equity, just because I know a few people have been playing around with numbers today, we think there’ll be about a $3 billion plus or minus impact to tangible equity as a shift, and that RoE then will be negative but minimal, and it’s still tied in with our commitment to get back to cost of capital returns. On CTA, I think – we’ll think we’ll probably spend about another $1 billion or so in Q4, which leaves us about $3 billion or so to spend in 2022. We did have a slower delivery this year. A big part of that was a lot of our change programs are being run in India, and they obviously had a pretty severe impact as a result of the pandemic, which meant that our hiring plans, particularly technology resources that we intended to bring on board, have been slower. There’s been about a three-plus month delay to some major programmes of work, and it’s one of the reasons why, as a result of that, we expect costs to tick up in Q4, because we’ve got this ramp-up in investment coming into Q4.",False,6.0,0

Could you talk us through how interest rates are actually hedged in the various markets, maybe just the UK, Hong Kong and US? And then – so will they actually see what sort of rates – do you actually need the short rates to go up in all of those countries, or will you benefit from higher rates in the market in some and not others?

The US is slightly longer than the five years, albeit I think that will change once we divest ourselves out of the retail banking business. It’s not as material, obviously, as Hong Kong and UK.

The bit I don’t really understand is when I look at the currencies, if I look at your year one sensitivity, your sterling sensitivity is materially higher than your Hong Kong sensitivity, yet your sterling is the bit that’s hedged, the Hong Kong isn’t, and yet the total balances in Hong Kong are – well, orders of magnitude similar, but I guess if anything it’s slightly higher in Hong Kong than they are in sterling.

Just a very quick follow-up on structural hedging. One of your peers has announced its intention to deploy structural hedging a little bit more, just changing, I guess, some of the assumption on the stickiness of certain deposits. Is their scope – just based on your comments that Hong Kong is very short-dated, 40% of Hong Kong deposits are in US dollar ‒ would there be scope to reassess some of those deposits and take a view maybe similar to the UK, that deposits have a behavioural majority of five years? With that, could this be a source for additional income going forward? Secondly, on capital, first of all, thank you for the 14 to 14.5 guidance now for 2022. Just in terms of thinking about the quarter one trajectory and the end of scope for capital return for HSBC going forward in the medium term, should we use this 14 to 14.5 as a range going forward, or is there scope for capital to achieve lower?

The choice that we have always made is not to run currency risk to extend duration. There’s probably a low hundreds of millions opportunity in the next few years through improved management of our liquidity book. We’ve recently hired, a few months ago, the group treasurer out of UBS to come and run our treasury business. I think over the next two to three years we’ve probably got a few hundred million dollars of upside in terms of how we’re managing our global liquidity pool. On capital, I would use the 14.5 over the next few years. I think our aspiration is to run it towards the lower end of that range, if we can. As you think further out, there’s obviously the impact of output floors and what that does, depending on where they’re applied and the impact on capital positions of subsidiaries, etc, that we’re going to have to pay attention to to get below 14%. We’ve got a big programme of work to step up our capabilities in stress testing. I think our peak-to-trough fall in stress is still too high, but that will be a multi-year programme of work to improve stress testing and then go after the higher-risk stress areas of the bank where we’re not getting remunerated appropriately.

I’m joined today by two individuals that need no introduction: Richard O’Connor, Global Head of Investor Relations, and Greg Case, Head of Debt Investor Relations. I’m not going to go through the slides that we posted nor going to give a very long speech. I’ll limit myself to making a few highlights about the results and then I’ll go through into a bit more detail on the financial resources and tangible, quite helped by the release of ECL provisions, but we have some very good earnings diversification with all the regions being profitable. Revenues grew by 2% in the quarter and we have given the rate environment more confidence on a positive NII trend, and you will have seen that we have announced that we are now flagging a 10% return on tangible for 2023 onwards, one year earlier than previously planned. In terms of balance sheet dynamics, we had $38 billion of loan growth across Wealth and Personal Banking and commercial banking and, as well, we had $24 billion of growth in deposits for the quarter. Our credit quality remains good. We had low stage three charges and you would have seen that our stage three loans represent about 1.8% of the total loans and they have been stable at that level. We have now released about 85% of the Covid reserves that we had put on during 2020 and we have $600 million of those still remaining. We are expecting our ECL charges to normalise somewhere around the 30 basis points during 2022. You will have seen that we took some charges on China CRE and we have given you some slides in the document and some more information where you can see our exposure and details around those. Turning to financial resources, taking each of them in turn, first from a capital perspective, our capital ratios continue to be quite strong. 15.8% CET1 ratio at the end of the year, dividends of 25 cents and we have announced a new $1 billion buyback on top of the up to $2 billion that we had announced in the last quarter. As a reminder, we have flagged that we are planning to be back within our target range of 14-14.5% CET1 ratio from this year onwards. From a liquidity perspective, liquidity continues to be super strong. LCR of 138%, but that of course masks the surplus liquidity we have in all the subsidiaries, which gets deducted from the HQLA ratio, so if you were to take into account that, the total HQLA ratio that we have as a group is $880 billion. We continue to pursue initiatives to increase the returns and the efficiency of the excess liquidity in addition to our desire to increase our customer lending book. MREL ratio, very, very healthy at the end of the year. Please note that our requirements have actually gone down by 170 basis points on the back of the UK leverage computations, which affect both the leverage base requirement, but also the sum of the parts given that a lot of the entities are leverage constrained from an MREL perspective. From a funding perspective, we have been until now in a building-out phase of our MREL stack. We have ended that phase and we are now getting into a refinancing and rebalancing mode of the stack, so we should be expecting pretty much zero net Senior HoldCo issuance for the year. We are flagging about $10 billion from a gross perspective. We aren’t likely to be in the market for AT1 this year. We don’t quite have much of a need. Of course we reserve the right to be in the market should we think that’s appropriate. We are conversely planning to return to the tier two market. We have been absent from the market for about five years and you will have seen that we are saying that we are planning to have around $4 billion of issuance for the year and we have added some disclosures in terms of our legacy capital stack and some update on our position on IBOR. That’s all I wanted to say. So, in summary, a very strong year. Return targets have been brought forward by about a year. Improved rate environment which gives you a nice tailwind. Capital, funding and liquidity positions are all very, very strong. Net issuance substantially down on prior years and our MREL stack now at a steady state.

Thanks for taking – thanks for doing the call and thanks for taking my questions. So I have three for you. Firstly, just on the slide 21, the fixed income slides, we’ve had a fair few questions about how the infection risk works that you highlight there. To me it doesn’t look like there’s anything new, but could you just clarify exactly how that works? Secondly, as you highlighted, you’re returning to the tier two market. I think you flagged about $4 billion of issuance. Obviously you’ve got a significant volume of operating company tier two still outstanding. A lot of that isn’t going to work any longer. I guess the question is: why wouldn’t you look to do some form of liability management? And then, finally, on additional tier one, you highlight limited needs.

In terms of tier two, yes, you’re right, we have a number of tier two outstanding that have lost some value and some of those that will lose value in the future. Liability management is always one of the potential options that we have. We will look at each of those in turn. We will continue to look at all options available.

I also want to focus on the legacy area because there’s quite a lot of interest there. Just focusing on the legacy tier one and noting your comments, I can see that they’re not MREL or capital. Can you just help me with the rationale for leaving these bonds outstanding, given the CET1 headroom you’ve got and what they’re costing you? And are these bonds swapped? So could they – could the interest rate be hedged when you come to do – potentially do a May call? The second question I have just goes back to your point on de-recognition from an infection risk point of view. I had understood that EBA guidance is quite clear that you can’t do this unless you call, change terms or LME to mitigate the infection risk. So my question is: is the UK’s approach different to the EBA’s? Has the PRA, I guess, rolled over and let you take this treatment? I’m just a bit surprised to read this. And then, finally, just on the resolvability assessment framework, can you just help us to understand the timeline? So have you submitted all your information? When do you expect the results and do you expect to be told the PRA stance before the public disclosure in June? Thanks.",True,0.0,0

On the legacy securities, so when we’re assessing the legacy securities that are outstanding, we always look at, if you want, three different components, and the blended result of those three components drives whether we will be making any – taking any action on those securities. Those components are first of all the regulatory requirement. We are in ongoing discussions with the regulators around those. Maybe we’ll get more information around midyear about those, but it’s fair to say that the regulatory treatment of the legacy securities is not black and white. I mean, there are shades of grey there in all sorts of securities. I would note that some securities are particularly challenging and that includes near loss securities where, as you know, even if we wanted, it would be impossible to pretty much eliminate a full stack. So the point I’m trying to make is this is not black and white. Obviously, from a regulatory perspective it would be better for those securities to not be there, but given the complications and all the different components, I think the regulatory treatment tends to be a little bit greyer than that. The second component is of course yours and investors’ interest. We are a long-term issuer in the market and we want to have a long-term constructive relationship with investors and, as such, we will take those interests in mind. But finally, and very, very importantly, we look at the economics of those securities, and the economics of those securities, as an outsider, outside from the firm, is not totally straightforward for you to see how those economics play out because you need to look at the accounting treatment that we have for those securities internally. We need to look indeed as to whether we have those securities hedged, or unhedged from an interest rate perspective. We need to look at what is the optionality value of those securities for future funding, like for example we have at the moment in the case of the DISCOs. So there is all sorts of economic components, that affect whether those securities are or not in our interest, to be called. I’ll leave it at that but that’s basically drives whether we would or not call some of those securities. In terms of hedging, we’re not going to comment on individual hedging, on individual securities, but, likewise, we shouldn’t assume that we have hedged them all. In terms of de-recognition, I think you pretty much – you answered it in your question. It is the UK rather than then the EBA approach. From a UK perspective, we can deal with that by voluntarily de-recognising the securities. That is an acceptable way of dealing with infection risk in the UK. And in terms of the rough timeline, we submitted our self-assessment last year. We have been in contact with the Bank of England and PRA. They have sent a number of questions, on the back of those we actually sent an update to that a couple of weeks ago in line with everyone else in the market, and the next step of the process is midyear, just in June, there is going to be a public disclosure made by both the Bank of England and ourselves on the status of that assessment. I guess we’ll have to wait for that one. Obviously we will have discussions with them ahead of that in terms of what is it that we’re going to be disclosing, and we’ll be aligning communication.",False,0.0,0

Just following up on one point, then another subject. You mentioned the DISCOs. If you were to leave those outstanding, how would they be categorised within the liability stack? And then, two other questions. One, you made a large provision for real estate in China. Could you talk about the Hong Kong real estate market and if there’s going to be any need for provisions there given the economic slowdown and the moves we’ve seen of personnel out of Hong Kong? And then, third, on UK mortgages, swap rates moving much faster than you could probably reprice mortgages, so could you talk about the impact on your margin for the next couple of quarters on that? Thanks.",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2021\220224-hsbc-fixed-income-call-2021-annual-results-22-02-20-final.pdf,HSBC,2021,Annual,Carlo Pellerani,,"Yeah. Thanks, Robert. So, in terms of the DISCOs, they de facto become senior debt, and that is senior debt that is actually not that expensive. So the DISCOs are LIBOR plus 10 to LIBOR plus 25 perpetual funding. So we looked at them in the context of, you know, funding value. Most of the DISCOs are issued out of a non-ringfenced bank, which is an entity which is naturally in funding need long term, so having that optionality is actually quite valuable, so that is how we look at the DISCOs. In terms of China CRE, yes, I think the segment of the China CRE that is most impacted is the offshore segment. We have exposures to that segment in Hong Kong. We have about 11.6 billion of exposure there. About half of that book is in what we call ‘enhanced monitoring mode’. The other half is investment grade and better. So there is always a chance that we get, you know, more impact. At this stage we have reserved what we think is appropriate for where we are. I just note that we have mentioned that we are expecting that we would be returning to around a normalised 30 basis points of provisions for the year. That 30 basis points include as well any foreseeable impact that we can at this stage see on the CRE market. Having said that, of course the situation is fluid and we will continue to look at it. If you were to look at developments this year, there seems to be a little bit more support for the China CRE market coming in terms of commentary and some of the dynamics in the market, but, again, trying to predict that ahead is treacherous, so I think we will have to see how that develops. RICHARD O’CONNOR: Could I just add one thing? Clearly, the property companies you’ve read about, about having liquidity and other issues, are mainland China property companies [much of which, as Carlo said, the exposure is booked offshore. The question was very much more, I think, about Hong Kong incorporated public companies who have been – we’ve had a very strong relationship with for decades. Tend to be very well-resourced, very conservative LTVs, the Hong Kong property market has been very, very resilient and indeed still very, very good prices for clearing in both commercial and residential property market in Hong Kong, so clearly we keep an eye on all our portfolios, but the issue is really at that mainland China offshore market at the moment.",False,1.0,0

The swap – I mean, a lot of the mortgages in the UK, of course, are fixed, and the dynamics of the swap markets are slightly different to the dynamics on the short end, so yes, it is quite possible that that market will continue to have a little bit of competitive pressure. It is a very, very competitively priced market. We continue to originate new mortgages at returns that are higher than our cost of capital. So at the moment we are comfortable with those mortgages, even at the compressed spread, but of course it is something that we will keep an eye on. I don’t know, Richard, if you want to add anything. RICHARD O’CONNOR: Yeah, the other thing is, clearly, the market tends to look at mortgage prices in the newspapers today versus swap rates today, but clearly there’s a lag between swap rates either moving up or down and companies themselves moving mortgage prices. We don’t move it every day. Clearly we move it on a regular basis, but there’s always a lag between mortgage pricing going up and down versus swap rates, so just bear it in mind that swap rates have moved and interest rates have moved dramatically in the last six weeks, but just bear in mind there’s normally a lag there before mortgage pricing starts to reflect that.",False,1.0,0

We will look at all of the above. In terms of DISCOs, yes, I think the only similarity between the Hong Kong securities and the ones who are non-ringfenced is the type of instruments. The two are very different because the legal entities have very different needs. You could say that our Hong Kong entity is less of a natural funding need entity than the non-ringfenced bank, and also from a regulatory perspective the Hong Kong DISCOs are no longer counting from a regulatory perspective, so we don’t treat them the same.

We went from a NIM, I think, of 158 basis points in 2019 down to 120 last year. If you think about the path back, sterling rates are going to be higher than where they would have been in 2019, but we do think over the next couple of years you’ll see a very rapid recovery in NIM and a further boost into 2024 as well, given the annualisation effect and if you look at our interest rate sensitivity tables.

On your first question about the interest income path from about 2015, 2016 through 2019, as I think we’ve taken you through, there are a number of one-offs that were impacting this. Firstly, we sold Brazil, which was about a $2 billion impact. Secondly, we were still running through the run-off of Household, the sub-prime portfolio. In 2015 we still had over $20 billion of sub-prime, earning a yield of about 8%. We had currency movements. We had customer redress. I think if we backed all that out, net interest income grew by about $4.6 billion between 2015 and 2019. There are also some other structural issues – ringfencing was set up at that time. That did two things. The ringfenced bank had a lot of trapped liquidity, which we weren’t able to redeploy quickly. And secondly, it meant that we had to refinance a lot of the liquidity – the absence of liquidity in the non-ringfenced bank with quite expensive wholesale funding. And then we also had a lot of MREL financing over the time too. So I think we had to replace about $55 billion of debt in that period with MREL and we had to, on top of that, issue about another $25 billion of additional MREL. So I think when you do all those numbers together, Manus, I think you get to about $7 billion or so of net interest income growth over that period rather than the flat that you see in the actual numbers.",False,6.0,0

Are there any offsets to your rates sensitivity that you’d call out in terms of the asset side of the business? UK mortgages might be one in terms of a negative mortgage churn. Is there anything else that you’d encourage us to think about that might clip that quite strong rate-sensitivity? The second would be about wealth management. You’ve got your double-digit revenue aspiration, your revenue CAGR aspiration. But I think that was pre the impact of IFRS 17. Sorry if I’ve missed it in the various updates, but I’m interested in your updated expectations for that, perhaps post the impact of IFRS 17. Presumably this year it is going to be hard to deliver on that double digit, but maybe some of that strategic investment comes through next year? The last one was a question on ring-fencing. There were the preliminary findings of the ring-fencing review. I thought some of the conclusions were quite interesting – they rejected the idea that it had a distorting effect on operating conditions in the UK around liquidity and mortgage competition.

I think ring-fencing has had a heavily distorting impact both in retail banking and wholesale banking. It’s created trapped liquidity in the UK and it has undermined the profitability of UK wholesale banks by cutting them off from a natural source of liquidity that existed previously within the ring-fenced banks. So, we were quite strong in our submissions into that inquiry that we felt ring-fencing had net net – look, we understand the reasons why it was imposed, but we do think that all of the post-financial crisis additional measures that have been brought in to regulate banks mean that ring-fencing is not needed anymore, but it’s here to stay. On wealth, we didn’t give any updates on IFRS 17. We are planning to have a session in the third quarter, but what we have disclosed today is data that we think it’ll have about a two-thirds impact on reported profits, and so the year-one tangible net asset value will go down by about $3 billion. Costs will be lower, but effectively that is a contra-revenue line item, but I would work with the IR team, if you want to check your numbers. RICHARD O’CONNOR: We’re clearly going to be rebasing to IFRS 17, but that 10% aspiration in Asia is still very much intact but you have to rebase downwards in year one, but certainly the volume growth and the asset-management growth and all those working assumptions behind it are absolutely unchanged in the medium to long term.

So the first one is that data sensitivity assumes static balances, so, to the extent that there are migrations of products then that would affect that number. Second, to the point you were making, you may have some impact on margins on the asset side. The UK market is an important one, as discussed. If the market becomes very competitive, potentially you could have some compression on the margins on the mortgage side. And the third one is also – remember that NII sensitivity does not take into account trading assets, so to the extent that, in particular in dollars, we are, from a treasury perspective, lending to the trading desk in dollars, that lending increases as the sensitivity of rates moves is not reflected in that number. So there would be an increase in trading revenues that is not reflected in the NII line, so maybe look at what is NII in order to orient your calculations. RICHARD O’CONNOR: I’ll just say that our asset sensitivity – we assume, obviously, quite high pass-throughs on the asset side, but one of the answers to Manus’ question on why you didn’t see it in NII last time was because we did see very strong UK mortgage competition as we went into ring-fencing. Clearly, you are already seeing that, so it is up to you to model whether it gets any worse from here, but certainly that was one of the impacts last time around; we saw quite strong UK mortgage competition. We grew our mortgage business very successfully during that time period and continue to do so, but generally the asset pass-through sums are as you would expect them to be.",False,7.0,0

Of course, the assets are priced out of a swap rate, which is a long-dated rate in the UK for sure, whereas the moves we are seeing are particularly on the short end, so I think you need to look at those dynamics a little bit more, in more detail than the disclosure that we gave you.",False,7.0,0

A couple of questions from me. First of all, I just wondered whether you could talk about what you’re seeing in terms of loan demand out of Hong Kong in particular this year and whether that’s been impacted by what’s happening at the moment, and also maybe the pace at which you might see that pick up later in the year. And the second question is, you’ve got some experience now of Pinnacle and you’ve got an increasing number of relationship managers in place.

Presentation Transcripts\2021\220228-fy-2021-equity-analyst-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Post-Results Sell Equity Analyst Meeting,Ming Lau,,"On loan demand on the wholesale side, I would say term lending, similar to last year, has been relatively muted. The positive so far has really been on the trade side, so, when you look at trade volumes, trade financing, the recovery on that had picked up through 2021, and through January the trade-financing volumes are still at all-time highs. On the residential side, we had seen some good volumes come through on residential mortgage originations, albeit, when you look at what’s happening in the short term on Omicron and the lockdowns and so forth that are happening, clearly that is dampening some of the residential property sales volumes. So I’m expecting that first half residential sales volumes will likely be weak, but, hopefully, Omicron and the fifth wave is quick and we’ll come out of this in the second half. On Pinnacle, it’s still early days. We’ve got up to about 700 personal wealth planners. Broadly, in terms of what we’re expecting from sales activity, annual net premiums and so forth from the 700, it’s slightly above where we expect to be in terms of sales, but it’s early days. In terms of competition, I would say it’s noticeable, but I would say the market in China is big enough that there’s enough market share for us to grab - it looks on track, but extremely early days at this point. RICHARD O’CONNOR: Just on term lending outside of Hong Kong, actually notably many of the sites in our network have seen slightly better term lending trends outside of the UK and Hong Kong. At the moment, UK is still pretty weak, as we’ve seen in all the UK banks’ wholesale lending numbers. Hopefully that picks up during this year.

We set out in the annual report, as you know, Tom, all of our assumptions on BoCom. BoCom doesn’t have the same exposures, I understand, to the China commercial real estate market that Bohai did that led to the impairment of the value-in-use calculation of Bohai. We’ve set out all of the assumptions. If we were ever to need to mark to market BoCom because the value-in-use calculation dropped, the first $10 billion or so of that impairment has a very negligible impact on capital.

EDWARD FIRTH, KEEFE, BRUYETTE & WOODS: I’m struggling to see how in actual terms Hong Kong opens up, because it seems that the mainland Chinese authorities in particular, not so much the Hong Kong authorities, more the mainland Chinese, are still very strongly pursuing this zero-Covid approach, which I guess is quite markedly different from what we’re seeing everywhere else in the world. I’m just trying to think about how we can think through that actually happening, because as soon as you open up then you’re just going to get Covid back again and then it seems to me there’s going to be a lockdown all over again. So I guess that’s my first question. And then, sort of related to that, last year we were all talking about the border opening and how this was going to be a big jump-up, but it seems to me that your Wealth Management – you had a very good year last year and now we’re having a less good year and the border has been closed throughout all that. So do you think that people have started to work around now some of these hurdles with Covid? Should we still be thinking about the border opening as being a big jump-up?

Presentation Transcripts\2021\220228-fy-2021-equity-analyst-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Post-Results Sell Equity Analyst Meeting,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"For Hong Kong, the issue that I think the Hong Kong authorities – I wouldn’t say ‘every place in the world’ or, ‘they’re on their own’. My home country, New Zealand, I think, has tried for the longest possible time to approach a zero-Covid strategy, much to my detriment, because I haven’t been able to get home. You know, the issue that they’ve been grappling with in Hong Kong - my understanding is – and Ming can correct me – a significant portion of the over 80 year olds haven’t been vaccinated. It’s not an anti-vax thing; they’re just believers in traditional Chinese medicine. And, you know, as of a month or so ago the vaccination rate was something like 20% amongst the over 80 year-olds. We’ve had a similar issue in Singapore as well. So, at the moment, what you’re seeing in Hong Kong is a very rapid increase in that vaccination rate, but the last numbers I heard a few days ago – it was still only up to just over 50%. So I think you need to get that population vaccinated. I think the issue in mainland China might go beyond that into the efficacy of vaccines and maybe needing to get another round of vaccination done in mainland China. So the issues are different, I think, but I definitely think you will have – it will take some time for the Hong Kong international border to reopen. I think what’s more complex is, if you’ve got high vaccination rates and high efficacy of vaccine in Hong Kong and lower efficacy of vaccinations in mainland China, how that mainland China border plays out.",False,10.0,0

So, from a general-population perspective there isn’t really a carrot for the senior population to really go out there and get jabbed. That’s the reality, given some of the risks around the vaccines, but clearly now, with Omicron and the spike in the infection rate, it has really now sparked an acceleration of the vaccination programmes. So, yeah, even in the 80-year-old-plus population now, the vaccination rates are going up pretty quickly. In terms of mainland China, what I would say in terms of when that opens up, I think, clearly, China’s working on developing a mRNA vaccine programme which is more effective globally from what we have seen. And, secondly, at some point the development of a Covid pill will also help contain the severity of Covid itself, so I would point to those to this in terms of development on-shore on the mainland from a reopening perspective.",False,10.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2022\220223-annual-results-2022-fixed-income-investor-presentation-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Annual,Carlo Pellerani,Group Treasurer,"Hello, everyone. Welcome to the HSBC Fixed Income Call for our Full Year 2022 results, thank you for joining us. I’m Carlo Pellerani, Group Treasurer, and I’m joined by Richard O’Connor, Global Head of Investor Relations, and Greg Case, Head of Debt Investor Relations. As usual, I will mention a couple of things on the be referencing any slides as we go through. In terms of results I would like to mention three points. 9.9% ROTE for the year, up 1.6% on the back of higher NII and good cost controls, which more than offset a higher ECL charge. We expect ROTE to grow to above 12% this year. Second, in terms of balance sheet dynamics, the reported loans and deposit numbers need to be read carefully because they include adjustments for the Canadian and French sales and FX. If you include those, loans decreased by $25 billion only in the quarter, and deposits were flat. Finally, credit quality remains quite solid. Full-year ECL charge equivalent to 35 basis points of gross loans. Stage 3 loans remain low, at 2.1% of total loans. At this stage we still see limited signs of deterioration in the loan book, and we’re flagging an ECL charge of around 40 basis points for this year. Now onto financial resources. Starting with capital, our CET1 ratio, as you saw, was 14.2%, which is 80 basis points up in the fourth quarter thanks to profits and lower adjusted RWAs. We are now inside our CET1 target of 14% to 14.5%, and 3.3 percentage points above our MDA requirements. Second, on liquidity, it remains strong, most importantly at the legal entity level. We also reported a 132% group LCR, with total gross HQLA of over $800 billion. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is quite low, at 59%, and hence we have a meaningful deposit surplus which positions us quite well in this higher-rate environment. Our MREL ratio is 30.1%, which compares very favourably to our 26.4% requirement and we intend to continue to operate with a prudent buffer over our minimum. From a funding perspective we expect to issue a similar amount of gross debt to what we issued last year, targeting $17 billion to $20 billion of holdco senior, $4-5 billion in tier 2s, and about $2 billion in AT1s. On legacy capital, good progress in 2022. We reduced the stack by over $4 billion. We will continue to monitor the market for cost-effective options to manage this stack down over time. In summary, a good year. The Group is now becoming very capital generative. Our capital funding and liquidity positions leave us well placed to continue growing, and we believe our business model offers bondholders one of the most diverse sets of revenue streams in Global Banking. On that note, let’s open the call for Q&A. I’ll hand over to Greg.",False,-1.0,1

Congratulations on the results. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three. I just wanted to touch upon the AT1 call, the dollar 6.25%. Was this decision taken on an economic basis? You mentioned before the call that the market wasn’t pricing in the risk of extension, and I guess if I look at your spreads today and also your issuance plan versus your total calls this year it suggests that it could have been called outright, similar to what you’ve done in previous years. On the legacy, could you just remind us of your priorities and whether anything’s changed there? Just focusing on the make wholes, you’ve talked about economics there in the past as well. I’m just wondering if you can guide us to what sort of P&L or CET1 impact you’d be willing to book. I guess I’m looking at the exercises that you’ve done so far, and thinking of one to two points that you’ve paid. Is that reasonable, or should we expect that you’d maybe take a larger hit as a result of the need to get rid of these securities? Finally, just a quick one on LIBOR. Do you intend to use the synthetic extension on your dollar discos post June 2023?",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\220223-annual-results-2022-fixed-income-investor-presentation-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Annual,Carlo Pellerani,Group Treasurer,"Thanks very much for the three questions. On the AT1 call to start, yes, the decisions that we make are on economic terms. Now, the way that those economics are calculated are a little bit more complex than just calculating the PV of the transaction. Broadly speaking, what we do is we take into account three components. One is the PV of a call versus automatically reissuing the full amount. Second, what is the full amount that we need outstanding, and whether we’re going to have a period of time or an amount outstanding to replace that call which is smaller, and as a consequence there is a cost of carry that we are avoiding. Third, it was, ‘what is the impact on the future spreads and the issuance markets?’ When you put all those things into account it’s a little bit of an art rather than a full science. We put all those things together and we come up with the results. You saw on the back of that that we decided to call the transaction. That’s probably all I can say on that one. In terms of legacy, you might remember from previous calls that I described that I think of these in two dimensions. There is a dimension which is how complex the securities are from a resolution perspective, and the second dimension is, ‘what is the cost of taking those securities out?’ When you put those two dimensions together we ended up with a pecking order that has, broadly speaking, four buckets. The first bucket is the holding company Tier 2 securities. Those are in the first bucket because they’re out of our resolution entity, the holding company, and there is a lack of contractual rights of recognition of the Bank of England bail-in rights, so those are the first priorities. Second, we have the non-ringfenced bank fixed rate Tier 2s, then we have the discos and then we have everything else. As you saw, we progressed along the first two buckets last year, and those buckets continue to be the most important and we’ll progress down from that priority list. A third on synthetic LIBOR. All I would say is at this stage the consultation of synthetic LIBOR hasn’t concluded, so we’ll have to wait for that before we can do anything about it.",False,0.0,0

I’ll just read them out, because I think he’s having some trouble joining. Firstly he asks a high-level question. With all the changes in the business model in recent years, which banks do we regard as our main peers? Additionally, what’s the plan for the $4.3 billion of legacy that loses capital value in 2025, and also linked to that should we assume the $4-5 billion of Tier 2 would be a normal run rate over the next few years?",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\220223-annual-results-2022-fixed-income-investor-presentation-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Annual,Carlo Pellerani,Group Treasurer,"Thanks very much, Lee. On the first question, HSBC stands pretty much on its own in the type of business model that we have, so we don’t quite see ourselves having a very comparable peer around the globe. What we do is we look at each of those markets and we compare ourselves versus more local peers with, of course, the caveat that the value of our franchise is actually the international connectivity. It’s difficult, pretty much, to give you a few set of peers that you can compare us against. In terms of the legacy securities losing value in 2025, what we’re doing is we are pre-funding those amounts over the next few years to avoid a big cliff risk in 2025, and that’s incorporated into the four billion to five billion that we are flagging for this year for Tier 2. And then on your third question, looking forward – and I would say this more broadly across all the components of the stack – we are now more or less at a level where the distribution of the different components of the stack are pretty much where we think they should be, and from this point we are about refinancing and financing growth. If you take the current amount outstanding and you divide them in a five-to-seven-year average maturity you end up with an annual amount of issuance which is not that similar to what we are doing this year. That includes also the Tier 2, so somewhere between 3-5 billion on a stable basis every year. Richard, do you want to comment on anything else, especially on the first question? RICHARD O’CONNOR, GLOBAL HEAD OF INVESTOR RELATIONS: On the peers, Lee, it’s a very good question. Clearly we can do benchmarking for our UK ringfenced bank versus our big peer banks, and we do so. It’s the same in what we call GB&M, same in the US, in China, and obviously our home market of Hong Kong versus other large Hong Kong banks, but the short answer is at the group level there’s no one direct peer in trade. We’ve obviously got three or four banks who are also global, but much smaller than us. We’re double the size of number two. For example, in transaction banking it’s basically us and Citi, then you go down to our peers who are a lot smaller than us. You won’t have seen it yet, but just so you’re aware the peer group for remuneration purposes has changed this year, and there are more Asian peers within it. We have made a few changes to peer groups who basically make it Asian-centric as the centre of gravity for the bank moves more to Asia.

First, on net interest margin developments, you’re projecting continued strong growth in the margin, even with a 50% passthrough of an increase in rates. Could you talk about the development, particularly Hong Kong versus the UK? Some of your peers in the UK are seeing peak net interest margin now. Where are you seeing growth in yours? That’s the first question. Second is UK-related again. You have a lot of liquidity at the bank. Any other plans to deploy it in any other way? I know that the easy answer is, ‘If we could, we would have already,’ but anything that changed there? Then finally, on the ECL charge, 600 million for mainland China, 800 for the rest of the book.

Presentation Transcripts\2022\220223-annual-results-2022-fixed-income-investor-presentation-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Annual,Carlo Pellerani,Group Treasurer,"Thanks, Rob. Thanks for the questions. Let’s start with an NII. As you saw, we had NII for Q4 of 9.6 billion. If you annualise that number it gives you about 38 billion of NII. We had a lot of questions earlier today as to what should be our guidance of NII for the full year, and what we have said is we haven’t changed our guidance. What we are saying is that we are flagging more than 36 billion of NII for 2023. The way we think about it is there are a few tailwinds and there are a few headwinds. On the tailwind side, we have still components of the rates that haven’t repriced yet in our books, so that’s a tailwind. There are some potential additional rate moves that are still in the tailwind, and FX calculations gives us about 500 million upside versus when we flagged that more than 36 billion. Conversely, there are a few headwinds. The headwinds are potential increases in pass- throughs. Our pass-throughs so far have been inside the 50% long-term averages. We’re expecting from this point on the pass-throughs to start to become closer to the 50%, which implies more than 50% from this point on. An additional headwind is also on the migrations of clients from savings accounts to time deposit. That is particularly relevant in the Hong Kong market, which is extremely competitive, much less so in the UK market. When you put all those things together we end up with the guidance that we thought of at least 36 billion and more than 36 billion for the year. In terms of the UK market we are starting to see some signs of competition in the UK market, but it is still far from what we see in Hong Kong. At the moment we’re quite confident with the guidance that we have given. In terms of liquidity, indeed, we are a bank that ends up having a lot of liquidity. What we have done over the last few years is we have become very deliberate about our liquidity management, which clearly is helping us in this up-cycle. Having surplus liquidity in this increasing-rates environment is a competitive advantage, but broadly speaking we created a framework to look at surplus liquidity in each of the entities that looks at what that liquidity should be. Then we look at what the surplus in each of the entities is, and then we lay out a framework that looks at how we deploy that liquidity, how do we invest that liquidity, or how do we reduce it if deploying and investing are not appropriate. Deploying is about business opportunities. Investments are at the margin, if you have the liquidity, what you can do without increasing the risk profile for the bank, and then reduction is about offering different products to our clients and potentially finding intra-company solutions. So we put all those things together. We are quite active. I would say, given the current rates environment, that the reduce dimension has become less of a priority than it was when we started this a couple of years ago. Richard, do you want to cover China? RICHARD O’CONNOR: The ECL charges as you’ll expect is a on a bottom-up basis but you’re right, to some extent the $600 million on China CRE is based on a bottom-up view of our particular borrowers and their particular situation and circumstances, and then clearly we then look at it at an overall provision coverage level. Is that sensible? What is the downside scenario? What are peers doing? And so on and so forth. So, as we said this morning, we’re comfortable with that charge as of 31 December and we also said that the situation in that sector has improved since the year-end. It’s still very early days. I think there’s still a lot to work through, but I think you’ve seen a positive policy development in the last couple of months, whereas in Q4 you did see some deterioration. So we’re still very watchful on that sector, but more positive. The rest of the book, not much to say, really. 30 bps, broadly spread. UK, a pretty normal charge. Mexico, a pretty normal charge. Those are our big books. Again, broadly split between retail and wholesale. No big tall trees in there or no big overlays or what are called FEG adjustments, or ‘forward economic guidance’ adjustments. So a pretty standard quarter for the book outside the China CRE 600 million charge, which we called out separately.",False,1.0,0

RICHARD O’CONNOR: We guided at 40 and, as you know, our guidance range is 30-40, so we’re at the top end of that range. That reflects difficult economic circumstances at the moment with high inflation and so on and so forth, some companies going through cashflow difficulties staying in the retail sector. So that’s the reason why we’ve struck it at the top end of the range. Obviously China CRE, as we’ve mentioned already, we’ve been making provisions there over the last 18 months or so. 30-40 is our guidance range and for now we’re sticking at the top of that range, given our caution early in the year and given the difficult economic circumstances which much of the world has found itself in the last few months.",True,1.0,0

So from Rob Thomas at T. Rowe Price, Rob asks, ‘Outside of China CRE, are there any areas of particular concern that you’re monitoring closely?’ and also, ‘Can you update on the progress of the sale of the Canadian business? How is this transaction to occur and what’s the timing?’ RICHARD O’CONNOR: On the first, as you would expect, our two big books are our books in Hong Kong and the UK. Clearly in Hong Kong it’s the Hong Kong books’ China CRE which has been the issue. The book outside of that has been very, very, very solid and remains so during 2022 and so clearly, whilst we’re obviously watchful of the market – it’s a big market for us. It has had economic difficulties in the last year. Touch wood, it seems to be coming out of those difficulties with reopening pretty strongly. Albeit it’s still early days there, but certainly all the signs are positive in terms of Hong Kong recovering during 2023 and beyond. And then our other big book is UK and, again, it’s really we’re watchful on the small businesses and small and mid-size companies in the commercial sector, some of whom have cashflow difficulties. As you’re aware, a fair chunk of the small business market is government guaranteed but, even there, we’re obviously watchful. So those are the areas we’re really watchful. Elsewhere in the world I suppose it’s the idiosyncratic credit risk. In a particular company, in a particular sector, you can get one or two of those each quarter, but I would say those are the major points which we’re watching at the moment. In terms of Canada, nothing to add to… when we’ve just announced it a month or two ago. We’re working through the regulated processes, as you’d expect, and that’s on track with nothing more to say. I would expect us to give you a more fulsome update on where we are in the process probably at the half-year. We continue to think that it will take much of 2023 to work through all of the various regulatory and other processes we’ve got to work through.",False,1.0,0

Another question submitted via text has come from Paul Fenner-Leitao from SocGen. I think, Paul, we’ve covered your first question, but on the other two, ‘Specifically on stage 2, a big jump in total balances but no change in provisions. Why is that?’ and also, ‘What can we expect for the remainder of the year?’ Paul notices the jump is in retail, but you would have thought that corporates would have been the most volatile in the stage 2 balances. RICHARD O’CONNOR: Yeah. It’s a methodological change on UK mortgages. Nothing to flag. It’s just a methodology change. UK mortgages do perform well for us. It’s a very solid asset class, so really – and it’s explained in our Report & Accounts in more detail. It’s more of a technical change than anything else. I wouldn’t flag anything there particularly of concern. The book continues to perform very well for us. And nothing much to say, again, in stage 2 in wholesale. Obviously you’ve seen some of the China CRE book go from stage 2 to stage 3 during particularly Q4, but also some in Q3 as well, but nothing else to call out there in terms of anything more than normal quarterly volatility in the wholesale stage 2 area.",False,1.0,0

Ellie says, ‘I noticed that your AT1 issuance plan is $2 billion and is less than total redemptions for all the AT1 calls you have this year.

I’m really delighted that we’re in Hong Kong today for our interim results announcement for the first time since the COVID-19 virus struck the world. I’m here today with Noel and Ewen. They will take you through the presentation shortly, and Noel will then lead the and investors face to face, and I’m very much looking forward to meeting with our Hong Kong shareholders tomorrow. We have always greatly valued their feedback and engagement and we look forward to seeing them in person. There have been reports in recent months about ideas for alternative structures for HSBC. The board has been fully engaged in examining these ideas in depth, and we will continue that thorough examination. Noel will discuss this in more detail during the presentation. The board firmly believes that, as these results clearly demonstrate, HSBC’s strategy is working, and expect that it will deliver very good returns over the coming years. For 157 years, we have followed trade and investment flows to support our customers as they fulfil their financial ambitions. We have used our deep experience and strong global relationships to help our customers to navigate the world. Today we remain steadfastly focused on our core purpose of opening up a world of opportunity. Our model is increasingly relevant to individuals and to companies of all sizes and whose financial ambitions span multiple countries and regions. Our transformation has enabled us to emerge from the pandemic a stronger bank, and well positioned to capitalise on the current interest rates cycle. And very few banks can rival our ability to connect capital, ideas and people through a global network that facilitates the international collaboration required to succeed in today’s world. The focus for the board and the management team is on delivering our strategy precisely because it is the best way for us to support our customers and to improve returns. With that, let me hand over to Noel.",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2022\220802-interim-results-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Interim/H1,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon to everyone in Hong Kong. It’s great to be here to present our half-year results. And good morning to everyone in London. Before I turn to progress against our strategy, a brief reminder of the context. As Mark said, our purpose as an organisation is “opening up a world of opportunity”. These words are a product of extensive consultation with our customers, our colleagues, about who we are and what we do, and I strongly believe that our strength as a global institution comes from our ability to connect the major trading blocs of the world. I will come back to the value of our connectivity and strategy later on. The next slide sets out the key points that we’re going to cover in our presentation today. First, we’ve had another strong performance in the second quarter. I’m pleased that reported revenue grew by 2% on last year’s second quarter and was up 12% on an adjusted basis. Adjusted profits before tax were up 13% on the same period last year and continued strong cost control led to positive adjusted jaws of 12%. Second, we’ve made good progress with our transformation programme. If you look back a few years ago, we had loss-making businesses in the US and Europe, and capital was being used inefficiently. We have structurally repositioned our portfolio, our businesses and our operating model for higher returns. The two most material adjustments in our portfolio have been the exit and wind-down of non-strategic assets and clients in the US and Europe, and the strong impetus behind organic and inorganic growth in Asia, especially in Wealth and Personal Banking. This repositioning effect is starting to pay off in terms of growth and returns, as these results show. Third, it is the benefit of transformation and the tailwinds from higher interest rates that allow me to announce some ambitious new targets and underpinning guidance even against the challenging economic backdrop. After delivering an annualised return on tangible equity of 9.9% in the first half, we are confident of delivering at least 12% from 2023 onwards. This would represent our best financial performance for a decade. Finally, as a result, we are providing more specific guidance of a 50% dividend pay-out ratio for 2023 and 2024. We understand and appreciate the importance of dividends to all our shareholders, so we will aim to restore the dividend to pre-Covid levels as soon as possible. We also intend to revert to quarterly dividends in 2023. Let me now walk you through the progress we’ve made in the first half of this year in transforming the bank. In Asia Wealth, our investments over the past few years are gaining traction. We’ve made a series of bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate our progress. In the first half, we completed the acquisition of AXA Singapore, and we remain on track to complete the acquisition of L&T Investment Management in India, and in mainland China we continue to build momentum on the back of 17 new licences and regulatory approvals gained since the start of 2020, seven of which were in the first six months of this year. We’ve got strong revenue momentum across all of our businesses, with 4% of the adjusted revenue growth in the first half. After turning the corner on revenue back in 2021, normalising interest rates give us confidence in the returns trajectory for the coming years, as we will explain later. We have also got good cost control, with adjusted costs stable in the first half despite inflation and higher spending on technology. We had an annualised return on tangible equity in the first half of 9.9%. We have now made cumulative RWA saves of $114 billion and remain on track to exceed $120 billion as we continue to exit assets and clients that do not add value to our international proposition. Our CET1 ratio was 13.6%, and we aim to manage back to within our target range, 14% to 14.5%, during the first half of 2023. Our capital allocation to growth opportunities in Asia, and Wealth and Personal Banking also showed good progress. We have a strong focus across our network today. When you combine exiting unprofitable businesses and underproductive RWAs with tighter costs and an impetus for growth, you get much better geographic performance, with every region profitable in the first half. One of the standout performers was HSBC UK, which contributed $2.5 billion of adjusted profits, up 15% on the first half of last year. Many of you heard about the fantastic job that Ian Stuart and the UK team are doing at the recent investor day. If not, please do look at the materials on the website. Looking forward, our transformation also means we can expect the current rates cycle to bring higher returns than previous rates cycles because we have more liquidity, less risk and much higher operating leverage. The level of surplus deposits we hold means we’re very well positioned to benefit as higher rates kick in. We also now have less risk in our two key books, the retail unsecured loan book and the SME lending book. We have around $91 billion of Business Banking deposits in Hong Kong and around $55 billion of Business Banking deposits in the UK at very low A/D ratios, and we have outperformed our peers on cost management in recent years. The next few slides cover our four strategic pillars, starting with the focus on our strengths. Our market-leading Commercial Banking franchise had a very strong first half. Revenue was up 14% on last year. Within that, it was particularly promising that there was fee income growth of more than 12%. Trade revenue in Commercial Banking increased by nearly $200 million or 20%, driven by a 25% increase in average trade balances, as clients trusted us to help them navigate supply-chain shifts. GLCM was up 42%, with a strong benefit from interest rates normalising, and by geography, every region performed strongly. Revenues were up 19% in the UK, up 5% in Hong Kong, up 18% in the rest of Asia and up 12% in the rest of the world. In Wealth and Personal Banking, the impacts of the transformation I described is particularly evident. Net new invested assets in Wealth grew by 9% in the first half. In Asia, we achieved significantly more positive dollar growth than was reported recently by our European wealth- management peers, and it was great to see the value of new business in our Asia insurance franchise grow by 41%, all despite adverse market conditions. Revenue in Wealth and Personal Banking was stable but, excluding market impacts and a gain on pricing updates on policyholders’ funds, it was up by 7%. Personal Banking had a very strong half. Lending balances were up 4%, driven by a strong UK mortgages performance and, looking at revenue by geography, excluding market impacts and the insurance gain, the UK was up 22%, Mexico was up 16%, while Hong Kong remained resilient, down only 1% despite the impact of Covid restrictions. All of this underlines the way we’ve structurally repositioned the business. We should now get the benefit of normalising rates on top of that. Global Banking and Markets also performed very well in the first half, reflecting our differentiated and diversified business model. Strong revenue performances in transaction banking and our Markets business were driven by rate rises and continued good levels of client activity. Collaboration between Global Banking and Markets and Commercial Banking is a priority, so I was particularly pleased to see these collaboration revenues increase by 14%. Back in February. I talked about the proportion of Global Banking and Markets client business booked in the East but originated in Europe and the Americas. In the first half, this revenue grew by around 8% on the same period last year, underlying the strength of our connected franchise. We will continue to invest in coverage and build share in connecting capital and trade flows between the world’s major economic blocs. Digitising HSBC continues to improve the client experience and make our processes more efficient. We’ve continued to raise our spending on technology, with more than half spent on change-the-bank initiatives to drive growth and efficiencies. This is in spite of the commitment to keep our overall costs stable in 2022. We’ve more than doubled the proportion of our agile workforce over the past year, which we expect to translate into a much faster release frequency for new features and propositions. Our cloud adoption across public and private cloud continued to increase beyond 30%, with an ambition to go much further. And, across trade, HSBCnet and retail mobile, penetration levels and volumes increased materially, with ambitions to grow them even further. The next slide covers our last two strategic pillars. First, we’re continuing to build a dynamic and inclusive culture. We remain on track to achieve our revised target of 35% of senior leadership roles filled by women by 2025. The total number of hours spent by colleagues learning about sustainability, digital and data increased sevenfold, reflecting the increased priority placed on future skills. And to give you an example of how we’re opening up a world of opportunity for our people, we’re rolling out a talent marketplace which uses AI to match colleagues with short-term projects and learning based on their skills and ambitions. Then, on transition to net zero, the amount of sustainable financing and investment that we provided and facilitated was stable on the first half of last year despite the overall market for green, social and sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds being down in the first half. The overall amount of sustainable finance and investment provided and facilitated since the start of 2020 now stands at more than $170 billion, well on our way towards our target of up to $1 trillion by 2030. The next slide shows why we’re confident of keeping adjusted costs stable in 2022, and our ambition is to keep cost growth to around 2% in 2023 despite strong inflation headwinds. It comes down to three things. First, good cost discipline across the whole group. Second, our efficiency levers. We’re reducing the global real estate footprint, reducing our global retail infrastructure, using more automation and reducing our operations headcount. We’re still only partway through these journeys, with an ambition to achieve even greater savings. Finally, we will continue to see the impact of our current transformation programs into next year. The flow- through benefits into 2023 are also a big component and will be an important help to offset inflation. This brings me to expectations for the rest of 2022 and 2023. I’ve explained how we’ve structurally repositioned the business to achieve higher returns once rates normalise. Despite the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, we’re expecting at least $37 billion of net interest income in 2023, which is a significant uplift on the $31 billion-plus we expected in 2022. We’re aiming to keep cost growth at around 2% in 2023, which we fully expect to be able to do for the reasons I’ve explained. Given all of this, we are materially upgrading our returns guidance. We are confidence of achieving a return on tangible equity of at least 12% from 2023 onwards. As a result, we are also providing more specific guidance of a 50% dividend pay-out ratio for 2023 and 2024. We aim to restore the dividend to pre-Covid levels as soon as possible, and we will also revert to quarterly dividends from 2023 onwards. I’ll speak to a few more slides at the end but let me now hand over to Ewen to take you through the numbers in detail.",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2022\220802-interim-results-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Interim/H1,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Noel, and good morning, or afternoon, all. As Noel and Mark have said, it’s really great to be in Hong Kong for these results. We had another strong quarter, reported pre-tax profits of $5 billion while down 1% on last year’s second quarter. This marks a strong core operating performance. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted revenues were up 12%, including net interest income up 20%. With operating expenses flat, we had 12% positive jaws. Adjusted pre-tax profits were up 13% and profits attributable to ordinary shareholders were up 62% Credit conditions remained benign in the quarter. ECLs were a $448 million net charge compared with a net release last year. We benefited from a $1.8 billion deferred tax asset credit in the quarter, reflecting a recognition of brought-forward tax losses in the UK, given the improved profitability outlook. We now expect a 2022 effective tax rate of around 10%, reverting to a more normalised effective tax rate of around 20% in 2023. To remind you, for 2022 dividend modelling purposes, please exclude the DTA gain and the French loss on disposal, being non-cash significant items, but include the $3.4 billion of costs to achieve we expect to spend this year and other significant items. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.6%. Tangible net asset value per share was $7.48, down 32 cents on the first quarter mainly due to FX impacts but also to the fourth quarter 2021 dividend payment. And we’ve announced an interim dividend of 9 cents per share, up 2 cents on the first half of 2021. On the next slide, there was a strong adjusted revenue performance across all our global businesses. Wealth and Personal Banking revenues were up 5% overall and up 19% if you exclude $700 million of adverse market impacts and insurance. Underlying this, Personal Banking had a strong quarter, revenues up 20%, reflecting both rate rises and balance sheet growth. Commercial Banking was up 19%, with growth across all core products due to improved margins and balance sheet growth and revenues driven by collaboration with Global Banking and Markets. Global Banking and Markets revenues were up 15%, mainly due to Markets and Securities Services and Global Liquidity and Cash Management. Net fee income was down 4%. The decline in fees from Wealth and Investment Banking was partly offset by the $100 million increase in Global Liquidity and Cash Management and trade fees, underlying the benefit of our diversified business model. On slide 17, net interest income was $7.5 billion, up 20% against last year’s second quarter on an adjusted basis. On rates, the net interest margin was 135 basis points, up nine basis points on the fourth quarter and up 16 basis points compared with the fourth quarter last year, as higher asset yields more than offset increased liability costs. And on volumes, we had underlying loan growth in the quarter of 5% annualised, but we saw a decline in average interest-earning assets due to FX. Based upon current FX and the consensus rates outlook, we now expect net interest income of at least $31 billion for 2022 and at least $37 billion in 2023, as we return to a more normalised rates environment. On the next slide, we provide some build-up to our net interest income forecasts on the rates assumptions. As I said, our forecasts today are based on current FX rates and the current consensus rates outlook. As you know, we’ve low pass-through rates at the moment, but we expect these to increase going into 2023. On volumes, we’re forecasting mid-single-digit loan growth in 2023. Turning to slide 19, we reported a net charge of $448 million of ECLs in the quarter, or 17 basis points. This included a further $140 million relating to our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. Outside of this one specific portfolio, the overall quality of our book remains good. Stage 3 loans, as a percentage of total loans, remain stable at around 1.8%. At this stage, we’re not seeing signs of portfolio stress across our key early warning indicators and defaults in July remained low, but we continue to monitor the situation closely. While the first- half ECL charge was only 21 basis points, we continue to expect ECLs to normalise towards 30 basis points of average loans for the full year, with the core driver of this the risk of further deterioration and forward economic guidance rather than any sharp upturn in stage 3 losses. Turning to the next slide, second quarter operating expenses were stable versus the same period last year, as cost savings and reductions in accrued variable pay offset the continued increased investment in technology and growth. We made a further $500 million of cost programme savings during the second quarter with an associated cost to achieve of $600 million. As Noel said, we remain on track for stable adjusted operating expenses this year. Assuming FX remains at June levels for the remainder of 2022, that would be around $30.5 billion of operating expenses. We’re also on track to achieve the top end of our three-year $5 billion to $5.5 billion cost savings target and now expect to see a further $1 billion of cost savings from this programme flow through to 2023, which will be a material mitigant against the higher inflation we’re seeing. As part of this cost programme, we’ve now spent $4.6 billion of our $7 billion cost-to-achieve budget that ends in the fourth quarter. We still expect to spend the remaining $2.4 billion during the second half of this year. For 2023, despite the inflationary trends we’re seeing, we’re still aiming for cost growth of around 2%. The environment is highly volatile, but we do not intend to allow the yield curve to weaken our commitment to cost discipline. Turning to capital, on slide 21, our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.6%, down 50 basis points on the first quarter. This included underlying risk-weighted asset movements from lending growth and data and methodology enhancements, post-tax fair-value losses through other comprehensive income as interest rates rose and increased threshold deductions as common equity tier 1 capital fell. We expect our common equity tier 1 ratio to fall further during the third quarter. This includes the announced sale of our French retail banking operations, which, based on current FX rates, is expected to have an impact of around 30 basis points. We expect common equity tier 1 to recover materially in the fourth quarter back towards 14%, given additional capital management actions we’re now taking, and then be back within our 14% to 14.5% target range during the first half of 2023. So, in summary, this was a strong quarter. We’re firmly on track to achieve significant improved operating performance, returns and distributions from 2023 onwards. With interest rates rapidly normalising and a post-Covid recovery in most markets, we’re seeing strong revenue growth, up 12% on a year ago. With continued cost discipline, we’ve achieved a 12% operating jaws this quarter. While not complacent, the experience of our credit portfolio remains benign. Based upon the normalisation of interest rates, with at least $37 billion of net interest income in 2023 and the continued core operating performance improvement we’re driving, we’re raising our expectations for 2023 and beyond to a return on tangible equity of at least 12%, and on the back of this we expect to see a material uplift in distributions from 2023 onwards. With that, back to Noel for a few closing comments.",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2022\220802-interim-results-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Interim/H1,Noel Quinn, ,"Thank you, Ewen. I’d like to end with a few slides before Q&A. When we began to accelerate our strategy in February 2021, one of our four strategic pillars was to focus on our strengths. As you have seen from the material today and throughout our history, we have no greater strength than our ability to bridge capital and trade flows between the major economic blocs of the world. We’re the world’s leading trade bank, one of the largest payments providers globally and one of the largest FX houses in the world. And even as trade flows have changed and supply chains have shifted, we’ve taken market share in trade because our network means we can go wherever trade goes. We also command a 20% wallet share of wholesale banking client business from Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas into Asia. Outside of revenue, our international model has also started delivering synergies in our cost base, particularly through digitisation, where we can “build once, deploy globally” at much lower costs, and there are also capital and funding synergies through the greater diversification of our portfolio and the interconnectivity within it. In the past investors could not fully assess all that value because parts of our portfolio dragged down the overall returns below the cost of capital, so the work we have done over the past few years to tightly control costs, reduce capital allocated to low-return domestic-orientated businesses and increase investment in higher-growth higher-return geographies in Asia and in businesses such as Wealth will allow us to demonstrate the value of our international strategy much more clearly, as is evident in our forward guidance of at least 12% returns in 2023 and beyond. International connectivity is core to our entire value proposition, from clients to employees, and has contributed to our improved returns. 45% of our wholesale client business is booked cross- border and a large proportion of the revenues booked domestically for wholesale clients comes to us because of the business we do for those clients overseas, and we will continue to grow that number. Similarly, in Wealth and Personal Banking, international is the most attractive and fastest-growing segment. A product like Global Money and our Wealth platforms, which are some of our highest-return propositions, are specifically designed to capitalise on our international connectivity for our retail and Wealth customers. You will continue to see more propositions from us in this space, and that’s because the average international customer revenue is around double the average domestic-only customer. In addition, in a highly competitive talent marketplace, especially in Asia, our internationalism is core to our employee value proposition and how our colleagues think about us. There has been a debate recently about our international model and specifically whether alternative structural options would create more value for our shareholders. As you would expect, we have considered many of these options over recent years. More recently, we have updated our analysis with the benefit of independent third-party financial and legal advice. It has been our judgment that alternative structural options will not deliver increased value for shareholders. Rather, they would have a material negative impact on value and our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to get to higher returns and dividends we all want to see. When considering different structural options for the bank, we need to make judgments on a range of factors which we think would materially impact valuation outcomes. Clearly, the primary factor is about disruption, too, and the potential loss of the international synergies I just highlighted, but it’s not only about synergies. There are significant costs and execution risks that would need to be considered for any alternative structural option. Past experience in the market has evidenced that carving out a relatively small European bank in a single market can take more than $2 billion, and, even then, has a high risk of failure, so you can understand the risk of standing up separate entities for a franchise of our size. I won’t go through all the points on the slide. Suffice to say the costs are material. There would be significant execution risk over a three- to five-year period when clients, employees and shareholders would all be distracted and impacted, and there are obvious day-one risks around capital distribution and client exits. Another point that comes up with investors in this discussion is our geopolitical positioning. As a global bank, we engage and maintain strong relationships with governments and regulators around the world. Our international role, our importance to global trade and our homes in London and Hong Kong underpin our relationships in both hemispheres, and our customers have trusted us for 157 years to help them to navigate the world as it has changed. I am putting the factors that we consider when assessing alternative strategies in the public domain so all our shareholders can understand the value of our international structure and our strategy. So, in summary, we’ve explained today how our strategy will generate significant value for our shareholders. We remain focused on our strengths, of which international connectivity is at the top. Our UK and Hong Kong franchises are performing very well, and we are shifting capital to areas with the strongest returns. We’re managing costs tightly, and we expect at least $37 billion of net interest income next year. As rates normalise, we’re simplifying and digitising the bank. We are engaging and will continue to engage with all our shareholders. We share their desire for improved returns and understand the importance of dividends to them. We think the best and safest way to improve returns is to focus on our strategy, which we are confident will deliver a return on tangible equity of at least 12% from 2023 and materially increased distributions. With that, can we please open up for questions? RICHARD O’CONNOR, GLOBAL HEAD OF INVESTOR RELATIONS: We’ll take most of the questions from the audio lines today. We have a few analysts and investors in Hong Kong who – after four or five from the lines, I’ll see if anybody raises their hands, and we’ve got a microphone to come around and hopefully get some questions from Hong Kong.",False,-1.0,1

I’ve got two, one on capital and one on strategy, please. On capital, when we look at the second half of the year, you’ve got, it looks like, a step up in CTA, and, obviously, the impact of France / M&A - It looks like second half may be less capital generative. I’m just wondering if you could talk about the moving parts or the actions you could take to build the capital ratio back up to 14%. And related to that, when do you think you might be in a position to buy back stock again from a capita] perspective? And then the second one – strategy - just going back to structural change slide and the analysis there, I guess the main interesting point here is the ongoing cost of running two separate groups within a different structure. I was wondering if you might be able to share a little bit more colour in terms of what is the magnitude of additional cost that you see if you were to pursue structural change, just to give us some sense of the materiality of these costs – some of your points on the slide look like they could add up to quite significant costs.

On capital, I think the first part of it was understanding the moving parts on the rebuild of capital. From first half, the 13.6%, obviously we’ve given you the M&A impacts that we expect in Q3. In addition to that, we are taking probably about 20 to 30 basis points of incremental capital actions that we previously haven’t talked about with the market, which you should expect to come through in the second half of this year. We also remember that under the Bank of England/PRA rules we have to accrue dividends at the top end of our 40% to 55% pay-out ratio. So in the first half effectively the common equity tier 1 ratio is understated because of that accrual. And there’s a catch-up that you’ll see in Q4, so we do think that we’ll trough next quarter a bit below where we are. We’ll be back close to 14% by full year. We’ll be back within range 14 to 14.5% during the first half of next year. And then your question on buybacks then links into that, which is you should not expect us to be doing buybacks until we’re back within our common equity tier 1 range of 14 to 14.5%, which, you can imply from that will be more back-end loaded next year as a result.",False,0.0,0

Just before I get to the detail or go to the specific that you asked, just on the alternative structural options I think what you’ve got to take into account is there is a combination of impacts. There is a negative impact on the revenue synergies that we have identified in the paper. There’s a negative impact on some of the funding and capital synergies that exist in a group that’s well diversified. There’s a negative impact on the costs of executing, which are one-off costs, and then there are some ongoing cost impacts in terms of the funding costs of a less diversified group, split into two, would be higher than the funding cost of a diversified group. And then there’s some ongoing running costs that you’d incur. I think it’s the totality of that that you’ve got to look at, not any one item, and there are many judgment calls to make in that equation, but whatever way you balance those judgment calls, we believe that the safest and fastest route to generating increased dividends and increased returns is the strategy that we’re pursuing. We’ve given you schedules in the pack and in the appendix to help you understand some of the factors that need to be considered, so I don’t think there’s any one cost item that I think is more relevant than the other, but it’s the package, and then you’ve got high execution risk because something of that complex nature can take three to five years with uncertain outcome for regulatory approval and for investor approval.",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\220802-interim-results-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Interim/H1,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, just to give a bit more colour around some of the numbers, Raul, as Noel said, if you just look at the one-off costs associated with setting up a structure, if you were to have a separately listed Asian subsidiary you would have to be able to demonstrate that you had standalone IT systems, which would probably take three to five years to construct and would run probably into the billions of dollars to be able to do that. You have a $40 billion MREL stack currently sitting in our Asian subsidiary, all of which is downstreamed from the parent. Again, there would be a three-to-five-year issuance programme required to reissue all of that MREL out to the public markets and effectively do a liability management exercise on that excess MREL that was sitting at the group. You would have potential tax impacts because of triggering capital gains tax implications as you did the restructuring, and other one-off costs associated with effectively recreating a standalone business here - here being Hong Kong, where I am today. And then you go into the ongoing de-synergies. For example, in the slides we’ve showed you that of the $20 billion of wholesale revenues, 45% of them relate to international customers, so you can run your own maths on what portion of that $9 billion would be at risk, but it wouldn’t be immaterial. You would have to effectively duplicate corporate functions and IT run costs that we get global synergies on today. We would lose group purchasing power benefits that we get today. We think you would have to operate our Asian business at a higher common equity tier 1 ratio as a standalone business because it wouldn’t benefit from the group support that it gets today that the HKMA does take into account. There’s about $100 billion of AT1, tier 1, tier 2 capital sitting in the rest of the group. We think if you were to break out the Asian subsidiary there’s a significant risk that the rest of the group would de-rate from a ratings perspective. A one notch downgrade on that $100 billion we think is a 25 to 50 basis point impact per annum. Our UK business holding company today has a number of tax benefits. The UK has far better withholding tax arrangements with the rest of the world compared to Hong Kong, and we also get a tax shield on our UK headquarters costs in the UK. And then you go into the complexity of execution. All of the timelines point to three to five years. In that three to five years we would have to prioritise IT change in respect of the separation rather than IT change in respect of the core business. We need regulatory approval in about 25 jurisdictions. There would be questions around indexation. We’re currently fully indexed in both markets. US dollar clearing we don’t think would be available to the Asian subsidiary, and we don’t think that we would readily be able to get a dollar clearing license for the Asian subsidiary, as we’ve seen with others. As Noel says, when you package all of that up in terms of cost to implement, complexity to implement and ongoing de-synergies, we just really struggle to come up with any form of value case that we could put in front of shareholders.",False,0.0,0

Congratulations on a good set of numbers. It’s good to see jaws coming through so strongly. I’ve got two questions, please. So my first question is on the analysis of the strategic options, and I wanted to ask you, is there anything that you’ve decided to do that is incremental to the strategy because of the process that you’ve gone through during the past couple of months? What I can see is that cost efficiencies have moved to the upper end of the range, and you’re talking about 20 to 30 basis points of additional capital actions. I was hoping you could add a little bit more colour specifically on those two points and anything that we can’t see in how your thinking’s evolved. My second question is on deposit beta. One of your peers said last week that we were starting to see some migration from current and savings accounts to time deposits.

We’re very determined to improve the performance of the business. We take all feedback that says the business hasn’t performed well over the past 10 years - we take that to heart - and have done, and are very committed to trying to drive our capital efficiency into the business. We constantly look at parts of the portfolio that are strategically less important and are underperforming, and we’re determined to continue to drive out efficiency into the capital allocation of the business. On the specific point of the additional capital management actions we’re taking, I think that’s in response to the CET1 impact of the mark-to-market on the treasury book. That’s in addition to mitigate the downturn in the CET1 as a consequence of that, but we’re confident that the capital build coming from higher profitability will start to reboot the CET1 towards the end of this year and into next year. But those capital management actions are not in response to structural considerations, they’re more in response to near-term capital management activities. Those actions are tactically important and the right thing to do, but they’re not strategically damaging to the franchise of the bank. We’re not having to turn off good, strategic growth.

What we’ve tried to do is, if you want, clarify the strategy a lot clearer that we’re pursuing. On deposit betas, we are seeing currently very little migration to time deposits so far.

As we’ve said previously, the modelling that we’ve done in the interest rate sensitivity is based on a 50% pass-through rate. We’re well below that at the moment.

Two questions, if I may. Firstly, on your net interest income guidance, thank you so much for giving us the greater than $37 billion. I note the rate assumptions that you’re making behind that are laid out on slide 18, i.e. in line with market implied policy rates. I guess there’s a pretty healthy debate amongst investors when I speak to them as to whether we actually get to those level of interest rates and, if they need to get cut again, maybe if growth were to weaken. I’m interested in your thoughts around to what extent, if the full rate didn’t appear as part of the forward curve at the moment, what risk would that pose to your ROTE ambitions? Do you have levers that you can pull? Is that $37 billion NII guide at risk if you didn’t quite get to an at best circa 3% base rate, for example? The second question is just around capital. I note the actions that you’re taking to lift the CET1 ratio back towards target range, but that actual target level – how are you thinking about that? When I compare that to your MDA, there’s a pretty handsome gap of around 300 basis points towards your target level. That feels quite large. Is there anything that you can do or you’re hoping for from the regulator to try and get that target level down?",True,3.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\220802-interim-results-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Interim/H1,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"On the NII guidance, a couple of things. You should assume that we’ve got a bit of fat in there when we’re guiding to at least $37 billion. Secondly, remember that as interest rates continue to rise, deposit betas will continue to rise. So if you don’t get that final edge on interest rates at the back end then – we’re already modelling very high deposit betas at that time, so the implicit impact on the net interest income is a lot lower than what you may think. We’ve run various scenarios and are comfortable, based on a range of scenarios at the moment, that we’ll be able to deliver $37 billion, but, obviously, if there’s a very material change in rates, we’ll reassess that. We’ve given you the interest rate sensitivity so you can run your own numbers. On capital, there is a debate at the back end of 2023 and 2024 on whether we can adjust common equity tier 1 ratio. If you think about where we’ve been in the past, we’ve been making a very big investment internally into our stress testing capabilities, into our recovery and resolution capabilities, which you don’t see from the outside. We also didn’t have the returns in the past, the combination of the returns that we had and a very high pay-out ratio that we had in the past. We just didn’t have the same capital flexibility that we’d expect to have from 2023 onwards. I think it’s important before we engage the regulators in that discussion that we get back within the range, but I think once we’re back in the range there should be some model stability to adjust down where we’re targeting on common equity tier 1, but I would say that’s back end of 2023, 2024 for discussion.",False,3.0,0

I have two quick questions, please. The first is on the Prime Rate in Hong Kong, and then the mortgage cap that should effectively be hitting all the mortgage borrowers starting next month, if I’m not mistaken. What could be the efforts to narrow that “Prime-minus”, and hence to lift the effective gap for the mortgage borrowers? How much of that can we do before we see deposit migration, as Ewen, you have talked about, and then we run into that question of raising the Prime interest rates. Once they are raised, will it be symmetrical with the savings deposit rate or asymmetrical? That’s the first question. Sorry for being a lengthy one on this one. The second is simple, on the credit cost. So as of now I see China here is still contributing nearly 30% of the total provisions. At some point during this year or early next year it’s going to roll off. We aren’t going to book CRE losses until eternity, right?

I think that’s something good to be accused of. Let me deal with the China CRE and then I’ll ask Ewen to deal with the Prime Rate and the mortgage cap. The ECL charge in the first six months is a positive outcome, but the economy’s still uncertain, so I think it would be unwise of us at the half-year stage to start factoring in the first half performance as a trend for the full year, and therefore it is appropriate to guide to a higher second half charge, given the level of uncertainty. I think we’ll update in Q3, and, clearly, we’ll know the answer at Q4, but it would be unwise to think that the first half trend is something that can roll forward into the second half. Our expectation at the moment is that forward economic guidance will probably continue to worsen, and therefore there’s more likely to be stage 1 and stage 2 provisions in the second half of the year rather than necessarily us having a line of sight to stage 3. That build of ECL in the second half is going to be more around stage 1 and stage 2 as economic forecasts continue to deteriorate and forward economic guidance is factored in. That would be the view on the ECL, but happy to be conservative at this stage. Ewen, do you want to cover Prime Rate?",False,4.0,0

Just to add on ECLs, we haven’t said they’re going to be 40 in the second half. We said that they’re trending towards a yearly average of 30, so that would be the highest we would expect them to be in the second half. On the Prime Rate, not for everyone in the room here in Hong Kong, who understands this, but for everyone who’s not in Hong Kong, the mortgage market here is typically priced off one month HIBOR plus a spread. The borrowers also have an option to shift from that rate to what’s called the Best Lending Rate minus a margin. Today those two rates are broadly in line with each other, maybe even – I would say most of our mortgage book is tipping into the latter, i.e. the Best Lending Rate minus a margin provides a lower rate to customers than one month HIBOR plus the spread we’re charging them. That rate is set daily and calculated daily and the customer doesn’t need to do anything, it just happens automatically that they switch from one rate to the other. Today, about 12% of our portfolio is subject to the mortgage cap, but I would say that given movement in the last month or so that’s likely to trend materially higher, to most of the portfolio, over the next couple of months. I’m clearly not going to sit here and give guidance on what we’re going to do with the Best Lending Rate. Historically going back – I think for 20 years – the Best Lending Rate has moved in line with the best savings rate, so we have seen slightly lower margins in the past, discounts being applied to the base lending rate. That’s obviously one tool we have. If we were to change the best lending rate and the best savings rate followed in tandem, that would be economically worse for us, given that we have a larger deposit surplus and would see a bigger hit on higher savings rates than the benefit we would get from raising the lending rate.

It would be good to just clarify what beta is assumed against that $31 and $37 billion. And my second question is just the disconnect between average interest-earning assets and loan growth. If you look at the quarter on a constant currency basis, loans are up 1%, average interest-earning assets are down 1%, so that’s giving a disconnect.

I was just wondering if your appetite has changed towards deployment of some structural hedging or maturity transformation, or however one wants to call it, in geographies outside of the UK in order to move or transform some of the deposits into more medium term maturities and to stabilise the NII going forward. Can you just update us on where you are with structural hedging? Secondly, you called out the standout performance of the UK.

Secondly, on the asset side, the trade book is very short dated too. We do typically have more interest rate sensitivity than most of our peers. Having said that, relative to what we could do, we are structurally under-hedged. We have, for example, started to – as some of the hold-to-collect and sell portfolio is beginning to mature, we’ve materially increased the hold-to-collect portfolio during the quarter, and you should expect that to continue. I think we will slowly increase the level of structural hedging overall in the bank over time to reduce some of the interest rate sensitivity, but, given the nature of the balance sheet, I think you should assume that we will continue to have higher interest rate sensitivity than peers even after we’ve done that. On the outperformance of the UK business, which I think was the second question, I just think Ian Stuart and team are doing a really, really good job at the moment. They’re taking very assertive actions against their cost structure. I think costs were down 8% Q2 on Q2. We’ve always told you that we’re structurally underweight in some segments like mortgages. We had 7% mortgage growth year-on-year in Q2. The Commercial business is going well at the moment in the UK. Post-Brexit we are the only bank in the UK of any size that can really deliver an international network to customers, and, as customers change the nature of their international businesses, we’re ideally placed to service that.

What informs taking those actions now? Would it not have been possible just to build the capital naturally and get back to target a little bit more slowly, especially given the capital hit is in part rate-driven, which is P&L beneficial and in time, ultimately, net positive? The second question - thanks for all the colour and all the guidance - it’s very, very useful - I just wondered, given where the market-implied rates path is now, were that to shift any further up, would you still see that as net beneficial to the bottom line, given deposit mix, etc? I just wondered how much incrementally benefit you would still see if rate rises went even further than the market-implied path. Thank you.",True,7.0,0

It will have some, but modest, impact on the P&L, but when we think about the balance of considerations of heading into probably tougher economic conditions in 2023, the right thing for us to do is to accelerate our capital ratios to being back within target. So we’re happy to accept some impact on income in order to achieve that, but we do think that the return analysis that we’re running on those incremental actions make sense, and we’re not doing anything that goes into what I’d describe as franchise impairing actions. On NII, I think it is market dependent. So, here in Hong Kong, there’s probably very little benefit that we would derive from interest rates going higher than what’s implied in forward curves at the moment, but I think, in other markets, definitely there would be value. And I still think that we’re structurally geared. If you think about the last couple of years, in 2021, net interest income was slightly under $27 billion. So over two years we’re generating an extra $10 billion of net interest income which more than offsets any incremental ECL costs we could see or higher costs because of inflationary issues. So I still think there’s some way to run, even based on forward curves, before you start seeing impairments materially tick up. I think the other thing that’s important to remember, Guy, for us, and it probably applies to other banks, but our customer base on the retail side is mainly affluent. They’ve had their savings rates go up materially during Covid. So they’re all sitting quite liquid with good cash reserves at the moment. We’ve seen credit card spending pick up, but people are still mainly rolling their credit card balances, so we don’t have any particular difficult credit exposure on the retail side that I would call out, with the customers sitting with good cash balances. And now, on the mainstream corporate side, the global corporate sector has effectively been de-leveraging for two and a half years. In most parts of the world, corporate loan growth has been well below nominal GDP growth. So, again, corporate balance sheets are unusually healthy for what would be at this point in a cycle facing a downturn. So for all those reasons, I think if interest rates went higher, other than Hong Kong, I think we would view that as a positive for us.

First of all, 9.9% ROTE for the half-year, largely driven by higher NII and good cost control, more than offsetting higher ECL charge. Importantly, we are now expecting to improve our ROTE to above 12% in 2023, which is well ahead of our cost of capital. Second, in terms of balance sheet dynamics, $33 billion of adjusted loan growth in the half year, largely in mortgages and trade, alongside $24 billion growth in adjusted deposits. And lastly on the results, credit quality remains quite good. ECL charges equivalent to 21 basis points of gross loans for the half year, stage three loans stable at 1.8% of total loans and we are flagging that, despite the fact that our early warnings indicators are not yet showing any signs of stress, we have an expectation for ECL charge to normalise towards 30 basis points in 2022. Onto financial resources - let’s start with capital. Our CET1 ratio was 13.6%, which was down from 15.8 at the end of the year, the reduction mainly driven by timing differences in fair value OCI securities and some RWA growth. We remain 2.9 percent points above our MDA hurdle, although we are below our target operating range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect the CET1 ratio to trough in Q3, given headwinds that we have previously mentioned on the sale of our French retail business and some other M&A that is completing, and we expect strong earnings and management actions will help us lift the capital back into our target range during the first half of next year. In terms of liquidity, it remains strong, most importantly at a legal entity level but also you can see that in the overall group LCR ratio of 134%, and we still have an HQLA on a gross level of about $800 billion. We have a loan-to-deposit ratio at 62%, which positions us quite well actually in the current rising rate environment. Our MREL ratio, 28.7%, compares favourably to a 26% requirement which, as you will see, is still the sum-of-the-parts calculation. We intend to continue to operate a prudent buffer of over $29 billion. From a funding perspective now, we have made good progress this year in, let’s call them, interesting markets. We have issued $8.4 billion of senior HoldCo and $2.6 billion of Tier 2. As you will have seen in our deck, we have increased our funding plan for the year by about $7 billion in senior HoldCo and $1 billion in Tier 2, which positions us halfway through the overall funding plan at this point. The reason for the increase in the funding plan is to offset negative market moves that we have impacted the liability value of our reg bonds, just to flag that that impact over time will unwind as those bonds are pull to par and, as a consequence of course, we are expecting that this will reduce funding needs in future years, all else equal. As mentioned at the full year, we continue to expect not to refinance any of AT1 calls that we may look to make in 2022. I am pleased to just have announced, literally before this call, an exchange offer targeting some of our older legacy Tier 2 securities, issued by our holding company. You’ll find an overview of the transaction that has been included in our updated fixed income deck on the website. The transaction is a par-for-par exchange offer, which is the most logical structure given the practical challenges that exist with consent solicitation under New York law, and we plan to use exchange accounting, which minimises the cost of the exercise for us. Having said that, we’re also offering a 35-cent incentive payment in order to encourage everyone’s participation. Just to close on legacy capital, as I am sure there will be some more questions about it, I just want to remind everyone of our position on those. We are aligned with the Bank of England in our commitment to reducing the stack over time. However, doing so cannot come at any cost. We are willing to take some cost to exit those positions but, as we have flagged in the past, we have made some historical hedging and accounting decisions that make the economics of taking the full stack out in its entirety not currently feasible or rational. So we will continue to monitor the portfolio and if further opportunities arrive we will take them. So, in summary, a strong half-year result with a clear path to solidly returning above cost of capital. Our financial resources of capital, funding and liquidity leave us all well placed to continue growing. Our business model continues to offer bondholders one of the most diverse sets of revenue streams in global banking. That’s all I thought of saying, so I’ll stop here and let’s open out for Q&A.

Thanks for doing the call and taking my questions. I’ve got a couple. The first one is just on issuance plans for this year. So I hear you on no new AT1 issuance for potential refinancing this year. However, I guess I’m looking out to next year and I think you’ve got quite a heavy potential call schedule. So would you look to AT1 markets this year to potentially get ahead of your refinancing needs next year? And then secondly, as expected, a few questions on legacy. So I’m yet to see the details of the exchange, but I welcome that and I hear your comments on the RAF and where we’re headed. I’d just like to drill down on that a bit more and I realise you’re probably limited in what you say. I’m just interested by what the PRA have told you, if they’ve given you targets to reduce by an amount per year. And then also, just on the reasonable economics point, does that – and I hear your comments on taking a small CET1 cost. Do you need to get back to your CET1 target range before you can take CET1 costs as a result of potential legacy calls or LMEs? And also if you can give us any guidance as to what is reasonable, that would be really interesting, thanks.",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\220808-interim-results-2022-presentation-to-fixed-income-investors-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,3,Carlo Pellerani,Group Treasurer,"Hi, Dan, thanks for your questions. So on AT1 first, this year was a transition year. You might remember that we mentioned that we were overweight in AT1s and underweight Tier 2s, so this year was rebalancing. With the actions that we’re taking this year, that pretty much brings us in line. So going forward, it’s all about maintenance and refinancing. And yes, to your point, it is always a possibility to try to pre-finance some of the potential call for next year, so that is something that we would leave open, market conditions dependant. In terms of the legacy stack, no, we haven’t had specific targets from the PRA or Bank of England about it. It has been just more a generic discussion. The way I would characterise it is that everyone would rather not have those securities outstanding because they’re a little bit of a – it’s a nuisance to have those securities outstanding from a resolvability perspective. And to give you some guidance in terms of cost, I guess the best I can do is to give you a sense of how I think about those securities. And the way I would describe them is there are two dimensions to the equation. The first one is how challenging each of the securities are from a resolution perspective, and there is a pecking order of those securities. So I would call out that our securities from the holding companies are the ones that are the most complex from a resolution perspective, because they are issued from the holding company, they do not have the contractual recognition of the Bank of England bail-in powers, and hence they create this potential infection risk. So the way we are dealing with those is clearly with the exchange and then to voluntarily derecognise the remaining bonds from 2025. But then you go from that point on and the rest of the entities are still a challenge, but they’re less problematic than the ones from Holdings. And then you have the other dimension, which is the cost, and that dimension is driven by what is the accounting and hedging arrangement that we have on those bonds, whether they have significant optionality value and so on and so forth. So when you put those two dimensions together, you end up with a pecking order, which is broadly as follows. First is the holding company securities, then is the subsidiary securities that are fixed rate instruments, then you have the floating rate securities and maybe lastly you have the legacy tier 1 securities. So obviously we are announcing today an exchange for the holdings securities. We will continue to assess one-by-one the other securities to assess their economics, but that hopefully gives you a little bit of a guidance of how we are thinking about it.",False,0.0,0

We haven’t found opportunities for efficiencies. Naturally, when you hold a group together versus separating, there are some natural synergies and inefficiencies around it, and that’s really what dominates the analysis that we described yesterday and that Richard just highlighted. In terms of your third question on the trade-off of the reliance on dividends and the overall capital management, I think it was last year when we changed our capital policy. Historically we used to have a fixed dividend component, and what we have made now is a pay-out that is linked with the profitability of the group. So we think that that is a sensible way of balancing all of these requirements, so to the extent that the company is highly generative then our dividends will increase; to the extent that it isn’t, they will decrease. So it creates like a natural stabiliser that we think is probably the best way of balancing all of that. RICHARD O’CONNOR: And, Carlo, let me just add to that. Look, clearly, in the second half of the year we hopefully intend to get back within our 14% to 14.5% range. As Carlo said, the previous divided policy was a fixed policy which didn’t really covering earnings and growth appropriately. We think this policy does do that and it does allow for – and if we can achieve our return target of 12%-plus, the group will be substantially cashflow-generative and there’ll be a good policy to give dividends back, to fund growth but also to ensure that debtholders have a very healthy level of capitalisation and liquidity, and we fully commit to that today.",False,2.0,0

And we’ve got a question coming in from Phil – sorry, I’ve lost the button – from Phil Pühler at Deka. Phil, your line’s open. PHIL PÜHLER, DEKA: Yeah, hello, everyone - thanks for making the call and thanks for taking my questions. I’ve got two. First of all is on your China real estate exposure. You took some provisions this quarter, but do you think this will be sufficient for the long run? And the other point is in terms of issuing new senior bonds. Which currencies would you prefer at the moment? Do you just look at which currency would be cheapest or are there other factors playing a role as well? Thank you.",False,3.0,0

Richard, you want to cover China real estate, please? RICHARD O’CONNOR: Yes, thanks. Again, we covered it yesterday, but I’ll just add a few additional comments. But, as you know, that sector came under stress from the second half of last year and we’ve taken cumulatively around $900 million of provisions, on average $300 million in the first half of the year, about $150 million each quarter, as some medium-size developers go into stage three. So it’s fair to say that that sector’s obviously going through some issues at the moment. However, the Chinese authorities are trying to stabilise the issue in terms of the developments and looking at a bail-out fund or a fund of that nature. Our sense is that we’ve taken the appropriate provisions at this stage. When you look into the second half, we do think that within our ECL guidance, which we gave yesterday, of towards 30 basis points for the full year ’22, there were will be further charges from China CRE as that impairment issue matures, probably of the same nature we saw in the first half, $300 million or even slightly more. And, indeed, if a large developer gets into further issues, then clearly there may be $200 million or $300 million on top of that. So we do think it’s an issue that will be ongoing. We think it’s very much controllable from a group perspective, given it’s a relatively small part of the group’s loans and advances. The offshore book is about $12 billion, really only about 1% of the group’s loans and advances. I think the authorities in China are trying to stabilise the position, but clearly there will be, I think, further developments in the second half of the year, and that’s really our guidance at this stage. Central case is for some further provisions of about the same magnitude in the first half or maybe slightly more. We’re watchful; we’re managing the situation very carefully. And I think the Chinese authorities will resolve it, but I think it will take some time. I think this will take some time to resolve over the coming year or two, so I’m giving you some near-term guidance and let’s see how we get on from there.",False,3.0,0

So we have about 50% of our RWAs are in dollars or pegged currencies. Then the next one down is sterling, which is about 17%, and then the remaining third is a combination of all the other currencies. That would be the dream treasurer’s approach. However, unfortunately the market is not quite there. The market is predominantly a dollar market, so invariably what we try to do is we try to take pressure off the dollar market and try to diversify as much as possible, and we look largely at that in a currency-agnostic fashion. So we always are keen to try to diversify, so this year what we have done is we have done Swissies and Sing dollars in addition to euros and dollars. Last year we did CNH, Honkies and also Swissies, so we try to diversify away from dollars, but invariably, given the large funding pool in the US, we end up doing more in the US than proportionately we would want to.",False,3.0,0

I rather thought this was ongoing. I’m just wondering as to how you’re going to accelerate this, which was the impression I got from the call.

To your point, the RWA approach is one that is dynamic. We look at it all the time. Given the temporary depression, let’s call it, that we have seen on the CET1 ratio, we have decided to accelerate some of those, and the focus is really on less profitable, less franchise clients alongside potentially some hedging opportunities that we have on some of the RWAs, so that is the bulk of the actions we are looking at at the moment. In terms of the Chinese institutions, Richard, do you want to cover that? RICHARD O’CONNOR: Hi, Jim. There’s a limit to what I can say, because obviously the shareholder register – whilst it’s public, obviously I’m not going to talk about individual shareholder positions; you wouldn’t expect me to. What I’d observe is that clearly there’s the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, and you have daily data on that, and you can see that the vast majority of the position, when you look at the filings, is the Ping An position. It’s not just Ping An. When you do the maths, there’s a couple of other institutions there who’ve taken advantage of that stock connect to invest in Hong Kong and our Hong Kong stock, which we very much welcome. But, more generally, when you go through the shareholder register on Bloomberg, then you will see a very large number of institutions in China and Asia on that register, and we very much welcome that. Clearly, we are dual-listed in both Hong Kong and the UK, and we’re a key member of the Hang Seng Index, and therefore we welcome Asian institutions, including mainland China institutions and Hong Kong institutions, on our share register. And, indeed, part of the success of Hong Kong over the last few years has been the massive growth in the asset management industry in Hong Kong. There are well over 70 to 80 mainland China parent company asset managers now based in Hong Kong, investing in the city, investing internationally and investing in HSBC. So, Jim, I wouldn’t take it any more or less than that. It’s something which we very much welcome. We welcome that internationalisation of the China asset management industry investing international and being part of our share register, so take it in that spirit, please.",False,4.0,0

I still am a bit surprised about the extent to which the market value of your liabilities affects MREL because, from an accounting perspective, a lot of it is amortised cost, so I just wondered is it currency more than anything else that’s caused the stepped-up issuance rather than actual fair value or spread-related fair value?",True,4.0,0

First of all the impact: the impact over the quarter was about $7 billion. About $4 billion of that was interest rates and about $3 billion of that was FX, so it was a combination of both. It is a curiosity of MREL valuation, in which when hedging, regardless of the accounting treatment, from an MREL perspective, you fair-value it as a whole and regardless of the way you are hedging it as well, because the hedges that you may take from an interest rate perspective are not bail-in-able from an MREL perspective.

And, as you can imagine, when rates go up, the bond liability value goes down. That’s reflected in MREL.

I just wondered, is there some sort of scenario between your severe downside and prior Bank of England stress tests where there is a biting point, where you would start to see losses come through?

MING LAU, CFO ASIA-PACIFIC: Sure, Ewen. The point I would draw out on the mortgage book is strong LTVs.

To the point on mortgage insurance, I don’t have the specific number with me.

There is of course the headwind for the France sale and there is another five basis points or so of other M&A. In terms of FX, in the last quarter we had about a 10 basis points hit through FX on the back of the movement in currencies, so that type of magnitude is always possible, given what we have seen so far. In terms of hedging I would just remind you that we need to balance the capital volatility and the NII sensitivity. As a group we are very sensitive to the downside in rates, so when we’re talking about hedging, we’re trying to reduce the capital sensitivity without affecting the NII sensitivity, because we want to be protecting ourselves to the downside and not to the upside, of course. So far we have reduced the sensitivity to capital on the interest rate risk by about 60% since Q1, so that makes the impact much less significant. We flagged to you that the sensitivity to another 25 basis point move would be about $500 million, which is about half what we had at the time.

It’s a relatively small part of the book, about 10% of the book. Elsewhere, both in retail and wholesale, people are borrowing, unless it’s involuntary, which is bad. It depends on confidence: confidence to invest, confidence to buy a house, confidence to buy a car, and so to the extent inflation impacts confidence – which it’s clearly doing – then we think it would be net-net a negative to our business.

The cost of that is about £20 million-odd, so it’s not a material number and not a permanent feature of the cost base. I do think this will be a slightly unusual recession in the UK, but if we look at what happened post-Covid, we’ve got mainly on the retail side an affluent customer base. We know, in terms of the deposit flows, that customer base – savings rates went up enormously, so all of them are sitting on far higher levels of savings than they typically would at this point, heading into a recession. So we do think, in the nature of our UK retail customer base, they are likely to be substantially less impacted than, say, the bottom three or four deciles of society, who undoubtedly will have a very, very tough time, given what’s happening with energy prices. And equally on the corporate side – this is both a UK comment and a global comment – we’ve seen the global corporate sector being effectively deleveraging now for two and a half years. Global corporate loan growth and UK corporate loan growth have been below nominal GDP since Covid. So mainstream corporates are sitting on very healthy balance sheets at the moment. You can look at our IFRS 9 modelling, if you want, to create adverse scenarios for the UK and what may happen with impairments, but I think similar to what you’ve seen with some of the other UK banks, we’re not seeing anything at the moment that causes us undue concern, but the impacts on the UK economy and some parts of the UK economy are going to be severe. RICHARD O’CONNOR: I would just highlight the Business Banking side. We showed you a massive deposit surplus in that sector. Of the lending, a large chunk is government guaranteed. That’s an area that we’ll see headlines over the next few months coming through, and therefore that’s something I know the team’s watching, but it’s not a huge part of our book, but I think that’s an area worth watching.

As you’d expect, we are in regular dialogue with them. As we said as part of the second quarter results, while the work is not finished, all of the work that we’ve done to date would say it’s very costly to put in place any structure that’s being proposed. There’s a three to five-year gestation period to do it, whether that be creating the MREL stack required, creating the IT stack required, getting the regulatory approvals required. So costly and lengthy to put the structure in place, and then material dis-synergies once you’ve put the structure in place, so, yeah, we are struggling to see that there’s a value case here that would possibly make sense to put in front of our shareholders. So, our plan is to execute our plan. We think if we execute our plan, that drives material returns, profit, distribution upside. As we said, we expect to get back to a 12% return on tangible equity next year, and we’ve said we’re committed to paying half of that out by way of a dividend. That gets you to materially higher distributions. I think if we achieve a 12% return next year that we fully expect to do, we think the share price is materially undervalued relative to that performance. So what’s the endgame for Ping An? I think a much higher share price, probably, hopefully, is an acceptable compromise for them. We think their in-price is probably around HKD60 a share, so we’re about HKD50. So we think there is a path to getting our share price to a level that’s comfortably above their in-price, which allows them to then take a different stance in relation to their current position. But in terms of the structural options, I think we have a not yet complete but pretty clear view that what is being proposed is value destructive. RICHARD O’CONNOR: And you saw their results. Their investment yield is about 5%, and our dividend signalling, if we achieve our plan – you can do the maths and work out that they’ve got a higher than that, up to end of 2019, dividend yield.

What we’ve seen in the last few weeks has been a rapid increase in the swap rates. I think two and five-year average swap rates are up around 100 basis points in the last month or so, so I was wondering how you’re thinking about HSBC’s ability to increase pricing to keep in line with the swap rates from here and how this translates to mortgage spreads? RICHARD O’CONNOR: Many of you will have seen that we’ve put both some – I stress ‘some’ – of our deposit rates up and our mortgage rates up over the last few weeks, so, as you saw in Q2, rates are moving up quite fast and that remains the case. So we’re taking action on both sides of the book to make sure that our pricing is appropriate and is return-enhancing. It’s probably fair to say that, a couple of months ago, we were a little bit behind the curve when you look at the returns on the mortgage business we were writing and we’re trying to get to at or above that curve, and that’s what you’ve seen in our pricing in the last couple of months. We’re still very happy doing business in the UK mortgage market. It’s a profitable business. We’re expanding in it, but clearly we need to do it with the right level of return and that’s what you’ve seen with our pricing in the last couple of months.",True,16.0,0

There was a recent Bank of England speech, talking about potential changes to the capital framework in the long, long term, perhaps, and how this crisis and other crises have shown banks’ unwillingness to go into capital buffers, even though the idea is they’re supposed to be there to be used into a downturn to support the needs of the economy. And there was a suggestion that, to reduce stigma for certain banks to go into the buffers, that you just have a blanket ban on dividends for everyone, no matter what their capital ratio is. And maybe we can say that’s just unlikely to happen, but were the Bank of England to go down some sort of route like that – or wider regulators in Europe, perhaps – how would you view such an action, both personally as a bank and also for your investor base?",True,17.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\220902-h1-2022-equity-analyst-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,Post-Results Equity Analyst Meeting,Ewen Stevenson,Group Chief Financial Officer,"We viewed the action that was taken in early 2020…we understood it in the context of … a very early stage of Covid and the extreme uncertainty that existed, and it wasn’t just the UK regulator that did it. A number of regulators did it globally. What we particularly objected to was the fact that we were two weeks after going ex-dividend and I think, if you think about what you’re trying to achieve is extreme downside protection, cutting a dividend is not going to solve that. Our main recovery action in an extreme downside scenario, as you saw in the global financial crisis, was all the banks going out and raising equity, and we think that blocking what was a $4 billion dividend payment had a significant impact. If we had been forced to go out and then raise equity, the net amount of capital we would have been able to raise would have been considerably less as a result of that saving of $4 billion of dividends. So I understand what the Bank of England have said and mused on. We’ve consistently said to them that there are reasons people don’t cut into buffers. It’s got nothing to do with their buffers; it’s got to do with the market signals and how the market interprets it, and that stigma is not going away. So I think if they were to codify this musing, that they might have a persistent approach at blocking dividends, I think that would be very negative for the banking sector. RICHARD O’CONNOR: It was one policymaker and I think they are taking the view that, actually, you would have to – best done on a global basis. When the Bank did it, I think they thought that other jurisdictions would follow and they didn’t, so that’s part of the reason behind the speech, but there’s no signs that jurisdictions in other parts of the west, or indeed the east, have any view like that.

Thank you for joining our third quarter results call. Ewen’s going to lead the financial presentation, but I want to start by first talking about the leadership changes we’ve also announced. We’ve now spent nearly three years transforming HSBC, and while there’s still work to do, we are now in a much better place to accelerate our financial performance and deliver stronger returns. As we approach the end of our three-year transformation programme, myself and the board have taken the opportunity to review the composition of the GEC, with an eye to long- term succession planning. As a result, we have today announced that Georges Elhedery will take over as Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 January 2023, and Greg Guyett will take on the role of CEO of GBM permanently, effective immediately. Ewen will therefore step down as group CFO on 31 December and will leave the bank in April 2023. I want to put on record my thanks to Ewen for everything he’s done during his time with us. He played a key part in creating and executing our transformation and growth agenda over the last four years. He helped steer HSBC through the Covid pandemic. He’s been fundamental in reshaping our portfolio globally, improving our capital efficiency, and embedding disciplined cost management across the organisation. He has also driven the transformation agenda within the Finance function, reshaping its strategic direction, encouraging innovation, and building the team’s engagement levels. He’s been a great professional, has contributed much to the bank, and I wish him the very best for his future career. I want to emphasise we remain absolutely committed to delivering our strategy and the 2023 targets we announced with our Q2 results. There is no change to my commitment as a consequence of these people moves. Going into Q3, I am pleased with our third-quarter performance. All regions performed well, with particularly good performances in the UK, the Middle East, and south-east Asia. We delivered a double-digit return on tangible equity for the nine-month period, excluding significant items, and we remain on track to achieve our financial targets in 2022 and 2023. We’ve also kept a tight grip on costs and are driving greater efficiencies across the organisation. Clearly, this is important in an unpredictable and challenging external environment, but it’s also a sign that our digitisation strategy is working. Our work to structurally reposition the business and invest in areas of growth continues to gain traction. We are in a much better position at the start of the new interest rate cycle, as a result of the actions we have taken on capital efficiency, portfolio rationalisation, organic revenue generation and cost control. We can also see in Wealth, for example, that we’re building a strong earnings platform for the future. Over the last 12 months, we attracted $91 billion of net new invested assets, with $32 billion in the third quarter alone. Clearly, I result, we’ve given some more information about our Canada business in the appendix. I’ll now hand over to Ewen to take you through the details.",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2022\221026-3q-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,3,Ewen Stevenson,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon, all. As Noel said, these are a good set of results – reported pre-tax profits in the quarter of $3.1 billion. While down on last year’s third quarter, this was due to the $2.4 billion revenue impairment associated with the disposal of our French retail bank. Adjusted pre-tax profits in the quarter increased by $1 billion, or 18% to $6.5 billion, reflecting a strong net interest income performance of $8.6 billion. That’s up $2 billion on last year’s third quarter. We had higher ECL first quarter – $1.1 billion, or 43 basis points. This primarily reflects increased economic uncertainty in the UK, together with further provisioning for our China commercial real estate portfolio. Operating expenses are up 1% year to date against the same period last year, and up 5% on last year’s third quarter due to higher technology investment and different timings for our variable pay accrual. We remain on track to deliver broadly stable costs this year. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was down 20 basis points to 13.4%, including an around 30-basis- point impact from the loss on the French retail bank disposal. We continue to expect to be at the bottom end of our 14% to 14.5% target common equity tier 1 range during the first half of 2023. At our second-quarter results, Noel and I said our current strategy is the best and safest way to improve returns, with strong revenue growth driven by rising rates and volumes and tight cost discipline. With these results, our strategy remains firmly on track – good underlying growth across all of our businesses, with operating costs remaining broadly stable year to date, and an annualised reported return on tangible equity of 9.2%. Adjusted revenue was up $3.1 billion, or 28%, as the positive impact of rate rises were reflected in our strong net interest income performance; and non-interest income of $5.7 billion was up $600 million or 13% on last year’s third quarter, despite a $400 million insurance market impact charge in the quarter. ECLs were at $1.1 billion net charge compared to a net release of $600 million in last year’s third quarter. We now expect an ECL charge of around 30 basis points for this year. Lending was down 2% on the second quarter and deposits down 1%, but excluding the impact of the reclassification of the French retail bank as held for sale, lending and deposits were both up $5 billion. Our tangible net asset value per share of $7.13 was down 35 cents on the second quarter, due to negative FX and adverse fair value movements. Turning to slide 4, we’re seeing good organic growth across all of our global businesses, as well as the benefit of rising rates. Wealth and Personal Banking revenue was up 25%, with a good Personal Banking performance. Personal Banking revenues were up $1.4 billion on the third quarter last year due to higher rates and balance sheet growth. There was a good underlying performance in Wealth due to the strong Insurance and Private Banking performance. While revenue was down 9%, or $200 million, due to adverse market impacts in insurance of $400 million, we remain very confident in the growth of our Wealth franchise. We had $91 billion of net new invested assets in the last 12 months, including almost $32 billion in this quarter, so our investment is building a strong future earnings platform. Commercial Banking revenue was up 40%, with Global Payment Solutions, formerly known as GLCM, benefitting from higher rates, together with continued strong underlying growth. Global Banking and Markets revenue was up 16%; Markets and Securities Services revenue was up 20% due to market volatility; and Global Payment Solutions in Global Banking was up 100%, partly offset by lower Capital Markets & Advisory activity. On slide 5, net interest income was $8.6 billion, up $2 billion versus last year’s third quarter. This was primarily driven by higher rates and was strong across all regions and businesses. On rates, the net interest margin was 157 basis points, up 22 basis points on the second quarter, putting us back at pre-pandemic levels. We now expect net interest income of around $32 billion for this year, and at least $36 billion in 2023 compared to the previous $37 billion guidance. Relative to the second quarter, we are upgrading our assumptions on a like-for-like 2023 revenues by around $1.5 billion on a constant currency basis, including $1.2 billion for FX movements, and at least $1.3 billion of planned higher costs of funding for the trading book, with this benefit being reflected in higher trading income in non-interest income, and is dollar for dollar with lower net interest income. In addition, given the unprecedented speed of interest rate rises we’ve been seeing this year, we believe we’re being cautious on our planning assumptions across deposit betas, deposit migration and asset margins from here. The FX movements have a similar impact on costs, with 2021 adjusted operating costs of $32 billion translating to around $30 billion using year-to-date average FX rates, and around $29 billion if you were to use September average rates. Given the flow of growth we now foresee, we now expect low-single-digit lending growth in both 2022 and 2023, before returning to previous expectations of mid-single-digit growth from 2024 onwards. On the next slide, non-interest income was $5.7 billion, up 13% against last year’s third quarter. Net fee income was down 11%. The decline in fees was largely due to lower Capital Markets & Advisory levels in Global Banking and Markets, and lower equity market activity in Hong Kong in Wealth and Personal Banking. Flow fees in Global Payment Solutions were up 18% in Commercial Banking, and up 8% in Global Banking and Markets. Other income was up 49%, including another strong FX performance in the quarter. On the next slide, we’ve reported a net charge of $1.1 billion, or 43% of ECLs in the quarter. This included $600 million of modelled stage 1 and 2 provisions and overlays, $400 million of stage 3 loans, and $100 million of write-offs. There was a $300 million charge in the UK, including $200 million of additional allowances for heightened economic uncertainty. $400 million also relates to the mainland China commercial real estate market, around two-thirds of which are stage 1 and 2 provisions, and the remaining third are stage 3. The overall quality of our loan book remains good. Stage 3 loans as a percentage of total customer loans are stable, at 1.8%. In terms of outlook, we expect an ECL charge of around 30 basis points for this year, and for 2023 we now expect ECLs to be at the higher end of our 30-to-40-basis-point planning range, but with a higher degree of volatility around this guidance given the uncertain market outlook. Turning to slide 8, we've had three quarters now of relatively stable costs year to date, and we continue to expect costs to be broadly stable on last year. Within that, third quarter adjusted operating costs were 5% up on the same period last year, driven by continued investment in technology and timing differences in the variable pay accrual versus the third quarter of 2021. We made a further $600 million of cost programme savings during the third quarter, with cost to achieve spend of around $700 million. The formal three-year programme ends this year. We now expect to spend between $6.5 billion and $7 billion, slightly lower than our original $7 billion CTA target, but the expected cost savings from the programme remain unchanged, at around $5.5 billion, by the end of this year, rising to around $6.5 billion of cost savings by the end of 2023. We continue to target around 2% adjusted cost growth for 2023, with an ongoing focus on active cost management to mitigate inflationary pressures. Turning to capital, on slide 9, our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.4%, down 20 basis points on the second quarter. This includes the sale of our French retail banking operations, which had an impact of around 30 basis points, and further negative reserve movements through other comprehensive income due to higher rates. Reported risk-weighted assets were down $23 billion on the second quarter, principally to FX movements. We've now achieved our year-end ambition of at least $120 billion of cumulative RWA saves, with modest further saves still expected in the fourth quarter. We expect common equity tier 1 to now recover strongly in the fourth quarter, back towards 14%. This reflects a number of factors, including the formulaic impact of how our dividend is accrued during the year. We accrue at the top end of our pay-out range, so have already accrued 28 cents year to date, and additional capital management actions we've been taking to offset the negative OCI movements. Please remember that this is not guidance of our full-year 2022 dividend intentions. The dividend accrual is purely a formulaic calculation that will true-up at the full year, based upon the results and outlook at the time. We continue to expect to move back to the bottom end of our 14% to 14.5% target common equity tier 1 range during the first half of 2023, and to consider buy-backs from the second half of 2023 onwards. In summary, these were a good set of results, good earnings diversity across the group, growth in all of our business lines, and continued strong control on operating costs. Despite a weakening credit outlook, our credit quality remains strong. For 2023, we are upgrading like-for-like revenue assumptions. We continue to target adjusted cost growth of around 2%, and we expect to be at the bottom end of our target common equity tier 1 range in the first half of 2023. Finally, after another quarter of good progress, we remain confident of delivering our targeted 12%-plus return on tangible equity in 2023 and beyond. We expect a 50% dividend pay-out ratio for both 2023 and 2024, supplemented by active capital management for surplus capital beyond this. We've included a slide on Canada in the appendix so you can see the shape of the business and the tangible equity within it. We've also included slides on mainland China commercial real estate on the Hong Kong loan book. With that, Elma, if we could please open up for questions.",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2022\221026-3q-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,3,Omar Keenan,Credit Suisse,"Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions, and best of luck for the future, Ewen. Can I please ask a question on capital planning and on the provision scenarios? So just on capital planning, could you give an update on where HSBC is on the tactical RWA measures that are meant to get the common equity tier 1 ratio up to above 14%? It would just be good to have an idea of that. Just given the focus on real estate prices in the UK and Hong Kong and mainland China, would it be possible to give a sensitivity in terms of RWA migration to lower real estate prices? In 2023, for example, what a 10% to 15% across-the-board reduction in real estate prices would mean for RWAs? My other question is on asset quality. Could you give a little bit more colour on the guidance for the year ’23? I guess there's a lot of moving parts between stage 3 and moving toward a downside, or downside 2 scenario. When you’re thinking about the FY23 guidance being at essentially 40 basis points, what sort of assumptions are in that? Thank you.",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\221026-3q-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,3,Ewen Stevenson,Chief Financial Officer,"On capital planning, I guess, various parts to that. Firstly, I touched on, when I spoke about the technical nature of how we accrue dividends during the year. We’ve accrued 28 cents so far this year, so there will be very limited drag in Q4 from dividend accrual. Secondly, we’ve largely completed the $120 billion RWA saves programme that we committed to. I think there’ll be a bit of a carry-through into Q4 of a few billion dollars. And on top of that, going back to Q1, we did implement a series of other tactical measures to support the common equity tier 1, given the movements we were seeing driven by the OCI losses and the impact that was having on capital. We’re already seeing some of that benefit come through the Q3 results, and they’ll be incremental benefits in Q4, but I would say that you should see material improvement in the common equity tier 1 ratio in the fourth quarter, and then we’ll be back at the bottom end of the common equity tier 1 range by the middle of next year, which also then supports the buyback comments for the second half of 2023 because, at that point, with a 12%-plus return on tangible equity and a 50% pay-out ratio, we’ve signalled that we expect low-single-digit loan growth next year. That means the business at that point is very capital accumulative. On the second question, on the real estate crisis, I don’t have to hand what a 15% impact would be on a ratings migration across the book, but perhaps I can get you a follow-up with the IR team afterwards. There is quite a bit of detail in the Pillar 3 documents that I think they can help you step through to try and estimate what that impact may be. Then on asset quality for 2023, firstly, I think we do expect, on the China commercial real estate book, to continue to see some losses coming through that portfolio through 2023. It still feels like we've got some ways to go before we’re going to get stability and improvement in the China property markets. For the UK, probably the market with the biggest delta around it for us at the moment is the UK. We have already, in some way, front-end-loaded potential stage 3 losses for 2023, with forward economic guidance adjustments that we’ve made during the third quarter. And above and beyond that, I think we’re just being reasonably prudent with the guidance at the moment. We didn’t say 40 basis points. We said to the higher end of 30 to 40 basis points. I think when we look at consensus, it’s sitting at slightly higher than 40 basis points at the moment, but we’re not really trying to change that guidance. But when you think about the world next year, I think it’s also important to recognise that places like Hong Kong and China are likely to have better economic performances in 2023 than in 2022. For us, when you think about our business mix, we have got a blend of some parts of the world seeing improved economic performance next year.",False,0.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2022\221026-3q-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,3,Ewen Stevenson,Chief Financial Officer,"On the NII guidance, the technical side to the guidance is on the walk from the second quarter. Firstly, as you’ve noted, we’ve had adverse FX movements of $1.2 billion, and our planning assumption is that rate moves will increase the cost of funding in the trading book by at least $1.3 billion. The cost of funding will be a drag on net interest income but will have a dollar-for-dollar improvement in trading income in non-interest income. Relative to the second quarter, we think we’re guiding like-for-like revenue guidance up by at least $1.5 billion, even though the net interest income guidance is down by $1 billion. On the non-technical side, we think our net interest income assumptions at the moment are cautious. I think, increasingly, the interest rate sensitivity tables that we show you are less helpful because they are based on a 50% deposit beta. Given the relatively unprecedented speed in rate rises that we’ve seen relative to recent history, I think we are being deliberately cautious in key assumptions. We’re assuming in that guidance very high deposit betas, elevated levels of migration out of non-interest-bearing current accounts and contraction of asset margins in some areas. We’ll obviously see how this plays out in the coming quarters, but I would say, at the moment, we are trying to be deliberately cautious in that guidance, and I would note that, like for like, we have increased the guidance by $1.5 billion.",False,1.0,0

Just a couple of questions from me. The first one was just back on impairment. I’m sure it’s probably my understanding, but, when you look at the $300 million CRE overlay and the $200 million UK overlay, if I look at your overall coverage ratio on your loans to customers, it’s pretty much flat at 1.1%, which is about the same as 2Q and FY21. I would have expected that to go up if a lot of the provisions you are taking are just reserves rather than treating underlying delinquencies. So why hasn’t that coverage ratio stepped up? Are there other moving parts – obviously, the write-offs and underlying delinquencies. That would be my first question. And my second question is just following on from an earlier question. When you talk about your greater than 14% guidance on CET1 from first half 2023, have you factored in potential risk migration from higher loan losses, falling CRE within that, or, if we saw increased migration, would that be a risk to that greater than 14% CET1 guidance from 1H 2023?

And you can see what our assumptions are on the macro outlook from our first nine scenarios. So clearly, within that, in some markets, there is an element of ratings migration that we build into our RWA forecasts and capital forecasts. On your question on impairments, I guess it’s hard to answer the question on a macro level. On the commercial real estate portfolio in China, we have definitely increased the level of overall provisioning against that portfolio. And then, on the UK, again, I’m sort of struggling to get my head around the take-off of the provisions we had at the beginning of the year because of Covid and the putting back on provisions that we’re now putting back on. I think net we’ve put more on in the UK than we took off at the start of the year. But I’ll get the IR team to follow up with you on the specifics, but I think, on the two portfolios that we’re most focused on at the moment, provisioning levels are higher than where they were at the beginning of the year.",False,3.0,0

All the best to your future career, and I have two questions. The first one is just to follow up on that revenue and cost guidance, making sure I heard it correctly. So, assuming constant currency revenue is $1.5 billion higher, and I guess cost guidance hasn’t really moved 2% inflation, does that imply, on a pre-provision basis, you’re guiding for $1.5 billion higher PPOP? So that is the first one. And then second question is around the exit of Canada business. Compared to many other markets that HSBC is exiting, Canada is actually quite a profitable market with mid-teens RoE. So I just want to understand what is the rationale for that exit and, strategically, as you look at the footprint of HSBC, are there any further markets you’re reviewing at the moment?

On a constant currency basis, revenue’s up $1.5 billion no change in the cost guidance, so, on a pre- provision level, there should be a $1.5 billion increase, and, if you think about the guidance that we’ve given today on ECLs – that, even after ECLs, there should still be a net improvement on our guidance on a pre-tax basis.",False,4.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\221026-3q-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,3,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"And, on Canada, let me explain some of the rationale as to why we’re considering alternative options on Canada. Firstly, you’re absolutely correct; the business has performed well and is performing well with a return on capital above our cost to capital and a very strong recovery post-Covid. The team has done an extremely good job. The rationale for considering alternative options is as follows. First, our market share in Canada is around about 3%. And, second, it’s largely a domestic business. The international connectivity between our Canadian business, particularly in wholesale banking and supply chain finance, is less internationally connected than many other markets that we operate in. And then, thirdly, we’ve had strong interest in our business from the point of view of other banks looking to buy it. We clearly have to consider on behalf of all shareholders if the value that they would attribute to that business is significantly greater than the value of holding our profit stream in HSBC, and we’re testing that at this point in time by looking at the strategic options. Our assessment is there is a reasonable probability that the value will be significantly accreted and, therefore, it’s right that we consider that option, particularly as strategically, as I said, our market share is in the 2% category, and the international connectivity of that business is relatively low. So that’s why we’ve given serious thought to an alternative strategy for Canada. But I re-emphasise the management team in Canada has done an excellent job. When you asked me the question on ‘Do I consider that same evaluation for other markets?’ and, clearly, we always look, as a management team, at the performance of our businesses, the value in our hands relative to the value in others, and also the strategic importance. So we do do that, but at the moment we’re only looking at commencing a process on Canada. And I can probably anticipate your second question, so let me deal with that now on Mexico. And, if I do the same analysis on Mexico, I start with a market share analysis where, depending on the product line or customer segment, we have somewhere between a 7% and 10% market share of the business in Mexico, so a much stronger market share position. We have strong growth being achieved in our Mexican business at the moment with significant upside potential, and I think that’s particularly true as we believe that, as an international bank in Mexico, relative to other competitors, our position as an international bank is being enhanced. Thirdly, we believe that the supply chain interconnectivity between Mexico, the rest of the world and the US will actually increase in volume of business and business opportunity because it is an important manufacturing base into the US, and that’s at the core of what we do, and we have a very strong market share position in retail banking in Mexico with strong interconnectivity between retail and corporate banking in Mexico as a result of the payroll services. And we also believe that we’ve got strong shareholder value accretion potential by holding that business in Mexico, so we’re not going through a similar process on Mexico. We think we have good opportunities to continue to grow that business. It’s starting from a stronger position and it’s not my intention to sell Mexico. So hopefully that was a reasonably comprehensive answer. As and when we make a final decision on Canada, we will update you on the outcome of that process. Thank you.",False,4.0,0

There will be no easing at all in our cost discipline. I am absolutely committed to that cost target. Ewen has done a tremendous job on driving cost discipline in the bank, but I share that agenda and I am committed to that agenda. As we’ve said in the past, we’ve got a headline target of 2%, around 2%. We know that that’s challenging in a high-inflation environment, but we also know we’ve got cost savings coming through next year from the transformation programme we’ve already embarked on, and that’s the equivalent of 3%. It’s about $1 billion of flow-through savings. We also know we’re identifying additional cost savings opportunities through further simplification, further digitisation and further organisational change. That can add to the 5% underlying capacity to pay. So I’m not going to pretend in a high-inflation environment that 2% is easy, but I’m also going to remain absolutely committed to delivering that.

So we do expect there to be further provisioning against the offshore book, but, to keep that in context, $12 billion is on a $1 trillion loan portfolio, so it is just over 1% of the total exposure we have as a bank.

Let me echo, first of all, earlier comments and thank Ewen for a good collaboration over the years and all your patience with our questions. If I could just have two, one on pass-throughs and one on asset quality, I was just wondering, in terms of pass-throughs, earlier comments were on pass-throughs being more begin compared to assumptions you have made earlier in the year. I was just wondering have you seen any meaningful signs of attrition in your core markets, Hong Kong and UK ring-fenced bank in terms of current accounts into higher yielding accounts? Is it something that has started to trend higher and could imply higher pass-throughs going forward? And, secondly, on asset quality, I was just wondering what are the main ramifications you think higher mortgage rates in the UK will have? I think most recently mortgage rates’ headline had increased to a level of around 6%. I was just wondering, from your UK business perspective, what are the main implications of mortgage rates at such a level?",True,7.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\221026-3q-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2022,3,Ewen Stevenson,Chief Financial Officer,"On the pass-through levels, Martin, they have been below expectations so far, but I think they have been rising. As I said, in our guidance we’ve made some reasonably conservative assumptions and cautious assumptions on where deposit betas go to from here, but implied in that comment is materially higher than 50% to what we’ve seen to date, and hence why I would caution on using our interest rate sensitivity tables at this point, because they’re based on a 50% deposit beta, which are becoming increasingly less relevant as we get to higher rates. We haven’t seen any material attrition. We are seeing migration out of non-interest-bearing current accounts into saving accounts. We’re starting to see that trend now in Hong Kong pick up a bit, given where rates are. Again, just as a reminder, if you looked in previous cycles, our extent of deposit migration out of non-interest-bearing current accounts has been well below sector averages in Hong Kong. On asset quality, again, the book in the UK is typically a mix of two-year and five-year fixed. So the impact of those higher rates will take time to roll through the book. They are typically stressed when we put them on to rates of up to 7%. And you can look at our IFRS 9 modelling and look at the downside 1 and 2 scenarios, if you want to look at the potential sensitivity we have to higher provisioning levels, if you want to take some more adverse scenarios on the outlook for the UK. We think, as we sit today, we’re not complacent about it, but we think for most of our customers those higher rates are affordable, given the stress analysis we put on when those loans were put on.",False,7.0,0

Thank you so much for taking my questions, and my best wishes to Ewen as well. Noel, if I can start with a follow-up on your commentary around Canada and Mexico. I’m just trying to understand your reaction function to any incoming capital proceeds that you might generate from M&A. How would you think about capital deployment, if you were to reach a position in excess? Would you consider further acquisitions? I think that’s one of the comments you’ve made publicly. Or should we expect that the majority of capital that is generated from these disposals should be returned to shareholders? The reason I ask this is because historically I think HSBC has linked various share buy-backs to specific disposals, and so I was just wondering whether you might be willing to link any subsequent disposal-generated capital proceeds to a direct share buy-back. And I guess the second question I have is remaining on Wealth Management. I was just wondering – obviously, we have been expecting a recovery in Wealth in Asia for a while and things are obviously still challenging on the ground. I was wondering if you could update us in terms of your thoughts around how the business is positioned going forward and whether or not you see any structural challenges arising from recent developments in terms of Wealth growth.",True,8.0,0

Let me deal with the Canada item first. It’s still very early in the process on Canada, so I don’t want to be too definitive on use of proceeds. But, clearly, there would be an expectation that a significant element of the proceeds – I don’t want to hang on to excess capital, so as we get back into our target range of 14% to 14.5%, which we’re going to do without the benefit of Canada, and if we were to load a Canada disposal in on top of that, you would clearly have excess capital sitting at the group. Now, it would be reasonable to assume that we may retain some of our capital to fund further growth that would emerge in 2024 and beyond, but a good proportion of that capital would be available for distribution. I don’t want to give too much guidance on that at this stage – let us get through the process on Canada – but I have no intention to hang on to excess capital over and above our target range unless we see good opportunities for profitable growth. So I think it would be a reasonable expectation to expect some distribution of that capital back to shareholders in some form. On Wealth Management, I think on Asia we are seeing the Hong Kong market reopening. Activity levels domestically are increasing. We are seeing the Hong Kong market reopen internationally. So I think the prospects are far better for 2023 than they have been throughout 2022. I would expect activity levels to increase, but what you will also hopefully see is more stabilisation in the equity markets. The investment environment has not been very supportive, particularly in Asia, at the same time as the activity levels have been suppressed. If we start to see a stabilisation of the markets, I think there’d be an increased appetite to use alternative investment products. And what I referenced in my opening comments is we’re building the platform for future earnings growth from Wealth by continuing to accumulate net new assets. And, as we talked about, in the last 12 months, we’ve accumulated $91 billion of net new assets. That $91 billion, given the suppressed market situation and investment appetite at the moment, is not yet producing good earnings, but it will do in the future. That is a platform for future Wealth earnings that we’re continuing to accumulate. And I’d liken it to what we did in the deposit book. We’ve still accumulated deposits from good operating accounts, particularly in wholesale banking and retail banking non-interest bearing operating accounts, and we did that during the times when they weren’t earning a revenue stream, and now we’re getting the benefit of that, and that’s exactly what we’re doing on Wealth. We’re continuing to expand customer acquisition, asset acquisition, in order to build a platform for future Wealth revenue growth. Thank you.",False,8.0,0

Ewen, I just wanted to say congratulations – look forward to hearing what you do next. Can I just squeeze in two questions, please? Sorry to come back to net interest income, but the guide for next year I am really struggling to make sense of. I do appreciate there’s a ‘greater than’ symbol that’s sitting in front of that guidance, but, if I was just to mechanically take your $32 billion guide this year, the Q4 exit NIM run rate or NII run rate annualises at around $36 billion for next year. You’re basically assuming absolutely no incremental rate benefit in your next year. The assumptions that must sit behind that must be extremely conservative. I appreciate you’re talking about betas above 50%. Please can you just help us understand a bit more exactly if there’s something we’re missing and the extent to which those numbers are conservative. And then secondly I wondered if you had an update for us on the impact of IFRS 17 on your P&L. I’m mindful that actually we’re some two months away from the implementation of it. You’ve given us some guidance before. Could you help us understand the impact on NII, fees and costs? The reason I’m asking is because your fee income performance, your non-interest income performance in Q3, is actually quite robust. If I add back in the $600 million of mark-to-market negatives that you had, you’re actually annualising at quite a healthy clip.

We’re not able to – and we’re giving our guidance at the moment based on IFRS 4 rather than IFRS 17. I think we are going to be in that unsatisfactory position for a few quarters as we work to give you a IFRS 17-adjusted view of the world in the coming quarters. But, just to repeat what we said a couple of quarters ago, we expect reported earnings to be down by around two-thirds. I think, as part of that, you need to adjust out the impact of MCU, and we expect TNAV to be down around $3 billion and that the net impact on RoTE as a result of that to be relatively de minimis. I think the latest internal numbers we’re looking at is around 10 basis points of impact on 2023 RoTE, but those numbers are still being worked on. So, look, I appreciate it’s an unsatisfactory position for all of you. We are working as hard as we can to get to a position where we can provide you clarity, or better clarity, and when we can, we’ll update the market. Just on the comments on the maths of 4 times 9 to get to 36, I think you do need to add the $1.3 billion on top of that for the switch into trading income. That is an uplift in the guidance that we’re giving and in addition to that annualised rate of $36 billion. I think we would say $37.3 billion plays $36 billion in your maths and then revert to the conservatism or caution on other assumptions we’re making. The reason for that is just we genuinely think we are facing a relatively unprecedented period, given the sharpness of rate rises that we’ve seen, and we are generally trying to be cautious on giving you guidance over the next couple of quarters.

And you’re going to have a continuation of good fee growth in Global Payment Solutions, in both CMB and GB&M. I don’t see that trend declining. I see that trend continuing of good fee generation there.

We are making it a reality for our customers. Our results today are evidence of that, and I’m pleased that our performance also demonstrates that our people are living and breathing our values, particularly the fourth value, which is ‘get it done’. I will demonstrate during the discussion today that we have achieved a lot over the last three years and that we are committed to doing even more. I want to start by telling you the three elements I’m going to cover in the presentation today. Transformation was the first phase of our strategy execution. Three years ago, fair criticism of HSBC was that unprofitable or subscale businesses and clients were dragging down good profitability from our international proposition and from the profits generated in Hong Kong and the UK. I’m pleased to say we’ve addressed this. Our international connectivity is now underpinned by good, broad-based profit generation around the world. Delivery in 2022 is all about the good set of results we’ve just announced. I will come to the detail later, but I’m pleased adjusted profits before tax were up 17%. We’re firmly on track to achieve our returns target for 2023 onwards, and we expect to have substantial distribution capacity for higher dividends, more buybacks and, potentially, a special dividend in early 2024. But there’s also so much more we can achieve. So the final element of the presentation is growth and returns. It’s all about how we will further improve performance going forward. As we’ve transformed, we’ve built a strong platform for the future that will enable us to meet our customers’ needs, and I expect wealth, payments and FX, fee income, technology investment and climate finance to provide new value creation opportunities in the years to come. So taking these three messages in turn, starting with transformation, three years ago we set out to tackle a series of fundamental problems – loss-making businesses, unprofitable products and clients, inefficient capital, and costs. Our transformation journey had six components, which I will run through in more detail on the following slides. Our international connectivity remains our biggest differentiator, and we’ve grown and protected many of our market-leading international businesses during the three years, but we’ve done that while repositioning unprofitable and non-strategic businesses, particularly in the US and Europe. That’s resulted in a client proposition that is now built on international connectivity underpinned by our broad base of geographic profit penetration. All of this has been supported by strong cost discipline, which has enabled us to drive a step change in our technology investment. We’ve also removed the dilutive scrip dividend and introduced a new sustainable dividend policy, which is delivering attractive ongoing returns for shareholders and enabling us to invest in the business. Crucially, we’ve created a strong platform for improved growth and returns, with new opportunities for value creation. Our focus now is to capitalise on these opportunities. Taking each of these in turn, in terms of international connectivity, our greatest strength remains our ability to connect the world’s major trading and investment blocs. We are the world’s number one trade bank, top three for FX, and a leading payments company. Last year, we processed more than $600 trillion of payments globally. International is also core to our value proposition. Around 45% of our wholesale client business is done cross-border. In Wealth and Personal Banking, we now have six million international customers, which is up 7% on last year. This is significant, because our international customers generate around twice the average revenue as our domestic customers. Our international connectivity has also translated into higher revenue and market share. Since 2019, we’ve grown Global Payment Solutions revenue by 6% CAGR, Trade revenue by 5% CAGR, and revenue from Global Foreign Exchange has increased by 12% CAGR. Overall, Transaction Banking revenue was up by 7% CAGR over the last three years. We also see an opportunity to create even more value by continuing to grow these product lines over the coming years. The next slide drills down into how we reshaped our portfolio. Across the group, we reduced risk-weighted assets by a cumulative $128 billion, well in excess of our target of $110 billion. We made key strategic decisions to sell our US mass-market retail bank, our retail banking operations in France, and our banking business in Canada. We’ve also announced exits from Russia and Greece, with other potential smaller exits being considered. We’ve reallocated more of our capital to Asia – and by Asia, I mean the whole of Asia. We want to build strong wealth businesses in mainland China, India and Singapore, alongside strong business we already have in Hong Kong. We accelerated this process through bolt-on acquisitions and investments in the last 12 months. We’ve completed the integration of AXA Singapore and L&T Investment Management in India. And in mainland China, as well as continuing the organic buildout of Pinnacle, we had seven main licence approvals since 2020. These enabled us to take full ownership of HSBC Life China and increase our majority stake in HSBC Shanghai to 90%. As I said earlier, we now have an international connectivity underpinned by good, broad-based profit generation, as this slide demonstrates. This is the single biggest change compared to three years ago. I won’t go through all the numbers on this slide, but I will mention a few. The total amount of adjusted profit contributed by Asia excluding Hong Kong and mainland China was more than $4 billion in 2022 – an increase of 23% compared to 2019. Mainland China excluding associate income from BoCom contributed around $1 billion of profit last year in a challenging year, and India contributed a further $900 million of adjusted profit. Outside Asia, the Middle East generated $1.8 billion of adjusted profits last year. HSBC UK delivered $5 billion of adjusted profits. And we’ve got leaner, more profitable businesses in continental Europe and the US. Continental Europe generated adjusted profits of over $2 billion, and the US adjusted profits of over $1 billion. Both of those businesses were close to loss-making, or loss-making, three years ago. Mexico is another high-returning business. It delivered a return on tangible equality of 18%, and worthy of note is that 60% of new-to-bank retail customers last year were acquired through corporate client relationships by the provision of employee banking services and payroll services, demonstrating the value of our connected model in the country. The next slide focuses on the tight cost discipline we’ve demonstrated and we will maintain. The reduction of our global corporate real estate, our branch network and operations headcount have all delivered material savings, and we expect to achieve further efficiencies in the years to come, but the most important point on this slide is that we’ve used these cost savings to increase investment in technology. 18% out in operations costs, 18% in in technology investment. This is spending in the right place to build the business of the future, and it has enabled us to fundamentally change the way we operate. Our formal three-year cost reduction programme has now ended, but we still expect more than $1 billion of cost saves to flow through into 2023 from that programme. There will be no easing up at all in our cost discipline, but I think it’s right that we will also continue to identify opportunities to create efficiencies going forward that will deliver sustainable cost savings in future years, with any associated costs from those programmes reported through the cost line, not treated below the line as significant items. Whilst we have transformed, we have also invested in areas that we expect to deliver strong growth and returns in the future. A strong balance sheet has always been a defining characteristic of HSBC, and we’ve continued to grow the deposit book and assets over the past three years. This is benefiting our performance now that rates have increased. Developing our Wealth business has also been a strategic priority. Our investments over the past three years are gaining traction, reflected in revenues of over $9 billion in 2022, excluding market impacts, which is a 9% CAGR compared to 2020. It’s also reflected by increased insurance market share in Hong Kong. The next slide sets out the impact of the step change we made in technology investment. The faster services, reduced friction and more competitive products that this investment has enabled has been critical to improving the customer experience. With our digital propositions, our aim is to build once, deploy globally. Our upgraded mobile banking app is available in 24 markets and has around 13 million active customers. HSBC Kinetic, our award-winning business banking app in the UK, now has around 53,000 new-to-bank customers. And as well as Global Wallet and Global Money, we have rolled out our new digital trade finance platform in Hong Kong and the UK, so that our market-leading businesses are well positioned for the next 10 years. In addition, we are launching new products like HSBC Orion, which is our proprietary tokenisation bond issuance platform using blockchain. The first public bond was priced on it last month. Turning now to delivery in 2022, I’m pleased with our ’22 performance. As you know from Q3, the reported numbers include a $2.4 billion impairment for the planned disposal of our French retail business. Adjusted revenue was up 18% on the back of a strong net interest income performance, and adjusted profits were up 17%. We delivered a good cost outcome in a high inflation environment by containing adjusted cost growth to around 1%. Expected credit losses were a $3.6 billion charge. The dividend was 32 cents per share. The CET1 ratio was 14.2%. And we achieved a reported RoTE of 9.9%, or 11.6% once you strip out significant items, so we’re firmly on track to deliver returns of 12% plus from 2023 onwards. I’m now going to quickly run through our four strategic pillars, starting with ‘Focus on our strengths’. Our market-leading Commercial Banking franchise had a very good year. Adjusted revenue was up almost 30% on last year. There was further good growth in Trade, and Global Payment Solutions benefited from higher interest rates. It was encouraging to see fee income grow by 8%, and there was strong adjusted revenue growth across all regions. In Wealth and Personal Banking, revenue was up 16% overall. Personal Banking had a particularly strong year, and lending balances were up 3%, despite subdued economic conditions in Hong Kong. Wealth was also up, excluding market impacts. One of the best signs that our Wealth strategy is gaining traction is net new invested assets of $80 billion in 2022 – an increase of 25% compared to 2021. This is highly promising for future revenue generation. There was also continued growth in the value of new business in our Asia insurance franchise, despite adverse market conditions. Again, there was strong revenue growth in all geographies. Global Banking and Markets also performed very well in 2022. Markets and Securities Services was up 14%, due mainly to rate rises and a standout Foreign Exchange performance. Banking was up 17%, also mainly due to higher rates. In a challenging year for investment banking globally, this good performance underlines the resilience of our model. Collaboration revenues from cross-selling Global Banking and Markets products to customers in Commercial Banking and Wealth and Personal Banking were up 6%. There was strong growth in client business booked in the east but originated in Europe and the Americas, up around 30% on the previous year. This again underlines geographic diversification of our revenues, and that our greatest strength is connecting the world’s major economic blocs. The next slide is on ’Digitise at scale’, our second pillar. It illustrates the outcomes of our increasing investment in technology. Within retail and wholesale, penetration levels increased materially. More than 75% of Commercial Banking customers are now digitally active, and almost half of retail customers are now mobile active. We also believe we can grow these numbers further. The next slide covers ‘Energise for growth’ and how we’re changing the culture of HSBC. Taking out unnecessary layers of management has helped increase our speed and agility. In our last staff survey, the number of colleagues who say that work processes allow them to work efficiently were six percentage points above the sector benchmark. Confidence within the organisation has also increased. 77% of our colleagues told us that they are confident about our future which is seven percentage points above the sector benchmark and an increase of three percentage points since 2021. We made further progress against our diversity commitments, with increases in representation of female leaders and black heritage leaders. 36% of our key leadership roles are now located in Asia, and, if I reflect on the leadership of our Asian business five years ago versus today, I see much more Asian heritage talent and a strong pipeline of talent coming through that we continue to develop. At the same time, we know we have more to do in all these areas. The next slide looks at our final pillar and the leading role that we play in the ‘Transition to net zero’. The amount of sustainable financing and investment provided and facilitated in 2022 was up slightly despite the market for green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked bonds being substantially down. The cumulative total amount since the start of 2020 is now $211 billion. We’ve set new targets for on balance sheet-financed emissions for six high-emitting sectors. We recognise that methodologies and data for measuring emissions will continue to evolve, and our own disclosures will therefore continue to evolve as well. We continue to reduce emissions across our own operations and supply chain, which were down more than 58% since 2019. Finally, my third message is about growth and returns. We are firmly on track to deliver returns of at least 12% in 2023, but there’s also so much more we can achieve, and we can deliver higher growth and returns as we move out of transformation and into value creation. We plan to grow our core businesses, which are built on our international connectivity and the strong broad-based growth we have now spanning every region. The investment we’ve made in new sources of value creation, wealth, payments and FX, fee income, technology and sustainability will all increase and diversify our revenue, and we won’t be relinquishing our grip on costs because it enables us to spend in areas that create value. Our improved profitability and sustainable dividend policy will give us a substantial distribution capacity, with a 50% dividend pay-out ratio established for 2023 and 2024, a return to quarterly dividends from Q1, the consideration of buybacks brought forward to the Q1 results and, on top of this, the consideration of a special dividend of 21 cents to be paid in early 2024 subject to the completion of the Canada transaction and necessary approvals. So our current strategy remains the best way to improve returns for our shareholders, and now I’ll hand over to Georges.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2022\230221-annual-results-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Noel. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining in person and via webcast today. I am glad to see many familiar faces, and I’m looking forward to meeting those of you I haven’t had the opportunity to meet yet. Before I get into the Q4 numbers and given this is the first time I’m in front of you in this job, I’d like to share a few thoughts about my approach. You may know I’ve already spent 18 years with this firm running various businesses, including as CEO of the Middle East and most recently co-CEO of Global Banking and Markets, but what you may not know is that I spent most of this time creating efficiencies to achieve the purpose of investing in growth. So indeed I oversaw the sale of non-strategic businesses in the Middle East, and this allowed us to focus our investments into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and when I led GB&M with Greg I drove the rationalisation of our product lines and booking structure to focus on areas where we had competitive advantage and could best serve our clients. So, as a result, I materially reduced RWAs and costs and repurposed those saves to invest in technology for the future of the business. I believe, therefore, that growth cannot be achieved without a clear focus on our strengths. Therefore, purposeful transformation and elimination of areas of marginal impact are paramount. Equally and as importantly, clinical delivery and keeping a tight grip on spending are key to unlocking the potential to invest. So, as I approach this next phase, I want to emphasise my three focus areas: so, one, continuing to support our business to deliver growth and return, which is underpinned by continuing to improve customer service and attracting and retaining talent; number two is continuing to generate the further efficiencies required to support the investment I just spoke about; and number three, therefore the guiding principle that supports all of this, will be absolute cost and capital discipline. I’ll turn now to the Q4 numbers. Reported profits before tax were at $5.2 billion, up 95% on last year’s fourth quarter. Adjusted profits before tax were at $6.8 billion, up 92%. Adjusted revenues were up 38%, driven mainly by net interest income growth of 53% and higher non-net interest income. We booked an expected credit loss charge of $1.4 billion in the quarter, and then adjusted costs were up 2% due to higher technology spend and higher performance-related pay. Compared to the previous quarter, lending and deposits were both down, but this was largely due to our banking operations in Canada being reclassified as held for sale. So, if you excluded this, lending was down 2% mainly due to subdued conditions in Hong Kong, and deposits were up. For the full year, the dividend is at 32 cents per share with a second interim dividend of 23 cents per share. Also after strong capital generation and lower currency-adjusted RWAs our CET1 ratio was at 14.2%, an increase of 80 basis points on the third quarter. Our effective tax rate for 2022 was at 5%. This includes credit from the recognition of deferred tax assets related primarily in the UK as well as other deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position reassessments. If you excluded these credits, then the effective tax rate for 2022 was 19.2%, and we expect our normalised effective tax rate for 2023 to be around 20%. This slide now shows another strong adjusted revenue performance, with overall growth of 38% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven mostly by recent rate levels. There was strong growth in all businesses, as Noel indicated. Wealth and Personal Banking revenue was up 45%, Commercial Banking up 51% and Global Banking and Markets up 16%. Net fee income was down 11%. This was mainly due to, number one, lower wealth distribution revenue driven by lower equities turnover in Hong Kong in general and mutual fund sales, and this is reflecting soft equity markets in general; and, two, lower capital markets and advisory activity, which also impacted Global Banking and Markets. On this slide, you can see that reported net interest income was at $9.6 billion, up 41% on last year’s fourth quarter. The net interest margin was at 174 basis points, up 17 basis points on the third quarter of 2022 and up 55 basis points on the fourth quarter 2021. We continue to guide to a full-year 2023 net interest income of at least $36 billion on an IFRS 4 basis. Let me unpack this a little bit. Our guidance, therefore, is unchanged to what we indicated at quarter three. We do view this as a conservative guidance, given current FX rate tailwinds and the strong fourth quarter performance, so this is why we’re emphasising on ‘at least $36 billion’. This is very important. There are a number of factors that we need to be aware of which is driving us to be conservative in our approach. The first one is the potential lag effect of customer migration to time deposits; the second one is the competitive pressures we may be facing in deposit pricing; and the third one is obviously the impact of foreign exchange and the future rates outlook. We do note consensus and we’re not seeking to change it. We will be updating you on this NII performance throughout the year – I think at the Q1 results – when we will also incorporate the impact of IFRS 17 in our guidance. We retain a cautious outlook on loan growth in the short term but continue to expect mid single-digit percentage annual loan growth in the medium-to-long term. Historically, our earnings have been very sensitive to short-term interest rate movements, and we have started to address this lately with additional structural hedging positions given the current rate levels. I will certainly update you later in the year on the progress towards this net interest income stabilisation or mitigation. Turning to credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1.4 billion, which includes $0.6 billion for our mainland China corporate real estate exposure. If you excluded this portfolio, the ECL charge was $0.8 billion or around 30 basis points of loans with limited signs of credit deterioration. So our main indicators therefore are still holding up. Given the macroeconomic headwinds, we expect an ECL charge of around 40 basis points for the full year 2022. Our ECL charge as a percentage of average loans includes loan balances held for sale from the planned sales of Canada and France retail. Therefore, when you exclude them, you need to add another four to five basis points on top of that number. specifically, so in the spirit of transparency and having done lot of work on the dynamics of this portfolio, let me zoom in and walk you through that logic. First, our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. The onshore portfolio is performing and the security is working. The exposure booked in Hong Kong reduced by around 20% in the second half of the year from $11.7 billion in Q2 to $9.4 billion, and this is primarily due to repayments. In Q4 we did see some further deterioration in that sector, so we looked at the portfolio again and decided to increase the share of sub-standard and credit-impaired exposures to around 16% of that portfolio. That’s up from around 35% in Q2, and by doing so we increased our provisions accordingly. So now, if you zoom in on the $6 billion exposure that we now raised as sub-standard or credit-impaired, $1.1 billion is secured with minimal ECLs due to the security held. So then against the remaining $4.9 billion we are holding $1.7 billion of provision, a circa 35% coverage ratio, and within this our coverage ratio against the unsecured credit-impaired exposure is around 55%. We also ran a number of downside scenarios, and I’ve included some of that analysis in the deck, which we can discuss in Q&A, if you wish to, but, to be clear, we did not need to factor those downside scenarios in the 31 December number, and since then our view of the sector has become more positive following the more accommodative policy stance that we’ve been seeing. So we are currently comfortable with our coverage level, but we will continue to monitor the situation very closely. So I’ll move on to costs now. Fourth quarter operating expenses were up 2% on the same period last year as most of the cost saves were broadly offset by technology spend and higher performance-related pay. The UK bank levy for 2022 was offset by credits from overpayments we made related to prior years. We expect an annual charge of around $200 million for 2023. Rebasing prior year costs at constant currency for hyperinflationary economies – that’s specifically Turkey and Argentina – added around $200 million of cost growth to our adjusted cost base, so around half of the increase when you’re comparing 2022 to 2021. Our formal cost to achieve transformation programme, what we call the CTA programme, is now complete. We did achieve $5.6 billion of gross cost saves, which was somewhat at the top of our expectations, with an associated cost to achieve spend of $6.5 billion, which was towards the lower end of our guided range. As Noel said, we’re still seeking and finding opportunities to create efficiencies that will deliver sustainable cost saves in future years. The costs thereof will be above the line. We’re now considering up to $300 million of additional costs for severance in 2023. This will enable us to take out further management layers. These costs will be reported in our costs line. Taking this into account, we’re now aiming for approximately 3% cost growth in 2023, which remains a tough target in a high inflation environment. You should probably expect our 2023 costs to be marginally higher in Q1 as we’re absorbing the run-down of the residual costs from the cost to achieve programme. I’ll move on to capital now, and the three points I wanted to call out here is, first, our CET1 ratio at 14.2%, up 80 basis points on the previous quarter. This is mainly due to an $8.5 billion capital benefit from higher profits and lower FX-adjusted underlying RWAs. Second, we’re back in our CET1 ratio target operating range, which remains 14% to 14.5% for the medium term. The intention is to manage this range further down from medium to longer term and, given now we have returned to our target operating range six months earlier than we initially indicated, we have brought forward the consideration of future buybacks to the Q1 results. And, finally, on the proceeds generated by the planned sale of our Canada banking operations, subject to the completion of the transaction, of course, we anticipate three potential uses: one, a special dividend of 21 cents per share, which will be the first priority use; two, we will consider additional buybacks over and above any existing buyback programmes; and, three, we will retain capital as required within the business, and we will update you on these later in the year. Finally, on guidance, we are reiterating our guidance of at least $36 billion of net interest income for 2023. We remain on track to deliver a return on tangible equity of at least 12% from ’23 onwards and, as I explained, we are now targeting approximately 3% cost growth in 2023. Our capital allocation target for Asia remains unchanged at 50%. Now, given the changes in the macroeconomic environment together with IFRS 17, we do not intend to continue to track insurance and fees as a percentage of group revenue nor Wealth and Personal Banking as a percentage of group tangible equity. Needless to say, these businesses remain absolutely strategically important and we remain absolutely committed to growing them. In summary, this was a good set of results. We had revenue growth from all businesses, but we want to further increase and broaden revenues while protecting net interest income. We remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers through high quality propositions and our multi-channel international distribution network. As I said at the beginning, I have three focus areas: supporting the businesses to deliver growth and returns, continuing to generate further efficiencies and the strict cost and capital discipline. Higher returns in 2023 would give us substantial distribution capacity in the future. A 50% dividend pay-out ratio has been established for 2023 and 2024. We will return to quarterly dividends from quarter 1. Considerations of buybacks have been brought forward to the quarter 1 results and we have signalled a 21 cents per share special dividend as the first priority use of proceeds generated by the planned sale of HSBC Canada, all followed by increased investment in growth and further buybacks in 2024 and 2025, subject of course to continued strong capital levels. With that, I’ll ask Richard to take us to Q&A. Thank you very much. RICHARD O’CONNOR, GLOBAL HEAD OF INVESTOR RELATIONS: Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. As per normal throughout these live events, we’ll take a few questions from the floor to start with and then we’ll go to the telephones and then coming back to the floor. As ever, please give your name and institution. Those in the auditorium, please wait for the mics to come around and please stick to a maximum of two questions per person and, if you’ve got more than that, we’ll obviously try and come around again towards the end of the Q&A session.

I had questions on that net interest income piece. I was wondering if you could talk us a little bit through how the published rate sensitivities have changed versus what was published at the interim results. It looks like there’s been some quite significant changes and it might be impacted by the NII stabilisation programme that you talked about. That would be really helpful. And then my second question – just when we think about the recommencement of the buyback, given the good capital performance, when we think ahead to the first quarter how should we think about how you’ll manage within the 14-14.5% range? Can we consider that any capital generation that lets the group land north of 14.5% might be, say, paid down to the mid-point, or something like that? But that would be quite helpful. Thanks.",True,0.0,0

I think it’s important to keep it pretty consistent, but I do want to emphasise what Georges said. It’s at least $36 billion. We do know the consensus is higher than $36 billion. The consensus currently is around $37 billion. Georges said earlier, we’re not looking to move consensus. We’re comfortable with where consensus is. As Georges said, there are three factors that will play out over the next few weeks and months, and they are deposit migration, competitive pressures and foreign exchange. That will determine exactly what we mean by ‘at least’, but we’ll update on that each quarter. I just want to reiterate: we’re not looking to change consensus from its current level in the market. And then on the rate sensitivity, Georges, do you want to just explain how that shift has taken place?",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\230221-annual-results-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Noel. Thanks, Omar. So if you look at the downside 100 basis point shift we are reporting now $4 billion. You may have a record of $6 billion previously. The reduction is mainly due to two factors. Two-thirds of it is due to the rate level changing – obviously the higher the rate, the less you’re compressed by the zero downside challenge – and one-third is due to the additional structural hedging we have started putting on. We’d probably expect that one-third proportion to increase as we go forward. To look at the upside, the number is $3.5 billion, 100 basis points up. I’d caution you that this number is somewhat theoretical, i.e. we’re assuming 50% betas and no balance sheet change, so no deposit migration, etc. So we know that the real upside for higher rates will be lower than this. It will obviously be higher than where we are today, but lower than the $3.5 billion addition because you have to factor in a natural deposit migration and probably higher betas than 50% at the next juncture of rate increases. On your second question, we’re not giving an exact target. We’re just stating a range: 14-14.5%. We’re leaving it to our judgement and obviously the relevant approvals to assess what is excess capital beyond that 14%, but 14.5% is not necessarily the lower bound. It’s a range, and therefore it’s not a lower bound at which we judge excess capital.",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\230221-annual-results-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Martin Leitgeb,Goldman Sachs,"Good morning. Could I just have one on NII and one on growth? Just in terms of net interest margin, a strong progression again quarter on quarter, both in Hong Kong, so HBAP, and the UK ring-fenced bank. I was just wondering could you give us a steer on how you think of the shape of net interest margins on these two core businesses going forward? Should we expect a broad picture of stability from here, in terms of hedge providing further tailwind, hopefully helping to offset migration, and would you expect the impact of deposit migration to be fairly front-end loaded into 2023 or could this be a longer term process? And secondly, on growth, the improved and higher profitability outlook as we head into 2023 and some of the disposal proceeds from Canada being earmarked for growth and investment. I was just wondering, what growth opportunities are you most excited about and how to square that up with the guidance for low, single-digit growth this year? Thank you.",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2022\230221-annual-results-2022-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Let me deal with the second one first and then Georges can come back and add any flavour on deposit migration. I think with the economic uncertainty that exists around the world at the moment, I think it’s wise to be cautious on expecting too much underlying growth, particularly I think in the demand for term lending from corporates. I think they’re in a cautionary mode at the moment. So that’s why we’re saying we’re not expecting in the near term significant growth, particularly in the demand for term lending. I still think there’s growth potential in working capital finance, trade. A lot will depend on global GDP. That’s why we’ve been a little bit more cautious near term, whilst also seeing that, once we get through those uncertainties, there’ll be growth potential beyond that. What I’d also say, though: it’s not equal. It’s not even. We’re seeing a very strong business performance in the Middle East at the moment. We’re seeing good growth there. We’re still gaining market share in mortgages. Granted, the market in the UK has shrunk for mortgages, probably around about 30%, but we’re still seeking to grow market share and we can do so wisely and safely. I’m still seeing very strong business activity levels in India. It’s a strong market with good growth potential and Hong Kong has rebounded – not yet translating into demand for term lending from corporates, but we are seeing some early signs in January of Wealth activity starting to increase as the border with mainland China opened up and economic activity in Hong Kong opened. That’s particularly focused more on investors willing to invest in the debt markets and structured products, rather than equity. I think they’re waiting to see how the equity markets move forward. We delivered $1 billion of adjusted profit in mainland China last year. So that’s a good outcome and that was in a tough year. So I am expecting an economic rebound in mainland China. It will not be unaffected by the global slowdown. I think we’re well-positioned, if there’s growth in the world, through our Asia franchise, our international franchise and Middle East. We’re well- positioned, but it’s hard to predict exactly how much growth will be in the economy – so we’ve got to be a bit cautious. In terms of linking it to Canada, we’ve been quite clear in our preferred use, our priority use, of the proceeds of Canada. The first priority use will be a special dividend of 21 cents and I think you can understand why we’re doing that. The cancellation of the dividend for our retail shareholders was a significant event a few years ago and we want to try and put that right with the Canada transaction once that closes. The balance of the rest of the proceeds between retention and buyback, we haven’t formed a view on at this point in time. We’ll look at that, at the circumstances, when the Canada transaction closes. It will a combination probably of buyback and some retention, but I’m not giving guidance at this stage on what the balance is. Georges, do you just want to add any further comments on NII? I’m going to reiterate, for the avoidance of doubt: we’re not seeking to move guidance on NII. We tend not to give guidance on NIM.",False,1.0,0

Martin, a couple of comments that probably would help you figure it out. The first one is deposit migration and pass through is already happening, so we’ve already started to see it all the way from Q4. On that point, in Hong Kong the market tracks deposits, term deposits, we’re substantially below the market, but we’re tracking along the same direction. We’ve seen that the market in the UK – we’ve already increased our rates about seven times last year, so it kind of reflects this. So it is already happening. The second thing I wanted to say is that we haven’t seen such speed in rate hikes and such level of rates for a couple of decades now, which means however much we build and evaluate our forecast on expected customer behaviour and competitive pressures, we don’t know, and this is why we wanted to stay somewhat conservative, but we are conservative for those reasons, to assess that. But, third, I think the proposition we have in both Hong Kong and the UK, since you called out these markets, is leading. Most of our customer deposits are transactional and operating accounts, which means we do expect stronger performance than what you may see as market numbers. The one thing I just want to call out in Hong Kong to be mindful of is HIBOR, which is obviously a leading indicator of NII performance. Hong Kong has moved all the way to 5.3%, 5.4%, and dropped all the way to 2.4%, where I think they’re on 2.9% today. There is a short-term headwind on NII due to that, but we believe it’s only a short-term headwind due to inflows into Hong Kong and that will resolve itself.",False,1.0,0

I’ve just got a question on revenue, principally around non-interest income. I think you’re selling yourself a little bit short today around the revenue guidance. There’s a lot of focus on net interest income and the $36 billion guide, but my understanding is that that includes a much bigger trading interest expense than the kind of numbers you were calling out in Q3. I think you told us to factor in a great than $1.3 billion drag in 2023, but it looks like that’s annualising much north of $5 billion. So it looks like the net interest income that you’re calling out has a much bigger negative in it and I guess the assumption would be that there would be some positive trading income on that trading interest expense, which presumably is a big positive for non-interest income. I wouldn’t want you to audit my spreadsheet, but I think I can get to a non-interest income number that’s somewhere between $25 billion and $26 billion.",True,2.0,0

With the assumption that the money the bank lends to the trading books in Global Banking and Markets stays where it is today and the rates stay where they are today, then it is not unreasonable to assume you can annualise the Q4 $1.3 billion for the full year 2023 and therefore, yes, you will be a couple of billion up year-on- year on the non-NII part, which is related to funding the trading books.",False,2.0,0

Previously on the cost guidance, you talked about this $1 billion of cost saves at 3%, 5% inflation, net 2%, and now today there’s the $300 million severance, taking you up to 3% cost growth. Just thinking more about the medium term, your messaging was ‘no easing up on cost discipline and saves’, but obviously the severance charges are somewhat lower than the CTA that you booked last year. So, presumably, the attached cost savings are going to be lower than what you had as a tailwind following through into this year. So when we think about the cost base in the medium term and the underlying growth run rate, obviously inflation dependent, but do you see it slightly higher than 3% or do you think 3% is a medium term run rate?",True,3.0,0

I think it’s too early. I think we’ve got to see where we go to on the inflation curve for the rest of the year. There’s good progress on inflation, but it’s still unpredictable. On your point, which I do want to come back on, our investment in technology continues. We’re now at 20% of our total cost base in tech. That technology is improving customer propositions, but it’s also improving processes, digitising processes more and more. We have a long-term programme of cost takeout over the future years – 2023, 2024 and 2025. That’s already underway. From the IT investment that’s already embedded in our plan, that will generate cost savings on a recurring basis as we digitise. So I don’t always need severance to get cost savings, because I’ve got IT investment to give me some cost savings and that is going to be continuing. Clearly, the more notice you have on that, the more ability you have to achieve that without severance because you can do natural attrition. Typically, the attrition rate in processing centres and in much of the cost base could be 10-15% per annum. Some places could be as high as 20% per annum attrition. So you have lead time ability to reposition your headcount without the need for severance as those processes are re-engineered, and we’re going to be doing more of that going forward and therefore not have to call on things like CTA in the quantum we called on it in the past three years.

We ran that plausible downside as at 31 December without knowledge or the benefit of the positive policy moves that took place in January. So it’s a like-for-like. We topped up the provisions. We thought the provisions were appropriate. We decided to do some scenario analysis. That’s the result of the scenario analysis. We didn’t think that scenario required to be provided against, or we would have put it in the balance sheet. We decided that was not required. We had sufficient coverage, but we wanted to run a scenario that said, ‘What is the plausible downside if things continue to get worse?’ And that scenario, as existed in Q4, continued into 2023. Since then positive measures have happened, particularly the provision of liquidity to the offshore market and the rebooting of the China economy post-Covid. You could argue, in my terminology, that has changed the dynamics of that plausible downside – either the probability of it or the quantum of it – but we’ve not re-run it. It is what it was at 31 December. What we try to give you is a scoping of what could happen if things continued the way they were. Now, I’m not going to answer the question, is it in the 40 basis points or isn’t in the 40 basis points? We feel comfortable, whether it’s looking at the global economy, our UK business, our Hong Kong business, China commercial real estate. We’re guiding you to an overall ECL charge of around 40 basis points, the composition of which we’re not going to blow out into any finer detail.

Just to be very clear, it is a downside. It is not a forecast. We are very comfortable where we are now in terms of provisioning, and we have not factored $1 billion in the 40 basis points.

You know what we’ve classified as sub-standard and credit impaired, and that’s 60% of the optional portfolio. We’ve taken quite a robust view there. You’ve seen the level of provisions we associated.

Thanks very much for taking the questions, firstly on net interest income, and a quick follow-up on impairments. Firstly, in Hong Kong specifically, it’s good NII mostly in the quarter, but you’re flagging further negative deposit mix, HIBOR has drifted lower, and lending positions had been subdued. I’m just trying to get a sense, do you think, NII in Hong Kong specifically, should rise from Q1 run rate or whether we’re capped up there or we need HIBOR to really recouple with US rates to get an NII to move from the Q4 run rate And linked to that, in terms of deposit mix and deposit beta in your two largest markets, Hong Kong and the UK, you’re obviously further headed in that journey in Hong Kong. Is the guidance from here predicated on a greater headwind coming in Hong Kong or UK when you think about deposit mix and beta specifically? And then, just a quick follow-up on impairments. You’ve nudged up the guidance, and you now expect to be above normal. I appreciate your comments just now, that you don’t want to get into all the detail in terms of composition there, but I just wondered if you can share any colour on which markets do you think there’s a bit more of a risk about being above normalised cost of risk or, to put it another way, any markets you’re incrementally more cautious since Q3 results?

So on Hong Kong deposits, first, the HIBOR impact, we believe, is a short-term issue, and this is a correction, as Noel was explaining earlier, but you also have to look at what additional deposits this may mean for us. We’re looking at this. Obviously, it’s a headwind for NII. It’s certainly a tailwind for the economic outlook of Hong Kong, its growth and the capability of growing the overall deposit and loan pool. So this is why we’re yet to really see how the impact of the short-term HIBOR is going to be. In terms of deposit mix – and this is valid for both Hong Kong and UK deposit mix and betas – this is happening already, as I did say. We are substantially better than the market averages that are reported, due to the nature of the deposits we have. They are mostly operating, transaction deposits, and we already factored in our guidance the fact that we will see additional, or a continuation of these migrations taking place. So we’re very mindful that it will happen, and we’re factoring it in. The level of uncertainty we have is how much more or less, vis-à-vis, our own guidance is going to have. In the UK, as I said earlier, we’ve already increased rates seven times. You should expect that any 100-basis point higher from here will see marginally higher betas than the one we experienced before, but that’s just the nature of how it will work, both for us and for the rest of the market.

We’ve talked a lot about China real estate, and I’ve already said that Southeast Asia is performing well, the Middle East is performing well. We have, principally in Europe, an international wholesale corporate book, and in the US, an international wholesale corporate book, so not exposed to retail credit pressures there. So that brings you to the UK, and I’ll tell you, on the UK at the moment, we’re not seeing any signs of stress at the moment of any significance outside of normality in UK retail banking. I think it’s performing well. The mortgage book is holding up well. We’re not seeing any major signs of stress in our book. I’m not saying the market isn’t stressed, but I think in our book, we’re comfortable. And we’re much smaller in unsecured lending than many of our UK competitors, but again, we’re not seeing any major signs of stress in the UK retail unsecured book. It is fair to say that UK corporates, particularly smaller corporates to middle-market corporates, the inflationary pressures are having a negative impact on cashflow. But again, I’d say that’s marginal deterioration in our book at the moment. It’s not material deterioration. It’s understandable pressures. So we’re not seeing that turn in the corner into very negative territory at all at the moment. Now, we’ll have to see how that plays out for the rest of the year, but if I look at the 40 basis points, and you look at the pockets of where there are potential ECL charges could come from, we’ve given you a view on China real estate that says there’s still a way to go for the China real estate market to get back to a level of normality, but it’s turned the corner, and it’s in positive territory. But there’s still some way to go. So there’s some potential usage of the 40 basis points there. There’s some potential usage of the 40 basis points in the UK, but at the moment, it would be normal usage levels in the UK, which may be some possibly slightly higher usage levels in smaller to mid-market corporates, but it’s marginal at the moment. And then, the rest of the world are putting normal to positive territory. The Middle East is experiencing a very strong economy at the moment.

The one thing I will reiterate for you, though, just to help, we have programmes running that are part of business as usual, through digitisation, through technology, through simplification, process reengineering. You should expect that we will always have an element of cost savings coming through as part of continuing to drive efficiency, and I will use some of those cost savings to mitigate some of the inflationary impacts that exist in the environment. But I’m not going to quantify that trade-off between inflation and constant reengineering. But I think you’re wrong to assume, in your arithmetic that you just had, that we’ve stopped trying to drive efficiency through. We will always try to drive some level of efficiency into the cost base as a mitigant against some of the inflation repressions. So I wouldn’t flow it all the way through, necessarily, into your models as a one-for-one calculation.

So the bank levy benefit, i.e. the credit, is a 2022 benefit. We have said we are expecting normalisation of the bank levy to circa $200 million for 2023, and this is already baked into our cost guidance. So the benefit is past. It’s in the 2022 1% number already, and we banked it, we knew it. And therefore, for 2023, you should strip it out. It’s already in our cost guidance. The second one is the cost saving flow through that will manifest this year in additional pay- related inflation of the overall pay pool. Again, as Noel indicated, when you’re looking beyond 2023 you have to assess how the inflation outlook is during the course of 2023. We think the outlook is improving, and we think we’ve already baked into our pay the effect of the inflation that we’ve suffered, including double-digit jurisdiction inflation, etc. So that’s not necessarily a repeat beyond 2023, at least not to the same extent. I also want to just clarify the hyperinflation impact on cost is not budgeted. In our view, this is not a real cost growth. This is just an arithmetic growth that comes from rebasing prior year costs under our constant currency reporting. So therefore, we have not planned for this. We cannot manage it.

At least the UK DTA, which was the substantial one, is gone as a significant item and therefore not in capital, and is also deducted from the dividend pay-out ratio. Other DTAs fall under the threshold deductions and get it. I don’t think there’s anything to worry about that. So therefore, I don’t think we have any headwinds on capital as we go into Q1. It’s just about the impact of profit generation, the impact of RWA growth for our CET1 ratio. I may call it out here, just to make sure that I put your mind at ease, if this is coming through. Any impairment in BoCom, sitting under significant holdings, if it were to be needed, will result in virtually no CET1 ratio impact, again, due to those capital deductions, and therefore will result into no impact on our dividend pay-out and no impact to any share buy-back programme that may be running at such time of an impairment.",False,6.0,0

Our international connectivity remains our greatest strength, and it’s now underpinned by good, broad-based profit generation. That’s a powerful combination. You can see it in the strong delivery in 2022. We’ve also got a tight grip on costs, and we’re on track to deliver our returns target, but there’s so much more we can do. We’re well positioned to further improve growth and returns, and we expect to have substantial distribution capacity for dividends, buybacks and potentially a special dividend in early 2024.

Richard, you started with disclosure, so on disclosure I’m wondering what your thought process was about doing away with adjusted disclosure. I think in some ways that might make things more difficult to interpret – issues with consensus and what’s in and what’s not, etc. I’m just interested in that and whether you’ve had any thoughts on other potential changes like moving to a banking NIM rather than having trading revenue and expenses messing things up, and whether or not the use of pro-forma figures might be quite useful when you’ve got big accounting changes coming or big disposals like Canada - just giving us pro forma today - that would be very helpful. That’s just some thoughts on disclosure. RICHARD O’CONNOR: Let’s deal with that first, Tom. Georges, if you do high level and I’ll deal with the specifics on that?",True,0.0,0

Currencies have been quite volatile, and we thought let’s take it sequentially and not create more uncertainty due to the constant currency adjustment. This one we are retaining. First, we’re moving away from the CTA programme. Second, we wanted really to convey the strong sense that we’re managing every line item in our income statement and our costs. We didn’t want any impression that things may just slip below the line and we’re not necessarily as focused and as purposeful as managing them as the ones we’re managing above the line. That’s the main intent. We will still call out notable items if there are notable items, we just raised the threshold to $250 million from the current $150 million significant item threshold, but obviously if there are notable items we will call them out and we will make sure you can see the underlying business performance from these notable items, but we’re not going to have two sets of numbers going forward apart from the FX adjusted. On your second point about banking NIM, it’s actually our intention to transition to banking NIM, and it’s our intention to do so progressively by allowing all of you to understand how we’re computing it and have a parameter for some period of time. Essentially, the main difference between the banking NIM and the current accounting NIM is the funding of the trading book. In our accounts you’ll still have an accounting NII, and the rest of it will fall in the non-NII, but at least you’ll be able to quantify it because we’ll be giving a banking NIM. Equally, a banking NIM will effectively neutralise the effect of the funding of the trading book, because the income would be generated - it will just sit on a different line - NII or non-NII - depending on whether it’s the trading book paying for the funding of it, or if it’s the banking book or treasury book paying for the funding of it. We neutralise, if you want, some of that uncertainty. On your third point about pro forma, we did put in the appendix of the presentation a pro forma for Canada. The main things to call out - the first is it’s about $60 billion of deposits and $60 billion of assets which will drop off the balance sheet. It will add about four to five additional basis points to the ECL coverage ratio on the residual book. The other element that you need to be mindful of Canada is that the earnings of Canada for this year will be due to the lockbox structure we did on the sale of Canada. The earnings of Canada will be recognised as earnings and will be deducted from the purchase price, so therefore for all intents and purposes the earnings after tax are not ours. By the sheer fact of being deducted from the sale price, effectively the buyer already owns the earnings, and that started from 30 June 2022. The last thing I want to share about Canada is that there will be an additional 130 or 140 basis points on the CET1 ratio. That is coming from the gain on sale of pro forma $5 billion, roughly $5.7 billion minus the earnings of Canada that will accrue over the year, and from the release of the RWAs of Canada. Of that CET1 ratio, we intend to pay the special dividend, conditional to successful completion of the transaction and the right approvals, including board and regulatory. We’ll pay the 21 cents as the first priority, and then the additional capital surplus will support any share buyback programme we have running at that stage and will support any business requirements or regulatory requirements we have at that stage. RICHARD O’CONNOR: The only thing I’ll add before your second question, Tom, is clearly you saw the disclosures. You may have missed it. The insurance net interest income will go to non-net-interest income. There’ll be a residual about $400 million of net interest income in the insurance line, but we’ll split that out for you when we do the NII walk, but we are moving to a banking NIM as quickly as we can, Q1, Q2, because I think it’s better for you and you get a better understand of that.

The second question was on costs, and you mentioned you’re moving away from the whole concept of CTA, etc. Restructuring costs in 2022 all in were about $2.9 billion, and all we know about, which might be comparable, is the $300 million this year for severance. The $1 billion of flowthrough cost saves is helping you keep that cost growth number down to 3%; it seems to me very hard that you’re going to be able to generate the same sort of flowthrough cost savings into 2024 unless you are going to make significant other investments in cost initiatives, etc. I’m just wondering if you could comment on that, because the guidance is clear for cost growth in 2023, but it looks like into 2024 there’s some upward pressure on that number.",True,0.0,0

The transformation we’ve gone through the CTA programme over the last three years we don’t expect to continue with the same pace. I want to give you some numbers. Through that transformation we reduced our operations cost in the bank by approximately 20% and increased our technology spend by approximately 20%. That takes our technology cost from 16% of our total cost in 2019, taking it up to 20% by 2022. That sheer size of transformation we don’t expect to repeat, so we’re comfortable with the technology cost at 20% of total costs. This is why, when we’re saying benefits flowing through, it’s really following massive adjustments which we’re not looking to replicate with that same magnitude. The $300 million severance will allow us to continue to do that, so again, we’re using severance, mostly for management and senior management layers. If we wanted to adjust costs in our general population, this is much more easily done through natural attrition. We have anywhere between 6% to 10% natural attrition, depending on years, and that’s the right mechanism to use to adjust costs. We earmarked that amount mostly for senior management layers and roles that we want to still tackle, but you probably won’t expect the same size shifts that we’ve seen before. Therefore, if I want to sum it, while we have not given guidance for 2024 – and we think it’s a bit premature, we just need to see also how inflation is going to pan out this year – we’re absolutely committed to the cost discipline that we have committed to for 2023.",False,0.0,0

I just want to remind you first the assumptions under the sensitivity. The first one is a static balance sheet, so we just assumed the balance sheet, as is, no migrations, no additional or reduction of deposits, etc. The second assumption is a flat 50% passthrough rate, which we know is not necessarily real life, but it gives you a guide. Of that $2 billion reduction, circa two-thirds is coming from the fact that we’re at higher rates than we were in Q2, and therefore you do have less of the negative convexity when you’re compressed around zero. Further out from zero, the less sensitivity you have. That’s about two-thirds of the reduction, and one-third of the reduction is the additional structural hedges which Carlo and the treasury team have been putting in place. We’ve always had structured hedges, but obviously when rates are close to zero for a period of time you’re not necessarily inclined to extend your maturities at those rates, so you just wait it out. Where rates are today allow us to extend it and allow us to expand the volume. This is the journey we’re on, and it’ll take us easily through mid-2023, probably longer, to be in a position where we’re partly mitigated. I just want to clarify: we will always have rate sensitivity and short-term rate sensitivity. We’re not intending and we cannot hedge all of it, and there are reasons for that. Some reasons are we need to maintain some of our exposure to short-term rates. That’s a risk management reason. Other reasons are that you don’t always have the instruments to hedge, and this is particularly true in Hong Kong, where you don’t have enough long-term HIBOR or Hong Kong dollar related instruments to hedge with, so you’re de facto constrained by the market capacity. Number three, we also want to make sure that any of these hedges is done in an as capital efficient way as possible. There’s no point creating a hedge but creating capital volatility, so NII stability versus capital volatility. We need to manage that trade-off in a way that keeps us comfortable.

Broadly speaking, those are on average five-year transactions, so they are five years to start and they will roll down. Just to stress what Georges was saying - this is not a trading position - the objective here is stabilisation, so the idea is to smooth the income to the downside and avoid giving it up on the upside.

If I look at your fee income in Hong Kong minus the manufacturing market impact it looks like we’re about 10% below 2019. Is that fair? From the sounds of it on the call earlier in the week it sounds quite constructive, it’s picking up again, etc. Can we expect a catch up this year or are we structurally different, or is there any reason why we’re structurally different? RICHARD O’CONNOR: Let’s get Ming to take that, Ming in Hong Kong. Fee income down 10% since 2019. What are the prospects going forward? MING LAU, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, ASIA-PACIFIC: I would say for the drop in fee income in Hong Kong, a big part of it was the reductions in Asia Wealth fee income, particularly on the Asia wealth distribution side of the business, which naturally, if you look at it, has been impacted by two particular dynamics. One would be the drop in equity prices, both in Hong Kong and markets globally through 2022. Secondly, in Hong Kong the Hong Kong stock exchange turnover fell, which naturally would have impacted your brokerage revenues. In terms of seeing a recovery of the fee income for Hong Kong particularly, I would point to those two factors. I think we’ve seen a good start so far in 2023. There’s been just broadly over a 10% pickup in Hong Kong stock exchange turnover thus far through the early part of the first quarter. So look, it’s positive at this point, so a bit cautiously optimistic, but I would say you would have to continue to see recovery of the equity markets and continuing pickup of the stock exchange turnover to see a pickup in Asia Wealth revenues. I think, beyond that, trade financing activity clearly was impacted in the second half of 2022, so one would have to see a recovery in the trade financing activities to see a pickup in the transaction finance fees overall.",True,2.0,0

Yes, look, again, I would say cautiously optimistic. I think that GBA opportunity is potentially significant for us, but, as we’ve noted in the past, it’s early days. I think you do need to continue to see some of the policies continue to evolve to see freer flows of capital, etc, and investments between Hong Kong and the GBA. So I think the bigger impact for us at this point through the first half of this year would be the borders reopening and the impact that that has in terms of the number of visitors coming back into Hong Kong. And I think, through the first part of the year, and particularly January, we’ve seen the number of visitors just numbering below half a million, which is a good pickup from the Covid days, but still only about 10% of the levels we used to see in terms of levels of visitors coming into Hong Kong.

So this is guidance on an IFRS 4 basis. We will give you a restatement of this guidance under IFRS 17 with the Q1 results. We’re first waiting on 9 March for the key changes from IFRS 17, so you have all the dynamics. Broadly speaking and just paraphrasing what Richard mentioned earlier, about $2.2 billion of the current IFRS 4 NII will flip like-for-like into non-NII, due to IFRS 17, and then there will be a number of additions and variations on the earnings statement that, net/net, will take out about two-thirds of the insurance PBT of broadly speaking, $1 billion. About two-thirds of it will disappear from the year’s earnings and then will start accruing over the following years, and that’s through additional changes in the cost line and the non-NII element.

That’s really helpful. And then, second question, just a little bit more broader, Georges, in terms of what you’re trying to do in terms of reducing the downside sensitivity to rates as the rate cycle probably peaks out, but you’re saying you can’t completely hedge the downside risk. When you think about the medium term, there’s a risk that rates would fall from here and that would put pressure on the profitability of the bank, because of the NII disappearing. How do you think you can manage or mitigate that in terms of some of the levers? It doesn’t seem to me like cost could be an absolute lever from here, so do you think that growth in the other areas of the bank will pick up sufficiently to offset that?",True,3.0,0

If you look at a lot of the investments we’re doing – in the non-NII and specifically in the fee income line, if you want, and the investments we’re putting in Wealth. And if you assume both our own investments plus the market outlook improving from where we are, there is, cautiously speaking, potential for substantial growth in this space. If you look at the growth in our fee income, say, in trade finance, despite all the challenges we faced and global supply chains, we continued to see a resilient mid-single-digit CAGR in this space. So there is a clear focus on our net fee income growth with a lot of investments in this space. So that is one area. And the other area is we are now considering bringing forward our share buyback programme, and the capital generation we will have over the next couple of years, based on the current outlook, will allow us to have substantial share buyback capabilities, which should allow us to manage, if you want, the available share pool for distribution of dividends. So there’ll be a number of factors which will help us mitigate. This being said, if rates go to zero, it’s a challenge, but we think rates at zero is an aberration and we don’t think any normalisation – if we think, today, rates have peaked - we don’t genuinely think a normalisation will take us back to zero.

Is that fair? And on that, is the acceleration of the buyback in H1 simply related to the fact that you had very strong capital generation in Q4? Presumably you’ll have it again in Q1.

We are in a buyback programme. First, we’re not pre-funding. The consideration to bring forward the buyback programme is based on our capital generation and our capital position today. We are not pre-empting an outcome of Canada to do that. So therefore, any outcome from Canada is just an additional buyback capacity. Now, the reality is there is only so much capacity you can hit the market with for buybacks, so the likelihood of Canada, if we are in a buyback at that stage, is not that we will increase the volume, because we will probably be at the right capacity. It will, effectively, extend in time. And if it’s extending in time – capital is fungible, right – then we can co-mingle our own capital generation as well as the Canada proceeds and the contribution to that. The guiding principle for a buyback is excess capital. We indicated our target operating range to be 14-14.5%, at least for the short-to-medium term. We’re looking, beyond the medium term, to bring it lower. Any excess capital beyond what we’re comfortable with within this range is for distribution.

We’re going to just adapt to client needs with our stable risk appetite. And if client needs are slower because of economic conditions being slower, we will grow less in that area and we will grow somewhere else where client needs are stronger. RICHARD O’CONNOR: We will be optimistic. Companies always say it’s the second half of the year. Ultimately, when you see what’s happened in reopening in Asia, we think the conditions are there for a good bounce-back in the back end of the year.

So without the Covid restrictions, our wealth planners are now able to spend more face-to-face time with clients and, hopefully, selling some of the higher-margin products which are in the protection area versus the investment space.

So, answering your second question first, yes, some of the hedges that we have undertaken have been in sterling overall, not all necessarily in the ring-fenced bank but, let’s say, in sterling as a currency, and there is some more capacity, in particular in terms of extending the duration rather than the quantum, which will reduce the sensitivity to the downside. In terms of dynamics of NII in the UK, I guess there are two effects. The first one is the competitive environment in the UK is less than the competitive environment you would have in Hong Kong overall, so you have a little bit less of the dynamics you would have in Hong Kong in terms of migrations and so on and so forth. We have started to see some competition for deposits in the UK, in particular for those institutions like building societies that are a bit less liability-rich. Most of the large UK banks have significant deposit surpluses on the back of ring-fencing, so the pressure is coming more from the other players. What I can say is that until now we have had passthroughs of less than 50%. In our central assumptions from this point on we will see those trending towards 50%, which implies marginally higher than 50% from this point on. That is the assumption.

We need to give them a little bit of time to see if there’s a lag effect, but, obviously, the higher the rate, the more constrained the terms and conditions, the more restricted in terms of blocking the funds and access to the funds, etc. But you do have to factor in some lag effect in terms of that migration in some of these customers, which is in our forecast, by the way.",False,6.0,0

And then I think, from a broader perspective, on the wholesale side of the business. Look, naturally visitors coming back to Hong Kong is good for the economy.

That business generated in excess $1 billion a quarter. The outlook – I would say as long as we have a focus on growing out payments and our trade capability, FX is an automatic beneficiary of it because naturally they’re a bolt-on service for any of these global payments or global trade. In terms of DCM, I think we have two factors at play we need to watch. The first one is there’s a clear revival of markets after a very subdued Q4. January has been very positive. February we need to see if that outlook stays. But clearly the reopening of the mainland China and Hong Kong economies will also see more activity in Asia, so that’s a fair assessment to make. This being said, you have to weigh this with the current rate levels and how much corporates or financial institutions want to borrow when the rates are at that level. We’ve seen a lot of borrowing during Covid that happened ‘just in case’ - they didn’t necessarily need the money, but it was so cheap to raise the money; the DCM activity was brilliant with that.

First, we do report legal entities because most of these legal entities actually have public accounts with public records so we’re not adding work; we’re effectively taking work off somewhere, creating some efficiencies by not having to recreate regional reporting when we already have legal entity reports and Group reports. So we’ve just taken a layer out. But more fundamentally, because obviously it’s easier for us, we had two main issues. When we reported the Europe region, it was highly unrepresentative of how we run Europe because the ring-fenced bank, the non-ring-fenced bank, and the rest of Europe, including the holding company, which is a cost-bearing entity, are all mixed up, and are not representative of the different dynamics you can see, and what ring-fenced bank behaviour is versus the non-ring-fenced bank. And then the second one is North America, where effectively Canada was lumped with the US, and, with the sale of Canada, we felt, ‘Let’s start now already giving more clarity on what is the US without Canada because Canada will be stripped out’. So that is a nice segue to have an understanding of the US evolution, as part of the pro forma of North America without Canada. Those are the main regions. By all means, you should not read at all the fact that – we remain absolutely committed to our DNA, which is connecting East and West and working on global interconnectivity. RICHARD O’CONNOR: The principle is you should report how you manage, and Europe as an entity was not how we managed, and increasingly so in HNAH, increasingly so in Latin America with Mexico. So by doing it on a legal entity basis – it’s how the Executive Committee manages; it’s how the Group manages. So we should report to you how the Group manages, and that was the principle. And whilst we’re doing IFRS 17 and getting rid of below-the-line items, we thought we’d do it at the same time. So that was the thinking behind it.

We had indicated for 2023, ‘the top end of the 30 to 40 basis point range’; we felt it would be cleaner and clearer if we just said ‘approximately 40 basis points’, because we’re saying the range, but then ignoring the range because we’re going to the top end of the range. We may as well just put a number that we think we will land close to. It’s a probabilistic-based approach, so we not just building it up by making assumptions on various provisions we’ll be taking across the world. So it’s assigning probabilities of additional provisions in various areas of the world that landed us there. The areas we need to watch, we certainly continue to watch China real estate. As I said, we think we’re well provisioned and we think the outlook has improved, but we continue to watch that space. We need to watch some of the slowdown in the western economies, particularly places like the UK. There is an economic slowdown, still high inflation, high interest rates, erosion of cost of living, cash flow issues for some of the smaller corporates. So yes, there may be pressure on the smaller corporates in the UK which we need to watch closely. No indicators yet, but more pre-emptively being cautious and saying that there could be some issues there. I think the retail portfolios have been resilient and are likely to remain resilient, and this is mainly due to the composition of our portfolios. So in the UK, 90% of our portfolio is mortgages with lower than 90% LTV, with good stress test on the early payment capability of the borrowers, so highly resilient. Hong Kong mortgage, you’re probably familiar with, but it’s mostly guaranteed above 60% LTV. On the unsecured, we haven’t seen any signs of stress and, if anything, it’s not growing, because people are not borrowing additionally at these rates. And it’s small in all cases, so I wouldn’t be too concerned with this area. I would continue looking at the smaller corporates that are suffering from inflation and cash flow issues. RICHARD O’CONNOR: I’ll just add two things. Last year, we were quite fortunate. We didn’t have what we call any tall trees – i.e. big one-offs. In China CRE we had a number of impairments, as you know, but that was quite broadly spread. If you look on a rolling-five-year basis, you do have years where you have tall trees, and there’s nothing which suggests we will have this year, but they do happen. And when economies come out of difficult times, generally ECLs are a lagging indicator, so that’s why I think we’re quite conservative with our guidance. If we’re overly conservative, then that’s fine. We’d rather it that way than the other way round.",False,11.0,0

I really like the legal entity disclosure and regional liquidity. Page 209, it's a very useful regional entity disclosure. The LCRs and NSFRs, they're off the chart for HSBC. They’re just unlike any other bank, and I think you’d find it quite hard to explain just how much better your deposits are than other banks in terms of the quality of them. It's just coming back to this. I don't agree on the peak NIM either, but that's by the by, but just coming to how you think about pricing, it's almost one for Carlo. Really, if your LCRs are so high and your NSFRs are so high, you've got an ability to choose to just not price up and see deposits leave and be extraordinarily relaxed about that, I think. So that's the question. Is that the case? It's not what you will do, because it's a set of commercial decisions, but that looks like a lot of flexibility. 226% LCR in the UK is just peculiar.",True,13.0,0

Indeed, historically, HSBC has attracted a lot of deposits, and I would say, on the previous question on loan-to- deposit ratio, what we have found is we are a very defensive bank for the street, so we end up attracting deposits when others perhaps aren't. So if you move away from the vagaries of quantitative tightening, you'll see us also absorbing more or less deposits, depending on what happens in a different market. So two years ago, we established a strategy to look at the liquidity in each of the entities and strategically define how much liquidity we wanted in each of those. And the strategy has three legs, which I might have described before. And the three legs are deploy, invest and reduce. So we looked at how much liquidity we want to have in each of the entities and then we see the surplus and then, with the surplus, we decide whether we deploy it – i.e. what is it that we can do to incentivise for that excess liquidity to be deployed in the businesses? So we provide pricing incentives. It affects the pricing of loans versus deposits, and so on and so forth. To your point, it allows you, in the overall pricing of deposits, to be perhaps more aggressive than otherwise you would be, but it’s not the only consideration for deposit pricing. Invest is at the margin. If you have the liquidity, what is it that you can do without changing your risk profile in order to generate a little bit more? And then we had a leg which was reduce – i.e. incentivising more actively reduction by providing alternative products to clients, movements across the group. With the new rate environments, we have de-emphasised significantly the reduce leg, for obvious reasons, but we will continue to actively look at it. It's another nice problem to have. We end up attracting quite a lot. In this environment, it's a good thing. RICHARD O’CONNOR: Let’s be very clear, though. In our home markets – Hong Kong first and the UK second – we look at the franchise as well, so we will defend and ensure that, in Q4, we will defend our home markets where we need to.

Thank you for joining our first-quarter results call. Georges is going to lead the presentation, but I’d like to make some opening comments. We’ve announced a strong set of Q1 results. We delivered a strong profit performance, which was spread across all our major geographies. All three global businesses performed well, and cost discipline remained tight. In the first quarter, excluding the gain on SVB UK and the part reversal of the impairment on the potential sale of our French retail bank, we delivered an annualised return on tangible equity of 19.3%, so our strategy is working. I’m also confident about the future, for two main reasons. First, we have built a good platform for growth. We have a strong balance sheet, broad-based geographic profit generation, a good combination of net interest income and non-net interest income, and a tight grip on costs. This growth potential was evident in the inflow of net new invested assets of $22 billion in the quarter, with a cumulative $93 billion over the last 12 months, which shows that our Wealth strategy is continuing to gain traction, and you have my commitment that we will continue to drive strong performance for the rest of the year, while maintaining cost discipline and investing in growth. The second reason I’m confident is the diversity and connectivity of our geographical footprint, where we have access to markets that are exhibiting good growth and return potential. I’ve seen first-hand the strong economic recoveries underway in Hong Kong and mainland China. I’ve also visited the Middle East recently, where I saw a strong economy that is well-placed to continue to grow. And the UK economy is also showing good resilience, and our HSBC UK business is performing well. Investing in growth is critical and we saw an opportunity to do that by acquiring SVB UK. For 158 years, HSBC has banked the entrepreneurs who have created today’s industrial base. With the SVB UK acquisition, we have access to more of the entrepreneurs in the technology and life sciences sectors who will create the businesses of tomorrow. We believe they’re a natural fit for HSBC and that we’re well and uniquely placed to take them global. You will have seen the recent hires that we’ve taken on in the US in that regard, and we’re going to continue to invest to grow this part of the business on a global basis. We announced that the sale of our French retail bank has become less certain, due to significant interest-rate rises in France and the related fair value accounting treatment impacting the capital position of the purchase. We still believe it’s right to sell the business, but we also have to keep our shareholders’ interests in mind when negotiating revised terms. We are working with the buyer to try and find a solution, but the uncertainty on deal terms and timing has led us to reverse the impairment. Finally, we made two important announcements today. The first was the resumption of quarterly dividends, with an interim dividend of 10 cents per share, which is the same level as the last time we paid a first quarterly dividend before Covid. The second was that good, continued capital generation enabled us to announce a share buyback of up to $2 billion. Our AGM on Friday will be an important milestone. As you know, resolutions have been tabled by shareholders on the strategy and structure of the bank, as well as to fix the dividend. The board has recommended that shareholders vote against resolutions 17 and 18. I believe our first-quarter results reinforce our recommendations and demonstrate that our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to improve returns. I’ll now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2023\230502-1q-2023-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Noel, and a warm welcome to all of you. Thank you for being with us on this call today. Let me begin with the first- quarter highlights. Profit before tax was $12.9 billion, up $9 billion on the first quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis. This was driven by an $8.6 billion increase in revenue, which includes $2.1 billion from the part-reversal of the impairment relating to the potential sale of our retail banking operations in France, and a $1.5 billion provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK. Credit performance was benign, with expected credit losses of $0.4 billion. Costs were up 2% in the first quarter against our 2023 target of limiting cost growth to circa 3% on a constant currency basis and excluding notable items and hyperinflation. Our annualised return on tangible equity was 27.4%, or 19.3% excluding the gain on SVB UK and the part-reversal of the impairment on the potential sale of our French retail bank. And as Noel said, we’re providing strong capital returns in the form of the first quarterly dividend since 2019 of 10 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after the AGM and complete in around three months. Going into more detail, net interest income of $9 billion was up $2.9 billion or 47% on the first quarter of 2022, and was stable on the fourth quarter on an IFRS 17 basis. Non-net interest income of $11.2 billion was up $5.7 billion, which includes $3.6 billion of notable items in the first quarter and was driven by strong performances in Markets and Securities Services, and in Wealth. Lending balances increased by $32 billion in the quarter on a constant currency basis. This was made up of $25 billion from the reclassification of balances associated with our retail banking operations in France, and $7.3 billion from SVB UK. Deposits also increased in the quarter due to the same factors. If we excluded these items, lending and deposits were both stable. The tax charge of $1.9 billion included a credit of $0.4 billion. The CET1 ratio was 14.7%, which was an increase of 50 basis points on the fourth quarter and included the 30-basis-point gain relating to the part-reversal of the France impairment and the SVB UK acquisition. As Noel said, all of our global businesses performed well. This slide gives you the evidence for that. Wealth and Personal Banking had a strong quarter, with revenues up 82%. Within this, Wealth was up 13%, driven by the economic resurgence in Asia and increasing traction from the investment we’ve made in digitisation and in people. Personal Banking also had another good quarter, up 64%, benefiting from our strong deposit franchise. Across both Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, Global Payments Services had revenues of $4 billion, which was an increase of 176% on the first quarter of 2022. Global Banking and Markets also performed well overall. Markets and Securities Services revenue in particular were up 12%, with a strong performance in foreign exchange. Reported net interest income was $9 billion, which included $1.4 billion of interest expense due to the funding costs booked in Corporate Centre to fund the trading books. This was offset by $1.4 billion of non-net interest income reported in Corporate Centre. On a reported basis, the net interest margin was up by 50 basis points on the first quarter of last year and up by one basis point on the fourth quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, our net interest income guidance is unchanged from our 2022 full-year results. On an IFRS 17 basis, we expect to achieve net interest income of at least $34 billion in 2023. This is equivalent to at least $36 billion of net interest income on an IFRS 4 basis, which was what we told you in February. Our current view is that the things we told you about net interest income at our 2022 full-year results remain unchanged. Non-net interest income of $11.2 billion was up substantially by $5.7 billion, which was a combination of, one, $3.6 billion of notable items in the first quarter, two, a Global Banking and Markets trading income increase of $0.4 billion, three, a $1.3 billion increase in Corporate Centre income for funding Global Banking and Markets trading activity, and, four, other income, which grew by $0.2 billion and included higher Wealth revenues. Fees were broadly stable compared to the first quarter of 2022, with a good payments fee performance partially offset by lower Wealth fees. However, net new invested assets in the quarter were $22 billion, and $93 for the last 12 months, which bodes well for future growth. I called out the global business revenue highlights earlier, and there is a detailed non-net income interest breakdown on slide 17. Our credit performance in the quarter was benign, with a $0.4 billion charge for expected credit losses, which was $0.2 billion lower than the first quarter last year. This reflected a favourable shift in the probability weightings of our economic downside scenarios, as well as low stage 3 losses. China CRE was also benign, with a small charge relating to technical adjustments to two customers. We saw no China CRE defaults in the quarter for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021, though there were also limited repayments. We are encouraged by the first quarter, but there are still downside risks, so our 2023 guidance remains unchanged, at a charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending, including held-for-sale balances. We will review this at our interim results. On a constant currency basis and excluding notable items, costs were up 2% in the first quarter, once we also exclude the impact of retranslating prior-year costs in hyperinflationary economies at constant currency. As you can see, most of this spend was on technology. We remain committed to limiting cost growth to approximately 3% in 2023 on that basis. As I shared at the year-end, one of my top priorities is cost discipline. Equally, I also shared that another of my top priorities is to support our businesses to deliver growth and returns. The acquisition of SVB UK was an opportunity to do that. This is expected to result in incremental cost growth of circa 1% to Group operating expenses, the majority of which is the acquired cost base of SVB UK, together with some additional investment in the UK and other geographies. This will be in addition to our 2023 target of limiting cost growth to circa 3%. Finally, at year-end, we also flagged $300 million of expected severance costs this year. A large portion of these severance costs are now expected to be incurred in the second quarter, with the cost benefits starting to come through in the second half of this year. Moving on, we usually include information on customer deposits in the appendix, but we have moved it up to the presentation this time, because we appreciate the current interest. Overall, customer deposits are stable year on year and quarter on quarter. Of the $1.6 trillion of deposits we hold, half are invested in high-quality liquid assets, which gives you a sense of our strong liquidity position. This is a historic feature of the way that HSBC manages its balance sheet, and it has not changed. Around 40% of our high-quality liquid assets are held in cash or cash equivalents. And there are only $1.4 billion of unrealised losses in our held-to-collect portfolio, which is down from around $1.9 billion at the end of 2022. Three main points on capital. One, our CET1 ratio is 14.7%, up 50 basis points on the previous quarter, 25 basis points of which was from the reclassification of our French retail business from held-for-sale. Pending the outcome of negotiations for our French retail bank, there would be a commensurate reduction to CET1 in the event that the deal closes. Two, as you know, our business in Canada remains classified as held-for-sale, and we now expect the transaction to complete in the first quarter of 2024, as we work with the purchaser to ensure a smooth transition. We continue to expect to pay the potential special dividend of 21 cents per share in the first half of 2024. And as previously indicated, we expect almost all excess capital from the Canada transaction accruing into CET1 to be returned to shareholders, primarily through a rolling series of share buybacks in 2024 and 2025 that would be incremental to any existing buyback programme at that time. Three, share buybacks remain an active part of our capital management plans. We will update you on our assumptions for share buybacks in 2023 and beyond at our interim results. So in summary, this was a strong quarter. There was a strong profit performance. Net interest income was stable. Strict cost discipline was maintained, which I told you would remain a key focus area for myself and the management team. Our credit performance was benign amid a more positive economic outlook. We are starting to see the impact of strong economic rebounds in Hong Kong and mainland China, and our Wealth strategy is gaining traction. And I am pleased there were strong capital returns, a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after the AGM and complete in around three months. As Noel said, we are clearly on track to meet our returns target for 2023 onwards, and this upward trajectory will give us substantial distribution capacity, including, of course, the potential proceeds from the Canada transaction.",False,-1.0,1

Congrats on a good set of numbers in what wasn’t the easiest environment in Q1. Just a quick question on the buyback. You’ve been very precise in discussing that you would expect to complete the buyback over three months.

We have five months to complete this programme. We are hoping to complete it in three months. Going forward, we’re certainly considering a rolling series of buybacks in 2023, 2024, 2025, and those will be supported by organic capital generation as well as the Canada sale proceeds in 2024.

Thanks very much for taking my questions. Maybe just to follow up on that capital return question, firstly, and then I’ve got another one on asset quality. When we look at your headline capital ratio, it’s very strong and quite a significant tick-up over the last couple of quarters in particular. I guess there are a few adjusting items in there. Should we exclude the French disposal, let’s say, reversal from the headline ratio? I guess, if we exclude the share buyback, we get back in your range towards the lower end. So I guess the question is how much RWA growth you anticipate the business to require over the next 12 months. Linking to your loan growth outlook as well, I’m just wondering if you could give us some colour on RWA growth expectations there, and that, hopefully, gives us a good idea of how much buybacks we can expect. The second one, again related to how much capital you might be able to generate in the remaining part of the year, your guidance on asset quality still implies quite a significant tick-up in provisions, given your very strong performance in Q1. So I guess the question really is, are you guiding us to something specific in terms of the 40-basis-point provision charge, or is that just an element of conservatism built into your guidance there? Thank you.",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\230502-1q-2023-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Raul. So on your first question, Raul, I think it is prudent to adjust for the French part-reversal of the impairment insofar that capital is concerned. As indicated, if we do reach a transaction, there is a likelihood of a commensurate capital reduction taking place. And I will just remind you, our capital target operating range is 14% to 14.5%, and we expect this to be reviewed slightly lower in the medium to long term. And as we do our capital return projections or our share buyback projections, we look at our medium-term capital outlook and cautiously compare it to that range, and this is what’s giving us now the flexibility to announce the share buyback and to consider additional buybacks going forward. As regards RWA growth, in line with loan growth, it has been subdued in the first quarter. It may remain subdued for another quarter. We may see some pick-up, particularly with the Hong Kong and mainland China bounce-back, but again, for this year, we have not given guidance on loan growth, recognising some of the economic conditions. We do remain committed to mid-single-digit growth in loans for the medium term, which is what you can factor in for RWA growth commensurately, and equally for our share buyback. If I move on to your next question with regard to asset quality, I would lean towards your latter comment, Raul, that we are baking in some conservatism, or we think at this stage the full-year guidance, which we have retained unchanged from February, is now leaning towards conservative. I just want to highlight some tailwinds. Certainly, the situation in the UK – the possibility that we may dodge a recession – is a tailwind. Equally, the recovery in Hong Kong and mainland China following the opening up of the borders and resumption of activities and trade is a tailwind at the same time. And China real estate has shown some positive signs, both from the economic standpoint as well as from the policy measures. But at the same time, we wanted to remain cautious. There are a number of refinancings taking place in Q3 in the China commercial real estate portfolio, which we would like to stay cautious on, and we continue to watch some of the UK SME space – in particular those heavily reliant on discretionary consumer spend – before we revisit the guidance. We intend to revisit this guidance at H1.",False,1.0,0

You’ll notice on the capital walk that we’ve accrued dividends at 50% of the profit generation in Q1. And if you do the maths on that, the accrual on dividend is higher than the 10 cents that you’ve got in the Q1 declared interim dividend. So we’re accruing dividend distribution at a higher rate than the payment of the 10 cents, so that’s just factored into our CET1 ratio as well.",False,1.0,0

A couple, please. On that slide you were talking about, Noel, about the RWA, I noticed that the risk-weighted assets from Silicon Valley were just short of $10 billion, which seems quite high relative to the loans that you’ve taken on. I wondered if you could share with us what the nature of those assets is and give us some indication about asset quality within the Silicon Valley Bank acquisition from what you’ve seen so far. Secondly, with a thought to the structure of the group, you’ve obviously showed some willingness to make some acquisitions recently and indeed to do some disposables where possible. I just wondered if there will be any interest in further moves. In particular I’m wondering if there will be anything around some of your businesses such as insurance manufacturing, which you might think about being non-core to the group going forward.",True,2.0,0

Just on the asset quality of SVB, everything that we’ve seen since we bought the business reinforces the view that we had that weekend when we did due diligence. The book was a good quality book. We’ve seen no nasty surprises. We did do a bit of mark to market on acquisition accounting, but that was evident to us when we did due diligence that weekend. Georges can give you a little bit more detail on that, but fundamentally the asset quality of the SVB book is as we expected it. The team have done a good job in building that business over the past 14 years. They’ve got good client relations, a good quality book, and good business development potential. On the back of that we decided to invest in putting more people on the ground in some of the key markets around the world that have strong technology and life science centres, to take that business model not just to the UK but to take it globally. We’re investing in that as well. No nasty surprises on that. In terms of other acquisitions that we may consider or M&A activity, the insurance business is a key component of the wealth proposition that we have. We have a very profitable insurance business in Hong Kong. It’s a combination of manufacturing and distribution. The team have done a good job in building out the product line up in Hong Kong over the past few years to put us back into a market-leading position in Hong Kong, and we get access to the full value chain. One of the challenges we’ve often faced in the past is getting full recognition of that value, as a bank shareholder in an insurance manufacturing business. You can rest assured the economics of that business are very strong and we’ve got a market-leading position. We obviously, like all businesses, keep the strategy under review, and if we think there’s a better position to take, we’ll take it, but at the moment we’re pleased with the way the insurance business is performing.",False,2.0,0

I just had a quick question on rate sensitivity. If I look at your rate sensitivity at the end of 2022 it looks like you’ve been quite purposefully bringing down your rate sensitivity on a year one view. I was hoping you could perhaps give us a little bit of colour of the direction that sensitivity over one year has changed in the first couple of months of the year. Can we assume that some of the structural hedges have been further increased and when we see the sensitivity at the interim it might have reduced further? Any colour in that respect would be really helpful.,True,3.0,0

That $2 billion reduction, the NII sensitivity reduction of 100 basis points is for about a third of it, justified by the structural hedges that we started putting in place or that we continued putting in place as of last year. Two-thirds of it is due to the fact that we’re just at a higher level of rates and therefore we have less rates convexity on the downside. If you look into Q1 we have not published a revised rate sensitivity but we continued the trajectory of our structural hedges. Just as a reminder, structural hedges will reduce somewhat our rate sensitivity, and our target is to take that $4 billion in the medium term to circa $3 billion. We are on that journey.

It appears that a lot of it is from Commercial Banking, and maybe some from Global Banking and Markets. How much of that do you think is sustainable? Presumably you wouldn’t encourage us to annualise the whole lot, so how much of that do you think is sustainable? Secondly, on the AGM on Friday I guess a lot of the attention will be around the debate you’re having with Ping An. They obviously recently published an announcement that made some critiques, especially around your cost-income ratio and RoTE.

I think it’s also fair to say that in WPB the wealth business performed well in Q1. Its revenue was up 13% in Q1 relative to Q1 last year. What Georges is saying is I think we’ve seen a recovery taking place in that wealth revenue. We’re not expecting that to just be a Q1 phenomenon. That is something that will continue in Q2, Q3 and Q4, but it’s still early days to predict whether the 13% is an annual number or it’s higher than that or lower than that. We don’t expect it to disappear in Q2, Q3 or Q4, so there should be a level of annualisation on that as well in the WPB non-NII line. With respect to the AGM comment, we said for a while that we believe the safest and fastest way to achieve higher returns, better performance, better dividends and capital generation was the existing strategy. I think the Q1 results provide a lot of evidence that that is the fact, that that is the best way. We guided the market over the last 12 months to a 12%+ RoTE. I did emphasise at the year-end that we should focus on the plus, not the 12, and I think you see in Q1, even excluding the notable items, we’ve done a RoTE of 19.3%. I would just draw attention to the fact that in that RoTE of 19.3% there is a tax credit. That tax credit is not something that will repeat every quarter, but even if you adjust for that it’s still a very healthy return on tangible equity. What we’re focused on is driving performance on behalf of all our shareholders, and we believe doing what we’ve done is the best way to get improved returns and improved performance rather than some more radical corporate restructuring action. We believe Q1 is strong evidence of that. Georges, do you just want to clarify the tax situation?",False,4.0,0

One strategic question and then one numbers question. On the strategic question, if the proposed French retail sale no longer goes ahead what would be the plan? Would you put it back on the block again or would there be a plan to reabsorb it into the broader HSBC Group? Is there anything you can say on plans for France, given that sale process and where we’ve got to? Secondly, on costs, you’ve actually had a very good cost print in this quarter. You’ve down 2% year on year on a constant currency basis, and yet you’re still guiding to 3% cost growth or 4% with SVB UK. Is this a timing issue? Is it a case of the wage inflation coming through from Q2? Is there anything you can elaborate there?",True,5.0,0

Georges will cover the second one and I’ll cover the first one. We still believe that a sale of the French retail business is the right strategic outcome. That business probably has a stronger future in another purchaser’s hands, however we have been in discussions for a few weeks now with the current buyer to try and overcome the challenge they have on their acquisition accounting impact on their capital base. We’ll continue that dialogue. We’re hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable settlement with them on that, but we can’t be guaranteed of that outcome. We have to consider what is financially the right decision for all shareholders. It’s hopeful that we can reach an agreement but it’s not guaranteed. In the event we can’t, then I still think we’ll continue to run the business, but I still think over time we wouldn’t see that as a long-term strategic hold, but we’re happy to wait and see what happens thereafter. We’re very much focused on trying to reach an agreement with the current buyer to bring that transaction to a close. That’s the update I have for you on costs. I’ll hand over to Georges.",False,5.0,0

Our reported costs on a constant currency basis is down 2% Q1 last year to Q1 this year. If you adjust for notables – and remember last year Q1 we had $450 million of additional costs due to the CTA programme. If you extract that notable item from last year’s base, our reported cost adjusted for notables will show us up 2% Q1 to Q1. This is the basis on which we’re measuring ourselves for this year. It’s on that basis where we are targeting to achieve a 3% annualised number where our Q1 basically is coming in at 2%. Why from 2% to 3%? I just want to highlight a few things. The first one is we still haven’t incurred, by and large, the severance costs which we announced at the year-end, and now we expect to incur the majority of it in Q2 this year. The second element, just to highlight, is that some of the pay increases have only been effected partially in Q1 starting March, and will start being fully effected in Q2 onwards. This is why our 3% target for the full year is where it is. As you said, Andrew, and just for avoidance of any doubt here, the acquired cost of SVB and some of the additional investments we need to do there will add another 1% to that 3% target.",False,5.0,0

On that reconciliation between the headline reporting number and the cost target, what we’re trying to do is be very straightforward and not try and bake in what was a CTA last year into the cost base of this year. So we’re adjusting the prior year reported number for the notable CTA last year so that the cost target of 3% is on an ‘apples and apples’ basis with the cost base of this year, so we’re not looking to take an easy option on that. We think it’s the right thing to do, but as we say, we’re in 2% against the 3% target in Q1. And then on SVB, I just want to clarify as well, the SVB business we bought, we acquired a cost base with that, and we acquired a revenue stream, and that revenue stream was in excess of the cost base. We’ve acquired a positive P&L that was contributing, if I remember correctly, around about $80 to $90 million of PBT.

One on net interest margin and one back on SVB. So on NIM, I guess the UK ring-fenced bank did quite a lot of the heavy lifting this quarter, allowing for one basis point of sequential NIM growth. As we look ahead, perhaps that tailwind fades, at least in quantum. So is that going to make it a tricky thing from here to deliver NIM sustainability, or is the drop in HBAP and the headwind from deposit mix in particular, likely to fade in your view to allow for some stable NIM backdrop? And then the second question on SVB. In addition to the acquired cost base, you flagged the incremental investment spend and plans to build the business outside the UK, so could you talk about associated revenue ambitions and what timeframe you expect to see any notable uplift there? How big a shift in that $80 to $90 million PBT reference could we see of SVB inside HSBC with that incremental investment? Thank you.",True,6.0,0

So indeed, you did call out the possibility of headwinds in the UK. Obviously, there may be still one or two rate hikes for which we will be passing most of that to customers through pass-through rates. And we do see continued headwinds in Hong Kong, with around 1% per month migration into term deposits, with the mix now at 25% term deposits across both our entities in Hong Kong. This being said, we also have tailwinds. The first one is we still have a strong momentum from Q1, which we are carrying over. The second tailwind is HIBOR normalisation. Just for reference, in Hong Kong, HIBOR and Exchange Fund Bills in Q1 were 65 and 35 basis points lower on average than where they were in Q4, and that was a major headwind for us in Q1. We are seeing now – over the last few weeks, we have been seeing normalisation in those rates. If we continue to see normalisation – and just for a reminder, we are about 200 basis points off the equivalent rate in dollars – if we continue to see normalisation, this will provide us material tailwinds in the Hong Kong base. And the other tailwind is our resilient deposit and loan base. We continue having stable deposits and loans despite some of the competitive pressures, and we continue to aim for mid-single-digit growth in both in the medium term, which should give us some supportive tailwinds.",False,6.0,0

We still have that view. The only adjustment you need to make to NII is for the IFRS 17 adjustment. Everything else remains, as we said in February, that the guidance that existed at that point in time, we were not uncomfortable with it. The same is true today. Just adjust for IFRS 17, which is around about a $2 billion adjustment from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17. That’s the only change that needs to be made based on what we’ve given you as an update today. And then on SVB, we recruited over 40 people in the US, to build out our SVB capability in the US. We did not bring a book with them - purchase a book - so they will be in build-out mode, so there will be a payback period on that investment. We think that it is a relatively short payback period based on the quality of people we’ve hired. We’re looking at other geographies around the world. We think it’s a sensible and modest investment to do that organically, and we’re pretty confident on the payback will be relatively short. We’ll provide more details once we complete our buildout. Hopefully by the half-year, we’ll be able to give you more information. So there will be a profit drag to a degree, probably in the first year or 18 months, but then I think it will be back into proper territory, even on those organic buildout strategies, but we’ll give more of an update at the half-year.

I just need to come back to revenues. Both your net interest income and your non-interest income are performing really well in Q1, and they are annualising at levels that would suggest a pretty material upside to market expectations for both of those lines. Your net interest income is annualising north of $36 billion on the Q1 number. Your guide is obviously greater than $34 billion. I appreciate there’s lots of moving parts here, but I guess to be more specific, Noel, in terms of your commentary around consensus at full-year and now, there’s a $1.7 billion gap between where the street is and what you’re guiding for the street at $35.7 billion. It doesn’t actually sound like you see much downside to that consensus number at $35.7 billion, unless there’s something here on term deposit mix. It feels like there’s a lot of conservatism in that NII guidance, or there’s something I’m missing, so can you help us with that? And then secondly, on the non-interest income, I totally appreciate your markets business might have over-earned in Q1, but you are also pointing towards a wealth management business that is trending higher, and underlying momentum in your fee business. You talked about strategic initiatives at full-year that sit behind that. To what extent is that revenue number an over-earn, or is this the kind of level that we can expect you to crank out in a year? Because this is well ahead of what the street is.

I think you’re right on your maths. I think if you go back to what we said in February, there was – we talked about $36 billion plus, and when people were talking about our NII, they were sort of annualising it to about $38 billion, and consensus was around $37 to $37.5 billion, and I think we said that we were comfortable with that. So I think, if you go back to then, we sort of said, ‘Yes, we’re sort of comfortable that consensus had a calculation on the ‘plus’ bit of the $36 billion plus. That put it sort of north of $37 billion. That was around about consensus back then, and what I’m saying to you now is the only thing you need to adjust for is IFRS 17, which takes about $2 billion off of that. So we’re talking about $34 billion plus, and that therefore would put you north of $35 billion. So I think what we’re saying is – we’re sort of saying the street has probably got NII around about the right place back in February, and we’re saying there’s no need to change what the street is. You’ve only got to do the mechanical adjustment for IFRS 17. Hopefully that helps, and then Georges, I think, do you want to just come back on the non-NII? Because I think you’re right.

So somewhat flat – just slightly up from quarter four. That number, it is fair to annualise it, given current rate forecast consensus. Equally, as Noel mentioned earlier, the discussion on wealth growth in NNIA, in wealth – the resumption of activity in Hong Kong in particular bodes well for the future, and I think it is fair to assume that we will see continued performance in wealth. On the other hand, some of the outperformance in some of the markets activities such as foreign exchange trading, which had a record quarter, may not be repeated, and obviously, we may have to look at it quarter by quarter in terms of what business opportunities are there. And while you can bake in and factor in the results for Q1 outperformance, I would caution you not to annualise that outperformance.

First of all, congratulations for this good set of results. I just have one broader question on growth and one follow-up on deposits. Just looking at the much-improved profitability levels of the group with NII being $2-3 billion higher per quarter, despite the capacity to scale up growth. And I was just wondering, if we look into the medium-term or starting 2024, do you see hope for the group to lean more into growth, so the single-digit loan growth could potentially be higher, or should we just think that any increase in profitability could be essentially returned to shareholders, just in terms of the trade-off between opportunity for growing more versus shareholder returns? And secondly, with regards to the deposit franchise, I was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of HSBC’s deposit franchise during the quarter. Have you seen, in particular, inflows in certain parts of your footprint helping delivering stable deposits in the quarter? Also wondering with regards to deposit migration – part of moving into time deposits, or whether you have seen any change in trend. Are we towards the end of that cycle in terms of deposit migration, or could we still go on for another quarter? Thank you.",True,9.0,0

I think, clearly, we want to pursue growth, but I think we have the capacity in our dividend pay-out ratio of 50% to pursue growth, and with the option of doing buy-backs as well. Now, at the moment, I think we’ve seen a relatively subdued lending market in corporate banking. I think the demand for term loans around the world is not particularly high at the moment, and probably isn’t going to be particularly high in the very near term. As Georges said earlier, once we get to 2024, one would expect there to be an increase in demand starting to emerge, but the near-term, for the next few months in 2023, given the economic uncertainty, we’ve seen subdued loan demand. So I think the message I’d give you, in a 50% pay-out ratio world, we believe the second 50% after we pay the dividends, there is potential to fund both growth and buy-backs, and that’s our plans going forward.

If I start with some of the outflows that we’re seeing, and then I’ll go into the tailwinds. Some of the outflows we’re seeing, particularly in the UK – so obviously UK retail, Q1 is a tax payment period, so there is seasonality here. We are still seeing high cost of living resilient inflation in the UK, which is obviously draining some of the UK consumers’ savings. We have, to a lesser extent, competitive pressure as well in the UK. Likewise for corporates in the UK, Q4 was in year-end where people shore up their liquidity, whereas in Q1, most of the companies pay dividends, and then you can see some of the draining liquidity. We’re also seeing deleveraging of loans - using some of the deposits to deleverage on the loan side - especially for those with a strong rate differential between what they’re paying on their loans. This being said, we continue to see growth and strength in the deposit preposition, so if I take Hong Kong and all of Asia, actually, we’re seeing definite deposit growth in the retail and personal banking space. We have seen 5% growth of our deposit base in Commercial Banking in the US.

First one on the loan growth. You flagged the corporate demand, and maybe that is the answer. I want to ask, because you’re quite upbeat on the economic recovery you’re seeing now in Hong Kong and mainland China, and the UK that you said was quite resilient. Is there any other reason why you’re so cautious in the short term on loan growth, or is it purely a lack of demand from corporates? And my second question is on cost, please. It’s looking at the 3% target for this year and thinking forward to next year, because I guess you’re still enjoying some of the flow- through this year from cost savings from the previous cost programme, which has now ended. So I just wondered if you or Georges would comment on your approach towards costs in 2024, whether you’ll be thinking in terms of absolute growth, maybe similar to this year or whether a jaws approach might be more appropriate.

I think if there is a place where I think loan growth could pick up more in the near term, I think it would be Asia. I think Middle East is another option. So I think I am being a bit cautious on the near-term loan growth. I think probably it would start to emerge more in the working capital side of the balance sheet, trade finance, before people start investing in fixed capital, but I think there is a level of nervousness out there in the corporate world about taking long-term investment decisions in fixed capital. That is aside from sustainability. I think there’s a lot of infrastructure spend taking place, and I could see some loan growth coming in and around that sustainable infrastructure investment. So maybe I am being a bit cautious on loan growth at the moment. I think I’d rather be that way in the near term, but I do believe there’s going to be medium-term loan growth, and I think it is fair to say that Asia has the potential to pick up faster than elsewhere in the world.

Even in the UK, we are seeing green shoots in the mortgage sector. I mean, market share in the UK for the first two months of the year is at 15% for new business. That’s against the book market share for both 7.5%, and the Q4 new business market share of 9%, so we’re certainly there in the retail space where we’re seeing growth. On the wholesale side, I just want to add one comment to Noel’s description, which is also bear in mind the rate differential between mainland China and Hong Kong. So all those Chinese companies who used to use Hong Kong as a base for raising funding internationally will be less doing so as long as the rate differential between dollar rates and onshore China rates are that wide. It is cheaper for these corporates to raise funding in mainland China as opposed to Hong Kong, and that will remain the case up until the time we see reversal in that rate trend. If I move to your second question, Tom, we have not shared targets for 2024 as yet, but the few guiding principles, I can share with you. The first guiding principle, paramount guiding principle, is that you should expect our focus on cost discipline to continue. The second guiding principle is that we will continue doing transformation and restructuring as part of our BAU cost base and expect some of those saves to flow through also in 2024 and beyond, and case in point is the spend on severance, which we’re planning now to do in Q2 this year, for which the benefit will flow through mostly in 2024.

Thank you for joining us and great to see you again. And good morning to everyone watching from London and elsewhere. Before Georges takes you through the second-quarter numbers, I’ll start with a summary of the first-half performance and progress. First, I show this slide every quarter. It’s critical, in that it summarises our strategy, and our strategy remains unchanged. It is summarised by the four pillars at the bottom of the slide. Let me take you through the latest outcomes of that strategy. We had a good first six months. I’m pleased with the broad-based profit and revenue generated by our global businesses and geographies. I’m also pleased by our strong capital generation and returns. We delivered an annualised return on tangible equity of 22.4% including the two material notable items reported in the first quarter, or 18.5% if you exclude those notable items, and we’ve announced a second interim dividend of 10 cents per share and a second share buy-back of up to $2 billion. Today, we’re also upgrading our guidance. Now we expect to achieve a return on tangible equity in the mid-teens for 2023 and 2024. Prior to 2023 we were very focused on transforming the business. Now, while still continuing to improve operational efficiency, we are very focused on driving growth, diversifying revenue and creating incremental value. We have a plan built around six areas. I will take you through some of these over the next few slides, starting with our international connectivity. We grew wholesale cross-border client business in the first half by around 50%, with growth across all regions driven by higher rates. Our international proposition in Wealth and Personal Banking continues to gain traction. We now have 6.3 million international WPB customers, and that is up 500,000 or 8% over the last 12 months. That’s significant because these international customers generate around two and a half times the average customer revenue. Finally, we drove strong revenue growth in transaction banking, which was up 63%. There were good performances in Foreign Exchange and in Global Payments Solutions. Trade was slightly down year on year in line with global trade volumes, but trade balances stabilised in the second quarter, particularly in Asia, and HSBC was named best bank for trade finance by Euromoney for the second year in a row as well as best bank in Asia. The next slide sets out our latest progress on another area of focus, the redeployment of capital from less strategic or low-connectivity businesses into higher-growth international opportunities. I’m pleased that we agreed new terms for the sale of our French retail banking operations in the quarter. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, and we now have a lot of work to do to complete migration in early 2024. The sale of our banking operations in Canada remains on track to complete in early 2024, with a special dividend of 21 cents per share planned thereafter. We completed the disposal of our Greek business last weekend and we have announced the disposal of our Russian operations. We are changing the nature of our business in Oman, and we will wind down our WPB operations in New Zealand. Crucially, this is allowing us to target growth opportunities, some of which are set out on the right-hand side. The first is the continued development of our wealth business across the whole of Asia. Our digitally enabled wealth and insurance business in mainland China now has 1,400 wealth planners and is driving good new business growth. We launched Global Private Banking in India last month. In June, we launched HSBC Innovation Banking, a strengthened, globally connected proposition on the back of our purchase of SVB UK. We will nurture the specialism we acquired, back it with HSBC’s balance sheet strength and global network, and build further innovation banking businesses in the US, here in Hong Kong and Israel. The process is already well under way and will enable us to support our clients in the technology and life sciences sectors to achieve their global ambitions. Finally, we’ve announced today that we are also increasing our shareholding in Tradeshift and have agreed to launch a jointly owned business in early 2024 to provide embedded financing solutions within their trade ecosystem. We believe this will help us to grow our client base in Commercial Banking, giving us a new avenue for growth outside of traditional relationship banking. The next slide looks at how we are diversifying revenue by growing fee income and collaboration. As I’ve said, our wealth strategy continues to gather momentum, especially in Asia. Net new invested assets were down in the rest of the world due to lower third-party asset management liquidity products, mainly in the US, but they were up in Asia by 21% to $27 billion. Over the last 12 months, we took in a total of $75 billion of net new invested assets and grew our invested assets by 8% globally. This all underlines the growth potential of our wealth business. Fee income in Commercial Banking was up 6% in the first half and collaboration revenues between our global businesses were up 5%. Collaboration revenue is particularly important in a relatively low-growth economic environment because we can drive growth from within the organisation. The next slide focuses on the tight cost discipline we’ve maintained and how it enables us to invest in the bank of the future. We remain committed to disciplined cost management and have continued to use cost savings to increase investment in digitisation. We increased spending on technology by 12.8% in the first half, and this spending now accounts for 23% of our target base operating expenses. This investment has translated into faster services, reduced friction and more competitive products, all of which will improve the customer experience and our operational efficiency. We’ve made good progress increasing digital penetration amongst personal and business customers while increasing our product release frequency. Investing in technology is also enhancing our capabilities. We now have a range of test-and-learn use cases for generative AI across HSBC and are in the process of scaling up a small number of those. Last month we became the first bank to join BT and Toshiba’s quantum-secured metro network. This uses quantum technology for secure transmission of data, which should mitigate the risk of future cyber-threats, and we are pleased to be working with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on two pilots to test the Hong Kong dollar in a new payments ecosystem and to trial tokenised deposits. My last slide shows how we have continued to build on our position as an enabler of the net zero transition. In the first half, we provided and facilitated $45 billion of sustainable finance and investments, as we continued to work closely with our clients on their transition plans. This consisted of capital markets financing and on balance sheet lending to clients and included a number of key deals in Asia and the Middle East. We were recently named Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Asia by Euromoney for the sixth consecutive year. I’ll now hand over to Georges to take you through the Q2 numbers.",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2023\230802-interim-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Interim/H1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Noel, and a warm welcome to everyone in the room with us today. It is great to be back in Hong Kong to deliver our interim results. And for those of you watching today from London and across the globe, a very good morning and thank you for joining us. We’ve announced a good set of second quarter results. Reported profits before tax were at $8.8 billion, up 89% on last year’s second quarter. Revenue was up 38% at $16.7 billion. This was driven by, first, NII of $9.3 billion, which was up $2.5 billion or 38% year on year, and, second, non-NII of $7.4 billion, which was up $2.1 billion or 39% year on year. We booked expected credit losses of $0.9 billion in the quarter. Despite the inflationary environment, cost growth in the quarter was restricted to 1% compared to last year’s second quarter, including $0.2 billion of severance costs. These severance costs were expected, and we’re on track to meet our 2023 cost target to limit cost growth to around 3% on our target cost basis. Compared to the first quarter, lending and deposits were both down 1% due to subdued loan demand, deposit outflows in Global Banking and Markets in Europe and the reclassification of our portfolio in Oman to held-for-sale. Our CET1 ratio remains strong at 14.7%. As Noel said, we announced a second interim dividend of 10 cents per share and a second share buy-back of up to $2 billion, which we intend to complete in around three months. TNAV per share was down 24 cents, due primarily to the final interim dividend for 2022 and the first interim dividend for 2023. The next slide shows another strong quarterly revenue performance with overall growth of 38% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Three further points on this: as Noel mentioned, revenue was up in all three global businesses; wealth was up 19% due to higher rates and a strong insurance performance mainly here in Hong Kong; and, three, across Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, Global Payments Solutions reported revenues of around $4.2 billion, an increase of 115% on the second quarter of 2022. On the next slide, reported net interest income was $9.3 billion, up $0.3 billion or 4% on the first quarter. We’ve introduced Banking NII as a new disclosure this quarter. It is derived by adjusting reported NII for the centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities and the NII generated by the insurance business. At $11.6 billion, banking NII was up $1.3 billion on the first quarter and up $4.5 billion on last year’s second quarter. The $2.4 billion centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities within Global Banking and Markets in the second quarter included a $0.4 billion year-to-date impact of methodology changes. As a reminder, the related income associated with these funding costs is reported within non-NII. The net interest margin was 172 basis points, up three basis points on the first quarter of 2023 and up 43 basis points of the second quarter of 2022. We continue our structural hedging activity. Our NII sensitivity is $2.6 billion for a 100 basis point drop in rates against a previous year-end sensitivity of $4 billion. At this point, we are adjusting our NII guidance. We now expect NII of at least $35 billion in 2023. Within this, we expect the centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities within Global Banking and Markets to be in excess of $7 billion with associated income reported in non-NII. We continue to reiterate that we expect to see higher pass-through rates and continued migration to time deposits, and we remain cautious on loan growth over the next six to 12 months, but we do expect it to start picking up some time in 2024. I know that many of you will have questions about Banking NII in particular, which I’ll be very happy to address as we move into Q&A later. Moving on, non-NII of $7.4 billion was down on the first quarter, which benefited from $3.7 billion of notable items and FX translation. However, it was up $2.1 billion or 39% on the second quarter of 2022. A couple of things to mention here: one, there was a strong wealth performance, up $0.3 billion or 19% on the second quarter of last year, $0.2 billion of which came from increased life insurance income primarily in Hong Kong; and, two, Markets and Securities Services was down due to lower client activity and the methodology change that I just mentioned earlier. Fees were up $0.1 billion on the second quarter of 2022 due to higher Personal Banking and Commercial Banking fees. Turning now to credit, our second quarter ECL charge was $0.9 billion, which was $0.5 billion up on the second quarter of last year. It includes $0.3 billion for our mainland China commercial real estate exposure booked in Hong Kong and a $0.3 billion charge for the UK. To remind you, this is a more normalised level of charge that we expect for this year and is a sign that our main credit indicators are holding up. On the basis of what we have seen so far in 2023 and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to expect a 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points on average gross customer lending, including held-for-sale balances. The next slide is our six-monthly update on our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. As before, our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. At the full year, our exposure was $9.4 billion. It now stands at $8.1 billion due primarily to repayments. The proportion of sub-standard and credit-impaired exposures is around 65% of the portfolio, marginally up from the full year. Of the $5.2 billion of exposures that we rated as sub-standard or credit-impaired, $1.1 billion is secured with minimal ECL due to the security held. Against the remaining $4.1 billion, we have increased our provisions from $1.7 billion at the full year to $1.9 billion today. Within this, our coverage ratio against the unsecured credit impaired exposures has increased from around 55% to nearly 70%. At the end of 2022, we calculated a plausible downside scenario of $1 billion on this portfolio. As you can see, we have now crystallised some of that downside into the P&L. We remain comfortable with our coverage level. On slide 17, despite the inflationary environment, cost growth was restricted to 1% on a constant currency basis versus the second quarter last year. As you can see, a large share of this growth was technology-related. There was also a higher performance-related pay accrual and the expected severance costs, which were part offset by a write-back of software and lease impairments. We remain committed to limiting cost growth to around 3% in 2023 on our cost target basis. On this target basis, second-quarter costs were up 6% year on year, of which around half was the $0.2 billion of expected severance costs. As a reminder, our cost target basis excludes notable items from constant currency operating expenses. It also excludes the impact of re-translating hyperinflationary economies at constant currency and, finally, it excludes the acquired cost base and additional investments in HSBC Innovation Banking, which are expected to result in incremental growth of around 1% above our targeted basis. The full cost target basis reconciliation will be on slide 26 of this deck. Our CET1 ratio was 14.7%, which was stable on the previous quarter. Profit generation was offset by the dividend accrual of $6.9 billion during the first half and the share buy-back of $2 billion that has now completed. In summary, this was another good quarter. There were good profit and net interest income performances. Credit remains resilient. We are on track to limit cost growth in 2023 to 3% on our cost target basis. We now expect NII of at least $35 billion in 2023 and, as Noel said, we now expect a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2023 and in 2024, excluding the upcoming sale of Canada. Finally, we are returning capital to shareholders by way of increased dividends and share buy-backs, and with that I’ll ask the chair to open it up for questions, Richard, please. Thank you.",False,-1.0,1

I wanted to ask about NII, please – a couple of questions. Firstly, I noted that the NIM was flat in Asia, in HBAP, quarter on quarter. Could you give us a bit more colour around that and what you would expect in Q3? I appreciate the trading book costs have been somewhat allocated there, but I would still have thought that you might see some benefit from higher HIBOR in HBAP. So please elucidate that performance a little bit more. And then, secondly, you also talked about increasing hedging and the structural hedge in order to reduce your downside risk on NII. Can you go into a bit more detail about what you’ve done and how we should think about that in terms of potential benefits going forward into 2024 and beyond? Thank you very much.",True,0.0,0

So on NIM/NII, NIM in Asia was flat because most of the uplift from rates has translated into an uplift into the non-NII component of the trading book funding, about $0.3 billion uplift in that space. We’ve introduced Banking NII. In due course, we will enhance our disclosure in this space to introduce Banking NII sensitivity and Banking NIM, which would be reflecting such an uplift. With regards your second question, Manus, the hedging activity – so if you look at our NII sensitivity, downwards 100 basis points, it has reduced from $4 billion to $2.6 billion. About a third of that reduction is due to our structural hedging activity and another third of that reduction will be a fact of the change of composition of our balance sheet, and then the last third is numerous other factors including modelling enhancements. If you now look at our structural hedging activity, which we’ve conducted over the last 12 months, the overall impact on the reduction of banking NII sensitivity is to the tune of $1 billion.",False,0.0,0

So overall funding of our trading books globally, which was heavily used also in Asia, moved from about $108 billion or circa 6% of our deposit base to around $130 billion or about 8% or 9% of our deposit base. That additional lending or that additional transition from funds has moved NII into non-NII income. It is still rates-sensitive and it does benefit from the improved level of rates, particularly in dollars, where it’s coming from.",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\230802-interim-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Interim/H1,Aman Rakkar,Barclays,"Good morning, Noel, good morning, Georges; good morning, Richard. I had two questions, please. So, again, on net interest income, at face value your ‘greater than $35 billion’ NII guide does imply a step-off in the run rate of net interest income in Q3 and Q4. I suspect you’d point us to the ‘greater than $35 billion’, suggesting that there’s some conservatism that’s baked in there, but can you talk to what the pressures are or indeed actually even the sources of support on the net interest income run rate from here through to year-end? I think one thing the market would love is some sense of whether this level of net interest income is sustainable beyond this year, so anything you can give us there. I know, relatedly, that the UK has been very strong as well, so any kind of colour you can give us on the moving parts there and the sustainability of net interest income in the UK would be great. The second question was around distributions, specifically around your dividend. You’re reiterating your 50% payout ratio guidance this year. This year and potentially next year does look like it’s going to be quite strong earnings. I guess if I take consensus, looking for an underlying EPS of around 120 cents, which implies an ordinary dividend of 60 cents, that number feels big. It’s big versus the 51 cents you used to do; it’s big versus what you did last year. And I guess the question is how comfortable are you with paying a big ordinary dividend now which might then become quite difficult to sustain in the future, as rates come off and earnings taper? Are you bothered that you do 60 cents this year and you do some number that’s lower than that next year or thereafter? Thank you very much.",True,1.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2023\230802-interim-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Interim/H1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. Thank you, Aman. In turn addressing your points, first, as you did say, we’re emphasising this as a floor. We’re emphasising this as a guidance of greater than $35 billion. We’re revising this floor because we’re gaining more comfort halfway into the year and with the outcomes of H1. We want to remain cautious, and you may find our guidance to be cautious given the difficulty to forecast some of the challenges I’ll talk about in a second. And then in terms of outlook for the rest of the year, look, we are not looking to change the consensus for H2 NII. We’re comfortable where H2 NII stands at this stage. Now, in terms of the pressure and the support we’re seeing, we’re seeing certainly tailwinds that we’ve seen already in Q2, one in terms of additional rate hikes, to be expected very much in the major currencies such as dollars, pounds and euros. We’ve seen also tailwinds in the HIBOR normalisation. We’ve seen about 1% quarter on quarter normalisation of HIBOR and, if you look at July, we continue seeing further normalisation. HIBOR is now around 5%, so probably around the end of July will have fully normalised, and those will provide us certainly some tailwinds as we look into H2. This being said, we continue to see the same headwinds we’ve been calling out from the year- end, and they will continue manifesting in H2. The first headwind which we forecast to remain is the subdued balance sheet growth, certainly subdued loan growth due to the activity. We have indicated that we may see some resumption in 2024, but for the next half year it will probably remain as a headwind and, naturally, the other headwind that is very difficult to forecast is the deposit costs, the behaviour, what pass-through rates we will be feeding in, what is the impact of lagged migration to time deposits. In Hong Kong, we’re still assuming a 1% migration per month, and whether this manifests as it is, it’s very difficult to forecast, hence our cautiousness. Now, if I look forward, look, we’re not guiding for NII in 2024, but there are a few things I can just give you to bake into your analysis. The first one is you have to exclude Canada and France retail on completion of these transactions, which now we expect for Canada in Q1 2024 and in France, as we initially ambitioned, we’re aiming 1 January 2024. The second one – you have to expect that balance sheet growth will resume at some stage in 2024 and that will give us support for NII. The third one is obviously the structured hedging, which I mentioned a bit earlier, and the impact they will have on more stabilisation of outlook for NII. And obviously the fourth one is what interest rate assumptions you are going to use and what pass-through rates you are going to use. And then, last but not least, we’re investing a lot in our non-NII or fee income-earning businesses and do expect fee income-earning businesses to continue driving some of that growth. That’s it for the NII component. So dividends – so what we shared is that we’re going to pay a 50% dividend payout ratio, excluding notable items. I think in your math, based on consensus, you have taken out notable items. I’m not going to comment on the size of the dividend, but what I’m going to say is, in order for us to sustain dividend, there are a few things we’re working on, and you can as well do the math, Aman. The first one is share buybacks. As you know, share buybacks is reducing our share count, and to the extent we ambition to continue on a journey of share buybacks as long as we remain capital-generative, which is what we forecast, you have to adjust your denominator by the share count. The second thing is the NII stabilisation actions we are taking, which should give us some protection from a reversal of the rate cycle, and the third one is obviously our cost discipline will be maintained even though we haven’t yet – we are not ready to share numbers – we will maintain the discipline, and lastly, as I again indicated, fee income growth and the investments we are putting in fee-generating areas such as investment and wealth are also initiatives to support, mitigate, turn in our earnings and therefore turn and possible in our dividends beyond 2024.",False,1.0,0

If I can ask two, please. The first one just on distribution is perhaps to invite Georges’ thoughts on potential for buybacks in the second half of the year. Looking at your capital ratio, obviously, you probably have to make a couple of adjustments – France impact of 25 basis points, you’ve got the buyback that you’ve announced today – that’s 50 basis points off the current level. Just thinking about your RoTE guidance, it does imply a slightly less capital-generative second half. Just wondering if you can scope for us, Georges, what potential buyback might be from here. And then the second one just for Noel on wealth management revenue growth. If I look at the wealth management revenue this quarter, roughly $2 billion, just sort of stable, on Q1. I’m wondering if I understood some of the momentum that you are building within the business, so if you could just help us understand how we expect the wealth management revenue will grow?",True,2.0,0

This is obviously just upfronting, if you want, the profit generation that we will be doing in the quarter. Beyond that, again, at this stage what I can say is we believe we remain capital-generative for the foreseeable future, and as long as we’re capital-generative, we continue to ambition a rolling series of share buybacks, but obviously we will review this on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on a number of factors, including our capital adequacy ratio. I just want to also highlight – and probably answering your question, Raul, and complementing the question of Aman earlier – that the Canada sale expected in Q1 2024 will provide us additional capital. The priority use of the first part of it is for a 21 cents dividend, which we will be in a position to distribute expected in H1 2024, and then the residual part of it we will utilise to supplement or complement or top up any capital buyback we are planning to do.",False,2.0,0

The $27 billion of net new invested assets here in Asia in the first half, up 21%. Globally, net new invested assets growth of $75 billion over the past 12 months, a growth in our aggregate invested assets of 7% globally. They are strong lead indicators – an additional half a million international customers in the past 12 months. For me, they are the lead indicators. I think you’re absolutely right. There will be a lag effect as you turn that customer acquisition and asset acquisition into revenue, but that’s why we’re talking about building businesses and new growth opportunities that can supplement our revenue going forward and give us some cushion and offset to any downside rate effect that may emerge post-2023 and post-2024, so we think it’s the right thing to do, and you’re right – the revenue will be a lag indicator on those early success criteria that we’re sharing with you. If you remember our growth in our wealth business in mainland China, we started with zero wealth managers just over two years ago. We’ve now got 1,400. Our ambition is to get to 3,000 over the relatively near term over the next couple of years or so. Again, that will be revenue generative as an offset because most of that is fee-based as an offset to any downside pressure that may be on interest rates, so I think your second comment is a fair comment, but I’d turn that into the positive rather than the negative. RICHARD O’CONNOR: And Raul, just to add, as you’re aware – Q1 is normally seasonally a bit stronger and IFRS 17 means you build revenue from a pretty low base but up rapidly.",False,2.0,0

Firstly on Chinese commercial real estate, there were ups in the charges in Q1, and more additional charges in Q2, what triggered those additional charges? And then when you talk about your downside scenario on slide 16, I think previously you’d said $1 billion; you’re now saying lower. Should you just take off the $0.3 billion and say $0.7 billion, or can you provide some framework around what you think the downside scenario now is?

So we have put in more charges in Q2. The total charges was $0.3 billion – or the sum of Q1 and Q2, Q1 being very benign, is $0.3 billion. Most of these charges are on stage 3s.

Now, with regards the plausible downside scenario, we indicated $1 billion at the year-end as a plausible downside.

So on savings, we’ve got a good, competitive range of fixed-rate deposit accounts in the market. We also believe we’ve got good pricing in place for more instant access type savings accounts or deposit accounts. We will participate with the FCA on any review they do. We believe if you take our two-year fixed-rate savings account in the UK, based on the yield curve in the UK, we’re offering savers the opportunity to get 5.1% on that two-year fixed-term savings account. If you compare that to our two-year fixed-mortgage product that we’re offering to our customers with a 60% loan-to-value ratio, we’re in the market at around about 5.53%, and for new-to-bank customers we’d be in the market at about 6.1%. So we believe we have the structure of the deposit book and the structure of the mortgage book in the right level, and as ever, there is a price difference between term product and instant access product because of the maturity and the liquidity risk, so we have tried to price our products fairly and appropriately. We’re very cognisant of the pressures that UK customers face at this point in time. We’ve certainly tried to remain competitive and to help them navigate what is going to be a challenging year or so, with high interest rates in the yield curve and higher rates of inflation, but we will fully participate with any review that the FCA take. We’re also trying to encourage, through marketing prompts, customers to take advantage of those products if they want them and they meet their circumstances.

One is more long term and one is more near term. For the long-term questions, I will ask management if you can give us any colour on potential impact of Basel III reform, because I think one of the key support on share prices is buyback and shareholder return, and then I think the impact of capital because of these potential regulatory changes will have an impact on how we model in future capital return, but this is more in the long-term. I understand that. I just want to get some colour – any colour – particularly after the US regulator released that Basel III endgame. How would that change our present forecast on that? So this is for the long-term question. And then on the near term, just now I think management gave us a number – a potential additional ECL charges on China CRE $0.7 billion, and then I also noticed that for our guidance for full-year credit cost is 40 basis points, but if I look at the first half, it’s a bit less than 30 basis points on an annualised basis, so that additional upside on credit costs – have we included that $0.7 billion or that $0.7 billion is outside of the 40 basis points guidance?",True,4.0,0

So on the ECL, we decided to maintain guidance at 40 basis points on ECL because there is still a lot of economic uncertainty out there. There’s economic uncertainty around China’s commercial real estate. There’s economic uncertainty generally in the world. We’ve had a good first half performance on ECL, as you say. $1.3 billion is below the run rate of 40 basis points, so we think we do have some capacity to absorb some of that risk that’s inherent in the commercial real estate book in China, but I think I’d be misleading you if everything was so scientifically proven, because it all depends on what happens elsewhere in the world. So, I could easily say, ‘Yes, we’ve got capacity to absorb that,’ but it depends what happens elsewhere in the world, but we do believe we have – it’s right to maintain a conservative guidance at the moment on ECLs at 40 basis points, and we have capacity in the second half, relative to the first half performance, to absorb some additional shocks, should they come through from near-term economic issues.

If you look at Q2 at $0.9 billion as a more normalised level, so that is more a level that you can look at, whereas Q1 was unusually quite low, so this is why H1 will look low to your taste. So on Basel III, the first thing to share about Basel III is we need to know the final rules. At this stage, most of these rules are still in draft form, and they will remain subject to change as we know the final rule. The second thing I will share is that, based on the current draft rules as per our PRA standards for the Group holdings, there will be a minor improvement initially in our RWAs, but as the output floor starts kicking in five years into the journey, so from 2025 plus five years, there is a likelihood that the outputs floor will catch us and that the impact may be in a material up or down – but immaterial up as we look at it this way. This being said, I just want to caution one thing. The US obviously issued their draft rules last week. They came out more severe than we initially expected. They will have an impact on our US operations. It remains a marginal impact. We’re likely talking single-digit RWA uplift against a possible downward move before that, but those rules will impact our local reporting for our US entity – will not change the way we report at the group level, so we will need to navigate both, if you want, in parallel.",False,4.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2023\230802-interim-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Interim/H1,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Yes, that’s fair. Listen, you’re absolutely right. We’re keeping a strong and tight cost discipline in the bank, but what we’re doing is we’re reallocating cost “from / to”, and what we’re typically reallocating is from what I’d call bad costs – costs that are associated with low returning portfolios, low returning business activities in certain markets or costs that are associated with manual processes that should be digitised – so if you look at our cost performance, I think we increased our investment in IT costs by 12% so far this year – first half to first half – we increased some of our investment cost in our global businesses, and we reduced cost elsewhere, and that’s what’s getting us back to the 3%. So we’re investing and saving at the same time, and that is a phenomenon that probably, historically, HSBC has not been great at. It has typically been cost management or cost investment, and it has been a cycle. You manage costs tightly, and then you invest. We’re definitely trying to do both at the same time, and there’s a lot of self-funding going on to try and mitigate the overall cost base, and that’s how we’re building out the 1,400 people in mainland China, because we’re saving cost through other country exits, other market exits, reducing our support costs in some of the manual processes in our global processing centres. That’s allowing that investment to take place, and that’s been the journey for the past three years. On SVB, the integration is going well. We’ve had no nasty surprises since the day we bought the business. It was profitable the day we bought it. It is still profitable. We’re going through systems migration at the moment. One statistic which is probably an important guide for the future – in the three months post-acquisition, we took in new-to-bank customers at a higher rate than the three months prior to acquisition, so in the transition of ownership from the previous owners to us, we’ve seen an uptick in the momentum of customers wanting to bank with SVB in that first three-month period. That acquisition has also given us the knowledge, the platform, the connections, and frankly, the positive brand and reputation globally that has allowed us to go and recruit a team in the US. We recruited a team here in Hong Kong and we’ve recruited a team in Israel. So my view that there is strong growth prospects in that business, not just for the next two or three years – I’m doing this because I think this will be an important business for us in the five to 10 to 15-year timeframe. This is an important sector of the economy and we’re willing to invest in it, so I’m very pleased with how it’s going. We probably do owe you, as an investment community, more detail on how material, what are the numbers, and I’ll think we’ll come back to you at the end of the year with, if you add this all together, the investment and the current bought business, what could that potentially look like going forward and how material is that, but that is something, if it’s okay, we’ll give you more towards the end of this year with the full- year results.",False,5.0,0

Good morning and good afternoon all. I had one back on costs, and then one on NIM specifically in the UK. On costs, in the context of a very strong top line and then uprated RoTE guidance this year and next year, I’m just interested in how you’re thinking about investment spend in that context of what is a better revenue backdrop that you had previously anticipated. Guidance is very clear for this year, but does it change your attitude at all for next year and beyond, also mindful of consensus - modest growth next year from where you’re guiding in the market - so just how deliverable or appropriate you think that is in the context of what is a better top line and given the opportunity available to you? And then the second question was on NIM in the UK. You saw a very strong growth in the second quarter in the ringfenced bank, in stark contrast to some UK peers. If you could talk about some of the dynamics, how you see the deposit mix evolving.

Certainly on costs it’s a very simple answer. We’re not giving any guidance at this stage on 2024. We’ll give an update on 2024 guidance at the end of the year, but on 2023 we’ve given, I think, a strong commitment on cost discipline. I also will maintain strong cost discipline in 2024, but I’m not going to quantify what that means in terms of percentage growth at this stage. On the UK, Georges, it would be good if you could just share some of the information that we’ve got on the UK, particularly the progress we’re still making in the UK mortgage market, despite the pressures in the UK mortgage market.

The overall book passthrough is in the around between 40% and 50%, but clearly the marginal passthroughs are higher at these high level of rates. Equally on the mortgages, we continue aiming for market share, so we’ve grown the stock market share from 7.7% to 7.8% and our new business market share is now just shy of 10%, so we maintain a leading proposition in mortgages. Now if I go specifically on the NIM, without talking to our peers, some parameters that you can use when you’re doing your assessment and your analysis – the first one is we have a very strong liquidity position with a very strong deposit franchise and a low loan-to-deposit ratio. The second one to take into account is we are relatively small in consumer finance, so that component of our portfolio is single-digit percentage of our retail finance. The third one to take into account is that our structural hedging is relatively young, i.e. we started the structural hedging essentially when rates started to be at higher levels, so we have little baggage from structural hedging positions from prior, i.e. when rates were very low, and this is obviously helping us in adjusting our NIM upwards, and we’re not bugged by low-interest-earning assets from older structural hedges.

Just on your revised RoTE guidance 2023 and 2024, it’s in the mid-teens, excluding the material notable items. I understand when I look at your company consensus, you have got material notable items in there. I think the sale of Canada is boosting the consensus return, so my point and my question is I think that that potentially obscures the size of the underlying upgrade that you’re guiding to for return on tangible equity in 2024, and my concern is whether the way you now present the figures, because the notables now are part of your numbers and therefore I think it makes sense for the consensus to look at it that way, but I’m just wondering whether this presentation is making it more difficult for investors to understand the underlying drivers of the business and whether that is maybe even affecting your rating at some level.

As we look to year-end, we do anticipate that we will reinstate this impairment sometime in H2 for a possible, obviously, closure of the transaction on 1 January, so that notable item, if you want, washes itself out from our full-year expectations. As regards 2024, I think the Canada impact is a couple percentage points on our RoTE, so whether you stretch the mid-teens a little bit on either side, you may still be right, but we would like to take it out because obviously it remains – while we are very confident in the resolution – it remains an element that is subject to continued regulatory approvals, so you can do your math with or without.",False,7.0,0

If you take out the two notable items, you get to an 18.5% RoTE. We’re guiding mid-teens to be equivalent, you could say, with the 18 number, not the 22 number, and if you think about 2024, there’ll be a profit on sale of Canada, assuming that transaction completes. There will be a capital policy around that in the form of dividend and in the form of buybacks, but we’re not including that profit on sale within our guidance – we’re not including that in our definition of mid-teens. That’s over and above. So what we’re trying to say we’re giving you a mid-teens RoTE guidance for the core business, not with the big swings in M&A activity achieving it. That’s the way I’d look at it, so we just want to try and make sure everyone understands what we mean by mid-teens, and it doesn’t include the big one-offs – either the one-off positives or the one-off negatives.

The first one is perhaps on non- interest income, especially in wealth in Asia. If I look at your Asian entity reporting and look at revenues, it’s pretty flat quarter on quarter, but NII has gone up a little bit, so that suggests to me that non-interest income has come down a little. I’m just wondering what you see in the frontline, especially with regards to wealth and obviously Hong Kong’s GDP print yesterday was quite a bit weaker than expected, so just what you see in context and your expectation about your Chinese business and to what extent do you think that that might help you. So that’s my first question. And then the second question is on deposit migration in Hong Kong because I noted in slide 41 it looks like Hang Seng, which is obviously traditionally very strong retail savings franchise, it looks like deposit migration went the other way, so does that suggest that migration is nearly there in Hong Kong and is it topping out?",True,8.0,0

If you take this one out, the growth is essentially from insurance and insurance in Hong Kong. It does appear under non-NII, but not fee income. That growth is a reflection of the growth we’ve seen in Q1. It’s in the 40% to 50% growth year on year. It is reflective of the opening of the border between China and Hong Kong and the additional inflow of mainland Chinese new policies in our Hong Kong business. About 30% of new policies are from mainland Chinese. As you would expect, insurance is a core component of wealth, in particular here in Hong Kong, and that’s the main driver of the growth. We still see some softness in wealth with regards equities trading, and that’s more reflective of the equity markets in general, and I want to say while the Hong Kong GDP is the main driver of our loan portfolios in terms of growth in our balance sheet, wealth activity is not necessarily directly linked to the GDP. It is linked to investor behaviours and it is linked to sentiment in the market. With regards your second question on migration, in HSBC we continue to see a migration of around 1% per month, although it did slow a little bit in April, but that continued a trend that we have been forecasting, whereas in Hang Seng, where the term deposit share is in the mid-30s percent. Our colleagues in Hang Seng have taken a proactive approach to manage some of the highly rate-sensitive deposits, and allowed them, if you want, to accept some attrition against these highly rate-sensitive or rate-chasing deposits, and this is what allowed them to maintain or slightly reduce their term deposit mix.

We continue increasing our book. On the pricing, as you know, the mortgages are capped and the pricing is highly correlated to the savings rate. For instance, last week we increased the saving rate by about 12.5 basis points on the Hong Kong dollar.

If you take all of the international banks’ share of the corporate debt market in mainland China, I think all of us together are about 2% market share. So actually, growing your corporate banking business as an international bank, particularly if your strategy is connecting mainland China to the rest of the world in both directions – GDP is not the prime driver of growth in the sense of what you can do, because you’re still relatively niche in the market, and what is a huge market, so you can get growth despite the fact that GDP – and by the way, GDP is still 5%-plus, so it’s not bad, but you can still get growth. Similarly, in our wealth business that we’re pursuing in mainland China we’re pursuing an area which is around about helping internationally-orientated personal customers, and particularly the domestic customers in the Greater Bay Area get access to wealth products and insurance products to help them with their protection needs and their savings needs. That is primarily targeted at the affluent or the emerging affluent sector rather than particularly at the high net worth or ultra high net worth. That is the core business we have here in Hong Kong. The way I look at it is that the wealth proposition here in Hong Kong has been a very strong driver of growth and profitability for HSBC in Hong Kong. Will we see that same opportunity in the Greater Bay Area? The engagement between the Greater Bay Area – or the Guangdong province – and Hong Kong represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for us, and what we’re trying to do, which is different to three or four years ago, is we’re targeting international wealth and insurance as our primary proposition, as opposed to just becoming another mortgage provider or another card provider in Guangdong province.

I'm Fas Yousaf, Group Treasurer. I'm excited to be here today and looking forward to engaging with you all over the coming weeks and months. Firstly, before I move on to the Q2 update, I wanted to give you a bit about my background. I've been at HSBC for over 22 years, in that time spanning many roles across Finance and Risk, most recently as Global Head of Traded and Treasury Risk. I'm excited by the new challenge and I'm looking forward to further shaping and delivering the ambitious treasury agenda that we have here at HSBC. Coming back to the second quarter, our financial resources remain in solid shape. As Georges mentioned, our CET1 ratio was 14.7%, flat on the quarter, 3.8 percentage points above our MDA level. Attributable profits added 1.8 percentage points to the ratio, but were fully off set by the dividend accrual for the second quarter and the first quarter buyback. Our CET1 ratio remains above our planned operating range, which to remind you is 14.0% to 14.5%. Albeit the current buyback is expected to lower the ratio by about 25 basis points. And additionally, we expect the re-recognition of impairment of our French retail business will further reduce the ratio by approximately 25 basis points. We expect to recognize this loss in the second half. With respect to liquidity, remember that we primarily manage liquidity at individual legal entity level, so our liquidity story is more complicated than the Group LCR. We show the LCRs of our major entities on slide 14 of our fixed income investor deck, and I would urge you to note the strong ratios, all of which are above the group ratio of 132%, demonstrating the conservatism that's baked into our group LCR calculation. In high level terms, we have $796 billion of high-quality liquid assets on the balance sheet, of which over $300 billion is in cash. Our funding position remains enviable with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 60%, giving us a very significant deposit surplus. Our MREL ratio was 31.2% of RWAs, which is 4.8 percentage points above our 26.4% requirement, and we expect to continue to maintain a prudent buffer over that requirement. On issuance, starting with HoldCo Senior, well we've issued just under $16 billion so far this year, after the $3 billion issuance in August. We have a plan of $17 billion to $20 billion for the year and currently expect to be at the lower end of that range. As such, we have limited further needs and expect negative net issuance in the second half. Of course, I would not rule out pre-financing for next year in Q4, but this would be a decision taken closer to the time. In terms of Tier 2, we have issued $3 billion so far in '23, and that's against the plan of $4 billion to $5 billion, and again, we currently expect to come in at the lower end of that range. Finally, we came into the year with relatively modest AT1 needs, only around $2 billion and covered the need in February. We've announced the call of our AT1 callable this year, totalling $4 billion, and so we will see another year of net negative issuance in this asset class. Overall in summary, our profitability, capital, funding and liquidity position leave us well-placed and our business model offers bondholders one of the most diversified banks in the world.

I just wanted to ask about capital generation, and I know in your fixed income presentation you put that first and foremost, thank you for that, I think it's an underappreciated credit metric. Could you talk about what you think the realistic running rate for capital generation would be over the next several quarters? That’s number one. Number two, do you think that we're kind of at peak levels there? Or do you see any kind of expansion in the capital generation rate? And then three, if you talk a bit about the experience in the U.K., you saw a bit of margin expansion, doing a little bit better than peers. Just what's going on in the general environment, margin-wise? And then if you could address credit quality, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.",True,0.0,0

Let me start with the capital question. So we are in a position, as you will have seen where we are very capital generative. We guided to an NII for the full year of greater than $35 billion and that's updated this half. We are not guiding for 2024 at this stage, but all of the metrics, from our perspective, look very positive for the forthcoming years. And we are working to ensure that we have stable NII for the future. So there are various things that we're doing in that regard and perhaps I'll call out just a few of those. So first of all, we have, as you will know, been working on a program of structural interest rate hedging. That is progressing well and you will have seen that our sensitivity over the half has come down from where it was at the end of '22 at around $4 billion for 100 basis points move down in rates. That has come down to $2.6 billion. There are various factors that drive that, but about a third of that number is down to our structural interest rate hedging program, and we'll continue that program over the course of H2. We're also working on diversifying our revenue base, so we're moving through a number of initiatives to generate greater fee income, and you will have seen that in the equity call at half year. So overall, I would say from a capital generation perspective a very positive outlook. Perhaps I will pass to Georges to talk about the U.K. and the U.K. market, if that's okay.",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\230908-interim-results-2023-fixed-income-investors-conference-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,2,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. Thanks, Fas. Thank you, Robert. I would also highlight in the capital generation, as an addendum to Fas’s point, the intended sale of our Canadian business, and you may have seen very recently the Competition Bureau in Canada giving the go-ahead. Obviously, additional regulatory approval and ministerial approval are required, but that sale should provide us with increased capital, which we’ve already indicated that of an amount of $9-10 billion, we will use $4 billion of which as priority use for the special dividend of 21 cents per share, and then the rest would just become excess capital available for share buybacks or other capital actions. Specifically on the UK margin expansion, the first thing I want to highlight, Robert, is very important – that we are passing through to customers the majority of the rate increases that we have seen of late. In particular, we’ve passed to our instant access retail saving accounts more than 70% of the most recent increases we’ve seen in the UK in GBP. So, therefore, it’s very important to position this. The overall pass-through on some of these instant savings accounts now is close to 50% on a cumulative basis. So, the reason why our NIM has performed compared to other peers – and I’m only going to give you some elements. Obviously, I cannot comment on other peers. The first element is we have a materially smaller fixed-rate consumer lending book, which, in the market, had suffered some reduction due to customers repaying some of these consumer loans. We did not have this dynamic manifest in our books. The second one is that we continue to have a very strong franchise in deposits – and has therefore helped us not have to pay up for some of the flighty deposits. And, as a reference, our term deposits remain a small, single-digit percentage of our overall portfolio. And the third thing to call out is also the fact that our large mortgage book with a growing market share in mortgages – our new business market share is just shy of 10% against the back book market share of the mid-7%s – is giving us additional impetus, if you want, on the NII, given the way mortgages have been struck. So these are some of the metrics that have allowed our NIM to perform as you’ve seen in Q2. A word of caution, though – we do believe that, at these levels, we’re probably going to see a more stable NIM than any additional expected increases in this space. Thank you, Robert.",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\230908-interim-results-2023-fixed-income-investors-conference-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,2,Robert Smalley,Ubs,"Thanks for all the detail. It’s greatly appreciated. RICHARD O’CONNOR, GLOBAL HEAD OF INVESTOR RELATIONS: Robert, apologies. You had two other questions there – credit quality UK, which I’ll take. Look, you saw in Q2. UK credit quality went back to normal if you look at the basis point charge, and so it’s actually been better than some, or at least some commentators would say. Two areas where we are watchful: the mid-market segment and our early warning indicators on areas like mortgages or cars, but generally, UK credit quality is bearing up pretty well in a tough economic environment, but I’d say the charge very much for Q2 was at a pretty normalised level. There’s two other quick points on capital generation, Robert. Look, you’ll clearly be aware of the building blocks with guidance for mid-teens RoTE. We were above that in the first half. That excludes, for example, Canada gain, and also our guidance for, short term, pretty cautious on loan growth versus our medium-term mid-single digit growth, for obvious reasons – pretty muted loan demand in, for example, Hong Kong and the UK at the moment. We’re not bearish longer-term, but certainly near-term, that will be the case. You’ve got the consensus on the website, and that’s up to date, so you’ve got all the building blocks there. The one thing I would say is, clearly, the associate income doesn’t flow through automatically to capital. Obviously, the dividends from the associates, which are public – and you can get them off Bloomberg in five seconds – do flow into capital, so you just need to make that adjustment along with other adjustments as you do your capital model, okay?",True,0.0,0

There have been a lot of changes in the group structure and things you’ve sold and the like over the last few years. Just any areas, at a broad level, where you think the group’s structure can be improved, as you look out from here? Secondly, welcome to the incoming new treasurer. Any areas where you think there’s scope for optimisation within the HSBC liability structure? And then a more detailed one to finish – just why run such a large MREL headroom at 480 basis points? Is that a mix of how it works across each individual resolution entities, or just why is that so large? They would be my three questions. Thank you.",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\230908-interim-results-2023-fixed-income-investors-conference-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,2,Faisal Yousaf,Group Treasurer,"Okay. Thank you very much, Lee. I think I’ll probably start with the treasurer question, and then go into group structure, and then the MREL. So, I officially moved into role on 1 July. I’d start by saying, look, I’m very familiar with HSBC, having been here some 22 years, as I said earlier. The strategy that I will adopt as Group Treasurer will be consistent with that of my predecessors, so there’s no radical change that we’d expect to see, certainly in the short term, and our strategy is entirely aligned to the overall Group strategy. From my perspective, probably, I’ve got four high-level priorities that I would call out. The first is really protecting and safeguarding what is a very strong capital, liquidity, deposit base and an overall balance sheet, and that’s working with our global businesses and global functions in order to do that. The second is really around ‘optimise’ and ‘enhance’. So, what I want to do is apply a commercial lens to optimise where we use our financial resources across the organisation to benefit shareholders, investors and the like. The third area, which is ever-present, I think, is regulation, and we’ve got a substantial programme of regulatory change that we need to deliver on, and that’s a priority. And I suspect we’ll touch on a little bit through the course of the call, but we’ve obviously got our commitments in terms of resolvability and recovery, and the legacy stack is one area that I’ll be very focused on as I move through the role. We’ve got LIBOR cessation as well, which is another area of regulatory change, and the overall Basel 3.1 framework as well. The fourth and final bit that I would call out is technology and analytics, so that’s going to be an area of focus for me. I will be looking at optimisation, digitisation and making the best use of technology and advanced analytics within our treasury capabilities at HSBC. So, to go on to your specific question about the liability structure and whether there’s scope for optimisation of the liability structure, it’s something we’d always look at and I have looked at over a period of time. There’s nothing that I would call out, obviously, at this point in time, but we’ll continue to look at that as we go ahead. Equally, in terms of the group structure, as you allude to in your question, we’ve made a lot of changes over the past two years with the disposal of the French retail business and of our business within Canada. Add to that the restructuring in Oman and the completing of the disposal of the Greek business as well and the announcement that we will be winding down our operations in Russia. So there’s a lot of things that we’ve been doing in a very short space of time. We’ll continue to look for opportunities, but we’ll obviously announce those as and when we go along. Finally, in terms of our MREL and the MREL structure, there are various drivers for that. At the moment, the overall buffer that we run is around 4.8 or which 3.8 is CET1.",False,0.0,0

That’s effectively the buffer that we’re running in CET1, and right now as well, you’ll note we’re operating at 14.7, so we are operating about 50 basis points above the mid-point of our range, though, naturally, that buffer will likely come down modestly over time, and we’ll be primarily still CET1, and we’ll run a small buffer in other MREL instruments.",False,0.0,0

Thanks for doing the call. I have three as well. The first one was just following on from what you were saying about optimal levels of capital. So I guess you’ve been shrinking that Tier 1 stack with calls larger than you’ve re-financed, and I guess I’m just interested – is this level of Tier 1 where you see yourselves longer term or could we maybe expect you to increase it back to more historical levels when double leverage was a bigger factor? Secondly, I guess, on the legacy – it would be remiss of me not to bring it up. You’ve done an awful lot, and that’s been acknowledged. I guess the one part of the stack that I think you haven’t touched yet is the make-whole bonds, so the 10.176 and the 5.844. I guess my assumption is these bonds have to go eventually. Is there something you’re waiting for? Is there something we should be watching out for? I guess is it rates peaking? Is there anything else that we should be looking at? I’m just interested to hear your thoughts with regard to that. And then, finally, just on LIBOR, I guess you’ve got a number of AT1s with fallbacks which are defined, but I’m just interested to hear how you’re thinking about those, particularly the New York law AT1s, which have got problems with the reference to mid swaps. Any thoughts there would be appreciated. Thanks.",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\230908-interim-results-2023-fixed-income-investors-conference-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,2,Faisal Yousaf,Group Treasurer,"Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. So perhaps start with the Tier 1 or AT1 stack. Our funding plan for this year in senior holdco[?] was for $17-20 billion, as I said, and in AT1 was $2 billion, and in Tier 2, was around $4-5 billion. Now, we’re very close to meeting those levels and, as I said right at the beginning, we’ll be pitching for the lower end of those ranges. On a go-forward basis, I think that’s broadly where we will be looking to issue. I’d expect a fairly stable funding plan over the period. Now, if we focus in and zoom in onto the AT1, we’ve been net negative in terms of issuance this year, and indeed for the last couple of years, so this year, we’ve issued $2 billion, but called and redeemed around $4 billion. On a go-forward basis, I think we will be, by and large, with all things being equal – RWAs and the like – net flat in terms of our issuance for AT1. So that’s probably the best guidance I can give you at this stage. Onto legacy and the make-whole piece, it has been a considerable focus for us, and we’ve reduced the legacy stack by around $6 billion over the past couple of years, albeit we have still approximately $8 billion to go. We would like, for the legacy Tier 1 make-wholes, just like the rest of the legacy stack, we’d want to redeem them if we can, but at a reasonable cost. The economics are extremely important for us, and we have a duty to our shareholders, and any actions that we take would obviously need to be fully justified. As we’ve said on prior fixed income calls, the economics here aren’t really ideal and, as such, we continue to look at the options. I think you can probably conclude, given that we’ve had – that these have been available to call for a little period of time, that the economics on the make- whole calls that we have are not economic. So, we’ll continue to look at it, but there’s nothing more, really, I can add at this point in time. Finally, on LIBOR, look, it’s another area of focus for us. We’ve made some progress there, as you will have seen from the announcements in June. We want to work together with our investors to reach a solution that’s mutually agreeable and in line with the regulatory requirements. However, in some cases, this is not entirely possible. In the case of the New York instruments, consent solicitation isn’t an option for us because, under New York law, we would require 100% of bondholders to agree to any change. So, then, that makes those swap resets instruments a little harder to deal with. We’ll look at options. We’ll continue to focus on it, but that’s where we are at the moment. As you will know, in ’21, we undertook consent solicitation on some of our Sterling and Singaporean Dollar English law securities. It was very pleasing because we were able to remediate the sterling ones. We got that passed. The sing ones weren’t able to pass, but we’ve since redeemed those. So there are multiple actions we can take with this, and we’ll look at all of them for all of the LIBOR-based instruments.",False,1.0,0

Can I just – just one point on the make-wholes? I guess you referred to the economics, and other issuers talk about economics in the round. Are you just referring to the day-one impact of buying these back, I guess, or is it a NPV of the future cash flows less the cost on day one? Is there something else to it?",True,1.0,0

As Fas mentioned, though, what I would say is, of course, is we’re not absolutely clinical on that point. We are willing to take a loss and that’s part of the broader conversation.

Presentation Transcripts\2023\230908-interim-results-2023-fixed-income-investors-conference-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,2,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Sure. Thanks, Paul. So, on the China commercial real estate, as we indicated at the interim results, the piece that remains of a concern, of a more material concern, to us is the offshore piece, the piece that’s booked in Hong Kong, and a portion of which is unsecured. So that is the one that remains a cause for concern. We had, at the year-end, if you recall, mentioned a plausible downside scenario of $1 billion additional ECL. By the end of H1, we had taken, in aggregate, about $300 million against that portfolio towards that plausible downside. I think, when you look at the events that took place in August, I would point, really, to two indicators. The first one is we continue to see policy measures being constructive and supportive of that sector, and we see these policy measures – practically every week, a series of measures that are meant to structurally and more sustainably support the sector going forward, which is a positive outcome. But we equally continue to see deterioration of the financials of some of the borrowers, and that deterioration is, unfortunately for some, happening faster than the benefits of some of these policy measures that may come in. So, as a net, if you want, of these two, we’re looking at it more cautiously now than we were in early August, and I would say the plausible downside we indicated at this stage we believe remains valid, we believe, in terms of quantum. We believe, though, that the probability of the plausible downside has increased following the events of August, and we continue watching this space, and we do expect indeed to give you additional guidance at the Q3 results in a couple of months. On your ECL, so we indeed maintain 40 basis points for this year. We did factor in some of the possible adverse events that could take place in Hong Kong and the UK. We indeed are seeing those events in Hong Kong materialise, related to this China offshore real estate portfolio – commercial real estate portfolio, whereas we do see things more resilient, as Richard mentioned earlier, more resilient in the UK, and the indicators holding up quite well. This is why we were comfortable – we remain comfortable with the 40 basis points. We haven’t given any guidance for 2024. I can only point you to our through-the-cycle guidance on ECLs of 30 to 40 basis points, that range, through the cycle. We will be giving any further 2024 guidance when we give more granular guidance to ’24. At this stage, we are only committing to a mid-teen return on tangible equity for ’24 as the only guidance that’s very specific to ’24 on our results. On the sale of France, so, look, as Fas mentioned, we continue to expect that we will have to reinstate the 25 basis point impairment, or $2.2 billion impairment, of that sale sometime in H2. We had initially communicated an ambition to execute it on 1 January. Obviously, the risks around that filing are there, but the main risks to call out is the process of regulatory approval. The transaction is more complex than the one we signed originally. It has more parameters to it, and therefore requires more evaluation and more time. But, as you would expect, the moment we see this to become a highly likely transaction, we would reinstate the impairment, and probably give more guidance at that stage as to more exact timelines.

I just had a quick follow-up question on the legacies, and basically, thank you very much for mentioning the economics being the key criteria, but there’s a very different economics on the 10.176 dollar legacy Tier 1, where the make-whole price is 130, and the sterling, the 5.844, where it’s 106. So, should we look at this decision as a package, or could you potentially make a different decision on those different bonds? Thank you very much.",True,2.0,0

I think in terms of the economics, it’s important to come back to that point that I mentioned to Dan earlier - the economics isn’t just about the upfront hit. It’s about funding it as well. So, we’ll take into account the upfront cost, and then of course you get either the bleed or the benefit through the P&L over the period of time – effectively, to the par call date around 2030.

Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter results call today. I will lead today’s presentation and Noel Allow me to begin by saying a few words on recent events in the Middle East. We have all been shocked by the devastating terrorist attack on Israel on 7 October and saddened by the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The loss of innocent life and suffering is heart-breaking. We continue to offer assistance to our impacted colleagues and clients. Just to be clear, we are not changing our strategy in Israel or the Middle East. Turning to our results now, as always, our purpose, ambition, values and strategy have been helping us drive the results that I am going to talk about today. Some highlights to begin with – first of all, the year-to-date performance clearly demonstrates that we have had three consecutive strong quarters reflecting the successful execution of our strategy. Year-to-date reported profit before tax was $29.4 billion, which is an increase of $17.4 billion on the same period last year, supported by higher interest rates and enabled by our strong balance sheet and the non-recurrence of notable items. We have delivered an annualised return on tangible equity of 17.1%, excluding strategic transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, these transactions are the reversal earlier this year of the impairment relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in France and a gain on acquisition from SVB UK. We’ve announced another share buyback of up to $3 billion, bringing total buybacks announced this year up to $7 billion, and we’ve announced three quarterly dividends, which total 30 cents per share. We have also exhibited good growth across our businesses. Wholesale transaction banking revenue was up 50% year to date primarily due to higher rates and reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise. Wealth had another good quarter. Wealth balances were up by 12% compared to the same quarter of last year, and we’re also very pleased that we attracted $34 billion of net new invested assets in the quarter, bringing the rolling 12-month total to $77 billion, which is a strong performance and testament to our strategy. The planned acquisition of Citi’s wealth business in mainland China will also help accelerate our growth plans for this business. In our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK, we are also seeing good growth areas. In Hong Kong, insurance new business CSM was up 40% year on year, and our mortgage books in Asia and the UK grew by a total of $11 billion compared to the third quarter of last year. Let me now move on to the third quarter numbers. Revenue was $16.2 billion, which was up $4.6 billion of 40% on last year’s third quarter on a constant currency basis. This was driven firstly by group net interest income of $9.2 billion, which was up by $1.3 billion on the same period last year. Secondly, non-NII was $6.9 billion, up by $3.3 billion primarily due to, first, the non-recurrence of a $2.5 billion impairment in last year’s third quarter relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in France; second, a $1.6 billion higher revenue offset into NII from the central costs of funding GBM trading activity; and, three, offset by $0.6 billion of treasury disposal losses taken for structural hedging and risk management purposes for our balance sheet. Banking NII of $11.5 billion was up $2.8 billion on last year’s third quarter and broadly stable on the second quarter. Expected credit losses of $1.1 billion were broadly stable on the same period last year and included a $0.5 billion charge in relation to our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio booked in Hong Kong. Costs were up 1% in the quarter, as lower restructuring costs were offset by higher technology spend, a higher performance-related pay accrual and costs from HSBC Innovation Banking. Lending balances and deposits were both broadly stable, and our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, an increase of 20 basis points on the second quarter. Finally, we announced the third consecutive quarter of strong capital returns, with a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share and a further share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we expect to complete before the full-year results in February. The next slide shows that our global businesses all performed well. Wealth and Personal Banking had a strong quarter, with revenues up by 71% or by 7% excluding the impairment taken in last year’s third quarter relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France. Within this, Wealth was up by 6%, as our ongoing investment in that business continued to gain traction, and Personal Banking also had another good quarter, up by 21%, due mainly to higher rates. Across Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, Global Payments Solutions had revenues of more than $4.3 billion, which was an increase of 56% on the third quarter of 2022. In our trade business, lending balances were up 3% in the quarter, mainly in Asia, reversing the declining trend from previous quarters. Global Banking and Markets also performed well, up by 2%. This included a resilient performance in Foreign Exchange compared to a strong third quarter last year and a good performance in Securities Financing and Debt Markets. On this next slide, reported net interest income was $9.2 billion, which was broadly stable on the second quarter. Banking NII was $11.5 billion, up $2.8 billion on last year’s third quarter and stable on the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, Banking NII in the second quarter was favourably impacted by a $0.4 billion year-to-date catch-up due to methodology changes, approximately half of which was attributable to the first quarter. Adjusting for this, Banking NII was slightly up in this third quarter on a like-for-like basis. The net interest margin remained broadly stable at 170 basis points. We are not updating our 2023 NII guidance and are also not expecting consensus to change. Next, constant currency non-NII of $6.9 billion was up $3.3 billion on last year’s third quarter primarily due to 1) a $2.3 billion favourable movement in notable items and foreign exchange, as last year’s third quarter included a $2.5 billion impairment relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in France and this year’s third quarter included a $0.6 billion of treasury disposal losses; 2) a $1.6 billion increase in the revenue offset into non-NII from the central cost of funding GBM trading activity; and 3) a $0.3 billion decrease in ‘other’, which includes lower Markets Treasury income. We continue to reposition our treasury portfolio as part of our balance sheet structural hedging and risk management initiatives. In the third quarter, this resulted in $0.6 billion of treasury disposal losses. These losses do not have a material impact on CET1 capital or TNAV as they have already been taken through reserves last year, although they will have a modest benefit to our CET1 ratio this year. The disposal proceeds are reinvested into higher-yielding or higher- duration assets. Disposal losses are forecast to be more than recovered through NII, with the majority over the next five years. Further restructuring of the treasury portfolio, leading to a loss of around $0.4 billion, is expected in the fourth quarter, which will also be reported as a notable item and have modest CET1 upside. Turning now to credit, our third-quarter ECL charge was $1.1 billion, which was stable on the same period last year. It includes a $0.5 billion charge related to our mainland China commercial real estate exposure booked in Hong Kong, following a $0.4 billion charge in the same quarter last year. The remaining wholesale charge was $0.3 billion. The $0.2 billion personal lending charge included modest UK releases, although we retain overlays to address the current risks in the economic outlook. Stage three balances of $19 billion were down $1 billion on the second quarter and account for 2% of total loans. We continue to expect a 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending, including held-for- sale balances. Focusing now on our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio, our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. As you can see, our total exposure stands at $7.5 billion, which is down by $0.5 billion from the half year, primarily due to write-offs. In February this year, we communicated the management-assessed plausible downside scenario of around $1 billion. The deterioration in the third quarter means that we crystallised around $500 million of provisions into the P&L that were part of this plausible downside. We’re encouraged by recent policy measures, which will help the sector, but need time to take effect, so the plausible downside scenario does now look more realistic for full year 2023. Our exposures rated ‘strong’, ‘good’ and ‘satisfactory’ were broadly stable on the third quarter last year. Around half of these exposures is lending to state-owned enterprises. The other half is primarily lending to privately owned enterprises that are not residential property developers. This is reflected in the minimal ECL allowance in this part of the portfolio. And if I now turn to the table at the bottom of the slide, against unsecured credit-impaired exposures, we already have now a 73% coverage ratio, and against unsecured sub-standard exposures, we have a coverage ratio of just under 10%. This is clearly an area that we will continue to monitor closely, but to reiterate, we continue to expect a 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending, including held-for-sale balances. Next, on costs, reported costs for the first nine months of 2023 were down 2% on last year, primarily due to lower restructuring costs. Our cost efficiency ratio for the same period was 44%, improved from 66% last year. On a constant-currency basis, costs were up by 1% on last year’s third quarter as the lower restructuring costs were offset by increased technology and operations spend, a higher performance-related pay accrual and the acquisition and investment costs from HSBC Innovation Banking, which were not included in our original plans. On our cost-target basis, we now expect our 2023 costs to be around 4% higher than 2022. This is around 1% or $300 million more than previously guided due to higher technology and operations spending, which we believe is appropriate given the importance of digitisation to the group and the strong financial performance of the business. In addition to this, we are contemplating an increase in performance-related pay in the fourth quarter, depending on the outturn of our performance and ongoing execution of our strategy in the fourth quarter. This would represent a further increase of around 1%. We have provided a full reconciliation from reported cost to our target-basis cost on slide 15 of the deck, and to reiterate, tight cost discipline remains my priority and a priority across the whole group. The next slide shows our strong capital position. Our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, which was up 20 basis points on the second quarter. A few things to draw your attention to. 1) The dividend accrued year to date is $9.6 billion or 49 cents per share whilst we have announced dividends of $5.9 billion or 30 cents per share; 2) We have announced a further share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have a circa 40 basis point impact on our CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter. We are aiming to complete it before the full-year results in February; 3) We also expect to reclassify our retail banking operations in France as held for sale in the fourth quarter, ahead of completion of the planned sale on 1 January 2024, which would have a further impact on the CET1 ratio of around 30 basis points. Finally, the planned sale of our Canada banking business also remains on track to complete in the first quarter of 2024 and, as a reminder, profits from our Canada banking business accrue to the buyer and are not included in our dividend calculations for the year. We estimate the gain on sale will be around $5.5 billion, which we will recognise through a combination of earnings from Canada and a remaining gain on sale at completion. Upon completion of the transaction, it remains our intention to consider a special dividend of 21 cents per share as a priority use of the proceeds and as previously announced. So, in summary, this was another strong quarter. We delivered a good profit performance and an annualised return on tangible equity of 17.1%, excluding strategic transactions, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy. Transaction Banking and Wealth both performed well, and continued investment will help accelerate the growth of our Wealth business. We continue to expect a 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending. We remain committed to tight cost discipline, and we have a strong capital position and have increased return to shareholders by way of dividends and share buybacks. And with that, can we please open it up for questions?",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Aman Rakkar,Barclays,"Two questions, please. Firstly, on costs, can I just probe you a little bit more on exactly what’s changed around costs? Because I think as recently as mid- September HSBC were reiterating their expectations for costs very much in line with the existing guide and the commitment to the cost base. So particularly around the point around compensating staff - or potentially compensating staff - for performance - I understand that it’s been a strong year for profits, but it doesn’t look like the view of profitability changed materially since you last spoke to us. So that component there would be interesting, and the related point then is to what extent should we expect that element of cost growth to roll over into next year? At its heart, I’m trying to get a sense of what the underlying cost growth is that you’re currently seeing through the business. And then the second question was around margins. I was wondering if you could just help us a bit on your experience on deposit beta and term deposit mix, particularly in Hong Kong but also a comment on the UK would be helpful and, as part of that, what your expectations are for NIM in both of those markets, please?",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"So, first, on costs, I think with regards to this 1% cost we contemplate for Q4, look, we have to put this in the perspective of the financial performance. Obviously, at the start of the year, we weren’t necessarily realising the performance of the group. We obviously need to wait for Q4 both to assess the financial performance but equally to assess how we continue to deliver on our strategy. It ultimately will be a matter for the Board and the Remuneration Committee to decide, but we felt it appropriate and fair to recognise that our colleagues have contributed, participated for the last many years through the whole strategic reshaping of the firm, through ensuring we have a great deposit franchise and a strong balance sheet and obviously delivering the growth we’ve seen in Wealth and Transaction Banking, that we can channel 1% or the equivalent $300 million towards performance-related pay. Again, all this is at the stage of contemplation and naturally we will reaffirm at the year end, and, again, subject to our Remuneration Committee’s opinion. In terms of next year, now we’re not giving guidance, but I think we are reflecting in this performance-related pay a year-on-year material change in our performance, as you’ve seen from our returns and our PBT, obviously with that quantum probably not expected for next year. In terms of margins, Aman, as we indicated, at these levels of rates, mostly in the UK and certainly in a number of western markets and for our wholesale businesses – at these levels of rates, we were expecting to have materially higher betas than 50%. We’ve expected that additional rate hikes from here would be mostly for the benefit for our customers. If you look at the overall betas in the UK, overall beta is just north of 50%. So while the marginal betas have exceeded 50%, the overall number is in the range of 50%. Term deposit mix – Hong Kong kind of same trend as we’ve seen through the nine months coming to this quarter, about 1% migration per month. So we have seen 4% over the quarter after 2% previous quarter and 3% in quarter one. That took the total term deposit mix to 31% in Hong Kong. We have not seen a deterioration of the trend. So we expect the trend to remain the same as we look into potential headwinds in the future, but equally we continue to see some of the tailwinds we were calling out before to continue. Just to put in perspective, the UK term deposit mix is just single-digit percentage points, so it’s a modest increase in Q3, but it’s not the main contributor to the dynamic of our NII.",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"If I could just add a couple of comments on the variable pay, there are two factors that are really coming to play in Q3. At the half year, when we talked about our cost position, we had an eye to variable pay, and we had a very strong first six months of the year. There was a lot of economic uncertainty around at that time – inflation, interest rates, ECLs, mainland China commercial real estate – so we didn’t want to anticipate exactly what the financial performance would be in the final six months of the year. We were confident of mid-teen returns, but we needed to make sure that the final six months traded well. I think as we’ve gone through Q3 we’ve continued to trade well. So I think our expectations now on a full-year outturn are probably higher than they would have been when we started this year and started to build the financial plan for this year. So, in the context of things, we’ve given an indication that given the strong profit performance, and if it continues into Q4, it would be right to share some of that upside in profit compared to original expectations with our colleagues, in the way that we intend to share the upside in expectations with our shareholders on both dividends and buybacks. A 1% $300 million top up to variable pay for a level of performance that could well outturn this year is a reasonable amount of additional variable pay to put in, and I will remind you that variable pay is not a continuum and a baseline. It is assessed each year on the profit of the bank against targets and can go up and can go down. But that’s a final determination we’ll make at the end of the year, and we’re just trying to be fair to our colleagues on what they’ve done. Trading performance has become less uncertain as we’ve got into Q3 – and you’ve seen the numbers – and we hope will continue in Q4 in a strong manner and, if that’s the case, we feel we should reward our colleagues for a very strong performance this year, but that’s the background to it. Both myself and George remain absolutely committed to strong cost discipline.",False,0.0,0

Then the other aspect would be on the trading book funding costs. You have guided to greater than $7 billion for the full year, and on my numbers, you’re already at $6.2 billion, so that implies a material step down in that cost, unless we should be emphasising on the ‘in excess of’ $7 billion element there.

Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Purely for the funding costs of the trading book, you should expect that the trading balances will remain broadly stable at around $130 billion for the quarter. Then the maths are simple. It’s just that, times the short rate levels, essentially, in USD. As you look at the overall Banking NII, I think the indication is that we’ve grown $0.1 billion Q2 to Q3. We haven’t given indication for Q4. Again, we feel comfortable with where the consensus is for Q4, and just to reiterate that Banking NII is probably a better measure, because it gets you immunised for some of these choices we make in how much we fund the trading book with. With regards your first question about tech and ops, it’s a mix of necessary and discretionary. We made the decision on the basis that, first, when we put our cost base at the start of the year, we had a materially higher inflation in some areas, in some geographies and in some pockets than we anticipated for the year, and we felt that it would be adverse for certain customer outcomes if we needed to take more restrictive action on it, and this is putting it in the context that our nine-month year-to-date reported cost is down 2% year on year, so this is why we were willing to tolerate the continued investment in tech and ops. I just want to reaffirm what Noel said. We are absolutely committed to our cost discipline, and we will be giving you visibility about how we are spending our money now and in the future.

The payback period – you said longer than five years. It feels like a downside risk hedge that’s being put in place. If you could just talk about how much you might get the sensitivity down, once all is said and done, and just confirm that it really pays you if rates fall rather than supports revenues in the near term. Then secondly, we’ve had a busy week of mainland Chinese bank reporting. All of the majors have missed our own forecasts, and one of your peers wrote down their mainland China stake with their third-quarter results. Could you update us please on where value-in-use is versus book value on BoCom, and how that process runs towards year-end?",True,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"So first on the treasury losses, a few things to share here. The first is we see this as one of the multiple tools we have to manage our structural hedge, and to manage the risk in our balance sheet. Second, importantly, the losses themselves have been taken already into CET1, mostly last year, so these are already factored in our CET1, and this is why, effectively, they have a mild CET1 ratio benefit where we sit today. Then third, as you indicated, Jason, we are looking to retrieve these losses in the NII line, essentially over the next five years, so this is a reinvestment into either longer dated or higher yielding instruments by faster disposing of lower yielding instruments to allow us to move faster in our structural hedging of the balance sheet. If you wanted some sense of maths, you could argue if we have taken $600 million losses, it is about $100 million additional NII every year for the next six years or so, which gives you a sense of how we are looking at it, and it’s indeed as part of our structural hedging, which means part of how we are protecting the balance sheet, mitigating risks of a rate downfall in the future. On your second question about mainland China, first I can comment on BoCom’s Q2 performance because, as you know, in our numbers we have one quarter delay, so the exercise relates to Q2. Our value-in-use as of Q3 has room of about $0.4 billion compared to our carrying value. Impairment is not a management discretionary decision. There is a rigorous accounting process and we will just follow the process and, based on their Q3 results, we will evaluate those as we go into Q4, and that will be part of our end-of-year assessment. I think the important thing I want to share about BoCom is because it sits in significant investments and because we hold regulatory capital deductions against it, as you can see from the slide on capital, $16 billion capital deduction – it effectively means that any impairment on our holding of BoCom, should it happen, will have virtually nil CET1 ratio impact, and that’s because any impairment will be compensated like for like by a release of the deductions of a similar amount. So therefore, no implication on CET1. It will have an implication on accounting reported profits, but we’ll treat it as a material notable item and it will have no implications, either on the way we calculate our dividend or our dividend payout ratio, so this is why, at this stage, this is not a concern. We’ll just follow the accounting rules as we do the VIU assessment.",False,2.0,0

There is no impairment due at Q3, and we’ll reassess it at Q4, but based on the Q3 results that BoCom issued a couple of days ago, those results, at a headline level first side, did not cause us any concern on our impairment test at Q3, but we’ll reassess that at Q4.",False,2.0,0

We said $11 billion year to date, essentially in Hong Kong and the UK. That continued even this quarter, despite softness in the housing market, but we remain competitive and we continue to support this business for our customers, so that is definitely there. We are also seeing some loan growth in the unsecured space in our retail business. It will be smaller proportions. In terms of commercial, the reality is the main softness in loan growth in commercial is in Hong Kong, and this is what’s driving the commercial overall number. The softness in Hong Kong has two parameters. One, the rate differential with mainland China, and as long as we have such a rate differential, it is expected to have mainland Chinese borrowers continue borrowing onshore mainland China rather than borrowing offshore, and that probably will not reverse in the next couple of years. But also, two is some of the softness we’ve seen in the economic conditions in Hong Kong, which we start to see reversing, and we have been encouraged by the policy measures that have been taken by way of supporting the economy and, as those materialise, we will start seeing some pickup in this segment. Now, outside these softness areas, we do still have strong loan growth potential in growing areas in our geographies, such as Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East. We even had growth in some of the Western economies, so that is happening. Quite importantly, also, I want to call out growth in trade. I called it out in the earlier speech, but trade is bucking the trend for the first quarter, where we’ve seen 3% growth in our loan book after several quarters of decline, and that’s encouraging. We’ll obviously need to see how it evolves, but that’s definitely encouraging, and if you look at it, most of that growth is in Asia, which means it’s bucking the trend in Asia, and that’s certainly on the backdrop of now the trade between China and ASEAN has exceeded trade between China and Europe or China and the US, and that obviously will benefit, given our footprint in China and ASEAN. On the special dividend, at this stage we’re aiming for completion of Canada sometime in Q1. We will then have to go through due governance and due approvals before we do it.

You’ve talked about increased hedging for the last couple of quarters and you have this quarter, as you’ve discussed previously, taken some losses through the held-for-sale portfolio to improve that now and next year, but we lack an overall understanding of what you’ve got in terms of the hedge, and so my question specifically is: how big is your hedge and what’s the duration of your hedge, so that we can do some modelling to understand how much protection you’ve got into 2024 and beyond?

We are intending to have much more disclosure around our structural hedge at the full year. We’re planning to give you additional disclosures from the one we already gave today, which is the usual NII table with multiple rate shifts over the five years. That includes duration; that includes yields on the structural hedge, etc, which hopefully can allow you to model all of this. We’re not ready to do it at Q3. It will be more appropriate to do it at the full year. I think what you should take into account is some of the information we shared at the half year, which is the hedge itself has allowed us to reduce our NII sensitivity at the back end of last year from $6 billion for 100 basis points down to now $2.6 billion, over which you should add the funding of the trading book sensitivity of $1.3 billion. So that’s giving you an idea of how much the overall hedge, among other contributors, have supported the reduction of our NII volatility and our NII sensitivity to the downward pressure on rates, and I think you should definitely assume that it remains our intention, at this phase of the cycle in rates, to continue doing hedges as appropriate across all our balance sheets where we can find them. So more on that at the full year.",False,4.0,0

I guess the first one is just around slide 17, looking at the split of NIM across your main subsidiaries. I’m just trying to understand the underlying NIM trajectory for the bank in the absence of any rate changes from here on. If you look at the UK bank – the ringfenced bank – obviously, that margin has been under pressure this quarter, and a number of peers are obviously flagging the lag effect on deposit costs as well as the migration is going to have an impact in Q4. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of colour on what you think is the outlook for your business in terms of margin in the UK. Then just linking it back to the group margin, which is, as you say, broadly stable but starting to come under a little bit of pressure, the HIBOR-LIBOR gap is obviously very narrow. Seasonally, I guess HIBOR tends to go up in Q4, but when we take a step back and think about the overall margin trajectory, would you say that, in the absence of rate changes, the margin is stable, or do you think there is a little bit more pressure creeping in because of what is going on in the UK?",True,5.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Let me unpack. There are quite a number of considerations here. The first one is I, as always, will encourage you to look at Banking NII, because that will – first, it’s a better reflection of our rate-sensitive earnings, and second, it will immunise you from some of the business choices we make by putting more funding to support the trading activities or not, and that can create noise in NII versus funding of the trading book, which is unrelated when you look at it from a Banking NII perspective. Now talking a little bit on Q3, before I talk about the outlook, on the Q3 numbers, if you look at Banking NII in Hong Kong, it was up 10%. Now, this is not reflected in NIM. NIM is up two basis points, but essentially, because a lot of that upside went into the funding of the trading book, but the full rate-sensitive earnings in Asia, in our Asian entity, has grown 10% by about $0.3 billion. So that’s the first thing to observe. If you look at HIBOR rates Q2 to Q3, obviously they were up 75 basis points. When we look at Q4 to date, there is another something like 50 basis points baked in the average, so there is additional tailwind into Q4 from HIBOR, which we’ll obviously need to see how the next two months fare before we evaluate. If you look at the UK, the UK NIM was up 16 basis points Q1 to Q2, down eight basis points Q2 to Q3. The first thing I want to say is this is definitely not the trend here to be read. I think NIM is broadly stable from here for the next few quarters. Some of these moves are idiosyncrasies in our Markets Treasury management, not necessarily drivers of trends, so we are looking at it, in the whole, as broadly stable. Obviously, it continued facing pressure on deposit costs, but as I just said earlier, at these rates any additional rate hikes are expected to be passed through to customers, and this is what’s been happening, so we’ve benefited from a 75 basis point rate hike in pounds between Q2 and Q3, most of which has gone either to customers in the form of passthroughs, some term deposit migration, in the UK minimal, but some, and then obviously asset margin compression in the UK. As you look forward, how can I invite you to evaluate forward first? I’m not giving guidance for 2024. The only guidance we are doing in 2024 is the mid-teens RoTE. We will be giving more details at the year end, but if you want some indicators of how to think about it, first think about it as we will continue facing the usual headwinds of margin compression, but that probably is easing now, having seen most of that compression in Q2 and Q3. We will continue to see pressure on deposits. Migration may continue. We’ve seen a pace of 1% per month in Hong Kong, steady for the last nine months. That is likely to continue, so these will be the main headwinds. The tailwinds would be the additional rate upside in Hong Kong from HIBOR – probably no further rate upside in the major other currencies. The tailwinds will be reinvestments of maturing structural hedges that have been put at lower rates and, as they mature, we reinvest them in higher rates and that will give us additional tailwinds. Then the main tailwind, which we anticipate at some stage in 2024, but not yet – at least not for the next couple of quarters, but at some stage in 2024 – is volume growth. When we start seeing volume growth, we will see the support for the NII in the medium term. As we have always indicated, mid-single-digit percentage point growth for balance sheet is our medium-term aspiration, and as and when this starts, after the next couple of quarters of transition, this will give us the additional tailwinds. I suppose that’s probably as much as we can say at this stage.",False,5.0,0

They tend to use it as a pure smoothing mechanism, to let the lower rates run off and then reinvesting, but you seem to have brought forward that. So the question is: does that suggest that you’re not just using the hedge as a smoothing mechanism, but it’s to more actively trade it? Is that fair? That’s the first question. The second question is really for Noel. I saw on Bloomberg that you made a comment that you feel like the China CRE situation has bottomed out. Acknowledging that the Chinese government has taken steps to support the sector, but the news flow still seems to be pretty negative. To the extent that there have been actions taken, they are probably not as large as maybe some of the market would have expected or hoped for a few months ago, so it’s probably around tailoring deposit requirements in some of the tier one cities. What gives you the confidence that we have bottomed out?",True,6.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"I’ll take the first question and I’ll invite Noel to comment on your second one. The hedge strategy – first, we have a number of tools at our disposal. We will use them as effectively and as opportunistically as we can to achieve what we want to achieve, which is 1) reducing the downside sensitivity of our balance sheet to a reduction in rates, and 2) extending that reduction of downside as far out in time as possible. This strategy that we’ve used, which is disposing of existing low-earning positions, is one of these measures. So number one, to remind you, it does not have a CET1 impact. At least the loss does not have a CET1 impact, because the loss has been taken capital mostly in 2022 already, so that gives us this flexibility on our capital. The second one is, yes, part of the hedge considerations is indeed allowing us to extend higher yields for longer rather than retain some of the lower yielding assets for longer than we wish for and give us additional protection, and the third is it’s also risk management considerations. We also look at how we use our RWAs and treasury portfolio and how we can optimise the utilisation thereof, and how we use combination of bonds and swap hedges and fair value accounting relationships, etc. So there are all sorts of number of other considerations which we look at, but the outcome of which, for the purposes of our bottom line, is indeed giving us this runway. Now I need to point out we have done an exercise in Q3. We indicate that we intend to do another exercise to the tune of about $0.4 billion in Q4, but we do not look at this as a recurring activity. This is by exception, occasional, when risk management and performance justify it, we will do it. This is not meant to be a recurrent, quarter-on-quarter activity. I just want to be clear about that. We’ve done it last quarter; we’ll do it next quarter. Anything beyond that we will give you indication, but it’ll be on a case by case and occasional basis.",False,6.0,0

It has really impacted very heavily the real estate market. Do I think that big negative correction in the market has been delivered and do I expect further negative correction? No. I think what we’re now into is the workout phase of that policy correction. Equally, I think I said this morning I don’t see a big swing back into positive policy territory for commercial real estate. I see it as fine-tuning from this low base. So what I’m talking about is the market as a whole – the commercial real estate market in China – a massive correction down. I think we’re at the bottom of that correction phase and we’re now in a gradual reclimb back out, with possible policy tweaks taking place, but as you quite rightly say, they’re not going to be big swings back up in policy correction. They’re going to be smaller policy corrections taking place, as we’ve seen in recent weeks. Now what does that mean for ECLs for banks, both domestically and internationally? Those ECLs have and could still emerge over time, but I think the market itself has bottomed, and now we’re in a period of readjustment for the new norm, and I don’t see a big readjustment back up. From our point of view on ECLs, I think we feel, as Georges has said, we’ve got good coverage ratios on the unsecured book – the 50% of our offshore book that is SOE-related or POE-related. We do not see that same policy correction affecting the SOEs the way it’s affected the POEs, so we don’t see necessarily a downside on that at this stage, and on those POEs in that 50% I talked about, those POEs are largely either secured or they’re not in the residential sector. They’re in CRE and other forms of the sector. So from our point of view, we feel well-provisioned at this stage. It’s not to say that there aren’t potential problems on the horizon from an ECL point of view for the industry, but we feel as though we’re well-positioned. I suppose my comment was on the market as a whole, in that there’s been such a massive correction. I think we’re now in a gradual rebuild, but that gradual rebuild will take time and there will be the potential for the industry to bear some further losses, and we are keeping a close eye on that and what it means for us, but we think we’re well- provisioned at the Q3 level. We’re probably going to take some more of our plausible downside scenario in Q4, but as Georges said earlier, we think that we’ve got the capacity within our overall guidance on ECL of 40 basis points to absorb any further charges we may or may not take in Q4.",False,6.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"On your first point, this is a matter of phasing it in time so that we’re doing it thoughtfully, carefully, we’re evaluating the impact every time we do an activity, so we didn’t put a cut-off, per se, for Q3 and Q4. As you can see, the numbers don’t follow a given symmetry. It’s just a matter of where we are on the journey when we cut off the books on 30 September, but we carry this activity throughout, and we look for the right market opportunities to do it. I think this is the way we look at it. With regards to your second point, a couple of things I can share here. The first one is the rate sensitivity of China. So, just to give you an indication, the impact of the China NIM on our HBAP, or our Asia NIM, is about three basis points, so the fact that we have some rate compression in China, simply because of the policy rates compression – this has affected our overall Asia NIM by a couple of basis points. That’s the quantum or the magnitude given, obviously, the size and scale we have in Hong Kong versus the size and scale we have in mainland China and other geographies. The second one to call out is that the rate differential – we expect it to remain for a matter of many quarters, probably a couple of years, which does mean that mainland Chinese customers borrowing offshore in Hong Kong will probably remain subdued for the next couple of years because it’s much cheaper for them to borrow at lower rates in RMB, and this headwind is likely to continue for the next couple of years. Now, on the flipside, again because of the rate differential, the growth in wealth that we observe in Hong Kong is obviously a positive and a beneficiary of the rate differential, so the fact that we’re seeing more wealth build-up in Hong Kong, the fact that we’re seeing more demand for our insurance products and capabilities in Hong Kong, also reflects the fact that, for mainland Chinese, for some of them and subject to the quotas they’re allowed to do, etc, it is interesting. It’s an attractive proposition to invest offshore because they’re getting great pickup. So we’re seeing the benefits of that when we talk about our insurance business in Hong Kong and our new business CSM, while we’re seeing the challenge on the other side. Look, all this, at the end, to say is we remain very optimistic in the medium to long term on both Hong Kong and mainland China, and we just need to see some of the short-term difficulties play out specifically in mainland China, specifically in the real estate sector, until we recover and are able to see some of the momentum back on positive growth there.",False,7.0,0

In the past, you’ve talked about being comfortable with consensus, which is obviously above that, $36.5 billion, so if I could just push you as to whether you are still comfortable with the consensus. And then, second question – buybacks and how you’re thinking about those. Obviously, a step change today going from $2 billion to $3 billion for the next quarter. Pro forma, for the buybacks and for France retail, you’re looking at a 14.2% CET1 ratio, still within your target range. You’ve said 2024 RoTE similar to 2023, payout ratio for the dividend similar to 2023, so the only delta seems to be loan growth, where you’re still talking cautious short term but aiming for mid-single digits in medium term. So, when we’re thinking about the buyback going forward, is it a trade-off with that loan growth? Is it a case of, if the loan growth goes to mid-single digits, you go back to $2 billion, whereas if it stays low single digit, you stay at $3 billion? Conceptually, how are you thinking about the buyback?",False,7.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\231030-3q-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,3,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"On your first question, NII guidance, I can reaffirm we’re still comfortable with the 2023 consensus. As you look into 2024, we haven’t given guidance yet, apart from the mid-teens RoTE, but I’d like to just point out two things just to keep in mind. The first one is, again, Banking NII would be a better guide of how our earnings will behave with rates, so look at NII in combination with the funding costs of the trading book and immunise, therefore, your analysis from how much we end up channelling or not in terms of funding to the trading book activities. And then, the second one, just to keep in mind, is the disposal of Canada and France, which will both contribute to an annualised $1.5 billion of NII, which will obviously not be there when the sale is complete. And finally, balance sheet growth at some stage in 2024, where we start resuming the expectation for our balance sheet to grow. That in the broad sense, is how we should look at for 2024. Again, we’re not guiding, but we’re giving you some tools that you can do your analysis. In terms of buyback, a couple of things: first, the reason we announced a $3 billion buyback – certainly because we have the capital to support it, but equally, because we have an extended period to do it. We mentioned that this is an intent to do it up to February results. That gives us four months. So I’ll definitely encourage you not to look at $3 billion as the new $2 billion; it is not. It is a reflection of the fact that we’re aiming for – well, we have a longer period ahead of us, four months instead of three, and we’re aiming to see if we can get up to $3 billion during that period. It’s therefore a specific consequence of this length of the period that is ahead of us for that buyback. Look, I continue saying it remains our intention to perform a rolling series of share buybacks, as long as the capital supports it. We look at our forecast, and our capital build up does seem to be reasonably realistic in our forecast, and therefore, it remains our intention to do the series of buybacks. About the question of trade-off between buybacks and loan growth, a couple of things: first, as you know, the proceeds of the sale of Canada will give us a buyback runway regardless of loan growth because the proceeds less the priority use for special dividend will still allow for a few billion dollars of additional buyback, and irrespective of our loans, so that will give us runway for loan growth. Second, I just need to also highlight, when we talk about mid-single-digit loan growth, we’re not saying mid-single-digit RWA growth. Some of our loans, specifically in the mortgage space, which is a big component for our loan growth, have lower RWA density, and therefore benefit from lower RWAs, and therefore, our RWA growth is expected to trail loan growth, absent credit reviews. And therefore, we don’t see that there is a competition between loan growth and buybacks. I think this is a fine balance between the two and an appropriate trade-off between the two. I’ll move straight to the closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your questions. I want to end by reiterating that we’ve had a good nine months. All of our businesses have been performing well. We have delivered an annualised return on tangible equity of 17.1% when you exclude strategic transactions and really remain committed to tight cost discipline. We’re investing in growth while we’re also supporting dividends and buybacks, and I will be looking forward to speaking with you all again soon. So have a good morning or afternoon, everyone.

Good morning to those watching in London and around the world. Before Georges takes you through the Q4 numbers, I’ll make some opening comments. First, I’m really pleased with the performance that the team delivered in 2023. We reported $30 billion of PBT for the first time ever, and we delivered a return on tangible equity of 14.6%, or 15.6% excluding material notable items. Second, there were some items in the fourth quarter which make it harder to understand the underlying performance. Georges will take you through them in detail, but I want to stress, there was still good underlying growth in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation, our profit before tax was $7.3 billion. Third, we distributed $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of 2023. This included a full-year dividend of $0.61 per share, which is the highest since 2008, and $7 billion of share buybacks, which have reduced the share count by over 4% at completion of the current buyback. Fourth, we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. We’ve announced a further share buyback of up to $2 billion. We’re committed to considering a special dividend of $0.21 per share as a priority use of the Canada proceeds, subject to the completion of the transaction. And we finished the year with a strong CET1 ratio of 14.8%, which will be further boosted by the Canada deal. Fifth, we remain committed to cost discipline. We have flow-through impact of 2023 inflation on our costs this year, but expect a downward trend in inflationary pressures in 2025 and beyond. We continue to invest in growth opportunities and the digitisation of our business to drive incremental efficiencies. We remain very focused on funding much of that investment through cost-saving initiatives. Finally, we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue, even in a lower rate environment. Georges will take you through how we’re reducing our sensitivity to rate movements. And we do acknowledge the downside risks to NII, but we’re confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver mid-teen returns in 2024. I’ll take you through some of these levers later. But let me now hand over to Georges.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Noel. Warm welcome to everyone here in Hong Kong. For those of you watching in London, good morning and thank you for joining our full-year 2023 results call. We delivered a good underlying business performance in the fourth quarter. Let me first start by clarifying that our reported profit before tax was impacted by $5.8 billion of notable items, and a further $0.5 billion from Argentina hyperinflation, including the more than 50% devaluation of the peso in December. Let me unpack three of those notable items. First, we reinstated the impairment on the sale of our France retail business as signalled at the third quarter. Second, we booked $0.4 billion of treasury disposal losses in the quarter, again in line with the guidance at the third quarter, to extend the duration of hedges in anticipation of rate decreases. And finally, as you know, each quarter, we conduct a value-in-use test on the carrying value of our investment in BoCom, described in detail in our Annual Report and Accounts. Following the outcomes of that test in Q4, we took a charge of $3 billion in the quarter against our carrying value. The charge had an insignificant impact on CET1 capital and our CET1 ratio, and no impact on our dividends or share buyback. And just to be clear, this has no impact on our strategy in mainland China, it has no impact on our strategic relationship with BoCom, and it has no impact on HSBC’s or BoCom’s operations, strategy or outlook. So on a reported basis, our profit before tax was $1 billion in the fourth quarter, down $4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the $6.3 billion impact of notable items in Argentina hyperinflation, our profit before tax was $7.3 billion, up $0.7 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to growth in banking NII. On the next slide, so on a reported basis, fourth quarter revenue was down $1.6 billion compared to the same period last year, due to the impact of notable items in Argentina hyperinflation. Excluding these, our revenue was up $1.5 billion, primarily banking NII. The strength of our deposit franchise, our access to two deep pools of liquidity in the UK and Hong Kong, and our enviable balance sheet made it possible for us to benefit from the more favourable rate environment. On the next slide, fourth quarter NII and banking NII were again impacted by Argentina hyperinflation and a re-classification of cashflow hedge revenue between NII and non-NII. Excluding these, both NII and banking NII were broadly stable on the third quarter, and NIM was down three basis points, primarily due to higher time deposit costs and deposit migration in Hong Kong. Turning to the outlook, taking our fourth quarter banking NII and adjusting for Argentina hyperinflation and the re-classification of cashflow hedge revenue, and the disposal of our France retail and Canada businesses, gives you an annualised run rate of just above $43 billion. That should be your starting point for modelling our 2024 banking NII. We expect four key variables to drive our banking NII from that starting point in 2024: changes in interest rates, the re-investment of maturing structural hedge assets at higher yield, deposit migration, particularly here in Hong Kong, and balance sheet movements. There is a degree of uncertainty inherent in all of these. We’re guiding towards a banking NII of at least $41 billion in 2024. This is our current estimate of the bottom end of the range of reasonable outcomes, and is intended to help you with your modelling. We will continue updating further as the year unfolds. And before turning to non-NII, I’d like to direct your attention to the chart on the bottom right of this slide. Over the last 18 months, our banking NII sensitivity has reduced by around $3.5 billion. More than one third of this reduction is due to increased structural interest rate hedging. Subject to market conditions, we expect to increase both the notional and the duration of our structural hedge in the coming quarters, in order to reduce our banking NII sensitivity still further. Non-NII was down $0.9 billion compared to the same quarter last year due to notable items and Argentina hyperinflation. And again, excluding these, non-NII was up $1.7 billion versus the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to the revenue offset into non-NII from the central cost of funding Global Banking and Markets trading activity, which is included in banking NII, and from the cashflow hedge income re-classification between NII and non-NII I referred to previously. Other non-NII was up modestly versus the same quarter last year, including an increase of $0.1 billion in net fee income, primarily in Commercial Banking and Wealth and Personal Banking. Looking at non-NII from our two strategic activities of Wholesale Transaction Banking and Wealth, in Wholesale Transaction Banking non-NII was up 2% on the fourth quarter of 2022. There was good growth in Global Payments Solutions, in Trade and in Foreign Exchange, reflecting the strength of our international network and transaction banking capabilities, as well as increased client activity and re-pricing initiatives. This was partly offset by a relatively small decrease in Securities Services. In Wealth, non-NII in both Asset Management and Private Banking grew by double digits versus the fourth quarter of last year due to an increase in assets under management, partly driven by net new invested assets. However, total Wealth non-NII was down $0.1 billion as a result of a $0.2 billion correction to historical valuation estimates in our insurance business. For the full year, non-NII in Wholesale Transaction Banking was $10.6 billion, up 5% on 2022, and $6 billion in Wealth, up 7%. Turning now to credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1 billion primarily in Wholesale. This brought our full year ECL charge to $3.4 billion, which was 33 basis points of average customer loans, including those held for sale, or 36 basis points excluding those, and within our full year 2023 guidance. Due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we’re guiding towards ECLs of around 40 basis points for 2024. We took an ECL charge of $0.2 billion for mainland China commercial real estate in the fourth quarter as part of the $1 billion charge for the quarter referenced in the last slide. This brought the full-year charge on this portfolio to $1 billion, crystallising the plausible downside scenario that we set out last February. Our main area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. That exposure is now $6.3 billion, down $1.2 billion in the quarter, and down $3.1 billion compared to full year 2022. We continue to monitor the sector closely, and we are comfortable with our current level of provisions. Turning to costs, full year 2023 costs on a constant currency basis were down 1%. On a target basis, full year 2023 costs came in 1% higher than our Q3 guidance, driven by three items that unexpectedly landed in the fourth quarter. First, the FDIC special assessment, which was expected to be incurred over 2024 and 2025. Second, the UK bank levy was higher than forecast, primarily due to adjustments relating to prior years. And third, there was an offsetting benefit from Argentina hyperinflation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we are aiming to limit cost growth to around 5% in 2024 on a target basis, which excludes the reduction in 2024 costs from the France retail and Canada disposals. This will be driven by the flow through impact of 2023 inflation to 2024 costs, investment and volume growth, partly offset by cost-saving initiatives. On the next slide, customer lending and deposits were broadly stable versus the third quarter once you exclude the sale of our France retail business. Without that, there was $35 billion of deposit growth, of which $27 billion was in Asia, with around half of this in Hong Kong. Deposit growth in Asia benefited from seasonality, and we would expect at least some of that growth to reverse in the course of Q1. Turning now to capital. Our CET1 ratio at the end of 2023 was 14.8%, which was down 0.1 percentage points on the third quarter. There are three things I’d like to draw your attention to. First, as I said earlier, the BoCom charge had an insignificant impact on CET1 capital and our CET1 ratio due to the compensating reduction in regulatory capital threshold deductions, and it had no impact on dividends or share buybacks. Second, we expect the share buyback announced today to have an impact of around 25 basis points on our CET1 ratio in the first quarter of 2024. And finally, we expect the Canada sale to generate around 1.2 percentage points of CET1 in the first quarter of 2024. We remain committed to consider $0.21 per share special dividend in the first half of 2024 as a priority use of the sale proceeds, which equates to around 0.5 percentage points of CET1. Before I hand back to Noel, I am pleased to share some enhancements that we have made with regard to our international disclosures. There are two sets of data, and Noel will also comment further on them. Starting with our wholesale business, let me walk you through the data on this slide. In 2023, we generated $33.5 billion of client revenue across Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets. Of this, $20.4 billion was generated from multi- jurisdictional clients. By this, we mean clients that bank with us in more than one market. The charts on the right show that two thirds of the client revenue we generate from those clients comes from providing them with services in markets outside their home market, where they also bank with us. It is also worth pointing out that two thirds of multi-jurisdictional client revenue, or $13.4 billion, was generated from clients whose home market is in the West, with the remaining $7 billion from clients whose home market is in the East. Turning now to WPB international revenue, more than $10 billion, or 40% of our WPB revenue, comes from international customers, around two thirds of which is generated in Asia. So to summarise, both the wholesale and WPB client revenue data clearly demonstrates the strength of our international network and our unique capability to serve international clients. Our network and further investment into our international proposition position us to capture an even greater share of this vital, fast-growing segment. Let me now hand back to Noel.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Thank you, Georges. You’ve just heard about good underlying performance in the fourth quarter, and Georges has introduced more detailed information about our international revenue. Our wholesale international business model is a mature and differentiated business model with substantial scale. And in recent years we have started to develop and invest in our WPB international business model. What Georges’ slide showed is that already 40% of WPB revenue comes from international customers, and we believe we can take it much further. So let me now turn to how we will drive revenue growth, not just this year and next, but over the next three to four years. As always, I’ll begin with our purpose, ambition, strategy and values. These have helped to drive the good underlying business growth, which alongside supportive interest rates, have given us strong momentum. In the short term, we’re conscious of the potential downside risk to NII. The structural hedging we have put in place will help to protect that income. But we do have some clear focus areas under our four strategic pillars, which I will cover on the following slides. Starting with Focus, and our international Wholesale business, which remains our biggest competitive advantage and, because of its scale, our biggest growth opportunity. In the past, our businesses in the West were primarily focused on domestic clients. Over the last four years, we have re-positioned those businesses to align them with our international strategy, exiting low-return and low-growth domestic RWAs. The result is the differentiated model you see today. In Commercial Banking, we are unique in our ability to serve clients across multiple geographies, which is what HSBC was founded to do. The result was the $13.3 billion of profit before tax that Commercial Banking generated last year. In Global Banking and Markets, I believe we are uniquely positioned to connect clients between West and East, which was evident in our market leading performances in markets like the Middle East and businesses like Global Foreign Exchange. We have clearly got a strong international franchise. As you can see, we facilitated more than $850 billion of trade last year, with the diversification of supply chains leading to revenue growth opportunities for HSBC. We ranked second globally by revenue in our payments business, and processed around $500 trillion of electronic payments. And we’ve been number three globally by revenue in FX since 2021. But I believe there is a significant amount of untapped opportunity still to go for, which can drive revenue growth in the face of declining interest rates. Importantly, this potential revenue growth is not necessarily dependent on GDP, as that growth opportunity already exists within our client base, and it is often fee-based and strongly influenced by opportunities that are inherent to the international nature of our client base. To provide some evidence of this growth potential, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 29% in 2023, and the revenue multiplier for multi-jurisdictional corporate clients in Commercial Banking was five times that of an average domestic-only customer. I’m pleased that international isn’t just a wholesale story. We are doing more with our WPB customers as well. Building our Wealth business to meet the rising demand for wealth management services, especially here in Asia, has been a strategic priority in recent years. So I’m pleased that we attracted net new invested assets of $84 billion last year, compared to $80 billion in 2022 and $64 billion in 2021. This is a good indicator of future revenue opportunities, which again is often fee income and should benefit in a lower interest rate environment as investors shift from cash reserves into invested asset classes. Another trend is the growing demand for seamless cross-border banking services. Innovation is key here, and we hadn’t innovated enough in this space in the past, which meant we weren’t offering our customers what they wanted. But we are now. Global Money has more than 1.3 million customers, up from 550,000 a year ago. We also launched a new, strengthened International Banking proposition. Overall, we grew revenue from WPB international customers by 41% last year, from $7.2 billion to $10.2 billion. And while you might assume this was driven solely by higher rates, I’m pleased to say there was a 43% jump in new-to-bank international WPB customers last year. Again, these are higher revenue-generating customers, bringing in three times as much revenue as an average domestic-only customer. Next is the continued growth in our two home markets. Our leading propositions in Hong Kong and the UK provide us with deep liquidity and a differentiated proposition. These two pools of liquidity underpin our exceptionally strong balance sheet, which gives us the safety and security that our clients trust us to provide. Hong Kong and the UK are both highly connected global financial centres. We have increased our market-leading share of trade finance in Hong Kong by 6.6 percentage points over the last three years. This included a 2.4 percentage point increase last year alone. We are also ideally positioned to capitalise as the mass affluent population in Hong Kong and mainland China continues to grow, driven by rapid urbanisation across mainland China and the increased use of the Connect schemes between mainland China and Hong Kong. We grew new-to-bank retail customers in Hong Kong by 36% over the last three years, including by capitalising on the significant increase of visitors from mainland China post re-opening. In the UK, we also have good traction in Commercial Banking. In 2023, we were the number one bank for UK large corporates as well as the best bank in the UK for SMEs, according to Euromoney, and we are continuing to grow in Wealth and Personal Banking. We attracted over one million new-to-bank customers in the UK last year and we have had steady mortgage growth, increasing our market share of UK stock to 8%. As economic conditions improve and we continue to invest, we are confident in our ability to grow our business further in these critical areas. Next, I showed a slide like this last year to demonstrate how we have gone from a business that depended on our home markets for the vast majority of our profits while the rest of the franchise underperformed, to one with broad-based profitability across markets. This slide shows the increase in profitability of these diversified growth opportunities. The number one rankings speak for themselves, and I especially want to call out the great work that the Global Banking and Markets team are doing in the Middle East. They have now topped these rankings three years in a row in a region that presents significant growth opportunities going forward. India, mainland China excluding associates, and Singapore all contributed more than $1 billion of profits in 2023, with Singapore doing so for the first time. This underlines why HSBC was named best bank in Asia by Euromoney, but there was strong growth in all these markets. The next slide underlines that we have reshaped our portfolio to reinforce strengths while exiting areas of underperformance and/or lower strategic priority. Over the last 12 months, we have announced exits in a number of our smaller markets. This is one way that we expect to take out further costs, alongside our continued focus on improving the internal efficiency of the bank, and by making savings we can invest in the areas on the left that help us to drive growth. Before I move on, I want to mention SVB UK. Everyone knows that HSBC is an international bank, but we also have a long history of supporting innovative entrepreneurs, and the acquisition of SVB UK enabled us to build a bigger proposition that can help us to become known as the go-to bank for innovation companies. It is encouraging that Innovation Banking had its best ever quarter for customer onboarding in the fourth quarter of 2023. I’m also encouraged by how many of those innovative companies want to take their capabilities cross- border. The next slide sets out how we’re investing in technology to make customer experiences better, sale processes more efficient and our cost of execution lower. I am pleased to see more of our personal and corporate customers are mobile and digitally active. HSBC has traditionally grown by cross-selling products to our existing banking clients, but innovation also enables us to open up growth avenues that are beyond our traditional customer footprint. Zing is one such growth avenue, because it offers cross-border payment capabilities, but critically it is targeted at non- HSBC customers. Our embedded finance joint venture announces with Tradeshift last year is another such growth avenue. It’s still early days for both, but they will allow us to break outside of the existing business model. I will also briefly cover our final two pillars. There isn’t a conversation I have with a client where the net-zero transition doesn’t come up. Our first Net Zero Transition Plan shows how we intend to finance and support the transition to next zero and collaborate globally to help enable change at scale. It will be a complex journey, but we have exactly the right geographic footprint, where the need and opportunity are greatest. Finally, Energise. Over the last four years we’ve increased the pace of execution across the organisation. Our management team is confident about the business, but it’s even more important that our colleagues are confident, because when they are we stand a much greater chance of succeeding. So I’m pleased that our 2023 staff survey showed the number of colleagues seeing the positive impact of our strategy was up 11 percentage points from 2020 to 73%, and I’m also very excited by the number of quality new hires we’ve been able to bring into the organisation over the last 12 months. It’s also a vote of confidence in our strategy and the momentum we have built over the last four years. In summary, I will go back to what I said at the start. I’m really pleased with how we performed in 2023 and the contribution that our people made. We reported $30 billion of PBT for the first time and mid-teens RoTE. There was good underlying growth in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation, our profit before tax was $7.3 billion. We distributed $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of 2023. This included the best four-year dividend since 2008 and three share buy-backs, and we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. We remain committed to cost discipline, and we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue, even in a lower rates environment. We are confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver mid-teens returns in 2024.",False,-1.0,1

Two questions, if I may, please. The first one is on FY25 and beyond. We note that the RoTE guidance for this year, but if there can be any comments regarding the RoTE for ’25 and beyond, in particular if the banking NII sensitivity for the next hundred basis points of rate cuts can be guided to us. The second one is around the gain, the implied improvement in the capital from the gain in Canadian operations, and that remains at around $10 billion of which $4 billion can be special dividend. So the $6 billion, have you decided on how much between capital distribution to shareholders and then business growth? Thank you.",True,0.0,0

So we have not at this stage giving guidance for full year ’25. I point you to the guidance we’ve given for full year ’24 of at least $41 billion in banking NII and mid-teens return on tangible equity. In terms of banking NII sensitivity, we do have a slide at the back end of the deck which I can point you to, which shows for the further 100 basis points and for future years what’s the impact. What I can point you to is, number one, we continue to intend to increase, subject to market conditions but as of today, to increase the structural hedge, second the volume of the structural hedge. Second, we continue to intend to increase the weighted average life of the structural hedge, having now reached 2.8 years and with the intent to take it to about three years, both of which should give you a sense of how we’re mitigating rate impacts into ’24 an ’25 from the structural hedging activity. With regards gain on Canada, so $10 billion proceeds, $4 billion will be considered – well, we committed to consider as a priority use for a special dividend. The residual $6 billion will constitute about 0.8% or 0.9% additional CET1, which very likely will be at the Q1 outcome. We will continue looking at opportunities, but it remains our intent, subject to market conditions, our capital position, regulatory position, it remains our intent to continue a rolling series of share buy-backs beyond this one.",False,0.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Andrew Coombs,Citi,"Morning from London. Good afternoon, to yourselves. Two questions, please. Firstly, I just want to clarify the messaging on the banking NII outlook. If I rewind 12 months ago, I think you gave guidance for greater than $36 billion of reported NII, but then this time a year ago you said you weren’t seeking to move consensus, which at the time was actually higher. It was at $37 billion. If I fast forward to today, you’re guiding to greater than $41 billion. If I look at consensus to NII, I adjust the trading book funding costs, it looks like consensus banking NII is around $44 billion. So are you seeking to rebase consensus banking NII or should we put greater emphasis on your ‘greater than’ within that $41 billion target? So that’s my first question. I just want to clarify that messaging. My second question is around the hedge. Thank you for the extra disclosure on the $478 billion nominal and the 2.8 years average life. Can you give us an idea of both the average yield on that book and also what it’s currently rolling off at and what you’re aiming to roll it back on at, if you are extending the duration out? Thank you,",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Andrew. So obviously today we cannot see consensus banking NII and basically I’ll use this opportunity to ask you collectively if you can start giving us your banking NII, so we can see the NII forecasts and then the funding costs of the trading book gets lumped together with the non-NII and it’s, to be fair, difficult for us to unpack it, although $44 billion does sound high if we try to do the math ourselves. But let me take a step back and just walk you through how we’re thinking about NII and just bear with me for two minutes, but I think that explanation will probably help guide you. So we start from a Q4 $10.7 billion banking NII. We would adjust then Q4 for the parts related to Argentina hyperinflation, as well as the reclassification of the cash flow hedges between NII and non-NII. We’ll adjust for the part that does not pertain to Q4, so that’s full year correction, and that’s about an additional $0.5 billion you could use on the Q4 $10.7 billion number. So that takes you to $11.2 billion adjusted quarterly run rate. Annualise, take into account day counts, you get to $44.4 billion. From that $44.4 billion, remember you have to deduct the full year France retail NII, as well as three quarters from the Canada NII, which together combined come to about $1.3 billion. So $44.4 billion minus $1.3 billion takes you to just above $43 billion. That would be our starting position, if you want, in terms of an annualisation of a run-rate, before factoring in structural hedges, etc. Now, from that $43 billion, there are various tailwinds and headwinds. We have the tailwind of reinvestment of the structural hedges from lower rates into the current rate environment. We do have some tailwinds. Probably cautious on H1, but tailwinds beyond H1 in terms of volume growth and loan growth. And we do have headwinds including the rate cycle, if indeed we’re starting the decreases in the second half of the year, and we obviously have the headwinds which we have observed, specifically Hong Kong around deposit migration to term deposits. Taking all of that into account, we’re getting to the guidance of at least $41 billion that we’re comfortable sharing today. With regards to the structural hedge, we have shared with you volume, we have shared with you the weighted average life, and we have shared with you now banking NII sensitivity. We have not yet shared and we have not yet found the level of standard we would need to be able to share the yield, but what I can tell you about the yield is that both the yield of the maturing hedges being replaced at current rates, as well as the additional hedges we’re doing with inverted curves, are all baked into our at least $41 billion banking NII guidance.",False,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"If I could just add a couple of comments, one reason we’re not giving a statement regarding consensus is, as Georges says, we think consensus is a mixture of updated thinking that has adjusted for some of these annualisation effects of disposals and other things, and some consensus hasn’t adjusted for that at the moment. There’s a little bit of apples and pears in today’s consensus position. What Georges is clearly trying to articulate for you is: take the Q4, adjust it for the known items, get to a new starting position of $43 billion. He’s underpinned that starting position of $43 billion with an at least $41 billion, therefore the range of modelling has got to be somewhere between $41 billion and $43 billion, depending on the assumptions you might make on the headwinds and the tailwinds. We think, given that lack of consistency on consensus and the uncertainty in the market, that’s probably the best to guide you on banking NII. There’s a very clear repositioning of the starting position to get us back on an apples and apples basis. That’s what I wanted to say, those two comments.",False,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Katherine Lei,Jp Morgan,"I have two questions here. The first question is I want to clarify the mid-teen RoTE guidance is a normalised RoTE. That means that the RoTE excludes Canada disposal gain. I want to clarify that, because if that is the case in mid-teen RoTE then, if you look at the company compiled consensus the RoTE is 17.4%. I just calculated on a very top-down basis you’re excluding the disposal gain and consensus, RoTE is roughly around mid-teens as well. The thing is that I think that means the HSBC guidance and consensus is quite in line in terms of normalised RoTE, but on NII, on costs, in previous questions I think there may be a bit of reset in expectations. I think the 5% cost is a bit higher than where consensus was indicating. Does that mean that you are quite optimistic on non-NII growth, i.e. fee growth? Or maybe you have a different view on asset quality, and hence the ECL charges. This is the first part of the big question. The second part is on BoCom. May I know what triggered the $3 billion impairment charges? As China’s yield is declining – they just announced 25 basis point on five-year LPR cuts and all those – should we be expecting more impairments on the BoCom investment? Basically I want to see if there is any one-time event that triggered this impairment, or if it is going to be a normalised part of the business. I think in the statement you clearly stated that that would have no impact on dividend and shareholders’ return. I believe this is related to the $14 billion capital deduction which you have already made on Associates. I think that is primarily BoCom. Can you explain a bit of that mechanism? I think today’s share price reaction is partly factoring in the kind of concern that there is an ongoing impairment on BoCom that will affect the company’s ability to deliver shareholders’ return.",True,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Katherine, taking them in the order you said, first, the mid-teens RoTE is excluding notable items, therefore it is excluding the gain on Canada. Your calculation is correct. In terms of NII and cost, a couple of things to share. We recognise the cost assessment. In terms of banking NII, we have given the guidance here. I mentioned it in my earlier speech, but I will just point you that our banking NII sensitivity has reduced by more than half from the full-year 2022 due to, among other parameters, our structural hedging activity, so therefore the rate impact on our banking NII is reduced commensurately. Equally, we do have some anticipation of volume growth if and when rates start decreasing, which is now planned for H2, and this is why we have some positive outlook for H2. If rates decrease, volume could pick up, subject to economic conditions, etc, but that’s the assessment we have made today. Thirdly, on the non-rate-sensitive earnings, I’ve called out Transaction Banking and Wealth earlier. Between them they constitute about 80% of our non-rate-sensitive earnings. One has grown 5%, 2022 to 2023, and the other one has grown 7%, and therefore we do feel there is momentum in both these areas for continued growth. I didn’t talk about the residual 20%, but in the residual 20%, capital market activities, for instance, is included. Again, in a different rate environment we have grounds to believe this can also pick up. So yes, we are comfortable with the momentum we have in the revenue. Can I point you on one thing about costs? We called it out. 5% for 2024 has a flow-through impact from inflation in 2023. 2023 experienced high inflation. There’s some flow through, some adjustments, including wage inflation, which we anticipate to do in 2024. Based on current outlook of inflation that parameter is easing as we look forward beyond 2024. Without giving you any guidance for 2025, the inflationary component flow through into 2025 does look like easing from where we stand today, looking at 2024 outlook for inflation. If I move on to your second question about BoCom, this is a – we do talk about the value-in- use model. It’s following the Hong Kong accounting standards, international accounting standards. Without boring you with the accounting details, the AR&A has many pages, which we can point you to, that explain it. It feeds into parameters all essentially in the public domain, including macro data, other factors, including analysts’ comments. It feeds in through the model. The model is not highly intuitive, but the outcome is the outcome and we’ve been consistently applying it for umpteen quarters now, and therefore will apply for Q4. It is very difficult to predict what the model will give us in Q1. We will take into account the information we receive over the course of Q1, and we will run the model as we do every quarter and consistently apply the outcome. Finally, capital deduction. I think this is a very important point. Your math, Katherine, is correct. There is about $14 billion sitting today in our regulatory capital deductions, because they sit above our threshold. Therefore, you could legitimately assume that there is that much of buffer against any impairments we face in our financial holdings, BoCom being one of them. The other one is insurance. That’s the two, essentially, and therefore you can legitimately assume that the compensation we would get from any hypothetical future impairment will be commensurate, given the size of our threshold deductions at this stage.",False,2.0,0

If we work back from your clean mid-teens RoTE you’ve given us some guidance on cost, you’ve given us some guidance on credit. It’s getting into a baseline revenue number of about $64 billion. I think consensus is $63.5 billion or thereabouts. Are you comfortable with that consensus number? Are you seeking to change that with this guide? That is question number one. Question number two is why the focus on banking NII versus total NII? Because there’s going to be, as rates come down, a lot of moving parts on the trading book funding cost dynamic. Indeed, if I look at your annual report you’ve actually got a benefit coming through in the USD bucket from rates falling in terms of the aggregate NII. Why are you trying to distinguish between those two conceptually for us? Again, it’s creating a fair amount of confusion with investors.",True,3.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, so I recognise your arithmetic, Yes, I agree with your arithmetic. This being said, I cannot give you guidance on total revenue, otherwise I’ll be giving you guidance on our full profitability, but we recognise your arithmetic. A couple of things just to highlight for your consideration. The first one is our guidance for banking NII is not $41 billion, it’s at least $41 billion, factoring in elements of uncertainty that I called out earlier. That’s for full-year 2024. You do have the building blocks for cost and for ECL, and then the residual part, if you want, of our earnings story is the non-NII component excluding the gains from Canada. As I said earlier, about 80% of it is generated from Transaction Banking and Wealth, both of which do have momentum, both of which are areas where we continue investing, both in terms of digital capabilities and client servicing, and in terms of net new invested assets. We are excited about the potential of these two businesses, and we believe our mid-teens RoTE is not based on unreasonable growth in these areas, it’s based on momentum growth in these areas. Maybe I can point you to our net new invested assets, $84 billion for the year, up from $80 billion last year, up from $64 billion the year before. Clearly we’re acquiring new assets, but equally, as you’ve seen, Asset Management and Private Banking grew double-digit percentage points. That’s also partly due to the valuation. Our AUM is also increasing because the underlying valuation is improving, which is therefore a generator of fees commensurately, subject to market conditions as we go forward. Just on your second point, so we’re guiding we would like to move to banking NII guidance. We recognised last year we have moved from NII into a dual guidance of NII and funding costs of the trading book. We think it is much simpler to look at our overall rate-sensitive earnings through a banking NII lens. The shift from one to the other – which is a zero-sum game, so it moves from one to the other – is reflective of business decisions as regards how much of our funding we would want to give to the trading book based on various parameters, including opportunities in the trading book, as well as opportunities for loan growth. We think that it would be too noisy if we have to really manage both on a separate basis.",False,3.0,0

We expect growth to pick up in H2, but for 2024 as a whole can you just confirm you expect net growth in the balance sheet?

Number two, we also have less concerns going forwards on our residual exposure in that portfolio. I can point you to our exposure is now at $6.2 billion. That’s down $3.1 billion from full-year 2022, so therefore we have a reduced level of concern. I can walk you through, if needed, how our ECL positioning is in this portfolio, but we’re comfortable, and no additional concerns than we called out last year.

We have an inability to hedge in any reasonable size or shape – and this is due to structural market – our Hong Kong dollar exposure. Our Hong Kong dollar exposure hedge would remain much lower, and therefore our exposure in Hong Kong dollar would remain more sensitive to the rate outlook compared to the other currencies. In terms of Canada sale, you could expect in Q1, subject to completion – which is now planned to be on track to be by the end of Q1 – you would expect to see a jump of 1.2%, 1.3% in our CET1 ratio. The special dividend, which we’re committed to consider, would happen afterwards. Our best estimate is H1, but frankly, afterwards as soon as we can, subject to all necessary approvals.

What can you do with costs in a falling rate environment? Because you’ve talked about management actions; I guess the reason I’m asking is because this year I believe all-in it’s about 7% year-on-year, and of course it includes a lot of one-offs like levies in this quarter and SVB earlier in the year, but on the basis that it crept up from plus 2% year-on-year, which is I think the first slide you talked about, the 2023 guidance, to the end result being something like 6%, 7%. I’m just wondering what levers you have in your cost management action pocket to combat costs if revenue were to disappoint? That’s number one. The second question is I think we all talked a lot about what might happen to revenues in various rate environments. Also, just thank you for the disclosures on the structural hedge. I guess stepping back a little bit from that, just a couple of clarifications. In a falling rate environment, how would you expect things like customer behaviour to respond? Things like deposit mix shift like in Hong Kong. I guess the mix shift towards term happened quite a lot faster in Hong Kong versus the UK on the way up, and it’s still ongoing from the disclosures today. If rates were to turn, would you expect that flip back to be pretty quick, we’re still in a pretty high rate environment, or do you still expect the mix shift to continue? I think you talked about things like capital markets might outperform in a falling rate environment. I guess, on an underlying basis, just how do you see that? Because capital markets and loan growth, etc, I guess a lot of it’s also to do with the underlying GDP as well, and there’s still a lot of uncertainty on the horizon.

The growth against our target of 6% also is reflective of the fact that a lot of the restructuring costs we’ve taken in 2022 did not repeat. We’ve guided how the costs have increased from our initial 3%, where we included severance, into the 6%. Obviously the last percent this quarter was unexpected. The rules for the FDIC special assessment came in November. The earlier draft rules we’ve seen in September indicated we would be incurring that cost in 2024 and 2025, but the rules that came in November had a different accounting treatment and accelerated all that, as did all other banks who were subject to the FDIC special assessment. I just want to call it out that this one was a particular event we called out. As we look going forward for 2024, we’re looking at a 5% on the target basis growth. This is excluding the cost reduction we will get from exiting the French retail business and the Canada business. Between the two of them we will be exiting on an annual basis an equivalent of $1 billion, just shy of that, which is around 3%. That would be a reduction in cost of 3%, but that is excluded from the way we’re managing our target basis. Just explaining how we’re coming up with this cost – and then Noel can talk you through the levers to manage our costs – first there is this flow-through inflation from 2023. There is some wage adjustments we need to take into account for 2024 based on the flow-through inflation from 2023. That component, we feel, is easing, and hopefully in the outlook of inflation will ease as we go out of 2024 into the future. There is continued spend in technology and continued investment in some of the growth areas, organic growth areas. That’s particularly true in Wealth. That spending is partly offset by a number of cost management actions, some of which we have taken already such as the severance programme, which will have a flow-through benefit into 2024, and other actions we’re planning to take. Just before Noel talks to levers, we’re looking at cost as in growth on the target basis in dollar numbers. We’re not looking at our costs on a cost efficiency ratio basis. There may be fluctuations to our revenue, but frankly in a year like 2023 our CER has dropped from 65% in 2022 to 48%, so we will tolerate some volatility on the CER, as long as we’re managing our cost in a spend dollar basis.",False,7.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"I know this is an important topic. Let me reiterate up front that we remain committed to cost discipline. The question is, how are we achieving cost discipline? We obviously look for efficiencies in the existing organisation. We invest in tech to drive efficiencies in our processing costs, and we’re continuing to do that. We invest in simplification of the portfolio, closing down businesses organically, exiting costs organically, but we’re also exiting costs through M&A, and in our target basis we adjust for that. I don’t want you to lose sight. We’ll be exiting $1 billion of cost in 2024 as a function of M&A decisions; portfolio choices made for good, strategic reasons. $300 million of that was the exit of our French retail business. It’s a business that was losing money, so we’ve exited $300 million of cost by selling and it’s going to be profit accretive, because that business was a loss-making business. We’ve exited $800 million of cost in Canada through selling – we hope to by the end of Q1. Not tempting fate. Why are we doing it? Because that business in our hands was probably valued at around one-times book and we were able to generate two-and-a-half-times book, over two-and-a half- times book. We sold it because it was worth more to somebody else than to us and we’re redistributing the proceeds of that to our shareholders, because we thought it was the right answer for our shareholders. We do internally generated cost efficiency and externally generated cost efficiency for good, strategic reasons and we’ll continue to pull those levers. The other thing is we do believe an organisation like us, with the growth opportunities we have, we should invest and we made a decision last year, on our original cost target of 3%, to actually move it up to 4% because we were continuing to invest in tech. Tech today, as proportion of our overall cost base, is now around 22%. When I took over four years ago, tech as a percentage of our cost base was 16%. We’re trying to remain disciplined on costs and change the nature of the costs to be a much more strategic cost component in driving future enhancements for customer propositions and efficiencies. That’s the thinking we have. You have our absolute commitment, both myself and Georges, and the management teams, we will keep cost discipline. We’ll invest and save at the same time. We have to acknowledge the flow through of inflation, but the other component we made a decision on in 2023, given the very, very strong performance the business had, we thought it was right to go from 4% to 5% by topping up the variable pay pool by an extra percent. We thought that was the right decision for our people, so we think it’s the right cost decision, but it has inflated our costs compared to our original target of 3% and I think we had to do the right thing by our people on that. And then the final 1%, taking us to the 6% number you talked about, was unexpected. When we talked to you in Q3, we didn’t expect that final 1% to come through for FDIC and bank levies. The FDIC was probably a timing issue. It was going to come through in ’24 or ’25, but it actually surprisingly came through in the final quarter of the year. You’ve got our commitment. We’ll remain with tight cost discipline. Let us now turn to revenue and let me maybe, again, decompose how we think about revenue growth outside of NII or interest income. Clearly, the great work that Georges and the team have done on hedging and the further structural hedges we’ve put in place and the extra duration is a mitigant to the downside. I look at the opportunity on the upside in two components. One is our core USP of international banking. We have, within our franchise, clients who operate in more countries than we currently bank them, be they personal clients or corporate clients. We still have huge amounts of untapped opportunity to further penetrate that client base and every time – you saw in the revenue multipliers – we take a client to multiple jurisdictions, a revenue multiplier of five times domestic revenue in wholesale banking, three times domestic revenue in retail banking. That is an internal generated revenue opportunity, not dependent on GDP. That’s in our hands. The second revenue opportunity you talked about in your analysis is countercyclical and I do believe – I’ve been around 37 years, so I’ve seen some cycles - and I do believe lower inflation leads to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates lead to a pick-up in economic activity, normally with a lag effect, and I do believe that pick up will have a positive impact on capital markets activity in our Global Banking and Markets business. I think it will have a big and positive impact on demand for corporate lending and personal lending in our wholesale and retail business – lag effect, as I’ve talked about – and, thirdly, I think consumers will start to shift out of cash into invested assets, and that’s a huge opportunity for our Wealth business. You’ve seen our track record on our ability to attract net new invested assets over the last three years – $84 billion, $80 billion, $64 billion. That’s where we’re very focused and a lot of our investment is going. It's for us, the management team, to deliver on that. We know we’ve got to deliver on tight costs and cost discipline and we’ve got to deliver on revenue diversification. My final comment on this is I’m grateful that we’ve had four years of transformation, because we now are through the majority of that transformation focus – the majority – and we’re now focused on that growth opportunity and we’re in a fortunate position that all of the hard work of the last four years has given us that platform for growth.

I have two broad questions. The first one is kind of split into two and then I’ve got a second question around GB&M. The first broad question is around fee income. The first part of it is I’m a bit confused by your banking NII sensitivity. You can see in slide 34, $3.4 billion on 100 basis points rate cut, but the majority of that comes from non-NII. Can you help me there? Because I just don’t understand that. I thought banking NII stripped out the trading funding costs, so whatever colour you can give us there. And the related question is that your outlook for fee income, more broadly – I get your messaging around Wealth and Transaction Banking is demonstrating positive momentum, but can I ask you about the other big chunk of fee income, which is GB&M? There’s various moving parts there. I suspect that you think cyclically it’s not earning its full amount, but I also do note that Global FX has been decent for a while. Can you give us your view on to what extent that business is operating at, below or ahead of capacity? That was a broad, two-pronged question on fee income, believe it or not. The second question was around your approach to distribution. You’re potentially facing down the barrel of slower volume growth in 2024 and I’m interested in – you’re arguably then going to be more capital generative this year on still decent profits and not a lot of balance sheet growth. How do you approach that? Do you give us additional buybacks through the course of this year or do you hold that powder dry for a bigger rebound in 2025, say? Thank you very much.",True,8.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240222-annual-results-2023-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,4,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Aman, what, historically, we have been giving you is NII sensitivity but, as you know, there is a big component that is rate sensitive in our earnings, which doesn’t sit in NII. It sits in non-NII under funding cost of the trading book and what we have been doing – and hopefully that slide was meant to clarify, but I’m assuming now we have to take probably more offline with you to go through it. What we have been doing is showing the sensitivity of both the NII to rates, as well as the sensitivity of the funding cost of trading book to rates, and then giving you the full sensitivity of banking NII to rates, because that would be a better representation of how sensitive our earnings are to rates and that will take away the noise that is created by ongoing commercial decisions on how much funds we provide the trading activity or take away from the trading activity in-year. It cleanses that information out, because it’s just giving you the total that is relevant for our overall earnings. That sensitivity has reduced by more than half over the year, in part – at least for 30%, 40% of it – due to our structural hedging activity. With regards the fee income, you mentioned FX having a good and decent income. A couple of things about GB&M to call out. First, the PBT of GB&M was more than 20%, 25% higher year-on-year, so clearly a business that increases PBT. Its return on tangible equity has exceeded our cost of capital. It’s something that has been not achieved for many years. It’s above 12% and, to be also fair to GB&M, its return on tangible equity only increased by about 10% because there are some Corporate Centre-related adjustments which have affected them. Otherwise, their return on tangible equity could have followed the trend of PBT growth because their RWAs were down they could have seen close to 20%, and therefore well above their cost of equity. We’re comfortable with how the business continues to transform itself, focusing on their strengths and adjusting their footprint, and that momentum continues. In terms of distribution, first it remains our ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks as long as our capital supports it, and the outlook for capital does support it, but this remains subject to ongoing macroeconomic developments and regulatory approvals, etc. One thing to call out with regards our bolt-on acquisitions is, when we look at an acquisition, obviously the first parameter is making sure it’s a strategic and accelerating growth area that we strategically want to grow, but the second parameter that we also use equally is that it is accretive compared to a share buyback. We’re making sure that, when we go for a bolt-on acquisition, the investment is more accretive than the investment in buying our own shares, and this would be a disciplined measure, to make sure we’re doing M&A that is both strategic and accretive. Finally, in terms of other parts of the distribution, around 50% dividend payout ratio for 2024, which we reaffirmed, and then if you want to have a benchmark on where we would operate on a target basis, our CET1 ratio, it will be in the 14 to 14.5% range, which we reiterate, but we recognise we may not need that target, because we may be well above it for a few quarters, in particular thanks to Canada, but also to our own capital generation.",False,8.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2023\240229-fy-2023-equity-analysts-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Post-Results FY Event,Georges Elhedery,Group Cfo,"Good morning, everyone. Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I just want to share a couple of messages, three in particular, and frankly, The first one is me sharing all my empathy with all of you, given the very messy, noisy set of results we published in Q4. I know, for many of you, it was 4am, and you had to deal with this in a couple of hours, and there were a lot of non-recurrent items that you had to go through, so genuine apologies, and you have my empathy, because I can imagine only how complicated sometimes these things can get within the timeframes you have to work with. I also don’t want anyone to lose sight that, if you clear out all of these items – we still had an exceptional quarter and an exceptional 2023, where we achieved a return that we haven’t achieved in more than a decade. We achieved a PBT that we haven’t achieved, probably, ever, and we paid a dividend that we hadn’t paid since the financial crisis. So I just want to put this in perspective, which kinds of gets lost sometimes in translation when you’re looking at some of these items. The second one I want to say is banking NII – first, thank you for all of those of you who really helped us transition, but we do realise we haven’t probably been clear enough for everyone to be able to cleanly transition. I’ve taken the feedback, and it’s very important for us now that we can get that sorted between now and Q1, and we’ve taken the action with the IR team to work with you as much as we need to get to a place where banking NII can be established in a way that doesn’t lead to any future confusion. Why banking NII? It’s because that’s the right way to understand, economically, how our earnings depend on rates. We felt it important that we’re able to split our revenue in two broad categories: one which is directly dependent on rates, and that is the statutory NII – plus the funding cost of the trading book, or the offset of the funding cost of the trading book offset. That component has a direct dependency on rates, and therefore, if we really want to understand the dependency on rates over earnings, that $44 billion we called out last year, or the at least $41 billion we’re calling out going forward, are the ones that will have that direct dependency. The residual $21.6 billion of 2023 is essentially much less dependent on it. There will always be indirect correlations, but they have no direct correlation to rates. Half of that $21 billion – so $10.5 billion exactly – is Transaction Banking fees and Transaction Banking other revenue, not related to, say, the value we get from deposits and payments and not related to the value we get from the rate component, so the pure non-rate component of payments, trade fees, foreign exchange, Securities Services fees. That’s about half, $10.5 billion of the $21 billion. Then, about a third – or $6 billion – is Wealth. That’s essentially our Private Bank, Asset Management, Insurance and Investment Distribution. Between those two, we’re at about $16.5 billion of the $21 billion. The residual $4 billion-ish comprises everything else that’s non-rate dependent, in particular the other trading activities if you exclude foreign exchange, so you really have the fixed income and equities trading activities. It includes investment banking activities, so capital markets is a big component of it, but obviously, it includes other investment banking – M&A, ECM, etc – fees, and it includes bits and bobs. We recognise that the rest, this $4 billion, you may put a cyclical value to, but not necessarily a growth value to, whereas the first two – Transaction Banking and Wealth – you can attribute a growth value to, because we clearly have a strong ambition to grow these areas: Transaction Banking, because this is our global wholesale network, one of our key differentiators; and Wealth because of all the investments we have been putting in, and because we believe it’s a key differentiator. We can talk to that if need be. But those two are growth areas for us which we continue investing in, both in terms of technology and in terms of people. The third message – and I am also cognisant that many of you want to have clarity on revenue guidance, which we cannot give, and I recognise some others may have given, but I understood some of the arithmetic many of you have done. If I look at the arithmetic you’ve worked around, you said ‘mid-teens’ RoTE, which in our language is approximately 14 to 16%. You may have taken 14% as a starting point. You may have then plugged in a cost number and an ECL number, given we gave you guidance for those two items, and then you may have come up with a revenue number, and I’ve heard $64 billion being quoted a few times. Without commenting on the number, I just want to follow a little bit further your arithmetic. We guided to ‘at least’ $41 billion in banking NII, and then, in 2023, adjusted for Canada and France, we made $21 billion in non-banking NII revenue, I’m taking out Canada and France, so $21 billion if you want a base case. If you take a no-growth assumption in non-banking NII, you get $21 billion in 2024 – no growth. If you take the bottom end of our ‘at least’ $41 billion – you take $41 billion – you get to $62 billion, and then the maths that many of you are squaring up is, ‘Where does the $2 billion come from for those guys to be comfortable giving us a mid- teens RoTE, which means $64 billion-plus? Where do these two come from?’ To your judgment, without me commenting on where should they come, we’ve given an ‘at- least’ $41 billion, which means we do get comfort in higher scenarios than $41 billion, and the $21 billion is an area of massive investment for us. This is probably one of the few areas where we keep investing. In 2023, just for the sake of comparison, we’ve grown Transaction Banking 5% to 2022, ex rates – purely the fees, and we’ve grown Wealth 7%, ex interest-dependent earnings. So therefore, when I take a $21 billion, putting no growth in 2024, subject to market conditions and everything, would be obviously a harsh assessment, because this is an area where we’re already proving we can grow, and it remains our strong intention to invest and grow. And this is where your arithmetic can get you and how much do you believe we can achieve in that space? 5% growth on 2022 – that’s $1 billion. 10% growth – that’s $2 billion, but then, ‘at least’ $41 billion – how much upside? We’ve seen the latest consensus. So you’re guessing some of the upside, your views on rates, etc. Anyways, so your maths, from those that I’ve heard, can – you can work it this way. Your logic makes sense, and it’s then your judgment on how you fill the gaps – your judgment or your best estimate of the market conditions. I’ll pause here. These were the three messages I wanted to say. I’m happy to open it up.",False,-1.0,1

Presentation Transcripts\2023\240229-fy-2023-equity-analysts-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Post-Results FY Event,Georges Elhedery,Group Cfo,"Yes. Your second point is on the hedging. First, it definitely is our intention to increase the quantum and the duration of the hedge. We’ve indicated we’ve done between $75 and $100 billion of additional hedges in 2023, and it’s reasonable to believe, subject to market conditions, we can continue doing the same in 2024. I’m saying ‘subject to market conditions’ because the rate environment will dictate how much more or less we would do. That probably will take us quite close to how much capacity we have. We may have capacity for twice that much, and that’s it, then the balance sheet will be fully stablished, which means we will not have additional capacity. On the duration, our ambition is to go beyond three years. Our ambition is to target three-and- a-half years, exceeding three years will probably be achievable, and as you already said, it’s easier to achieve it fairly quickly in pounds and dollars and euros. It will not be achievable in Hong Kong dollars, so we will always weight. The weighting will always bring the average a bit lower, but in hedgeable currencies, yes, we can get there fairly fast. One thing I want to say relating to question one and question two is that in Hong Kong a lot of the liquidity is unhedgeable, but you also need to look at Hong Kong in terms of when you’re trying to forecast your banking NII in a rate-drop environment. There’s a lot of drag we got on the way up from mortgages, because they’re capped. The average mortgage in Hong Kong is capped at around 3.25%. In a rate-drop scenario, those mortgages will probably remain at their 3.25% cap, so they indirectly behave like a hedge. We won’t call it a hedge today, because this is not a strategic hedge, but it’s a de facto hedge, just because you’re so deep in the cap that, on a rate drop, you remain in the cap. That fixed rate remains varied, and that gives us protection. That dynamic is important, and we disclose how much mortgages we have. We practically have half our Hong Kong dollar deposit book in mortgages; anything we may lose on the deposits, half of it will be compensated back in mortgages as long as we’re within the cap, i.e. within the 3.25-ish%. You have to bake this into your thinking when you’re thinking about a rate-down scenario. It’s a mitigant on the way down, as it was a headwind on the way up. On the yield, we’ve been fairly recent as a bank in disclosing structural hedge considerations. We obviously have a lot of tools internally to manage it, but we have historically not taken them like some of our peers, frankly. We’ve not taken them to standards where we felt comfortable disclosing them, because probably historically, we didn’t feel the need to do it. We clearly have come over that last year, and we said, ‘Look, however much we are happy with the tools we have to manage our own structural hedge, there is a requirement for us to be able to go more public with that information and be able to disclose’. What we have been doing over the course of the year is take some of the information we have and bring them to standards that we can put out. The bar may be higher for us. I can’t tell, but the bar for us is where we feel comfortable. All I can say now is, whenever things reach a status where we feel are disclosable and they will be meaningful for you, then we’re minded to disclose that. They need to be meaningful for you, but – so the yield maybe falls in that category. Obviously, the maturity used to fall in that category. The quantum used to fall in that category. Both of them are over the hurdle now, and this is why we disclosed them. A split by currency used to fall in that category; now that’s disclosable. Banking NII sensitivity used to fall in that category; this is why it was between square brackets back then. Today, it’s a firm number that we can stand behind as well. So we’ve made great progress. There are half a dozen metrics now that we’re disclosing, but you keep asking for more, so we’ll take the message.",False,0.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2023\240229-fy-2023-equity-analysts-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Post-Results FY Event,Georges Elhedery,Group Cfo,"So on your first question, Andy, that acceleration we did in Q3 and Q4 is an arrow in our quiver as a mechanism that we could use, but we have no further intentions at this stage to consider it, and if we think the conditions are right to consider it, we may let you know, but at this stage, there are no plans to do so. The reason sometimes you need to do it, like we did it in Q3, Q4, is that we didn’t have enough maturing hedges to accelerate in a quite attractive rate environment, so we then decided, ‘Let’s accelerate it by taking off some of the existing hedges’, but if we have maturing hedges that come along, those could be your natural source of new hedges, so there is no point for acceleration, and the rate environment today is fine, but it’s not a cause for us to consider a massive acceleration, just because the rates are in a steady place, quite attractive. So no plans at this stage, but if there are plans, we will let you know, but there are no plans at this stage. On your second point, it may be you’re confusing two things, and let me just clarify. There is an NII reclassification that we conducted, $0.3 billion, which we called cash flow hedge reclassification. In one of our legal entities, there was a misclassification, an error, of where some of these hedges should have pointed to, and that was since the start of the year. We’ve rectified this and we’ve taken the full adjustment. It’s not a charge. It’s a charge to NII, but to benefit to non-NII. It’s zero PBT, but it was in the wrong category. We did a one-time correction in Q4, so the impact of $0.3 billion is effectively a full-year impact, of which a portion relates to Q4 proper, and a portion is an adjustment for the three previous quarters. And that charge, you can assume, will not be repeated, because that balance sheet where the error occurred may not be with us anymore starting end of Q1 – not giving more details. On the hyperinflation proper, which is Argentina-related, the charge to NII we’ve booked in Q4 was $0.5 billion. The charge to revenue was $0.8 billion, so $0.5 billion plus $0.3 billion, and there was a positive impact on costs of $0.2 billion, roughly. This one is more difficult to say, ‘Is it a full year?’ It’s a one-time event, essentially driven by the massive devaluation that took place following a couple of quarters where there was no devaluation. It’s very difficult to argue how much of it relates to prior quarters, but it is fair to say the following: going forward, the NII from Argentina is $250 million per quarter, where we stand today. So it’s $1 billion – of the ‘at least’ $41 billion, there’s $1 billion related to Argentina. That $1 billion, or that $250 million a quarter, will increase as inflation increases, and then will decrease as you face devaluations. The net of the two is difficult to forecast, and therefore, the best guess at this stage is to just use $1 billion. Historically, you have had inflation, and then you had devaluation, and then inflation and devaluation kind of balanced themselves out, but sometimes, they’re not in sync.",False,0.0,0

It’s difficult to talk to deposit behaviour in a rate-going-down environment, because we just haven’t seen how it’s going to happen. It is fair that, the last 100 basis points of rate hikes, our betas were closer to 75 to 100%, so our betas were materially higher for the last hikes. From 4% to 5%, most of that benefit has gone to customers, and I know you will have a natural inclination to say, ‘Well, then, if you go back from 5% to 4%, you’ll take most of it back’. It’s difficult to call this out, and this is part of the uncertainties we’re facing.

One is around Transaction Banking and Wealth Management. Thanks very much for highlighting the year-on-year growth rates. I’m struggling to get a clean read on the actual underlying run rates of those businesses, though, because I guess a lot of your markets were in a version of a lockdown at the beginning of the year, or at least for a decent chunk of 2022.

Even Q1 – sequentially, I can’t get a clean read because of seasonality in various lines, but that would be really helpful.

I did a bad job of asking this question last week, so I’ll ask again. Markets is, I think, a bit harder to predict next year, and I know some of this is volatile and episodic and whatever terminology people are using now, but I think the revenue bridge that you’re calling out in part will depend on what the market does in 2024, and again, it feels like there’s various moving parts there because it’s not earning at full capacity, but also, I think Global FX has been coming off a decent period.

Presentation Transcripts\2023\240229-fy-2023-equity-analysts-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Post-Results FY Event,Georges Elhedery,Group Cfo,"First, on Transaction Banking, Covid has not been a major detractor to Transaction Banking because payments and exports continue to happen, even in the Covid lockdown economies such as China. What’s going to affect it is some of the trade tariffs, etc, which have created friction. Now, this can be a positive revenue earner for us because, whereas previously, let’s say, for the sake of example, you would have one trade transaction between China and the US, and one foreign exchange underlying it between renminbi and US dollars, and one payment underlying it with maybe a step through Hong Kong, today, trade friction is meaningful – we’ve published good reports from our economists, which we encourage you to look at. Today, what’s happening is that China’s exporting essentially to ASEAN, from ASEAN back into US, or ASEAN back to Mexico, Mexico to US, or China to Mexico, Mexico to US. India and others have become the ‘plus-one’, so it’s not only about China-US, but also India-US and India- Europe, etc. So this friction means, for the end consumer, that getting access to goods becomes a little bit more cumbersome, and obviously for importers and exporters, but for the banks who are serving all these legs of the trade, when one leg has become three legs, one foreign exchange transaction has become three, one payment has become three, so that is a potential source of growth. Now, you add to that the fact that, when you were doing US-China, you probably had every bank on the planet that could service that corridor, because that was the corridor. When you’re moving China to Vietnam and Vietnam to Mexico, etc, suddenly you’re in corridors where those who can deliver the services for payments and FX and trade finance, etc, are materially fewer. So there’s also an opportunity for us to gain share, because the fragmented corridors mean you need banks who are present in all these fragmented locations, which is not any more the case with many of the big banks. So there is a multiplication of legs, and there are fewer competitors that can compete on these, so that should be a source of growth. In terms of Wealth, you, granted, have had in 2023 a jump, because Hong Kong has been a major component – Insurance in Hong Kong and Wealth in Hong Kong – and those have benefitted from the opening of the border in January 2023, and that had driven a lot of the revenue increase. But we’re talking revenue increase and ensuring new business CSM increase of 50% plus, so it was a massive increase, but going forward, one of the major pullbacks on the opportunity in Wealth has been the slowdown of the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong and the various mainland Chinese indices and equities, and any revival in this space you could equate to additional growth for us, simply because there will be more attractivity from these markets. So today, for instance, our Investment Distribution, while it’s up 2%, the equity component in it was down 50%. It’s been up in structured products and mutual funds and bonds and, net-net, it’s all up 2% Q4 to Q4 – but the equity component of it is down 50%, so you can imagine how much upside there is if we start seeing normalisation of the equity markets. So that’s an underlying growth we can leverage. Third, the rate differential between onshore China rates and US dollar rates still means that there is wealth that is within what’s lawful in terms of wealth investments. There’s still a lot of wealth moving from China into higher-yielding products in Hong Kong or Singapore or internationally, if you want – even US dollar – and that corridor is one of our main corridors as well in terms of Wealth growth. So that’s another potential for the growth. In terms of Markets, Foreign Exchange, we count as part of Transaction Banking, because 80% of the revenue is driven by our flows in payment and trade. And that will be highly correlated with our overall performance in Transaction Banking, and we very much cherish that. Securities Services is also part of Transaction Banking. As you know, our Securities Services business is, essentially, Asia and Middle East. We are the number one sub-custodian in Asia and the Middle East. Again, an attractivity of the Hong Kong and China markets would give us a lift-off in this space. Obviously, India and other ASEAN markets have remained attractive, but there is a clear gap which can be compensated if these markets become attractive again. And then you have the other trading activities, which is Equities and Fixed Income. Incidentally, Fixed Income depends heavily on our Debt Capital Markets. Usually, when you do an issuance, half of the trading in a given issuance happens in the three weeks after it’s issued, and then it finds its way to long-only, or buy and hold. So, if you have a new issuance, half of the trading happens in the first three weeks. If you don’t have a new issuance, you’re missing out on that. So, if you regain activity in Debt Capital Markets, you regain activity in this space. That will be dependent on the rate level. This is why we believe rates coming down will allow some of these businesses to form. And Equities, for us, has been Asia and Middle East equities. There was a big drawdown in Asia because equities is a big part of Asian Wealth in terms of equity structured products or other, and that has been also pulled back by the subdued environment. So, do they have potential upside? Yes, they do – for one, from DCM revival, the other one from the mainland China / Hong Kong markets revival – but, in all cases, I’m assuming you’re not putting a very high multiple on these revenues, so this is why we haven’t been calling it out, but thanks for asking the question.",False,4.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2023\240229-fy-2023-equity-analysts-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Post-Results FY Event,Georges Elhedery,Group Cfo,"I do need to say, because I think it went somewhat unnoticed, because I’ve heard some say, ‘But you did $3 billion last quarter. Why? We were expecting $3 billion’. We announced $2 billion, but this is a quarter of two months. On a per-month basis, that would be the fastest we’ve ever done, because we did $3 billion for four months – that’s $0.75 billion per month – and, previous to that, for two consecutive quarters, we did $2 billion for three months, which is $0.66 billion. So we moved from $0.66 billion per month to $0.75 billion per month. And for this quarter, we’re announcing $1 billion per month. Now, whether we can achieve it or not remains to be seen, but it is the most ambitious on a per-month basis ever. So, for some who were expecting $3 billion, it would have been impossible to achieve in a two-month period. So, I think $2 billion for this quarter is the fastest we would have ever done it on a per-month or per-day basis. Your maths are correct, and Canada capital returns after the special dividend is correct, and it remains firmly my intention to do a rolling series of share buybacks. Based on our current projections, we have capacity for both growth from our own capital generation and buybacks, and Canada is adding to our capital generation. I look at the buybacks partly as a distribution mechanism in and of itself, and partly as a means to reduce our share count and protect future dividend per share. So, our buybacks so far have yielded 4.6% - $7 billion bought back is a 4.6% reduction of our share count - and you add the other $2 billion and you can do the maths. There are conditions. Our corporate brokers do the buybacks for us, and they have very strict conditions on how they hit the market. We try to be within 15% daily average volume. If you exceed it, then we’re too heavy in the market. We have lockout periods. That could be periods where we’re buying shares for our staff, or periods where the share price has gone up too fast. That’s a lockout period, then they stop buying back. So, there are limitations that are quite technical in nature, and we just need to see how they manifest. In terms of dividend, yes, we applied 50% to the dot. We thought, when we shared 50%, we meant 50%, and you expect 50%, so you got 50%. And for 2024, that remains our intention. We have not given a future assessment, but, for 2024, I think 50% plus the special dividend is a fair assumption of what the dividend will look like.",False,5.0,0

And then the second question is linked to the first, which is why I didn’t tell you at the outset. And that is Noel, in his explanation around the Canadian sale, emphasised you got a great price relative to where HSBC is trading. You clearly have a very strong balance sheet. In your introductory comments, you mentioned several times that last year was exceptional. It may be a new level for ROTE. Let’s hope it’s not a one-off. But the question I have is whether HSBC should be buying earnings rather than selling them, given the stage in the cycle, the strength of your balance sheet and the fact that the market doesn’t reward opex investment in Wealth or anything else.

The way we’re looking at it is, first, strategic fit, naturally. Obviously, pricing conditions, etc. But my benchmark internally is, ‘Is it accretive to buybacks?’ because our investors will say, ‘Look, if it’s more accretive than the buyback’ – $2 billion, $4 billion, whatever – ‘if it’s more accretive than the buyback, then that’s the right thing for our shareholders. If it’s not more accretive than the buyback, then probably our shareholders expect a buyback’. So, it’s the benchmark we’re putting, but we keep looking. We're looking very actively – in other words, we see a lot of propositions.

Just going back to NII, thanks for all the guidance for 2024. I think that’s reasonably clear. Do you have something in mind in terms of what your sustainable level of banking NII is? Because whether you look at NIM or whatever the bank looks at, in the past the easiest thing to do is look at what happened on the way down and say, ‘This is going to happen on the way up and maybe we'll go all the way back down to where they started’, broadly speaking, but now you have a structural hedge element to it. Is it as simple as looking at what happened on the way up and then adjust for the reduction in sensitivity? I presume it’s not as simple as that, but is it? That’s the first question. Secondly, I guess, is the shape of how you get to that sustainable level, because, in the domestic space, a lot of the upside protection in the second half of this year, and maybe even next year, is the rolling of the structural hedge. But a lot of it was put on more recently, and you don’t have a lot of structural hedge maturing at 1%, so would it be fair to think that the profile of banking NII would broadly follow whatever the rate environment is?",True,6.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2023\240229-fy-2023-equity-analysts-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2023,Post-Results FY Event,George Elhedery,,"A couple of observations. The first one is, yes, indeed, I don’t think you can take history when rates were zero and then moved to 5%. That spread – $10 billion to $12 billion of NII – isn’t reflective of how it will work on the way down. And there are two, I would say, major reasons. The first one, you called out, which is the structural hedge. The structural hedge, today, for a 100-basis-point drop in rates, has divided our sensitivity by more than 2, so we’re less than 50%, and that should be counted in. And then the second one is volumes. Clearly, our loan book hasn’t grown in 2023 but, in a lower-rate environment, subject to economic conditions, but if it’s lower rates because it’s lower inflation and a soft landing of the economy, you do then expect balance sheet growth and loan growth, and that will be also a form of a mitigant to a drop in rates. So this is why the dynamic will be quite different than the dynamic on the way up and, rightfully, more mitigated than the dynamic on the way up. So if you want, that’s the consideration on NII.

First is the interest rate outlook from the policy side and, second, whether we have any inorganic or not.

Just following on Jason’s question, we will look and we continue to look at M&A opportunities. We’ve always said we’re looking at ‘bolt-on’ M&A opportunities – and by ‘bolt-on’, we mean in the billion to a couple of billion dollar opportunities. We’ve done four over the last two years – or five over the last two years. We’ve acquired AXA Singapore. We’ve acquired L&T Investment Management in India. We’ve acquired SVB UK, of course. We’ve acquired the Citi business in China. We increased our share in the investment bank in China from 50% to 90%. And we bought back the 100% ownership of our asset management business in China, which we only used to own 50% of. So those are some visible ones. I’m sure I may have missed one or two. Yes, we acquired an asset manager in Singapore as well. So that, in total, is a couple or $3 billion. It’s fair, then, to assume we will continue looking at these opportunities. Now, in terms of outlook for banking NII, the interest rate component is definitely a component we forecast and stress in our outlook. Just to be transparent, we are assuming now, in our central scenario – not in our ‘at least’ $41 billion scenario but in our internal central scenario, we’re using three cuts for the US, two cuts for pounds, which is what the market is expecting, and we would stress this a little bit as well. We are not taking into account M&A, especially if it’s material. If there is a material M&A, we have to call it out separately. Equally, we're not taking any material M&A in our ROTE. We will be giving a ROTE exclusive of notables. Therefore, if it’s a material M&A, we will exclude it and we will look at it separately, because it will contaminate too much our internal metrics if we just mix it with the rest and confuse everyone.",False,7.0,0

I’m joining you today from London and have alongside me Noel and Georges. I’ll be making some short opening remarks before handing over to Noel. As you may have already seen, we have announced today that Noel has informed the Board of his intention to retire from the bank after nearly five years in the role. The Board and I would like to pay tribute to Noel’s exceptional leadership during that time. As Group Chief Executive, he drove both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler, more focused business through the disposal of assets in the US, France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver an improved performance, achieving record profits last year, and create a platform for future growth and development. Noel, who you’ll hear from in a second, has decided it’s the right time to step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments. As you would expect, the Board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already have started a robust and rigorous process to find our next Group Chief Executive. This process will look at both internal and external candidates. I’m very pleased that Noel has agreed to remain in his role while this process takes place, ensuring a smooth and orderly transition, and, on a personal note, I’d like to thank Noel for his unwavering commitment and dedication to HSBC, which he joined 37 years ago. Noel, it has been a pleasure and privilege to work with and alongside you.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240502-1q-2024-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,1,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Thank you, Mark. I’m very grateful for your support, guidance, friendship and partnership. I’m proud of what my HSBC colleagues and I have achieved together over the past five years. Over that period, we have hit some significant milestones – record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade, and the highest dividend since 2008. As Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we have built a strong platform for the bank’s next phase of development and growth. That’s why I feel this is the right time to step back, to find a better balance between my personal and business commitments, with the intention, going forward, after a break, of pursuing a portfolio career. When I reflect back on the last 37 years, I have held intensive leadership roles, particularly since I took over the UK Commercial Bank in October 2008. After 16 years of intensive leadership, I’m ready for a change, but it’s also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It’s an ideal time to bring in new leadership. The Board has now started a process to find my successor, and I’m very happy to continue in my role as that process takes place. Rest assured, I will be working hard to ensure a smooth and orderly transition for my successor and to keep the momentum going in this business as you have seen in Q1. Until then, it’s business as usual, so let’s now turn to our Q1 results, which have showed continued progress. We had a good first quarter. Reported profit before tax was $12.7 billion. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion. Our return on tangible equity was 16.4% excluding notable items. I’m also pleased with the further capital distributions of $8.8 billion, which brings the total amount of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last 15 months to almost $28 billion, and we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance for 2024. I will now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240502-1q-2024-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Noel. I’d like to open by paying tribute to the enormous contribution Noel has made to the bank. I’ve greatly enjoyed working alongside him, and I know everyone at the bank has appreciated his strong and effective leadership. I’m also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since my appointment as CFO 15 months ago. The Board has announced a process to find a successor, and I know Noel and I will continue to remain very focused on the job at hand until that process has been completed. Turning now to the numbers. Reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion was down $0.3 billion on the first quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, down $0.4 billion on last year’s first quarter. On an annualised basis, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 26.1% or 16.4% excluding notable items. We completed the $2 billion share buyback announced in February in two months. This means that, since the end of 2022, we have bought back 6% of our outstanding shares, and the trend of strong shareholder distributions continues this quarter. We have announced, as Noel said, a further $8.8 billion of distributions consisting of first interim dividend for 2024 of 10 cents per share, the special dividend of 21 cents per share from the Canada sale proceeds, and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we plan to begin right after the AGM and complete within three months. Finally, we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity excluding notable items and our commitment to limit cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. So, on the next slide, reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion included a $4.8 billion gain on the sale of Canada, partly offset by the $1.1 billion impairment on the classification of Argentina as held for sale. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, with revenue growth offset primarily by higher costs and ECLs. Revenue of $20.8 billion was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue was $17 billion, which was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year with growth in Banking NII partly offset by lower Fee and other income. Within that, we saw high single-digit growth in multi-jurisdictional revenue in the first quarter, which underlines the value of our global network. Banking NII of $11.3 billion was up $0.6 billion on the fourth quarter on a reported FX basis, mainly driven by Argentina Banking NII as well as the non-recurrence of the cashflow hedge reclassification in the last quarter. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, a few things to keep in mind. First, our Q1 Banking NII included $0.3 billion from Canada, which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion of the sale in March this year. Second, first-quarter Banking NII also included $0.5 billion from Argentina. This contribution will continue to be highly volatile until the sale is completed, which we expect to be within the next 12 months. Please, therefore, do not extrapolate the $0.5 billion run-rate for the remainder of the year. Our Banking NII guidance assumes the contribution of around $1 billion in full year 2024 for Argentina, which is in line with full year 2023. Third, the Banking NII outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our full-year results in February. The Hong Kong time deposit mix remains stable as a percentage of customer deposits in the quarter, and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates. However, it is still early in the year, and these things can change, so we are maintaining our 2024 Banking NII guidance of at least $41 billion. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale Transaction Banking was down by 9%, primarily due to the normalisation of FX revenues compared to a very strong Foreign Exchange performance in the first quarter of last year, which benefitted from higher market volatility. Fees from Global Payments Solutions had another good quarter, up by 6%. Wealth is another growth area that had a very good quarter, up by 14% on the same period last year as our investment continued to drive improved results. Private Banking was a standout performer, mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia, but growth in Wealth has been broad-based. To illustrate this, we acquired around 135,000 new-to-bank retail Wealth customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. Approximately 60% of these were non-residents attracted by our service and product capabilities in Hong Kong. Building on previous quarters, we attracted $27 billion of net new invested assets, of which $19 billion were in Asia, and our insurance new business CSM was $0.8 billion, up from $0.4 billion in the first quarter of last year. On credit, expected credit losses were $0.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 30 basis points of average loans. These were primarily stage three charges across Retail and Wholesale. There was a $54 million charge related to our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. While challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more benign ECL contribution from it than last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue monitoring developments closely, and we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around 40 basis points of average loans, recognising the overall uncertainty from the flowthrough effect of high interest rates on the economy. Next, we’re on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. This quarter’s year-on-year cost growth was impacted by three items. First, we chose to phase the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. This accounted for two percentage points of cost growth this quarter. We do not currently expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly different to 2023, so the accrual will be lower over the next three quarters than it was in the same period last year. Second, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to one percentage point of cost growth this quarter, as we only acquired SVB UK in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide you with a fuller update on that business at the half year, but I’m pleased that it has good momentum. In the UK, we onboarded 183 new-to-bank Innovation Banking client groups in the quarter, the best quarter since acquisition. Finally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank of England Levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost discipline, and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis inclusive of all the above items. On lending and deposits, there was good loan growth in the UK, the Middle East, Mexico and Asia excluding Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remained subdued, largely due to the high interest rate differential with mainland China. Overall, we continue to expect mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium-to-long term, but we expect demand to remain subdued in the near term. Deposits were down 2%. This was due to a range of factors including seasonality, the switch from time deposits to wealth products in Hong Kong and our deliberate choice to forsake some highly price-sensitive deposits. Next, our CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 40 basis points on the fourth quarter. Organic capital generation and the gain from the sale of the Canadian business enabled us to announce $8.8 billion of capital distributions this quarter. This includes a share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have an impact of around 40 basis points on our CET1 ratio in the second quarter. For modelling purposes, please note that the $5.8 billion of dividends announced today, as well as the $5.9 billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full-year results in February will both be reflected in TNAV in the second quarter. At closing of the sale of HSBC Argentina, which is expected within 12 months, we will also recognise $4.9 billion of foreign exchange reserve recycling losses, subject to any movement in this reserve up until completion. These losses have already been accumulated in capital over the previous years. Therefore, recognition in the P&L will have no impact on CET1, nor on TNAV. Finally, looking forward to the rest of the year, our good first quarter puts us on track, and we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance – a mid-teens return on tangible equity excluding notable items, a Banking NII of at least $41 billion, ECLs of around 40 basis points, cost growth limited to around 5% on a target basis, and a 50% dividend payout ratio.",False,-1.0,1

Thank you for taking my questions, congratulations Noel on a great tenure at the bank, and well done for the ROE and the capital return. Just in terms of my question, the TD migration in Hong Kong, if you go back to the way you were computing it previously, it actually looks like it improved quarter on quarter, and certainly under the new definition has stabilised. Is that a little bit better than where your expectations were a few months ago? I know when I was in Hong Kong recently it sounded like things were starting to stabilise, but is that better than where you were thinking a few months ago? Secondly, on the buybacks, is the $3 billion number due more to the calendar effect or are you looking to boost the run rate there from the $2 billion a quarter?",True,0.0,0

So first, on the time deposit reclassification, we have actually reclassified some Private Bank term deposits to time deposits. This is due to the observation of their behaviour and the recognition that they’re better classified as time deposits. This rebases the number, but, as you could see from the two charts we have, it does not affect the trend, so therefore the trend that we’ve seen under both classifications is the same and we’ve seen the first quarter stable, quarter on quarter. It’s too early to call it a peak, but we’ve always expected migration this year to be slower than what we’ve seen last year, and this just confirms the trend change from what we’ve seen in full-year 2023. As regards your buyback question, so the short answer is yes, this is indeed due to calendar effects. We just completed a $2 billion buyback in two months. That’s about a billion a month. That is the fastest run-rate we’ve done in terms of share buybacks ever. We are now announcing a $3 billion buyback which we intend to do over the next three months, starting after AGM. We will see how it goes with the $1 billion run rate. We will see how it will go. As regards any future amount of buyback or whether we’re doing a buyback, one, it remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share buyback, and second, we will decide on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on our capital outlook, the loan growth outlook and other parameters as and when every quarter.",False,0.0,0

Just staying, Georges, on this point on distributions and looking at the moving parts for capital, one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more colour on the growth in RWAs, the $7 billion of increase driven by asset quality trends. I think you’re calling out that it’s predominantly in Asia. What should we think about the outlook for RWA growth from here, even if loan growth is muted, just to get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in quantum terms for distributions? The second question is to Noel: a question for your broader thoughts, Noel. The five years preceding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC but I guess for a lot of people in your markets, given the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you exited Canada, you announced Argentina. You’re in the process of exiting quite a few smaller markets. The return on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens. You’re buying back stock at $3 billion a quarter. You’ve got a special dividend as well. I guess what I’m really interested in is from here onwards, what do you think is left to do for the group to progress?",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240502-1q-2024-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"I’ll start with your first question, Raul. First, on RWA outlook, of the RWA growth we called on a quarter-on-quarter basis $24 billion. First, about 40% of it relate to lending and other asset growth, and as you can see from our lending book, we’ve grown our lending book by $5 billion. There are a number of areas of growth that contributed to around 40% of it, $9 billion. Then we’ve had a $5 billion market risk RWA growth; this is due to a pickup in MSS activity against a subdued Q4, and it’s more in line with their activity levels in the first three quarters of the year, if you want. This is the normalisation of Markets activity. And then there is $7 billion which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, first, it is a continuous exercise. We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis. We have recognised, across a number of geographies and a number of sectors, certain names which we’ve decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe. You will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ECL, and that’s mainly because for many of these customers their balance sheet remains strong, so we’re comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore there is no ECL implication from this downgrade. But just closing the loop on this RWA downgrade, you will see some of it materialised in our stage three loans, where we increased our stage three loans by about $2 billion, and that’s exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality. With regards how we look forward, we’re very comfortable where we are today. Our credit metrics remain solid. As I say, the balance sheets of our customers remain strong for a number of them, for at least the exposure that is collateralised. We’re very comfortable with the level of collateralisation and the LTV, and therefore we do not foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking. We will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always do. Noel?",False,1.0,0

I want to pay tribute to the team for the way they’ve collectively navigated that, and during that whole process the external environment executed on a complex but absolutely critical transformation plan over the past five years.

With such volatility in an external environment any CEO needs the support of their Chair, their advice, their guidance, and I’ve had that all the way through.

Now, if I look forward I’m not going to give a to-do list to my successor, because that is not the fair thing to do to anyone, but I will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very much focused on and I’m focused on for as long as I’m still CEO, and that is continuing the momentum. You don’t work as hard as we’ve worked for the past five years and then take the eye off the ball at this moment in time, so I’m very focused on a smooth, orderly transition. I’m very focused on continued execution of the strategy. I want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy. We have exited a lot of businesses, a lot of RWAs over the past five years. The one thing we’ve protected whilst doing that is the international core of HSBC. The countries we remain in and the businesses we remain in are fundamentally now focused on the international nature and essence of HSBC, and we will continue to do that. Our key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are sustainable and repeatable, whilst also taking advantage of the growth opportunities as they emerge in a world that becomes more stable and that are inherent in our customer franchise. Therefore, we’re very focused on continuing the development of wealth, our transaction banking capabilities, our global wholesale banking capabilities, and then being ready for when corporate loan demand picks up we can take advantage of that to couple good returns with sustainable growth. I think you’ve seen evidence of that in these results. Hong Kong is subdued at the moment, but we understand why, with the rate differential in China. But, if you look at the rest of the world – as Georges said – there’s balance sheet growth in wholesale banking, in the rest of Asia, in the Middle East, in UK, in Europe. We’re seeing good growth elsewhere, so it’s about focus, momentum, continuing to couple good returns with good growth.",False,1.0,0

The first question is on deposits. We’re glad to see that the CASA migration in Hong Kong is slowing down, but it’s not stabilised at this level. But on the other hand, I think the bank has seen some deposit outflow in Q1, while your Hong Kong local peers still see some deposit growth. So I’m wondering if there is a strategic trade-off between the deposit growth and CASA for you at this stage, and how do you see that trend in the rest of the year? The second question is on the structural hedge. I’m wondering if this quarter you could share with us some breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the reinvestment of the structural hedge, and if there is any run rate that we can refer to?",True,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240502-1q-2024-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Jeremy. So on your first question about deposits in Hong Kong, if you remember at Q4 our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. What we’ve seen in Q1 this year is a decrease of about $16 billion, therefore you can see seasonality playing across the two quarters and therefore is broadly stable across the two quarters. What happened, though, is some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some deposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. When you look at Q1, while you see the deposit outflows you also can see that $19 billion of our net new invested assets were in Asia. Therefore, a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated into wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4 and explains, if you want, the seasonality of these deposits. Second, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and enviable franchise. We continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail and wholesale customers. We cherish this. We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. Throughout the last six quarters you’ve seen how our deposit base has been very stable, with our deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers, therefore I won’t comment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers. If I move on to your second question about the structural hedge, first you would have noticed that we increased this quarter the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 billion, with the weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of three years. Second, we commit at this stage to continue our structural hedging activity. Obviously this will remain subject to market conditions, but we will continue the trend that we put in Q1 based on current market outlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind toward Banking NII, and this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted, as you know, and you can do the maths. But equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates, and this reinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into Banking NII. Between the two of those effects the structural hedge activity for the full-year 2024 would remain a net tailwind to our Banking NII. We have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind. We’re looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space, but that tailwind has been factored into our guidance of ‘at least $41 billion Banking NII’, and obviously factored into our return on tangible equity mid-teens guidance.",False,2.0,0

Georges, I just wondered whether you’d talk a little bit within the context of ‘higher for longer’. You’ve referenced subdued loan demand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates, and I just wonder whether – one of your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue, so I wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether that’s a material part of the plan and what you think that means for revenue evolution in the next few quarters? I think I certainly was somewhat surprised that we didn’t see an upgrade to Banking NII guidance this quarter. I know you don’t rebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that ‘higher for longer’ has on asset mix and then on credit demand. And then secondly, Wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there’s a part of the business that’s quite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now up 20% in a short space of time, but I just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. Is that the strategy delivering the net new money flows, or is there an element of market volatility in there that we should be a little bit careful about?",True,3.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240502-1q-2024-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Jason. So first on Banking NII, we recognise there are a couple of encouraging developments. The first one is the ‘higher for longer’ on the rate side that will look more favourable than when we discussed last in February, and the second one we just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix, specifically in Hong Kong, where we’ve seen term deposit remain stable for this quarter. So we recognise these tailwinds to our Banking NII, but we also recognise it’s quite early in the year and these factors can still change. This is why we didn’t change our guidance. As you said, Jason, I don’t think you should expect us to update our guidance every quarter. We will reconsider this every quarter, but for this quarter we’re just sticking with our at least $41 billion. In terms of the Wealth performance, so recognise mid-teens percentage growth in Wealth, 34% for our Private Bank, I would say a couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that we’ve already said it’s a focus strategic area. We are investing in this area. A big part of our investments goes towards this area, and we’re very pleased to see the results of our investments generate revenue fairly quickly. You can see that through net new invested assets growth. You can see that through our CSM, with new business CSM growth in insurance, as well as in the actual revenue performance. This being said, I would just caution you not to annualise the numbers you’re seeing, because Q1 2023 had somewhat a subdued January in it, when mainland China and Hong Kong were still closed, so therefore you’ve seen more pickup in activity in the Q1 2023 at the back end of it, whereas we had a full proper Q1 2024, so there is an element of not annualising the performance, but expecting that performance to continue growing. I just realised I didn’t touch on your asset mix question. Look, we do not foresee a material change in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year the main growth take place in mortgages, and recognising mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in the UK and Hong Kong and the margins have been quite tight, as we start seeing pick up in wholesale demand, as we start seeing pick up in unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that those will drive higher margins than what we’ve seen in mortgages. Our numbers in Q1 did show that this pick up definitely is there in areas of Asia, south-east Asia, India, the Middle East, the UK, etc. The next in line for that pick up will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some stage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease.",False,3.0,0

Can I just dig a little bit further into Jason’s question just now on ‘higher for longer’? I know you probably don’t like to comment on longer-term NII, but in a higher-for-longer rate environment how are you thinking about the trajectory going from here? It sounds to me that deposit migration has probably stabilised a lot, and I would have thought any lower pricing that hasn’t already come through will come through in the next few months. In a higher-for-longer rate environment you can probably build more hedges at better rates as well, etc, and there’s obviously a tailwind, as you mentioned, this year already. How does that inform your thinking on your medium-term ROTE? That’s the first question. The second question, again, on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit. I guess just noting your point that Hong Kong might be the next in line to pick up, but I guess overall the Emerging Markets are probably not benefitting in terms of activity levels and in terms of capital inflows from the higher US rates. How does that impact trading activities, capital flows, etc? How are you thinking about the flip side of ‘higher for longer’?",True,4.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240502-1q-2024-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Perlie. First, yes, we recognise ‘higher for longer’ is definitely a tailwind or a reduction of a headwind we’ve forecast in our Banking NII. And as I said, there have been a number of manifestations of tailwinds now compared to when we last spoke in February, but equally it is early in the year, and, as you’ve seen, these things do change. We therefore want to bake in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing parameters. We will update longer than what we’re updating, but not at this quarter, Perlie. Do expect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future. I would say the one parameter just to keep in mind as you start planning for 2025 is to take Argentina out, because obviously subject to the sale completing – which we expect to complete in the next 12 months – that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from our Banking NII. That’s the most predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025. In terms of the broader activity level, first, if you look at the Wealth performance just demonstrates how Wealth remains very resilient, and that’s particularly true in Hong Kong, but very much so across Asia. Second, when you look at our Transaction Banking activities – apart from Foreign Exchange, which has an idiosyncrasy related to Q1 2023 with a very high volatility – has performed across the various areas of its fee-earning activities. And then our activity is very much benefitting from cross-border trends; if you look at some of the investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra-region in Asia between China and ASEAN, between India and ASEAN, between India and the west, etc, all of those trends are growing. I mean, the numbers are staggering in some cases. These are the activities that our business is operating on, so therefore we – while recognising that there will be some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels, there is still a very strong underlying network activity which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in Wholesale Transaction Banking and Wealth.",False,4.0,0

Our outbound activity from mainland China to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase in activity over the past 12 months. We’ve seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this year. A lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down, but what I would say is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up at quite a pace, a very significant pace. We’re very well placed to capture that outflow, and we are capturing that outflow. Our business in mainland China performed well last year. It’s performing well again in the first quarter of this year, and its outbound activity is performing extremely well. We’ll give more updates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that. That is why, actually, I think the rest of Asia is performing well on balance sheet, because a lot of it is being fed by good intra-Asia activity and outbound from mainland China.",False,4.0,0

The first one is on non-interest income. I look at the breakdown on non-interest income. It seems like Wealth is doing quite well, but on Transaction Banking there is some weakness. I think it’s down 9% worldwide. Can we know what is the reason? Should we triangulate this to the full year? What are the drivers to that? This is the first one. The second one is on Hong Kong. With Hong Kong relaxing LTV ratios, I think basically – not only LTV, but they relaxed the purchase requirements and the stamp duty requirements on residential properties, so I think there is a significant jump in transactions. I was thinking that this should be positive to mortgages at least, and then we are big mortgage providers in Hong Kong. Would that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth, particularly related to Hong Kong? That’s the second one. And then the last one, I think, is on cost. If I look at the first quarter I think cost is up 8%, including levy. How should I look at this? Are we on track to the 5% cost growth this year?",True,5.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240502-1q-2024-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Katherine. I’ll take questions one and three, and I’ll hand over to Noel to address your second question about the outlook for Hong Kong. First, on non-NII, Wealth has performed well. Transaction Banking weakness is specifically due to Foreign Exchange. That’s driving the whole weakness. The reason, as I called it out earlier, the reasons that Foreign Exchange had a very strong and a record strong Q1 2023 is on the back of heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis, so therefore we’re doing a comparison to a record quarter and it will show that drop, but if you look at the number itself, at the revenue itself for Foreign Exchange, it is back to normalised levels, so there is nothing to worry about here. It’s, on the contrary, back to normalised levels. We continue to expect some cyclicality in that space while we continue expecting growth in the other areas of Transaction Banking, so I wouldn’t read more than that into it. We remain very confident that the investment we’re putting both in Wealth and in Transaction Banking and in the technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain a strategic focus and are bearing results as we look into future quarters and years. On your third question about costs, first, I just want to reiterate it is a clear priority for us to maintain cost discipline. We’re very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis. We’re confident about it, and we’re actually on track to do so. The reason why we’re on track to do so yet we showed a 7% Q1 growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic items related to the quarter which are not repeated in future quarters, or some of them will reverse in future quarters. I’ll just call the three of them out that matter. First, there was a 2% accrual of the performance related pay, where we decided to phase that accrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher performance-related pay accrual in Q1, hence the 2% contribution towards the 7%, but it will contribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a full-year basis we are not accruing to a significantly different number than the full-year 2023 performance-related pay. Second, there was 1% contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter, because last year’s first quarter we only acquired SVB in the middle of March, which means we practically didn’t have it in the first quarter last year, and that’s a base effect. Third, we had the one-offs or the expected non-recurrence of the FDIC special assessment additional charge this quarter, as well as the Bank of England Levy, a new charge which used to be an interest expense in NII, and now it’s moved to operational expense, as in costs. Between the two of them they contributed to 1%. So if you adjust for those and you bake them in, we still remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year, or circa 5% on a full-year basis. On your second question I’ll hand over to Noel about Hong Kong.",False,5.0,0

Firstly, I think the change – the stamp duty arrangements in Hong Kong in March in the budget – was very well received, and it’s had a positive impact on the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong market residential sales. It was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month; that will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions of many of those developers. We have to wait and see how that stabilises, because undoubtedly there was an element of catch up in that first month because people were anticipating some change, therefore there was low activity in the preceding months. I think we’ve got to see how that stabilises, but I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance liquidity within the market, it will enhance activity in the mortgage market, but I think it’s too early to call it a trend at the moment.

Two questions, please. Firstly, on the UK NIM, you’ve seen an improvement for a second consecutive quarter, another six basis points, so outperforming some of the domestic peers. I can see your loans and deposit balances look fairly flat in that entity. Perhaps you could just comment on what you’re seeing in terms of deposit migration, mortgage re-fi, and what’s driving that NIM improvement and how sustainable you think that improvement is going forward as well? The second one is just a clarification on Argentina. You booked $0.5 billion in Q1, guiding to $1 billion for the full year based on last year’s experience. Presumably what you’re therefore saying is a step down to $0.2 billion per quarter for the remainder of the year, given that you don’t expect the transaction to necessarily close until 12 months’ time?",True,6.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240502-1q-2024-hsbc-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Andrew. The UK NIM was up six basis points indeed. It essentially benefitted from some idiosyncrasies of structural hedges and timing of structural hedge maturities and reinvestments. So if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of plus or minus 10 basis points, I would say UK NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple of quarters, and we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. You will therefore add to that broadly flat some structural hedge idiosyncrasies, which will drive you within this plus or minus 10 basis point range. Yes, our loans and deposits have been stable. Again, the UK economy has been resilient. We’re very optimistic about the outlook for the UK, specifically around inflation and employment. It remains a very important customer franchise for us, it remains a very important market for us, and we continue gaining market share. I mean, we continue gaining market share in mortgages, with a 10% new business market share. Our back book market share has moved from – or our overall portfolio market share has moved from 7% to 8%. We are 25% market share in SME lending, and obviously we continue investing in this business. You can look at the ring-fenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment growth for the ring-fenced bank within our overall circa 5% cost growth. All this demonstrates the confidence we have in our business in the UK, our clients activity in the UK and the outlook for the UK. If I move to Argentina, I wish I could give you a trend for Argentina. The way it works is the numbers balloon with hyperinflation and then they shrink with devaluation. It depends how they manifest themselves over month over month. Q4 last year has seen hyperinflation to some level, but they have seen a massive devaluation; if you recall, in December we’ve seen more than 50% currency devaluation. That’s contributed to a disinflation of the amount that Banking NII in Argentina brought to Q4, and then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We’ve seen 6% only, but we’ve seen 54% inflation, and that will just inflate the numbers. It will be volatile quarter on quarter, and our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it averaged out over last year, which is around $1 billion. Now, just looking at the overall Argentina, if you take in the non-banking NII and you take in the cost base, etc, last year’s Argentina contribution to our PBT was $0.2 billion. Just to put it in perspective, this is about one cent earnings per share or half a cent dividend per share. Therefore, I think as you look at the full-year 2024 that’s the quantum that Argentina volatility will create, so it should not distract you from the way you’re forecasting the bank’s outcomes.",False,6.0,0

I’m Fas Yousaf, Group Treasurer and I’m joined by Greg Case, Head of Debt Investor Relations, and Neil Sankoff, Global Head of Investor Relations. I’ll keep my opening remarks brief as I’m sure you’ve had a chance to go through the results already today. There is a comprehensive deck for fixed income investors available on our website and we’ll flash up a few selected slides as I talk. Once I’ve finished, we’ll go straight Today we announced a half-year reported profit before tax of 21.6 billion dollars or 18.1 billion excluding notable items. Stable versus last year. The return on average tangible equity was 17 percent, excluding notable items. We expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items, for 2024 and have today added guidance mirroring this for 2025. Significant changes have been made to our business over the last few years and during the first half we completed the sale of our Canadian, French retail, and Russian businesses, alongside progressing toward the sale of our businesses in Argentina and Armenia. This has allowed us to increase our focus on the core franchise: our scale activities in Hong Kong and the UK as well as our international wholesale transaction bank and wealth proposition. The business model continues to be strongly capital generative and in 1H24 we also benefitted from the gain on the sale of our Canadian business. Our CET1 ratio of 15 percent remains above our target operating range of 14 to 14.5 percent, and you should expect us to bring it back down to this level over time. At the mid-point of our target operating range, we will have a comfortable 300 basis point headroom above our MDA hurdle requirement. We remain conscious of where we are in the interest rate cycle. As such, we will continue to be focused on lowering our earnings sensitivity through hedging, driving growth in non-interest income and cost discipline. Banking NII of 10.9 billion dollars was down 0.4 billion versus the first quarter, largely due to the disposal of Canada. We have updated our guidance on Banking NII and now expect this to be around 43 billion dollars for 2024. The sensitivity of Banking NII to interest rates continues to reduce. A 100 basis point parallel shift down in yield curves, would reduce our Banking NII by 2.7 billion dollars based on a static balance sheet and 50% pass-through assumption. This compares to 3.4 billion at year-end, and approximately 7 billion two years ago. The reduction in sensitivity is driven by the deployment of additional hedges, current interest rates and natural changes to the mix and shape of the balance sheet. Our structural hedge increased by around 25 billion dollars in the first half to 504 billion with an overall average duration of 2.8 years. We have further improved our disclosures, allowing you to analyse the run-off profile of hedge assets during the remainder of 2024 and 2025. Over this period, we will replace around 160 billion of assets, which have an average yield of 2.8 percent. Turning to credit quality, the ECL charge for the second quarter was 0.3 billion dollars or 15 basis points as a cost of risk. The low charge was driven by recoveries and releases. Excluding these, the Q2 charge was broadly in line with our expected 30 to 40 basis point range. In the first half, the charge was 1.1 billion dollars or 22 basis points, including balances held for sale. We have updated our 2024 ECL guidance to within ‘our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. Stage 3 balances were 2.4 per cent of customer loans, up 1.4 billion dollars compared to the first quarter. This was driven by the refinancing of loans in the Hong Kong Commercial Real Estate book, which had a limited impact on the ECL charge because of the high levels of collateralisation. Our mainland China CRE book continues to reduce and generated an ECL charge of 126 million dollars in the first half. The level of net loans booked in Hong Kong has more than halved since the end of 2022, standing at 3 billion dollars, driven by repayments and maturities. Balance sheet and issuance. Now, moving on to balance sheet and issuance. As I noted earlier, our CET1 position is strong at 15%. Our MREL ratio was 31.8 percent of RWAs, broadly flat on the year-end and 4.6 percentage points above our requirement. The Group retains strong levels of liquidity with a well-diversified deposit base. We have a total deposit base of 1.6 trillion dollars, and our loan-to-deposit ratio is 59 percent. We hold almost 800 billion dollars in high-quality liquid assets and the Group LCR was broadly flat in the first half. As I’ve said before, the Group consolidated LCR is calculated using conservative assumptions. We primarily manage liquidity at the subsidiary level and our major subsidiaries all operate with LCRs that are significantly higher than the Group ratio. Finally, onto issuance. Starting with holdco senior, this year’s plan remains lower than our usual run-rate, with negative net issuance anticipated. We see gross issuance of around 10 billion dollars against maturities and calls of around 12 billion dollars. In addition, we tendered for 5 billion dollars of holdco senior in the second quarter, which will further increase the net reduction of senior holdco outstanding. We have largely completed the hold co senior issuance plan with 7.5 billion issued to date, and we aim to be largely finished towards early Autumn. In Tier 2, we expect to issue 2 to 3 billion dollars gross in 2024, against 2 billion dollars of maturities. This will be broadly half the amount we issued in 2023. So far, we’ve issued 2.5 billion dollars and we anticipate that any further issuance would likely come in relatively modest size, targeting smaller currency markets. With respect to AT1, we plan to issue around 3 billion dollars of gross AT1. We’ve issued just over 1 billion year-to-date in a very successful Singapore Dollar trade, demonstrating the strong support we enjoy from our Asian investor base. You’ll also know that we recently announced the call of our USD AT1, removing 2.25 billion dollars of AT1 from the market in September. So, wrapping up before handing off to Q&A, another strong half building on the 2023 performance. We maintain prudent capital, liquidity and funding, positions, and we have modest issuance needs in 2024. On that note, let’s open the call up for Q&A – Greg?",False,-1.0,1

So, if you'd like to ask a question over Zoom you can either raise your hand or use the Chat or Q&A functionality that should be in front of you. We have had a few pre-submitted questions so I'll start off with those while we give people an opportunity to signal for a question. We've got an anonymous question to start. So, the question is: can you give us an idea of how you think about refinancing for the remainder of this year? Is that something that you will use? And if so, could you give us an idea of what kind of products or currencies?",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-fixed-income-investors-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Faisal Yousaf,Group Treasurer,"Okay, thank you. Greg. Well, let me let me start by just recapping some of the things I said in my preliminary statements. So, in terms of where we are in the issuance plan for the year, as I said earlier circa 10 billion of senior holdco is the plan for 24. That is negative net issuance. We've got 12 billion of calls and we've tendered five so negative seven billion in total. We have probably about two or three trades left to do this year and we've done about 7.5 billion against that 10 billion target. On Tier 2 we indicated two to three billion in terms of the issuance plan. We've done two and a half at this stage. If we do something it'll probably be in small amounts in some of the non- G3 currencies. And then from an AT1 perspective we're looking to do about 3 billion in total this year of which we did one, and that was the Singapore Dollar trade earlier in the year. The real focus for me at this point is to complete that funding plan and my expectation would be, all things being equal, that we could get there by late Autumn - that that's the focus. I'm not going to rule out pre-funding, but at this stage it's not the central outcome. Just remind everyone that we have a window now to issue senior holdco in January, should we choose to. That relaxes the pressure a bit on the 2025 funding plan.",False,-1.0,1

So, we've got a question come in from Dan David at Autonomous. Dan, your line should be open to unmute yourself.",False,-1.0,1
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-fixed-income-investors-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Daniel David,Automous,"Great, thanks for the call and congratulations on the results. I've got three quick ones hopefully. The first one is just building on what you just mentioned, Fas. If I look at your MREL requirements half on half I can see they ticked up a bit. So question: just can you provide some insight on what's driven those changes in MREL, is this a trend that we should continue to see? Noting that you're a net negative issuer on MREL this year, I'm just thinking about where you want to get to longer term on MREL. Is the CET1 target headroom a reasonable expectation for MREL headroom as well? Then the second one is on Legacy. We noted that you made some pretty strong progress on Legacy, but it has stalled somewhat over the recent quarters. Can we expect you to revisit any of those Legacy positions this year? Also, does the PRA expect you to make progress in a given time frame? I'm thinking of June 25 as the next important date. Can we expect some more progress on Legacy before that date? Thanks.",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-fixed-income-investors-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Faisal Yousaf,Group Treasurer,"Okay, thank you very much Dan. I'll probably go at it in reverse order actually, so perhaps start with the Legacy. The position as it stands at the moment is that over the past couple of years we've reduced the balance by around 6 billion. It is something I'm very focused on. As I I'm sure I've said in previous calls. We want to reduce that Legacy stack in line with the Bank of England expectations but really any actions we take need to be appropriate and proportionate. So, we really do continue to look out for opportunities for further reduction, we're maintaining active dialogue with the regulators who I'd add have a full and close understanding of the position. The facts we consider in in that space really haven't changed: in no particular order we’ll look at the complexity and the options available, the economics, fair treatment to both bondholders and shareholders, and regulatory guidance as well. Where we take action, it's going to be an action that's rational to do. We are willing to take some cost obviously but we will assess the situation at each point and when opportunity arises. You mentioned as well, I think, we reach the end of the CRR grandfathering period in June 2025. And there are some of our New York issued securities which we undertook a liability management exercise on in 2022 and reduced the stack a little there, pretty much by third. A number of our core investors took part in that. I'm very much looking at that and looking at the options on that as well. At the end of June 25 there's a potential infection risk, which we have no intention of letting happen. So, we will address that issue but it’s a year away, though. There’s nothing definitive to communicate to you now and how, but we'll come back when there is. I'm going to your other questions. Perhaps I'll take question one and two together in terms of the MREL and the MREL requirements and how we think about the issuance on a go-forward basis. We have as you would have no doubt seen from our slides about 460 basis points of capacity. At the moment, we are also running above our CET1 ratio target operating level. The target operating level is 14 to 14.5, the CET1 is 15. It's our intention to get down within that target operating range and if you were to take it down to, let's say the midpoint of that range, like 14.2-14.25 that reduces the overall buffer by about 80 basis points. That's probably where I expect us to end up. We're pretty comfortable with that buffer and that range, it gives us the capacity on a go-forward basis and whilst we've been net negative issuer this year, I would say that is probably a one-off - we have typically issued on the senior side between 15 and 20 over the past four or five years and I think we're going to return to somewhere in that range going forward. Obviously subject to looking at our funding plans, loan demand, and what have you but you can see this probably is an exceptional year. I'll just check with Greg, whether there's anything you want add to that.",False,0.0,0

I just as a reminder if you do want to ask a question you can raise your hand over Zoom or submit it via the chat or the Q&A feature. So, we've had some pre-submitted questions. Firstly both Lee Street at Citi and Paul Fenner at SocGen ask a similar question on the development of Stage 3 loans. So, Lee asks can you explain the drivers of the moves in the stage three construction and real estate balances and what are your expectations going forward? And Paul adds to that, what can we expect for the NPL ratio at the group level and, and do you think that they've peaked here?",False,0.0,0

Well, most of the increase that we saw was in domestic Hong Kong commercial real estate, which was up 2.6 billion dollars in 1H24, outside of Hong Kong all the books were broadly stable. What we've seen is increase in interest rates has created a debt service challenges for some of our clients. However, if we look at Hong Kong collateral levels remain very strong and we have not seen that translate into increased ECL. As always, our main focus is on supporting our customers. My view is that the cash flow pressures will recede as interest rates start to reduce and over the long-term we're very confident in that sector and in the property market, in general in Hong Kong. You may have caught from our disclosures that we have circa 36 billion of Hong Kong commercial real estate loans. About 60% of that portfolio is secured - I think this was mentioned in the equity call earlier in the day. The collateral levels there remain strong, we have LTVs on the impaired portion of around 55% and loans rated substandard have an average LTV of 50%. On the uncollateralized portfolio these are typically loans to strong, listed commercial real estate developers who are generally members of conglomerate groups who have diverse sets of cash flows. We have seen relatively little credit deterioration, in that part of the portfolio - none of it is impaired and around, 90% are rated strong or good, which is our rating which effectively translates to investment grade or above. On NPLs more generally we don’t guide towards the NPL ratio. The ratio is an output of both inflows through the defaults and outflows through curing and write off so we're not we're not going to give explicit guidance on that.",False,0.0,0

Just picking up Paul's additional question as well so on supply… so, you’re saying you’re now expecting more senior, holdco and AT1 is that correct? If so, why? Is it because of attractive levels? Additionally, on the AT1 - what currency do you think that that could come in?",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-fixed-income-investors-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Faisal Yousaf,Group Treasurer,"Okay, thank you. So, on the senior holdco, the plan was 10 at the beginning of the year and it remains 10 at this stage so we're not increasing that at all. We're at seven and a half so we've still got a bit to do. On AT1 we are looking to do about three billion this year. As I alluded to earlier, we did a Sing trade earlier in the year, which we found of value to us and given the take-up seemed to be really appreciated by the investment community who here we are obviously thankful to. So, this is a space where we think there is good mutual value, given the current levels that we're at and which we're willing to explore further. It works for us, it works for the investors. So we'll we'll look to do a bit more. As you know, over the past four or five years, we have run down the overall quantum of our AT1. If I recall correctly back in 2019, it was about 26 billion and now it's around 19 billion. I think we're now much more in the cycle of replacing as we go and maintaining that stack.",False,0.0,0

We have adjusted that guidance ever so slightly to be circa 10 billion. I think that's very much within the context of what you've seen us do in Q2 in particular where you'll recall that we tended for five billion dollars of senior holdco. So, yes, the guidance has changed ever so slightly, but that is in the context of even further, negative supply versus what we'd guided to at the start of the year. So, just for another flag in case anybody does want to ask questions on the line. Please do raise your hand via the Zoom function but we do have a couple additional submitted questions to get through. Another anonymous one for you, Fas - on ESG issuance.

As I think the audience will know we published our Net Zero Transition Plan at the start of the year, that's available on our website and I'd direct you to that. It's a comprehensive document in terms of our plans going forward. What we're doing at the moment is currently refreshing our programs and framework to align to emerging best practise. Our main priority is really to continue to improve the Group’s overall ESG credentials, and we recognise, we have an important role to play in in that transition, especially given our footprint.

Okay, so the first thing to say is that there's no security that we have with the six month call window for a little while. I think the first one is around 2028. We recognise at the moment that there's not a consistent set of market practises. My expectation is that it will evolve and that the market will converge or align and from our perspective we would then want to align to that practise as well. Obviously subject to internal governance and what have you. I'm quite happy to engage bilaterally with individuals that want to bring up that topic and talk about it. The six month window is new for AT1s, and we mirrored some of the other market participants that introduced this, the idea was really that the larger window may give sufficient time for uneconomic calls to become more economic versus spot and for organisations to be able to call but I do understand that it causes difficulty for some investors in terms of in terms of their own hedging and planning purposes.

Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Good morning to everyone in London and good afternoon to those joining from Hong Kong. Today is my last results announcement before Georges takes over in September. I’m delighted to be handing the stewardship of the bank over to him. Georges is an exceptional leader who understands what makes HSBC special. I’d like to thank my colleagues around the world for everything they’ve done over the last five years, and I wish Georges every success for the future. I have always been immensely proud of the heritage of this bank and the strategic role it plays in the world, but when I took this job on five years ago we didn’t have the financial performance to match our standing. My aim was to change that. I believe we’ve done so, and created a strong platform for future growth. This was evidenced by the record profit performance last year and by the strong first-half performance this year. Revenue of $37.3 billion was up 1%. Profit before tax of $21.6 billion was stable on the same period last year. This performance enabled continued strong capital generation. Our return on tangible equity was 17%, excluding notable items. We’ve announced $4.8 billion of further capital distributions today; this takes the total capital we have distributed by way of dividends and buybacks in respect of the last 18 months to $34.4 billion. Finally, we’ve updated our guidance to reflect our increased confidence about the future. We’re providing new guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, in addition to the 2024 guidance we already had. We’re upgrading our 2024 banking NII guidance from ‘at least $41 billion’ to ‘around $43 billion’. We’re revising our 2024 ECL guidance to be back within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points, and we’re reconfirming our 2024 cost guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. That’s despite growth of 7% in the first half, which – as Georges will explain – is mainly due to timing differences compared to last year. The benefits of our strategy execution over the last five years are evident in our performance. Before getting into detail on further progress made over the last six months, please allow me to share some reflections on our five-year journey. When we set out, there were two key strategies to delivering higher returns. The first thing we had to do was to reshape our portfolio. Building on the work of my predecessors who initiated important structural changes, we’ve continued to exit businesses and client portfolios that were non-strategic, subscale and unprofitable. First, via organic portfolio reductions, which delivered RWA savings of around $128 billion, and then via inorganic means through disposals. The second and very important strategy, which we commenced at the same time, was to build alternative sources of revenue growth. Within this, we’ve invested to grow fee income, particularly in areas where we have significant strengths, such as Wholesale Transaction Banking and Wealth. We’ve also continued to invest in our differentiated international propositions; we’ve significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates from approximately $7 billion of banking NII for a 100 basis points down-shock in interest rates at 30 June 2022, to around $3.4 billion at the end of 2023, and now down to around $2.7 billion today. All of this had to be underpinned by a culture of cost discipline, which we have instilled across the group. These savings enabled us to invest in the areas I’ve spoken about, and this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance. As you know, we delivered a record profit in 2023, and a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2023 and in the first half of 2024. It has been over 15 years since the group was generating returns at current levels, and we now expect to sustain it this year and in 2025. The other tangible measure of success is capital distributions to our shareholders. I’m really pleased that we delivered around $54 billion by way of dividends and buybacks to our shareholders over the last five years, including the distributions announced today. I’m especially pleased to have paid the special dividend of 21 cents per share earlier this year, following the sale of HSBC Canada. I see this payment not just as a financial return, but as a return for the loyalty that our shareholders have shown us over the recent years. Let me now summarise the further progress evidence in the first half. First, Wealth has been a key component of revenue diversification strategy. It’s delivered two very good quarters, growing revenue by 12% in total. In transaction banking, Fee and other income in Global Payments Solutions grew by 4%, and in Global Trade Solutions by 1%, in a very difficult environment for trade. Revenue for HSBC Innovation Banking was up 4% quarter on quarter as our new global proposition continues to gain traction. Second, our scale markets in Hong Kong and the UK enabled us to grow profits each year as we captured new opportunities in both the corporate and retail businesses. As you can see, we also have positive growth in other markets, including India, which was up 4% in the first half, and Singapore, which was up 2%. Third, we continue to grow multi-jurisdictional client revenue in both wholesale and retail. Fourth, we saw good growth in both customer lending and deposits in the second quarter, despite what is still a relatively sluggish environment. Finally, we’ve continued to grow the size and duration of the structural hedge to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate movements. Georges has new disclosures on the expected benefits in his section. All of this progress underlines why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity this year and in 2025 as well. Let me get into some more detail. The steps we’ve taken to change our retail business model and our continued investment in people and digitisation have made Wealth the key driver of revenue growth. Wealth revenue was up 12% in the first half to $4.3 billion, and that growth is broad-based. As you can see in the boxes on the right side of the slide, Wealth Fee and other income was up 14%. Private Banking revenue was up 16%. We attracted $32 billion of net new invested assets, and new business insurance CSM was up 77%. Moving to the next topic, transaction banking revenue was stable in the first half. There was good growth in payments, which was up 3%. This included growth in Fee and other income of 4%. This is a result of the investment we’ve made to grow and digitise that business, which helped to improve our ranking from a top four bank in 2022 to number two today. Foreign Exchange was down 8% compared to a strong performance last year, when there was very high volatility. While trade was slightly down in the half, the pace of decline slowed to the point that it was broadly flat in the second quarter, but we still grew our trade volumes, despite global trade volumes remaining subdued. We also increased our market share in trade in Hong Kong to more than 26%. On the next topic, our businesses in Hong Kong and the UK both continue to perform well in the first half. Profit before tax in Hong Kong was up 1% on a constant currency basis. While the Hong Kong corporate loan market remains subdued, it was resilient in the second quarter. It’s too early to call it a trend, but deposits and investment activity increased, which underlines that the rate differential works in both directions. We attracted 345,000 new-to-bank customers in the half, as we continue to capitalise on significant inflows into Hong Kong from customers seeking opportunities for investment. Profit before tax in the UK business grew by 11%, excluding the gain on SVB UK last year. Customer lending was also up 2%, but our UK business is differentiated by its connectivity with the rest of the group. In the first half we grew the number of UK international customers by 8% to 2.7 million customers. We have a strong international franchise. We evidenced this through our multi-jurisdictional revenue disclosures in February, and in the first half we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 4% to $9.7 billion. As I said earlier, this isn’t just a wholesale story. We’re doing more with our International Retail and Wealth customers as well; we now have seven million International Wealth and Personal Banking customers, with revenue from these customers up 6% to $5.4 billion. These are the levers that have put us on track to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity this year, and why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025. With that, I’ll hand over to Georges. Thank you.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Noel, and hello everyone. Before I get to the Q2 numbers I’d like to comment briefly on the recent announcement. I’m deeply honoured by the trust placed in me to lead this great institution into Although I don’t take over as Group Chief Executive until 2 September from Noel, I’m ready to share a few high-level thoughts. Under Noel’s leadership we have delivered financial performance and built a strong platform for growth. The strategy of the group is working, and I’m committed to building on this. The shape of the group is broadly where we want it to be, with the bulk of our capital and other resources deployed in our four scale activities, that’s Hong Kong, the UK, our international wholesale bank underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities, and our wealth proposition, particularly in Asia. This puts us in a very strong position. In each of these activities we have scaled and sustainable competitive advantages, and our strengths are aligned to the needs of our customers. They account for the vast majority of the economic profit we generate today, and present some of our most exciting opportunities to grow over the next five to ten years. Together they are capable of delivering above cost of capital returns sustainably through the cycle. We’ve made good progress, and we are now in a position to accelerate the pace of execution of the strategy with focus and intensity, to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, to improve operating leverage while maintaining strong cost discipline and prudent risk management, and to continue to improve client service and experience. You’ll also have seen that we have announced this morning that Jon Bingham has been appointed Interim Group CFO from 2 September. Jon’s currently our Financial Controller, and has outstanding technical accounting and regulatory knowledge and expertise. The process to identify the next permanent Group CFO is underway, and I will update you further in due course. Turning to Q2 in summary, profit before tax of $8.9 billion was up $0.4 billion on the second quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis. In terms of the drivers, the banking NII run rate was stable on the first quarter. There was another strong Wealth performance, while Wholesale Transaction Banking was stable on last year’s second quarter. Despite cost growth of 7% in the first half on the target basis, we remain on track to meet our 2024 guidance of around 5% cost growth, and there was growth in both loans and deposits in the quarter. On the next slide, HSBC Canada contributed around $0.5 billion of revenue and around $0.2 billion of profit before tax in the quarter before the sale completed in March. To make like-for-like comparisons easier, these contributions and some other impacts have been excluded from some of the commentary. Excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions, profit before tax was up 7% to $9.1 billion. Revenue of $16.5 billion was up $0.3 billion on the second quarter of last year. Excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions, revenue was up $0.8 billion – or 5% – on the second quarter of last year. Banking NII of $10.9 billion was down $0.4 billion on the first quarter on a reported FX basis, primarily because of a $0.3 billion reduction from the Canada sale. Excluding this, the banking NII run rate was stable. We’re now in a position to upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance to ‘around $43 billion’. This assumes a $1 billion contribution from Argentina, which was its reported NII in 2023, although we note that it remains volatile and difficult to predict. We’re also providing new details to help you understand the expected benefits from the structural hedge. Around $55 billion of assets are due to mature in the second half of 2024 with an average yield of 2.8%, and around $105 billion of assets will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8% as well. Turning to Fee and other income, Wholesale Transaction Banking was stable on the second quarter of last year, or up 2% excluding the impact of strategic transactions. Within this, Global Payments Solutions had another good quarter, up 2%, as did Securities Services, which was up 3%. Foreign Exchange delivered broadly stable revenue compared to a strong quarter last year. Wealth had another very good quarter, underlying that our investment is continuing to drive improved results. Wealth Fee and other income was up by 13% compared to last year’s second quarter. Private Banking was a standout performer, mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia. Growth in Wealth remained broad-based. Customer growth and improved wealth penetration, primarily in Asia, helped drive growth in investment distribution. Invested assets were up 2% to $1.3 trillion, including $6 billion of net new invested assets in the quarter. Our new insurance business, CSM, was $0.6 billion, up $0.2 billion on the second quarter of last year. On credit, expected credit losses were $0.3 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 15 basis points of average loans. This included $0.4 billion of recoveries and other items mentioned on the slide. Excluding these, ECLs were broadly in line with our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. Stage three balances were 2.4% of customer loans, up $1.4 billion compared to the first quarter. This was driven by the Hong Kong commercial real estate book, but there was a limited impact on ECL charge because of the high level of collateralisation. We are revising our 2024 ECL guidance to our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points of average loans. Next, costs grew by 7% in the first half on a target basis, but we remain on track to meet our guidance of 2024 cost growth of around 5%. Two percentage points of cost growth in the first half came from higher performance-related pay accrual and levies. As we explained at the first quarter, we have phased the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than last year. We do not expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be materially different to 2023, so the accrual in the second half is expected to be lower year on year. In addition, the second half of last year included $0.3 billion of levies that we do not expect to repeat this year. We are therefore reconfirming our guidance of around 5% cost growth for 2024 on a target basis, and we remain committed to cost discipline. On lending and deposits, there was positive loan growth in the quarter in both the UK and Asia, while Hong Kong was broadly stable. Overall, there were promising signs in the first half. Deposits were up 2%, with the majority of this in Hong Kong. There was also growth in the UK, Europe and the US, and the rest of Asia, but it also included the benefits of seasonality in Commercial Banking, and a large one-off in Global Banking and Markets, so I would encourage you not to annualise the 2% figure. Next, our CET1 ratio was 15%, down 20 basis points on the first quarter, as strong organic capital generation was offset by distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We have announced a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we expect to complete within three months and to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points on our CET1 ratio in the third quarter. Finally, to recap, our strong first half performance and our confidence about the bank’s position enable us to provide new guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items, for 2025, in addition to our existing mid-teens guidance for 2024; upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance from ‘at least $41 billion’ to ‘around $43 billion’; revise our 2024 ECL guidance to within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points; and reconfirm our guidance for 2024 cost growth of around 5% on a target basis and a mid single-digit loan growth over the medium term. With that, Louise, can we please go to Q&A? Thank you.",False,-1.0,1

I have a couple of questions from my side – one big picture, one into the numbers. First the big picture question. Noel, you highlighted all the things you can be proud of during your tenure, but perhaps with the benefit of hindsight, I would be interested in any thoughts you had on anything you might have done differently. And then linked to that as well, Georges, I think you were on the tape this morning talking about accelerating the existing execution, so any tangible examples you can provide on that would be helpful as well. Then in terms of the numbers question, thank you for the additional disclosure around the structural hedge. I think you talked about $55 billion maturing in the second half at a 2.8% yield. Is it fair to assume that the new position that you’re putting on is probably about 1% higher than that, given where the forward curve is? Prior to any offset from adding to the existing structural hedge, notional it’s about $0.5 billion of NII uplift. Is that fair?",False,-1.0,1

I’ll take the first one. I’ve got no regrets, Andrew. Performing this role is an absolute privilege. You never finish with an institution like this, and that is why Georges is right to comment that you always want to do more. There are always things you want to improve; there’s always investment you can do to grow more revenue, to improve customer experience, improve systems and processes. So, there’s never a notion of finishing; it should always be a notion of continuous improvement and continuous ambition. I think that’s probably the bridge from me to Georges, because I have no regrets about the last five years. I think we’ve done a lot of good things, and I thank my colleagues for everything they’ve done, but equally you should never be complacent and think the job is finished. The job of running an organisation as large as ours and with so much opportunity before us to further improve is never finished, and that’s the bridge over to Georges now to take it on to the next level and to continue to execute the strategy.

Just echoing Noel and building on that, we’ve called out some of the key areas of our strategy. I’ve called out Hong Kong, the UK, the international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by leading transaction banking capabilities, as well as Wealth, all of which have demonstrated very strong momentum, certainly over the last few years but definitely over the first half of this year. We’re confident about the momentum. We’re confident in our ability to continue investing in them, and we’re confident also we have ample capital to support additional growth. So, it’s just about getting continued pace in the execution of this strategy that has proved its results. On your question about the structural hedge, Andrew, $55 billion are expected to mature over the course of the second half at an average yield of 2.8%. If I try to reverse-engineer your maths, and if you assume the reinvestment happens at around 3.8% with a 1% uplift, then you get $500 million, but remember this is maturities that are happening over the course of the half. Therefore, I think you have to average the number, and therefore you have to assume half the number as an in-year 2024 benefit from that structural hedge reinvestment, so say the half of your $0.5 billion you quoted. Also, bear in mind that we are increasing the structural hedge, subject to market conditions. We have done about $25 billion the first half. It’s a good estimate of the run rate for the second half, and that is a mild headwind because we’re increasing the hedge from higher short-term rates into lower longer-term rates due to the inversion of the curve, so you have to take all of this into consideration when factoring in the impact for 2024 banking NII.",False,-1.0,1

First, I was a bit surprised to get the 2025 profitability target, which does seem to be a little bit above consensus. I think consensus is about 14%, so I guess a bit of variation on mid-teens, but if that’s 15, 16, 17%, I’m just curious where you see a bit more upside. Is that mainly on the revenues or can you see a bit more cost control? And then linked to that, Georges, I think in your comments as well you talked about growing revenues on a sustainable basis – just curious again how you’re thinking about that, potentially with some NII headwinds. And then, lastly, Noel, I think you used the term ‘sluggish’ or ‘subdued’ a few times when talking about the environment – just curious when you think that will potentially turn and we can see a more constructive environment for some of those markets.

If you adjust consensus for 2025 for the impact of the loss from the sale of Argentina, which, by the way, as we communicated, now we expect by the end of the year, therefore it’s more reasonable to assume that the recycling of the foreign exchange loss of $5 billion, which has no impact on capital or on distribution – it’s fair to assume that impact will happen in 2024, but if you adjust the consensus in 2025, you get to around 14%. Our definition of mid-teens is broadly around 14% to 16%, so without commenting on the consensus, our mid-teens definition is broadly that 14% to 16% range. On the growing revenue on a sustainable basis, let me point you to three major indicators that are going to be important in the way we look at the future. The first one is related to banking NII. Banking NII, firstly, has been stabilised partly with the reduction of banking NII sensitivity. If you recall, two years ago we called out $7 billion to be the impact on banking NII or on our revenue for a 100-basis-point drop in interest rates. That number at the year-end was $3.4 billion, and that number as we reported it now is $2.7 billion, so therefore, through activities of structural hedging, but also through other methodology improvements and balance sheet composition, we have reduced the dependency of our earnings and of our banking NII to the impact of lower rates. The second component, again relating to banking NII, is that, while for a few quarters we have seen subdued loan growth, in particular in the UK and Hong Kong wholesale markets, we have now seen stabilisation. It’s early to call it a trend, but we are encouraged by the stabilisation we have observed, and importantly we will be more encouraged to, when we see rates coming off in the support they can have for loan growth, in particular in these two areas that historically have been a little bit more sluggish – other parts of our activity remained resilient. Loan growth in south and southeast Asia remained very strong. Loan growth in the mortgage businesses in the UK and Hong Kong remained very strong, so there is a volume component to banking NII, which we supported, and as you can see from our capital, we have ample capacity to support loan growth. The third component I would call out is the non-banking NII part of our earnings, Fees and other income, in particular Wholesale Transaction Banking and Wealth. You’ve seen the momentum in these businesses. You’ve seen the continued investment we’ve put in these businesses. We believe these momentums are sustainable. There’s an underlying sustainable trend supporting Wealth, in particular in Asia, and there’s an additional support through our own investments, both technology and people relationship management-related, to support growth in this area, and we believe the momentum is sustainable. Those are the broadly three components that we believe will sustain our earnings as we look into the future.",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Amit, just to come to a little bit more elaboration on the ‘sluggish’ and ‘subdued’, I’m not surprised that the corporate loan market is a bit subdued at the moment. I think it’s right for that to be the case because, in the higher interest-rate environment, not many corporates out there want to borrow at today’s interest rates, and actually they’ve still got a lot of cash sitting on their balance sheet. They don’t need to borrow, which is a good position to be in, but as you see interest rates come down, I would expect there to be a pick-up in activity. Like Georges just said, we’re starting to see the very early signs of that starting to emerge. It’s very early. It’s too early to call it a trend, but I was pleased that the rate of decline in the corporate lending book in Hong Kong in Q1 reduced dramatically. It had been declining through 2023, and it actually plateaued in the Q2, and that’s in Hong Kong. Then in the rest of Asia, we saw a growth in Q1 and Q2, and in the rest of the world we saw growth in Q1 and Q2. Q1 was the first time we saw net growth in corporate lending. Q2 we saw net growth as well, so I think it’s encouraging early signs as interest rates come off. I see that happening. The other thing is you’ve also got to remember there’s another side to the Hong Kong market. The deposit market and the investment market is very strong, as you saw in our Wealth businesses. The net new invested assets going into the business in the first half of this year was about $34 billion, if I remember correctly, and as rates come off, cash moves into invested assets, and I think we’re a beneficiary of that, particularly in Hong Kong, where rate differentials are playing strongly into the investment market, whereas the rate differentials are subduing the demand for loans in the Hong Kong market. But the rate differential is working in the opposite direction on investments.",False,0.0,0

Just a couple of quick things – so on the ROTE guidance, if you look, in the first half of the year you’ve done an underlying number of 17%, you’ve had a few credit headwinds, but generally benign. If you think about things like cash moving into invested assets, which should be higher ROE, your Wealth and Personal Banking ROE is around 31% at the moment; you’re doing about a 22% UK ROE. What would hold you back from maintaining that level in 2025 and 2026, not withstanding some rate cuts? Because it seems like there’s a lot more flex in your business model. I know you need to be conservative, but is it rates that would hold you back – lack of activity?",True,1.0,0

I think it is too early to call a return to volume growth in the corporate loan market in substantial proportions. I think we all expect the rates to come off and cash to move from cash to invested assets. I think it’s still a bit early in the cycle. There’s a lot of uncertainty still out there, and given our guidance of mid-teens, which is somewhere between 14% and 16%, is fair at this point in time. I think that the most important thing we’ve tried to do over the past few years is deliver each quarter and let each quarter be the base for the future, so it’s better to set reasonable and sensible guidance and then we continue to evidence progress against that as quarter by quarter goes.

I was just trying to dig into some of your commentary around the hedge. I’ve got two questions. The first one is: I’m just trying to understand how the notional size of the hedge is changing in the UK versus the rest of the world. My understanding was that the structural hedging in the UK was quite a mature book, so I wouldn’t have expected that to increase in size going forward. When we think about the rest of the world, it looks like your structural hedging was more recent so there’s probably scope to increase that, but maybe the refinancing yield is a bit higher. Is that the right understanding, first question? The second question is just coming to the Hong Kong CRE book and some of the disclosure you’ve called out there. I think $36 billion of total exposure. 40% of that is unsecured. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more additional colour around the unsecured part of Hong Kong CRE. I think you said it’s very good quality, but how you look to manage the risks, given the unsecured nature of this CRE book. Thank you.",True,2.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"So, Raul, on the hedge size, we haven’t given the specific currency split to balance sheet split, but, yes, you should assume that the sterling component is one of the largest components in terms of the hedge size, and the UK, therefore the sterling component, is one of the most mature by way of size of hedge, but there is obviously still our previous hedges struck at lower yields maturing, and we’re able to benefit from the reinvestment of maturing hedges at higher yields. That was still a component in the UK bank’s NIM, which has been broadly stable, and we expect to remain broadly stable, and the structural hedge reinvestment is playing a role in that. With regards to the rest of the world, it’s a story of two tales. There’s the reinvestment of old structural hedges at higher yields, and that is a tailwind in our banking NII. There is also additional hedges we’re doing, where we can, and these additional hedges are suffering from – this is a partial offset as a headwind because they’re suffering from the fact that curves are inverted, but it’s still the right thing to do for the management of our banking NII sensitivity. And then obviously always keep in mind that the Hong Kong dollar exposure we have remains largely under-hedged, and that’s due to the fact that the structure of the market does not give us enough insurance to be able to invest in the long term to support hedging. So, the Hong Kong dollar will remain structurally under-hedged in that sense. With regards to the Hong Kong CRE question, so 40% of the book, of the $36 billion you mentioned, is unsecured. It is typically exposure to large conglomerates with a diversified revenue stream, including revenue streams from activities not related to real estate. 90% of that book today is rated strong and good, and literally 0% is in the impaired category. We’re very comfortable over the exposure we have in that book, and we continue, obviously, supporting our customers through the cycle in this space.",False,2.0,0

My first question is on non-interest income. If my maths is correct, my calculation shows that our adjusted non-interest income is $5.8 billion this quarter compared to $5.3 billion a year ago, and we had $200 million growth on loans. Transaction banking is relatively stable, so it seems GBM contributed a lot this quarter. So, I understand that this business has seasonality and is volatile, but do you expect that momentum to continue going forward or do you think the second half of last year is a relatively weak comparison? The second question is a broader one because I realised now you speak less about focusing on Asia these days than you used to and emphasising more on the global network. Yes, sometimes in some ways they do intersect, but I’m wondering do you still focus on exploring some growth opportunities in Asia and Wealth business in the future and do you have a capital distribution hierarchy and preference among dividends, buy-backs and growth?

Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Very good. Jeremy, so without giving you quarter-by−quarter specifics in the development of our fees and other income component, the growth that you’ve observed year on year in Q2 were mainly driven by two areas. The first one is Wealth, which is obviously a very strategic area where we continue to invest and exhibited growth. The other one was from markets, in particular from some of the equity business in markets. This is coming on the basis of two components: one, a subdued Q2 last year – so there was a base effect which benefited the outlook for Q2 this year; and then the second one is the fact that we’ve seen more activity and more vigorousness, if you want, in the Asian stock markets, in particular the Hong Kong stock market. We’re encourage by this, and, if the trend continues, this will bode well for additional activity in this space. Let me jump to the third question and then I’ll hand over to Noel to conclude on the second one. Capital distribution hierarchy – first, we’ve committed to 50% dividend payout ratio for this year, which means half our earnings will be earmarked for the foreseeable dividends. Part of it will be distributed through our interim dividends; the rest will be meted out at the end of the year. After that we obviously will use capital to support the organic growth of our business. Loan growth, as we said earlier, started to pick up in certain areas. We are encouraged – or we have ample capital to support the loan growth, the appetite we have. We will look at bolt-on acquisitions or areas that are dead-on strategy but supportive of acceleration of the strategy. That will be part of the utilisation of excess capital, and any excess beyond that we will distribute back to shareholders through a rolling series of share buy-backs. If you look at our CET1 ratio today, at 15%, and you look at our capital accretion – we remain capital generative in the business based on the guidance we’ve given for this year and next year – we’re confident we will have capacity to deliver on the three. I will say the buy-backs – we’ll continue looking at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis with the ambition to have a rolling series of share buy-backs.",False,3.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"Thanks, Jeremy, and on your second question, is it an Asian strategy? Is it an international strategy? I think they’re interchangeable. I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive because, if you look at what we do, at the core of what we’ve done for 158 years, or more is we’ve connected entrepreneurs and businesses who want to trade with the world. That’s what we’ve done from day one of HSBC being founded. So, we’re essentially about helping businesses and individuals trade internationally, invest internationally. Now, why are they one and the same? Well, a huge amount of the entrepreneurs that we have as clients are based in Asia; they’re based in the Middle East. They’re based in the East, and they trade with the West, and the West trades with the East. Asia and the Middle East are high growth markets. So, I don’t think it’s an either/or. I think for us it’s very simple: we’re internationally driven, and Asia is a hugely connected international part of the world and will remain so going forward. The nature of trade will change, as it has done for 158 years. So, I think we use the words ‘Asia’ and ‘international’ probably interchangeably and sometimes it gets people confused. We’re investing where there is growth and where we have differentiation. There is growth; there is international connectivity; there is differentiation in Asia and there is in the Middle East, and we have the same here in the UK.

And Georges, on a similar theme, I just want to extend my congratulations around your appointment as CEO. I had two questions, please, both on net interest income. So, a point of clarification – I guess your banking NII guide this year of circa $43 billion at face value does imply a material step-off in net interest income in H2. I just wanted to check – you’re guiding for Argentina being $1 billion this year, and I think it was the best part of $900 million in H1. So, is it literally just Argentina dropping out of net interest income in H2 that’s driving that? And what would really, really help is the momentum of NII in H2 and the extent to which that carries over into 2025. I’m not necessarily looking for an updated guide here, but, if I just take again your banking NII disclosure at face value, it’s implying a $42 billion annualised run rate in H2, ex-Argentina. What do you think the puts and takes are on that, if we were to look a bit further afield beyond this year? And then the second question was if I could just get you to update your thoughts around deposit pass-throughs. You’re obviously noting you’ve hedged more of your balance sheet now, and what if actually pass-throughs were to be, say, 10% lower than what you’re modelling in your updated banking and NII sensitivity? That would be really helpful. Thank you very much.",True,4.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Aman, thank you. So, on your first question, look, around $43 billion banking NII for this year is a reasonable expectation, and we’re more confident about it because we’re already seven months into the year, and somewhat the forward rate outlook has become a bit less volatile than we’ve experienced over the last few months. Argentina, we have worked with a planning assumption of $1 billion, so within our around $43 billion we’ve factored in around $1 billion contribution from Argentina. It is a very difficult-to-predict number; it is a very volatile number; and therefore, the best estimate – you can use around $42 billion and add whatever other expectations you may have for Argentina, but we’re sticking with this $1 billion estimate in the uncertainty. Just for reference, $1 billion was the banking NII contribution of Argentina in 2023, and this is how we’re building the assumption for planning for this year. Now, if you look forward for H2, headwinds and tailwinds facing the banking NII – the first one to call out is the rates outlook. We’re using the mid-July curves, which comprise broadly between one and two rate cuts across all the major currencies in the second half. This is the working assumption. The second one is on the structural hedge so, as we called out earlier, you should expect a benefit from the $55 billion maturing assets in 2H at 2.8% yields which will be reinvested at higher yields, at the prevailing yields in H2, which will be higher. You can take a five-year rate as a good benchmark for what rates will be invested at. But this is partly offset by the additional structural hedging we are likely to do on an inverted curve. Again, here your best guide is what we’ve done in H1. $25 billion of additional structural hedging is a reasonable run rate to expect for H2, but it will depend on market conditions in H2. The other components that are playing as headwinds and tailwinds are the balance sheet growth. Balance sheet growth – we continue to see strong growth in South and Southeast Asia. We continue to see resilience in the mortgage books in the UK and Hong Kong, but we are now encouraged to see stability in the Hong Kong wholesale book, which has been on a decline for a few quarters. It’s early to call it a trend, but it is definitely green shoots when we look forward, and it will be supported with rate reductions, the balance sheet growth in this space. And then the last one to call out is deposit migration. That’s particularly true in Hong Kong. Again Q1, Q2 we’ve seen migration at 0% and 1% respectively, which is 1% overall on the half. Just to put it in perspective, this is after full-year 2023 where we’ve seen 12%. So, again, the trend here is much more encouraging. We’re very unlikely to see anywhere near the trend of last year, but it remains a difficult one to predict. Now, as you look forward into the full year 2025, we’re not guiding on banking NII, but a few points for you to bear in mind. The first one is please remove Argentina’s contribution – again, working assumption $1 billion. This is following the planned sale of Argentina to take place before the end of the year. Second, remove the one-quarter contribution from Canada, $0.3 billion, in your NII. Then we’ve shared that there will be $105 billion of existing structural hedge assets which will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8%, so those will provide some tailwind as we reinvest them at higher yield. So, beyond that you can apply your own interest rate assumptions on the banking NII sensitivity we provided. $2.7 billion is the sensitivity we provided across all currencies for a 100-basis point drop, and you can apply your balance sheet growth assumption and, again, we believe lower rates will be more supportive of a growth in balance sheet when you look into 2025, but basically all of that is factored into our guidance for return on tangible equity for 2025 at mid-teens.",False,4.0,0

So, we can work out the maths, if you want, offline. That number is broadly stable. We’re still working on an assumption of a 50% pass-through in our banking NII sensitivity. Second, if you look at the cumulative pass-throughs, we’re broadly around 50% from the start of the rate hikes in late 2022 all the way to now, broadly around 50%. The earlier part was much lower than 50%; the latter part was much higher than 50%. It is difficult to predict how pass-throughs will work out on the rate-cut scenario, and this is why I think 50% remains a good estimate of what it could look like, noting that we don’t have a recent history of that. I would point you to one thing to be mindful of: in the UK and a number of other geographies we will have to provide customer notice of at least 60 days before we pass through rate cuts, so there will be a delay in pass-throughs on the way down, and that’s 60 to 90 days on average, for instance, in the UK.

My two questions were – the first one was could you tell me – you’ve probably disclosed it somewhere and I’ve missed it, but performance-related pay – I see you’re assuming that’s going to be flat this year. Is it possible to tell us what the total quantum of that is? Because I guess there must be some potential that that may have to go up, particularly given the revenue performance. So that would be my first question. And then the second one was, to me, if I look at these results, I guess the standout to me was the performance in Q2 of the Wealth and Private Banking business. If I look in the past, it’s generally been quite seasonal in Q2, but it seems that actually it’s held up pretty flat. So, should we expect that – is that a new base level of run rate? Is that something that should continue into the second half now and then grow on from there or was there something about Q2 which held it up better than we might have expected? Thanks very much.",True,5.0,0

And on your second point on Wealth – I’ll give a very personal comment – you normally expect Q1 to be the seasonal high and then it to be a bit lower in Q2 and a bit lower. So actually, Q2 did exceed expectations in terms of seasonality. It was a strong quarter. At the moment I – again, we tend to be a bit on the conservative side and say, ‘Don’t base a trend on a quarter or two’, but I think your assessment that actually Q2 was a strong performance is exactly where we are. It was stronger than probably one would have expected through normal seasonality. I think it is – if I talk to the team, they were confident of a good performance. They’d seen good lead indicators. We’ve taken in in excess of $250 billion of net new invested assets just over the last two and a half years, and we haven’t seen this period where ‘How will cash move from cash to invested assets as interest rates come off?’ And therefore, I think it is difficult to predict a trend. I think we’ve just got to see it go quarter by quarter, but the lead indicators are good; we’ve invested in the business over the last few years to put us in this position. It was all about getting ready for lower interest rates and being in a position to take advantage of it. We invested heavily in the product line-up for our clients to make sure that, if they were going to move into invested assets, they could do so with us rather than another bank. We invested in distribution. We had good distribution in Hong Kong, but we didn’t have as good a distribution in other markets, so we built out distribution in mainland China, in Singapore, in India and in the rest of the world. So, I think it’s put us in a good position to take advantage of it, but it’s too early to call it a trend. But your observation is a fair observation for Q2. It was good, and it’s nice to be able to report that. On performance-related pay and costs, I’ll let Georges cover that, but we’re absolutely committed to the 5%.",False,5.0,0

This is disclosed in our annual reports and accounts, but, if you look at how we accrued for that number through the year in 2023, we actually under-accrued in the first quarter 2023 and then we topped it up at the fourth quarter to get to that total number. When you look at full year 2024, we are accruing towards a broadly similar number for the full year than for the full year 2023. Any decision on performance-related pay will take place in January with the Remuneration Committee after the full year’s performance has been delivered, but we are accruing broadly to the same number. The difference is that we’re accruing more evenly. So this is why you’ll see a higher accrual, on a year-on-year basis, in the first half and you will be seeing a lower accrual in the second half on that trajectory.

Thanks for answering my questions. I have two, both related to capital. On the capital side, we saw there is $6.4 billion of additions to RWAs. May I know what is that related to? I think in the notes it’s something related to modelling so I would like to know what assumption changes leads to this $6.4 billion and is that a one-off or should we see this as an ongoing addition to the RWA? Number two, we noticed some deterioration in asset quality on the Hong Kong CRE book. According to the disclosures, the deterioration seems quite significant as well. Can you explain to us what is the impact on capital? Because we understand that there is limited impact on ECL charges but mainly reflected on capital. So, what is the drag on capital? And then also, going forward, what is your view on Hong Kong CRE, in particular for the loans which are already in the stage 3 categories? Are you expecting that there will be a recovery of loans through disposal of collateral or are you expecting that the borrowers will eventually make up for the loans? Thank you.",True,6.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks. Katherine, on capital, we’ve indicated a $6.4 billion increase in RWAs due to modelling adjustment. To be specific, we’ve adjusted the probability of default models for banks globally, and the reason we adjusted this probability of default model for banks is because we wanted to factor in some of the observations and learnings from the March 2023 crisis in the way governments have supported a bank resolution. That’s specifically true for the US and Switzerland. We’ve taken those learnings; we’ve baked them in our modelling; and this resulted in this additional RWA. In so far that bank models for probability of default, etc, are concerned, we consider this to be done. If you ask me, while we continuously look at our models in a general fashion, the next big model update is going to be Basel 3.1, as and when Basel 3.1 becomes live in the various geographies or jurisdictions where we operate. We have not indicated the impact, which we do not expect to be material. We’re waiting to see some of the final rules that are still missing in a number of jurisdictions before we can call out the exact impact to the market, but we don’t expect it to be material. In terms of Hong Kong CRE, we’ve spoken earlier about the 40% that is unsecured, with which we remain very comfortable, so your question probably relates to the other 60%, which is the secured portfolio of our $36 billion exposure. So of this about $3.2 billion are credit impaired. What’s happening basically is a few of our customers basically are facing some short-term cash flow pressure challenges, and this is partly due to high rates, but the balance sheet remains strong, and our level of collateralisation remains strong. Typically for this impaired $3.2 billion portfolio the level of collateralisation on average is 55% loan to value. So, this is why there is a material, if any, ECL impact from the designation to stage 3. In terms of the capital impact, depending on which models we’re using and what form of lending it is, some of the impact may manifest in RWAs, and we’ve seen a little bit of that in last quarter. Some of it will manifest in EEL, excess expected loss, which will go straight into our CET1. We publish these numbers, but by and large these are immaterial numbers and, again, it’s all supported by the fact that we have a very strong level of collateralisation against the exposure. As we look forward, first, these customers, the specifically credit impaired customers, are current, remain current. We expect some of the pressure they’re facing to ease as rates reduce and as economic activity in Hong Kong picks up. In terms of the medium-to-long-term outlook for the sector, we are actually positive. We are confident, first, in the Hong Kong economy in general to rebound, but in particular for the sector. We expect the sector’s pressure will ease in the medium-to-long term, and we remain confident and positive about the sector.",False,6.0,0

First of all, Georges, congrats, and, Noel, congratulations for a new path, wherever you choose to be. Thank you for the helpful disclosures on the hedge, etc. I have two questions, which are pretty much linked, regarding falling rates and how does the management see it. First of all, the Wealth income – it’s an odd cycle with Wealth income and AUM growth rates being elevated as interest rates are high. So, when they do fall, do we have any precedent as to whether there will be an impact on the Wealth income from falling rates or we don’t get that much benefit from income? We see right now that a lot of the mainland Chinese money is also coming out and parking in Hong Kong. So that’s the first part of the question. The second is lending growth. We have targets for mid-single digits, but, when we think about modelling banking NII, we have to look at average interest-earning assets. So, I’m wondering – we have lots of liquidity on the balance sheet. If rates do fall and then some of these depositors don’t feel incentivised, do we get overall deposit growth not so strong, which in turn leads to average interest-earning assets not growing, and hence we should not be modelling average interest-earning assets growth at mid-single digits? So help us to think of that. Thank you so much.",True,7.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"So, first, Wealth income – the way we report it essentially is Fees and other income. So the slide I have there for Wealth – that’s particularly the fees part, which is fees earned on asset under management or for insurance in particular related to new business CSM. So the impact, if you want, on rates is more about the transition of customers from deposits into AUMs. So this has been happening. We’re seeing some of our deposits move into net new invested assets and transferring, if you want, to AUMs in our Wealth proposition. It is likely, on a trend basis, that when rates come down and the earnings you can make on deposits reduces, that customers may shift some of it into AUMs – it will be visible now in our net new invested assets proposition, and then we will be able to service them in the fee space. So, yes, there is a component where we do expect more Wealth activity to take place as we see deposits being less remunerative, but this is more on a broad trend basis, not a direct linkage. We are also benefiting from the structural growth of Wealth, in particular in Asia, where we believe the underlying market is growing at very-high-single digit if not double-digit percentages over the next five years, and on top of that underlying growth, which we’re benefiting from. We are taking market share because of our additional investment in this space. So, this is definitely a platform that can benefit from a number of trends that will support the momentum. On your second point, it’s a very good point because we talk about balance sheet growth and loan growth, but we have also a strong dependence for our banking NII to deposit growth, which constitutes the underlying for our average interest-earning assets. So we’ve seen this quarter deposits growing 2%. I caution you not to annualise the 2% because some of it is seasonal; some of it is one-off. But we have a fantastic deposit franchise. You know us. Everywhere we operate, we have a very strong balance sheet that’s very appealing, and we have a very strong proposition in deposits and transaction banking for both wholesale and retail, which means that we will continuously look to capture deposits. We continue winning Global Payments Solutions mandates in the wholesale space; we continue being attractive for retail customers; and we just shared – Noel shared 345,000 new customers joining our Hong Kong business alone. In the UK in 2023 we added 1 million new customers. So therefore, we do continue seeing a good underlying momentum to grow our deposits with this very attractive deposit franchise of ours.",False,7.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\240801-interim-results-2024-presentation-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,2,Noel Quinn,Group Chief Executive,"And I think I’d reinforce that and add another comment. The trick for us in the past – we were very good as a retail bank; we were very good as a corporate bank; but, when customers, whether they were retail customers or corporate customers, wanted to invest in alternative asset classes other than cash, they tended to go to other banks because our product range and our distribution wasn’t strong enough. We deliberately set out to invest in our products and distribution capability for Wealth so that that cash – if it did move, it moved within the bank not outside the bank, and one of the byproduct benefits is, if you’ve got a good Wealth proposition, you also attract the cash. You keep the cash in the bank as well. They go hand in hand. And so I think – look, I think we’re in a very different position today in offering Wealth propositions to clients, and what we’ve done is deliberately try to diversify the revenue stream so it’s less dependent on purely corporate banking and retail banking and there is a continuum from retail and corporate banking into banking the individuals and the entrepreneurs in their personal capacity and doing their wealth management in their personal capacity, and that’s, I think, the exciting trend for the future, and I think that’s why we believe that we’re well positioned to deliver mid-teens ROTE next year: because we have that diversity and that continuum of offering. So I just want to say that’s not a by-chance strategy. That was a very deliberate strategy to keep both the cash in the bank and the invested assets in the bank. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before we close, I’d like to thank you for your questions and for all the discussions we’ve had over the last five years. I’ve always enjoyed representing my colleagues when we announce our results, and I’m really pleased that the strong first-half numbers announced today demonstrate the improved financial performance that our strategy and execution has driven. It’s been over 15 years since the group has generated returns at the current levels, and our new guidance underlines that we expect to be able to sustain it through this year and in 2025.

Q",Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"I’m going to take the first part of the question, and I’ll ask Claire and Ming to come in briefly as well. So first maybe take a step back. Our NII is driven by loan growth and by our deposit growth as well because, when you look at our average interest-earning assets, they’re actually driven by deposit growth. Our deposit franchise has been very strong. There will always be some seasonality in the deposits, but we’ve seen it by and large very steady, and we remain a very attractive balance sheet for our customers to deposit money, plus the whole deposit offering we have around it. So that is one driver, which is expectation of probably less deposit competition or pressure with lower rates, which will make it also important for us to continue raising deposits through GPS, which are wholesale deposits, as well as retail. Specifically on the loans side, we’ve seen strong loan growth in South and Southeast Asia, and that carries on. We’ve seen strong loan growth in mortgages in the UK and Hong Kong. They’re lower margin so they’re not going to be material NII movers, but it’s an area where we keep maintaining or growing market share. We’ve seen some growth in some of our unsecured, again in particular in Hong Kong and the UK and a few other geographies, but that’s starting from a low base. So, if you want, the two areas that have not been growing as fast as we would have liked in previous quarters have been the wholesale business in the UK and the wholesale business in Hong Kong, so really, it’s about the outlook for these two activities, which will be a major turning point in the overall loan growth. A couple of things to say: one, we’re not going to change our risk appetite so you shouldn’t expect us to chase loan growth down the credit curve. It’s basically awaiting customer needs when the right economic conditions and the right interest rate level is right for them, and if we have to wait it out, we will wait it out, but we’re not going to jeopardise our risk profile for that. Second, we have ample capital at the firm level and in our legal entities to support loan growth, so we’re not going to be constrained by liquidity, 60% loan to deposit ratio, nor by capital, 15% CET1 ratio. So it’s really waiting for these economic conditions to come and, broadly, interest rates coming down are, we believe, one of the important levers to get the conditions right. But I’ll ask Claire first to comment on wholesale UK, specifically the outlook, and then Ming can comment on wholesale Hong Kong. Those two engines are the ones that are yet to grow, but they’ve been stable. CLAIRE BAIRD, CFO AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HSBC UK BANK: In the UK, from speaking with our large corporate clients, they have been cautious year to date. I think they were waiting on more certainty from the outcome of the election, any new policies that may come as a result of that and, as Georges said, just that easing over all of the economic conditions. So, I think, with rates coming down, with a new government in situ, hopefully they’ll start to feel more confident to go out and invest again, which would then drive their borrowing from us. As Georges said, we have plenty of room to grow within our existing risk appetite, so this isn’t about changing risk appetite or going above it. It’s more about just being ready to go. The other thing from a UK perspective is that, obviously, this corporate lending is Basel 3.1 friendly, and that’s another thing where we’re really focused on going into next year about where should we be deploying the bank’s capital, so I think we’re pretty optimistic. The loan growth has been muted, but clients are being sensible, but we do expect there to be some growth to come now. MING LAU, ASIA-PACIFIC CFO: For Hong Kong, if you look at the overall position at this point, quarter on quarter, Hong Kong was broadly flat on lending, so we’ve seen a stabilisation of the portfolio thus far. I think there are green shoots and positive signs when I look at Hong Kong, particularly if you look at trade. The second quarter trade export data indicates exports grew 12.5% year on year, which I think is a positive sign, and we continue to grow our trade finance market share at this point in Hong Kong. Our trade finance market share is now 26%. Beyond that, I would say, when you look at the rest of the portfolio on the wholesale side, we’re not seeing the same levels of deleveraging and pay-downs at this point. So, look, there are some positive signs at this point from a Hong Kong perspective, and then I think the last thing I would say on lending is we are also looking at pushing Wealth lending – it’s a small book at this point, but it is an opportunity that we feel, in terms of a proposition and product perspective, really caters well towards our Wealth franchise.",False,1.0,0

Q",Ming Lau,,"Sure. So, on Asia Wealth, second quarter, we had Asia Wealth revenue growth roughly about 25%. We generated $19 billion of net new investable assets in Asia overall, predominantly in Hong Kong and Singapore. The dynamic there in terms of how I would articulate it is, if you look at what’s happening onshore in China, interest rates are depressed, equity returns are depressed, and property is not doing too well, but that’s driving a demand from mainland Chinese to invest offshore, and naturally, Hong Kong is one of the first steps for them when they do go offshore. We opened 345,000 new-to-bank accounts in Hong Kong through the first half of this year. Two-thirds of that, roughly, is from mainland Chinese, but that’s built the franchise, and that’s helping to build net new investable assets and deposits from an overall Hong Kong franchise perspective. So I guess, Aman, to your question, there is this structural shift in terms of onshore versus offshore dynamics between China, Hong Kong and the rest of Asia that’s equating to this opportunity on Wealth, and I think, if you look at our competition, the competition is also doing well, but we’re capturing a decent share of the market here in Hong Kong just given our sheer size and scale between Hang Seng and HSBC. In terms of momentum, I would say thus far – typically the first quarter is the strongest quarter we see from a seasonality perspective on Wealth, but this year the second quarter has just been as strong, if not stronger, than the first quarter. I think the fact that we added 345,000 new accounts in the first half and that pace continues into the third quarter, I think, bodes well from a future growth perspective as we head into the second half of 2024 and into 2025.",False,2.0,0

Q",Kunpeng Ma,China Securities,"Good morning, Georges, in London. I’ve got two questions. The first one is about any preliminary thoughts or views on the long-term ROTE framework. I think maybe it’s too early to make the final version to us, but any thoughts or any preliminary ideas about the framework of ROTE in a three- or five-year framework will be very helpful, under the background of rate drops, and maybe other positive factors like a recovery in demand and a good recovery in trade and the continued trend in the wealth management business. The second question is regarding Hong Kong CRE. I think, in my view, the timing is a little bit weird because the Hong Kong CRE problem is a long-term problem, but there was a sudden jump in stage 3 in the second quarter. I’m just curious about the timing because you downgraded most of your secured CRE exposures to stage 3, but secured loans are secured, and the Fed is maybe going to cut rates very soon so maybe those stage 3 parts will recover in the future. So I’m a little bit curious about the timing of this downgrade in stage 3 Hong Kong CRE or – maybe I’ll put it more frankly – it’s a little bit like a kitchen sink before the transition of the CEO. Sorry to use this word. Thank you.",True,3.0,0

Q",Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you. On the first question, we’re not guiding yet for a three-to- five-year ROTE. I understand this is a question that comes quite often, so nothing to share at this stage apart from we’re all ambitious here, but we’ll get to it at the right time. On your Hong Kong CRE question, I’m going to share with you also some of my thoughts and I’ll ask Ming to complement with additional colour. The first one to share is that this is absolutely not related to kitchen-sinking. I can be absolutely adamant and clear. There is a very rigorous process of ECL assessment with the risk function. There is a very clear process in how we do the judgments, where judgments need to be taken, with the Finance function. All of this is reviewed by our external auditors, PwC, as well as by our Audit Committee. So there is absolutely zero input in terms of overt discretion, if you want, apart from the natural accounting judgment discretion, but that’s highly controlled in the way we conduct it. I want to be very clear about that. The second thing I want to share is the way we apply our rules - we move to a stage 3 or an NPL for a loan even if it is performing if certain triggers in the way ourselves and the borrower have reached, for instance if we roll a certain facility or if there are any conditions we put to the facility. So in our case the borrowers are all performing, but the triggers in our probably prudent approach have been triggered and therefore there is an automatic reclassification to stage 3. But you’re right: there could be easily circumstances where stage 3 moves back to performing. That’s not a concern. And then the third one is just also to highlight it’s about 9% of the Hong Kong CRE book that’s gone to stage 3. So I may have misheard you, but it’s not the majority at all. It’s 9%. It’s a large number, but it’s 9%, it’s $3.2 billion of a $34 billion exposure. And I’ll finish by saying we are comfortable and confident in the medium-to-long-term outlook of Hong Kong CRE, the actual underlying real estate situation. It will benefit from rate cuts, and it will benefit from the economic outlook and the economic activity in Hong Kong, and then we are therefore also comfortable with our borrowers and with the level of collateralisation we have but recognise some of these borrowers have short-term cash flow pressure because of the high rates among other factors and the current economic conditions.

Q",Ming Lau,,"Sure, Georges. Look, I would say it’s not a sudden progression to stage 3. There has been progressive deterioration in the portfolio and, just reiterating Georges’ points on what’s happened, these clients are still current and paying interest. We’ve experienced credit deterioration in the portfolio given the dynamics of higher interest rates and the current weakness in the property sector across office space and retail space. I think for those of us living in Hong Kong you can see vacancy rates are higher at this point, but, when you combine the combination of high interest rates, high vacancy rates from a rental perspective – that’s putting pressure on rents, which are falling. That is putting pressure on these borrowers from a debt-servicing perspective and, as we assess the deterioration on debt servicing, together with refinancing risk on these clients, we’ve taken a prudent approach to put them into stage 3, but we’re still continuing to support the clients. Many of these clients have been clients with us for decades. We’ve got strong collateral, low LTVs. The average LTV in the portfolio is 55% so, from an overall collateral and security perspective, it’s pretty healthy and it can absorb a further drop in property prices. The last thing I would point out on the structure of these loans – the loans are structured with recourse, which means if the valuation of the asset falls below the value of the loan, recourse allows us to access other assets from the borrowers, which is why, in some of these instances, even if there are high LTVs, the recourse allows you access to other assets and cash of the borrower, which then reduces the overall provisioning on these particular borrowers.",False,3.0,0

Just to follow up on CRE, two related points: the first is the situation on the ground and how we model it in. Is it that the values we are relying on are the values that these third parties - JLLs and CBREs - are giving us, or we are forward-looking and taking a haircut on the current values and then having those metrics, and then you saw the deterioration $3.2 billion – first point is that. Second question is regarding capital. Maybe I am guessing because the HBAP position is not yet out.

Q",Ming Lau,,"Let me take the question on the LTV first. The LTV values are refreshed, minimum, on an annual basis. There are seven external valuation firms that we use that provide the valuations. On the stage 3 and Sub-standard portfolio particularly, these are managed by our special credit unit, which is carefully managing every single loan and client that is in that bucket, so the LTV and the valuation of those assets are refreshed much more frequently relative to the rest of the portfolio. So I guess if you’re asking whether the valuation is out of date, and so on those buckets of loans that are in ‘Sub-standard’ and ‘Credit impaired’, we are very frequently reviewing the asset values on that part of the portfolio. From a capital perspective – question on the impact of RWA deterioration or increase in expected loss – that’s the same for HBAP as it is for Hang Seng.

I think you implied that you’re fully hedged or nearly fully hedged in the UK on the results call, and you’ve talked to some of the challenges of hedging in Hong Kong, so I just wondered if you could give any more colour specifically on other currencies you’re likely to build the hedge – I guess asking in part to understand if these are currencies where the curve is more inverted and there’s a cost in the near term. I recognise you talked about ‘subject to market conditions’ and things can change, but just if you can give any more colour around that, that would be helpful. Then the second question on impairments – in terms of the actual impairment rate that you reported, very encouraging in Q2. H1 sits quite a bit below the full-year guidance still. Clearly, there is some uncertainty in some markets that we’ve talked to, but your remarks sound like you’re quite confident in terms of how those shake through. So I’m just wondering if there’s anything you’re seeing that would imply the second-half run rate is towards the top of that medium-term range to get you back into your full-year guidance, as it were, or whether there’s just an element of conservatism, which is understandable.

Q",Fas Yousaf,Group Treasurer,"As you rightly say, from a sterling perspective we are well positioned. We’ve hedged probably to where we want to be at this point in time. The way we generally think about this is we will split the currency mix into broadly two categories: the categories of major currencies, so US dollar, euro, sterling, Hong Kong dollar, and any other currencies where the rate trajectory is similar to those currencies. There are obviously other currencies that fall into a different bucket where the rate environment is quite different, and that we may have a different view on in terms of our hedging appetite for those other currencies. That’s broadly the split. In terms of that bucket one that I talked about, I think there is still scope to go in terms of our US dollar hedging. We talked earlier, when I was answering Andrew’s question, that what we’ve done is we’ve swapped some of the currencies into US dollars, and what’s happened is the US dollar structural hedge sensitivity has ticked up. You’ll see that in our disclosures. I think it’s gone, from memory, from about $0.5 billion to around $0.8 billion, so that gives us a bit more scope to do hedging in the US dollar space. We continue to look for opportunities to manage our exposure in Hong Kong dollar. As we’ve said repeatedly, the Hong Kong dollar market is such that there aren’t necessarily the long-term assets out there to go and put on as much long-dated hedging as we would like, but we’re looking at opportunities constantly to manage that exposure down, and that’s another area of focus.

Does that mean the $43 billion is then going to be adjusted higher by the delta to the $1 billion you’ve assumed? Second detailed follow-up – the Hong Kong stage 3 is up to 6.6%. I couldn’t find the ECL coverage anywhere, and you very helpfully give us the ECL coverage on the mainland China series, so I was wondering if we could get that disclosure for Hong Kong as well.

You’ve still got a large amount of capital surplus, and to me it looks like you could continue doing this for a very significant amount of time, but is it really the best use of capital when the market may be penalising your valuation for the NII gearing with rates?

Q",Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Financial Officer,"Raul, the reality is we have enough capital to do all of the above. That’s the reality. If I take it in order of priority, the first thing we do is we provision for a 50% dividend payout ratio. That’s immediate use of that capital, which is based on our earnings, because that’s what we’ve given for dividend guidance. That’s the first use. Second use of capital for our organic growth, and this is essentially driven by loan growth. A you probably know, the mortgage growth, which is 40% of our loan books, doesn’t consume a lot of RWAs, so that growth is not highly RWA-intensive, therefore not highly capital-intensive, but other commercial growth or unsecured growth will drive more of that capital. The growth has been good in certain areas, subdued in the wholesale space in Hong Kong and the UK. We think, as we discussed earlier, the trend is turning, but to date we have the capital available to support that growth, it’s just that it hasn’t happened to the tune of what we have capacity for. Third usage is we continue to look at inorganic bolt-on opportunities. The inorganic opportunities need to be dead-on strategy and accretive. We are not looking at ‘shopping around’, we are looking for something that will accelerate our strategy, provide us capabilities needed for our strategy. We’ve done a few. Most recently, we just closed the acquisition of the Citi wealth business in China. We will continue to look at similar opportunities for uses of capital. Then the last priority in that order is utilisation for share buybacks. I look at share buybacks in a number of ways. First, it is a way of addressing our excess capital when it is not used by any of the above. The second is it is also a form of distribution that has been appreciated by a number of our shareholders. Third – and this is a very important one – is that it is allowing us to consolidate our share count. After this $3 billion we announced, once concluded, we will have bought back around 10% of our shares. That gives us, everything else being equal, 10% progressivity on our earnings and 10% progressivity on our dividends, which in particular matter for our retail shareholders – 30% of our shareholding is retail Hong Kong, about 10% is retail UK and other, and we have a number of our institutional shareholders in income funds, so we think it’s giving us a runway for future progressivity, everything else being equal, by continuing to consolidate the share count.",False,6.0,0

I’ve never seen such a big jump on impairment ratio regarding Hong Kong CRE, not only on HSBC, but broadly in other Hong Kong banks as well. So I would want to ask, is there any change in the recognition mechanism? I think somebody was explaining you recognise that according to certain criteria. Is there any change in the recognition criteria that trigger that this time the pattern could be different from the previous cycle? This is number one. Number two, I would say, I just want to confirm - just now I think you said about the Hong Kong CRE, even if it’s in stage three, does not necessarily mean delinquency. So some of the loans, clients are still serving the interest payments, the principal payments, but you are just pre- emptively looking at the numbers and think that there’s risk. That’s why you downgraded the loan. I want to make sure that my understanding is correct on that front. And then, also on capital treatment on the Hong Kong CRE, just now you said it’s about 10 basis points of impact on CET1, but if we look at Hang Seng, the impact is much bigger. We calculated that it’s roughly about 140 basis points. I understand HSBC and Hang Seng are under two different jurisdictions when it comes to capital treatment, but my concern is we’ll assume there’s no further deterioration, i.e. no further downgrade, just with the existing portfolio. Would there be any scenario that triggers a bigger drag on capital than you currently have recognised? Thank you.",True,9.0,0

Q",Ming Lau,,"On your second question, the clients are still current, so they’re still covering and paying interest. The reason why they’ve been put into stage three and impaired, again, is largely on the basis of stress on debt servicing, which I had explained earlier, and, secondly, refinancing risk. Just based on where the sector is and where the clients are from a debt servicing perspective, when these facilities mature, the clients are struggling to get refinancing in the market as a result. We are still supporting these clients. That’s the reason why they’re in stage three, but that’s just to confirm these clients are still current and paying interest.

We are expecting more rate cuts to come, albeit we’ve massively reduced our net interest income sensitivity since December 2021. I think it was $1.1 billion per 100 bps parallel shift now down to about $400 million or so. I think on that, the structural hedge will give us protection around those things. On mortgages, similar dynamics to what our peers have said this week in terms of new business margins. They’re definitely better than they were. We’re paying cost of capital, which is good, but they are lower than the back book rolling off, so we’ll still see that continued downward pressure on the overall NIM from mortgage margins for the time being.

Q",Ming Lau,,"On capital and investments itself, the way I would articulate it is, first on capital, I think it’s back to what Georges mentioned. We are selectively looking at bolt-on inorganic transactions. You would have seen the purchase of the Citi portfolio onshore in China. We’ve bought the AXA insurance portfolio in Singapore. Typically, the wealth business beyond wealth lending is not as capital intensive, so any use of capital would typically, more predominantly come from inorganic-type activities. That’s how I would say to think about it. We are exploring opportunities, but again they will largely be bolt-on acquisitions that supplement our either distribution or product manufacturing capabilities. I think the markets we predominantly would look at would be China, India, Singapore, from an Asia perspective. On costs and headcounts, I would guide you to our China investment across Private Banking and Pinnacle. Pinnacle is one of the big investments we’ve put in over the last few years. We have just over 1,700 Personal Wealth Planners onshore in China. Beyond that, we are selectively investing in Private Banking, for example, in Singapore. Those are the cost and FTE investment.

We delivered another good quarter, which shows that our strategy is working and we have a strong platform for growth. I am committed to building on that. Before Jon takes you through the third-quarter numbers, I’d like to make a few comments. We made several announcements last week. First, Pam Kaur will take over as Group Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1 January. Pam is an exceptional leader who joined HSBC in 2013 as Group Head of Audit and is currently our Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. With almost 40 years’ experience in the financial sector, she brings a global perspective to the strategic challenges and opportunities we face today. I look forward to partnering with her for the next stage of the bank’s growth and development. I would also like to thank Jon for his outstanding support during the interim period. Second, we announce a reorganisation to simplify and streamline the group. We are currently organised around three businesses and five regions. From 1 January, we will operate through four businesses: Hong Kong and UK, serving personal banking and commercial banking customers in our two home markets; Corporate and Institutional Banking; International Wealth and Premier Banking. We will also streamline our geographic governance structures, reducing them from five regions to two, further enhancing our ability to serve our customers’ needs throughout our global network. Our current Group Executive Committee of 18 members will be replaced by a new Group Operating Committee with 12 members. The analysis we’ve done so far demonstrates that the reorganisation will result in net cost savings with a relatively short payback period on any upfront costs. We will share these details with you at our full-year results in February as part of a wider business update. Third, turning to the external environment, I welcome the clarity provided by the UK government on its prudential rules. The PRA’s second near-final policy statement and rules on the implementation of Basel 3.1 bring an end to years of uncertainty and will help the banking sector to support growth in the UK. Similarly, I am encouraged by the recent policy measures in mainland China and Hong Kong. I am confident that the monetary stimulus announced last month and potential further fiscal and other measures will help to stabilise key sectors and strengthen mainland China’s economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s easing of macroprudential constraints is proportionate and timely, and we expect these measures to have a positive impact on the Hong Kong economy. With that, Jon will take you through the Q3 numbers.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2024\241029-q3-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,3,Jon Bingham,Interim Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Georges. In summary, we had another good quarter. Profit before tax of $8.5 billion was up $0.9 billion or 11% on the third quarter of last year on a constant-currency basis. This brings our annualised return on tangible equity for the first nine months of the year to 19.3%, or 16.7% excluding notable items. Revenue of $17 billion was up $1.1 billion on last year’s third quarter and up $0.3 billion on the second quarter this year, underlying the good momentum within the business. We’ve announced today a further $4.8 billion of distributions, consisting of a third interim dividend of 10 cents per share and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion. We intend to complete this buyback during the four-month period before our full-year results announcement in February. Last week, we also completed the share buyback announced at the half-year results in July. We’ve now repurchased 9% of our share count since the start of last year. As you can see on the next slide, strategic transactions, principally the disposal of Canada in the first quarter, were a small impact on the year-on-year revenue and profit growth. Excluding the impact of these transactions, profit before tax excluding notable items was up 13% on the third quarter of last year. Revenue of $17 billion was up $1.1 billion on the third quarter of last year, driven by a $1.6 billion increase in fee and other income. This included a $0.7 billion increase in Wholesale Transaction Banking and Wealth. The remaining $1 billion increase primarily reflected strong performance in Equities and Global Debt Markets within Global Banking and Markets, and adverse items in the third quarter of last year that did not repeat, including $0.3 billion of treasury disposal losses and other notable items. Banking NII of $10.6 billion was down $0.3 billion on the second quarter on a reported FX basis, primarily due to a loss arising from the early redemption of legacy securities. Excluding this, the banking NII run rate was stable on the previous quarter. Our 2024 banking NII guidance is unchanged at around $43 billion. Our guidance includes the impact of the $0.3 billion early redemption loss taken this quarter. It also assumes a $1 billion contribution from Argentina this year, which is what we reported in 2023. Argentina has contributed $1.2 billion to banking NII in the year to date, but the volatility created by hyperinflation accounting makes that number very difficult to forecast from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, I would encourage you to think about our guidance as being around $42 billion excluding Argentina. Turning to fee and other income, Wholesale Transaction Banking was up 7% on last year’s third quarter. The key driver was Global Foreign Exchange, which grew 12%, benefiting from increased client activity. Higher volumes also contributed to growth in both Global Trade Solutions and Global Payments Solutions. Wealth was up 32% on the third quarter last year. It was our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Wealth, as our continued investments in this business and the importance of Hong Kong as a global wealth hub have enabled us to capitalise on a favourable operating environment. There is double-digit growth in all Wealth products, but life insurance was the biggest driver. About half of the growth in life insurance was from the non-repetition of a charge we took in Q3 last year. Excluding that, life insurance still grew well into double digits, mainly because a higher CSM balance drove an increase in CSM release. The CSM balance is a store of value. All else remaining equal, growth in the balance means growth in future earnings, and our CSM balance has continued to grow. In the first three quarters of this year, we have generated more than $2 billion of new business CSM. This has driven our CSM balance to $13.2 billion, a 22% increase since last year’s third quarter, creating a foundation for future revenue growth. Hong Kong continued to benefit from inflows of international customers. There were 243,000 new-to-bank customers in the third quarter versus an average of just over 170,000 per quarter in the first half. Net new invested assets were $26 billion, $11 billion of which were in Asia. On credit, you’ll recall that our second quarter had a low ECL charge due to recoveries and other items. The third quarter ECL charge was $1 billion or 40 basis points of average loans. The wholesale ECL charge was $0.6 billion, driven by $0.4 billion in Hong Kong, of which $0.1 billion related to Hong Kong commercial real estate, whilst the personal charge was $0.4 billion. This brings our annualised ECL charge to 28 basis points of average loans for the year to date, which is broadly in line with our 30 to 40 basis point guidance for the full year. Next, on costs, costs were up 6% in the first nine months of the year on a target basis, which was 1% lower than for the first half. As we explained in the previous quarter, the phasing of performance-related pay and the additional levies from the end of last year will give us a tailwind heading into the fourth quarter. We’re on track to meet our target of around 5% cost growth for 2024 on a target basis and remain committed to cost discipline. On lending and deposits, loan balances were stable in the third quarter. Deposits were up 1%, driven by a $16 billion increase in Hong Kong WPB. This reflected short-term flows between invested assets and deposits, and I would caution you against annualising that number. Term deposits were 39% of total Hong Kong deposits, unchanged since the second quarter. Next, our CET1 ratio is 15.2%, up 20 basis points on the second quarter, as strong organic capital generation was partly offset by distributions. CET1 grew $3.1 billion during the quarter on a constant-currency basis. This growth included $2.9 billion of other movements, mainly gains in the market value of securities classified as held to collect and sell, which are fair-valued through other comprehensive income. RWAs grew by $14 billion on a constant-currency basis, mainly due to broader balance sheet growth. Finally, I’d like to point out a number of upcoming events which will help you with your modelling. First, we expect the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points on our CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter. It remains our intention to return excess capital to shareholders through a rolling series of share buybacks. Secondly, we expect to complete the sale of HSBC Argentina in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, around $5.1 billion of historical foreign exchange translation and other reserve losses will be recycled to the income statement on completion. This has already been recognised in capital and there will be no incremental impact on CET1, TNAV or distributions. These losses will also be excluded from our dividend calculation. We expect the completion of the sale to reduce RWAs by around $8 billion, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. Third, we intend to begin to actively market our $8 billion legacy French home loan portfolio during the fourth quarter. We expect to reclassify this portfolio as held to collect and sell in the first quarter next year, leading to a recognition of an estimated $1 billion pre-tax loss, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. Finally, the PRA recently published near-final rules on Basel 3.1. These are incrementally better than we previously expected. We continue to expect them to have an immaterial impact on our CET1 ratio upon implementation. To conclude, our guidance remains unchanged, namely a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items for 2024 and 2025; banking NII of around $43 billion in 2024; ECLs for a full year within our normal medium-term planning range of 30-40 basis points; cost growth of around 5% for 2024 on a target basis; and mid-single digit loan growth over the medium term.",False,-1.0,1

Thanks very much for the presentation and the questions. One on restructuring and one on net interest income, please. I’m just trying to scope the degree of ambition that you might have around restructuring. It looks like efforts to restructure the business are focused on delivering net cost saves. You’re clearly doing very well on revenues at the moment, particularly with the three businesses that are presumably a source of near-term upside to market expectations, but I think the outlook is volatile. A lot of these things are outside of your area of control. So what is the scale of the ambition around what you’d be looking to achieve on things like cost and RWAs, as you try and future-proof the medium-term return on tangible equity outlook? And then I had a second question on net interest income, so I think I’m taking the banking NII guide at face value and trying to nix out Argentina. I think it’s implying an annualised run rate of around $41.5 billion at the fourth quarter as a jumping off point into 2025. It may be a bit of a low-value question, but I’m interested if you were able to, at this stage, comment on banking net interest income as per consensus in 2025. I think the street is at around $41 billion versus that $41.5 billion, not looking for too much attrition from here – it would be great to get, if you’re not willing to put a number on it, how you see the moving parts are out there, please.

So the primary reason for the reorganisation is to create a simpler, more dynamic, more agile, leaner bank. It’s really to allow us to empower our frontline staff and make it faster to make decisions and ultimately serve our customers better. That’s the primary reason. Now, as a result of a simpler, leaner, more efficient bank, there will be cost saves. The cost take-out will be essentially in the form of severance or related costs. It will be affecting senior roles that will be de-duplicated, or the reduction of the number of senior roles will drive this. We will be giving you those details about the figures about the upfront costs as well as the benefits realisation in the full-year results in February. What I can say is, number one, the benefits will exceed the upfront costs, and the payback is going to happen in a short time frame thereafter, and then the second point to share with you is that we remain fully committed to cost discipline. I’ve been sharing this in my days as Group CFO. I carry on this mission of being fully committed to cost discipline, and this is now embedded in the firm, as you have seen from our Q3 results. For 2024, we remain on track to deliver on our cost target. We are committed to it, and we’re confident we will be able to achieve it.",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\241029-q3-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,3,Jon Bingham,Interim Group Chief Financial Officer,"So, on banking NII – thanks for the question, Aman. If I might be forgiven for giving you a longer answer to this, if we start on 2024, we’ve reiterated our guidance on 2024 of banking NII of around $43 billion, but encourage you to think about that as $42 billion ex- Argentina. In total, we’ve printed $31.6 billion for the nine months to date, and we think the Q3 run rate of $10.6 billion is a pretty clean run rate for you to think about modelling 2025. We don’t provide guidance at this stage on 2025 banking NII guidance, but if you take that clean run rate of the $10.6 billion, which I agree is about $42 billion – we’ll have disposed of Argentina – so therefore we then think of the building blocks for you to model this along four factors. Firstly, rates – the reduction in rates implied in the markets will be clearly a headwind. The cuts during the third quarter – given the timing of them, they had a relatively modest impact on the third quarter’s results, but we’d encourage you to use our banking NII sensitivity against market implied rates to generate that component. We then have the structural hedge that will provide a tailwind. We’ve got the reinvestment of maturing positions that will enable us to reinvest them at higher rates. We’ve signalled that, for 2025, we’ve got $115 billion maturing at an average yield of about 2.9%, so think about those maturing and being replaced at something along the lines of five-year bond rates. We’ve then got volume growth. Whilst volume growth has been relatively subdued in 2024, we do hope that, with interest rates coming off and economic activity picking up, we will see more loan growth. We continue to guide to mid-single digits in the medium-to-long term. The timing of getting there will be unpredictable. And then, lastly, we keep an eye on time deposit migration. That has been relatively stable, particularly in Hong Kong, at 39% over the last couple of quarters, but the impact on that as rates come off will be variable. It depends on competitive pressures and customer behaviour. So all of those factors are how we have thought about it and modelled it and included that within our mid-teens RoTE guidance for 2025.

The Wealth business, as you know, is generated from four segments, one of which has performed quite well, which is the trading activities of our customers, and that manifests both in the private bank as well as in our invested assets. They have been very strong, and they’ve been even stronger following the measures we’ve seen in China. On the outlook for corporate loan growth in Asia, as I shared earlier, we are very encouraged by the policy measures that have taken place both in mainland China as well as in Hong Kong. We see these measures, combined with the outlook on rates coming down, as supportive of future growth, specifically in our Hong Kong book. Outside Hong Kong, the rest of Asia remains resilient.

One, just going back on the simplification programme, I’m just curious – I guess, in the past, the group hasn’t opted to combine Commercial Banking and GBM, so I’m just curious what’s seen as different now which makes this more feasible and easier to execute with less revenue attrition or other considerations. Secondly, just on the ECL charges, those were a little bit higher than I anticipated. It looks like a bit of that’s from Hong Kong wholesale and in the UK ringfenced bank, so I’m just curious if there’s any additional colour you can provide on that, and how are you thinking about the 40bps in the context of the guidance into next year? Thank you.",True,3.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\241029-q3-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,3,Georges Elhedery,Group Chief Executive,"Thank you, Amit. Let me address your first question and Jon can address the ECL charges question. The primary reason for this reorganisation is to simplify the bank, as we shared, but we’ve been on a multi-year journey to simplify the activities we do in the bank. We’ve been exiting activities that were non-strategic. We’ve been reshaping our portfolio. We’ve exited markets or activities; currently, we’re on track to complete the sale of our Argentina business and our Armenia business, and announced two additional exits in September, including South Africa as well as the private bank in Germany. That activity was addressing the ‘what’ in terms of what we do as a strategy. The reorganisation we announced last week is basically addressing the ‘how’ we execute our strategy. It’s not changing the ‘what’; it’s changing the ‘how’. The reason we could effectively execute the ‘how we change our strategy’ – as in be simpler and more agile – is because of the work we have done over the past few years in simplifying what we do. It is the right time now to address how we operate and how we execute our strategy, because we’ve simplified what we do. We’ve clarified our core strategic areas for us where we have competitive strength and where we have leadership and opportunities to grow. The timing, therefore, is a natural conclusion of the various activities that we have been taking through the transformation over the last five years. I want to say that, outside out the UK and Hong Kong, where we’re merging all our Commercial Banking activities with Global Banking and Markets activities to form Corporate and Institutional Banking, it will comprise our core products, including our balance sheet related products, credit and lending and deposits, our transaction banking products, as well as our other products such as Investment Banking or Markets. This should give our customers a more seamless way to deal with HSBC across all this product spectrum that we offer them. Jon?",False,3.0,0

I’ll give you a bit more colour on the ECL charge. There’s a $1 billion charge in Q3, which is 40 basis points of average loans. That’s actually a more normal charge, because Q2 benefitted from releases and recoveries. If you then dissect the Q3 charge, there’s three things within there. Firstly, the UK is a $200 million charge. Again, that benefitted from releases in Q2. It’s a more normal charge; there’s nothing more going on in there. In Hong Kong in total, we incurred a $500 million charge. As you say, that was mainly a $400 million charge in wholesale, which included $100 million of mainland China CRE and $100 million of Hong Kong CRE. The rest of it was across a number of sectors – again, nothing of particular note. Relative to Q3 last year, we did have an increase in our Mexico retail charge, so that went up to a $200 million charge. That’s actually been relatively normal through the quarters of 2024, but relative to Q3 2023 is a little higher. We’re confident as we see this that we will be in our 30 to 40 basis points planning range over the medium term and certainly there for 2024.",False,3.0,0

I have two, and mostly follow-ups. The first is on Wealth, and then we’ll move to Hong Kong CRE. On Wealth, can I check with the so-called ‘policy rescue’ in China? It’s only a month old, and for this reporting quarter, maybe only a week. Have we seen from August, as we transitioned into September, good wealth management income traction better than what we’re reporting in Q3, and then, in October, that continued, maybe even accelerated? Some colour there would be helpful. And then, on Hong Kong CRE specifically – not talking about Hong Kong in general – can we get numbers on the NPL ratio within the overall global CRE book and also the Hong Kong CRE book, as at the half-year, we were at 9% stage three loans in both?

Let me just briefly address Wealth, and I’ll ask Jon to complement it and address your Hong Kong CRE question. There are two trends in Wealth. There is the underlying trend, which is a continued growth in our Wealth business, which has been there quarter after quarter. It’s a result of our increased investment in the space. It’s a result of us winning market share, given our brand and franchise. It’s also a result of the underlying market growing. As you’ve seen, Hong Kong is now expected to become the largest private wealth hub in the world by the end of the decade, so that is definitely a trend, and we’re privileged with our position in Hong Kong to be able to benefit from it and benefit our customers from it. That is the first component, which is an underlying continued investment and growth trend. If you add to that the additional activity we’ve seen following the measures that have been taken in China, this has created additional activity, which has been, as you said, for a week or so in Q3. We do see this activity continuing and obviously normalising, but we do see these measures that have been taken to be supportive measures, certainly of the economy at large, but in particular supportive measures of the financial markets and the revival of some of the financial market sluggishness that we’ve seen in both in mainland China and Hong Kong over the last few quarters.",False,4.0,0

A few customers continue to face cashflow pressures. Some of that is rates resultant, and as rates come off, we would hope that begins to abate some of those cashflow pressures. If you look at the Asia wholesale stage threes, they were up $1.1 billion in the quarter. Some of that relates to Hong Kong CRE. That also drove a modest amount of additional RWAs. For the ECLs on that, we’ve referred to the fact that there was a $100 million charge on ECLs. That was both across stage one and stage two. The stage three ratio is slightly up quarter on quarter, but we continue to see good collateral across that portfolio, so we don’t see this as a material ECL driver going forward.

My first question is on the structural hedge. Georges, you mentioned that $25 billion is a good run rate for you to build up the structural hedge in the second half, but in Q3 that increased by $27 billion, and maybe most of that comes from FX impact. Do you still stick to a $25 billion run rate, or would you like to accelerate it? The second question is I’d like to hear your thoughts on what areas HSBC can further make investments, because it seems like over the years our strategy always emphasised that the bank had to make excellent good cost discipline, and we did it. We made some investments, but mostly small ones. If you look forward, do you see any opportunities that may help to further drive growth and take market share, or do you think it’s better to stay cautious as we are still facing some top-line pressures?

Let me address your second question on investments and then Jon can address your structural hedge question. First, as you said, cost discipline. I’ve taken it from my days in my CFO role with me as CEO. It is embedded in the organisation, and we will maintain cost discipline. You should expect this to be ingrained in the way we think, in spending wisely and in the right places. In terms of strategy, in the reorganisation we announced last week we are basically organising ourselves alongside our strategic pillars. This creates clarity and this also creates simplicity in the way we can execute our strategy. We have two whole markets where we have scale, a leading market position, great growth opportunities, and certainly a very strong competitive edge. In our Corporate and Institutional Banking business we have a global connectivity capability and a transaction banking capability that is second to none. That is leading and providing excellent services to our customers. Our positioning is very cherished and very valued by our customers. We then have International Wealth and Premier Banking, which is really the proposition aimed at the affluent segment for investment needs in particular across our network, in particular in Asia and the Middle East. Any opportunity we have to accelerate this strategy, be it organic or inorganic, is an opportunity we will go after. These areas all exhibit fantastic growth opportunities. We have a real competitive edge, and we will continuously invest in them both organically and inorganically if the opportunities arise. What I should say there is we do have the capital to support our needs. We have the capital to support our dividend distribution, to support organic growth and to support inorganic opportunities, should we find some that can accelerate our strategy and allow us to gain market share.",False,5.0,0

The duration of that remains 2.8 years. We would continue to expect to increase our structural hedge, but that will depend on market conditions that we have.

The first one I would like to ask is about NII. The confusing thing here is that the headline NII actually slightly misses expectation, but if we work out the banking NII there’s a moderate beat, and also we try to calculate what is the banking net interest margin. It seems it’s by and large stable. Just starting in Q3 HIBOR actually went down on average 50 basis points. May I ask what is driving that stable net interest margin? Will it be from the liabilities management side? Just now Jon gave us some colour in terms of deposit migration, but is it possible to give me some numbers to work around? What is the CASA ratio in Hong Kong and how has the trend changed? This will be my first question. My second question is that, when I look at the RWA migration, on the numerator I saw that in the migration side there is a $2 billion addition to CET1 capital due to movement in reserves. Can we get a bit of colour on that one? Will we be seeing a similar type of movement in the coming quarters? Actually, I have one additional question on the loss that we were talking about, the legacy securities. Can you give us a bit of colour on this one. I understand that management put this into notable items, so supposedly to be one off, but is it really one off in nature? Will we have other securities and perpetual bonds that we would like to redeem in the future? For example, do we have another 10% type of perpetual bond currency in our book that we may be looking to redeem when opportunities arise? Thank you.",True,6.0,0

I’m going to let Jon answer the three questions, but allow me one comment on the legacy securities. We have said that we will look at our legacy securities continuously, but we will take actions that are accretive or neutral. We will not take action on legacy securities that are detrimental to our investors and our shareholders. In this case we’ve taken an action on a legacy security that has a more than 10% coupon that could be naturally and easily replaced with much lower rates, and therefore there is a positive impact on the net present value basis of the actions we’ve taken. We will always look at these actions where there is value in it.",False,6.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\241029-q3-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,3,Jon Bingham,Interim Group Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Katherine. Three questions there. If I start on your net interest margin, we give some detail on the net interest margin on page 17 of the slide deck, but effectively the net interest margin has moved from 162 bps to 146 bps. There’s three things driving that. One, the loss on the early redemption of legacy securities, as you’ve mentioned. Two, some Argentina volatility, and then the remaining is on – we’ve allocated more funding to the trading book, and as you know that will be a drag on net interest income but also an equal and opposite benefit on non-net-interest income. Our preferred measure and the way that we think about it is through the banking NII lens. There you’ll see that our clean run rate ex Argentina and ex the notables has been relatively stable period on period, reflecting the fact that the Q3 rate cuts, given their timing, had a modest impact on Q3. You’d also asked about deposit migration. We’ve again got some detail in that on slide 17, but that has remained relatively stable at 39% for the Hong Kong deposits. If I move on to your CET1 question and then particularly the change in other adjustments for CET1 capital, that is around the fair value movements of our securities that are classified as fair value through OCI. We’ve generated a gain on those, which has given us also a capital benefit on that. I think on legacy securities Georges has covered most of the questions on that, but we’re not signalling anything at this stage around further legacy securities redemptions.

One was just a clarification. Just to be clear, the $1.1 billion increase in stage three loans in Hong Kong, is that all CRE, just to be clear on that? That was the first question. The second one is we’ve obviously got a US election coming up in the next couple of weeks, and I just wondered if you could give us some thoughts from your perspective in terms of the possible risks and opportunities that you see that could come out of that with the two realistic options.

Look, this is a matter for the US electorate to choose their president. I’m not going to speculate or comment. We will see the outcomes on 5 November, but what is important for us is that we serve our customers. We have been serving our customers through an evolving set of rules and regulations on the global scale. We serve them for their needs, especially for their cross-border needs, where we’re unique at being able to do so. We obviously comply with all rules and regulations. We will make sure that our customers are able to comply with all rules and regulations, insofar that their financial needs are concerned. Any new rules and regulations which may come with any new administration are things that we will obviously comply with and support our customers to comply with. What I can say, though, is it remains a distinctive skill that we have in supporting our customers’ cross-border needs. This is one of our unique areas of competitive edge and this remains unchanged. Our customer needs remain broad-based and global, and we will continue supporting them on that mission. With regards to the reorganisation, this is categorically not either an intent or a preparation – as has been speculated by some – of splitting the Asia business, etc. Absolutely not. This is a simplification of the bank where we today govern ourselves through five regions, and we’re bringing this regional setup down to two. That is part of the simplification. It is also meant to help us speed up the build-out of what is a very promising corridor between the Middle East and Asia. We’re seeing material growth in this corridor over the last few years. Our customers across both the Middle East and Asia are looking for opportunities of trade and investments between them, and we’ve been – we have a unique position to be able to help our customers across this corridor. That simplification should also help speed up the build of that corridor. I remind you in our western geographies now we’re essentially a wholesale bank. We have sold our retail banking activities in France. We’ve sold the mass retail activities in the US. We’ve sold the bank in Canada. We’ve sold the bank in Greece. We are in the process of selling the bank in Argentina, and with that we’ll be left with what is essentially a Corporate and Institutional Banking business that also brings some simplification aspects to the way we govern ourselves in this region.

Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Georges Elhedery,Group Ceo,"Welcome, all, to today’s call. I’m joined by Pam, our new Group CFO. We’re delighted to be here in Hong Kong, the city where HSBC was founded 160 years ago. Our history and heritage stand us in good stead in so many ways. Adapting to new economic realities and technologies is what we have always done. It brings out the best in our people and culture, especially when acting as a trusted advisor to our customers as they navigate the world’s economic uncertainties and look towards new opportunities. Before Pam takes you through the fourth-quarter numbers, I will cover four items. First, I will go through our full-year 2024 results. Second, I will set out the changes implemented over the past few months to create a simple, more agile, focused bank addressing the ways we operate in a fundamental way. Third, I will describe in some detail the solid foundations we are building on. For example, I will share with you what we plan to do next in order to deliver sustainable strategic growth and meet our return targets. Starting with the full-year numbers, 2024 performance was strong. We delivered record profit before tax of $32.3 billion, or $34.1 billion excluding notable items. We generated a 14.6% return on tangible equity, or 16% excluding notable items, in line with our mid-teens target. We announced a total of $26.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders in respect of 2024, including 87 cents per share of dividends and $11 billion of share buybacks. When I took the role in September, my priority was to inject energy and intent in the way we deliver our strategy, while maintaining continued focused cost discipline. At our third-quarter results, I committed to provide you with more detail on the expected benefits from our organisational simplification. We have simplified HSBC in two important ways. We have elevated and empowered our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK and our Wealth proposition, and we have combined our two wholesale businesses. In doing so, we have eliminated large parts of our complex matrix governance structure. This significantly improved operating model is now led by a tighter Group Operating Committee. It has clarity of accountability, fewer management lines and layers, reducing the need for the number of committees we previously ran across the bank. This has increased our agility. As an illustration, previously, every dollar of revenue we generated had at least two accountable executives at the Group Executive Committee. Today, around 60% of our revenue has a single accountable executive at the Group Operating Committee. This will empower our people to make faster decisions, collaborate better and innovate for the benefit of our customers. In short, we’ve simplified our structure and we’ve aligned it to our strategy. This will enable us to deliver around $1.5 billion of annualised savings by the end of full-year 2025, primarily through de-duplication of roles. This represents circa 8% reduction of our global staffing costs. This will cost around $1.8 billion in severance and other up-front costs. Those $1.5 billion savings will have no meaningful impact on revenue and they will be taken straight to the bottom line. Separately, we will redeploy c.$1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities as incremental investments to our priority growth areas, where we have clear competitive advantages and generate accretive returns. We have started to do this by announcing that we will begin to wind down our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, Europe and the US. I will cover our priority growth areas shortly. These actions give us the confidence to target a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Each of our four businesses are firmly rooted in our core strengths. In our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK, we have two strong businesses. In both businesses, we serve Personal Banking customers as well as Commercial Banking and Small and Medium Enterprises. We are a leading bank and are growing market share in key products. Importantly, in both, we are profitable and delivering very good returns. As for the large corporations with global banking needs in both home markets, alongside individuals with multi-country personal financial needs, they will be served by our two international businesses, as I am about to set out. Corporate and Institutional Banking – CIB – is a global wholesale bank with significant competitive advantages. It has a powerful deposit franchise with strong financing capabilities, and it also has a market-leading transaction bank, leveraging our global network. As the world’s number one trade bank for the last seven consecutive years, we are exceptionally well placed to help our customers and capture global and intra-regional trade flows as supply chains reconfigure, new trade routes emerge, economies grow, and our customer expectations evolve. CIB is also well positioned to help entrepreneurs secure the capital they need to build the businesses of the future and help our customers decarbonise. International Wealth and Premier Banking – IWPB – is ideally placed to capture the increasing number of affluent and high-net-worth customers, especially those with international banking needs who seek new investment opportunities to help them protect and grow their wealth. Our recognised brand, financial strength and complementary footprints across Asia and the Middle East reinforce our position in the world’s fastest growing wealth markets. Let me now highlight our distinctive strengths, starting with our high-quality revenue streams. Our franchise generates resilient recurring revenue from three key sources. As you can see, in 2024, two-thirds of revenue was from Banking NII. This is the result of the strong deposit and lending positions in each of our four core businesses. As you know, we have built up the structural hedge to protect this revenue stream from falling interest rates. Pam will speak more about this. The remaining third was from fee and other income. Around a half of this was from our market-leading Wholesale Transaction Banking business, which is built on our global network, covering 85% of global trade and capital flows, including high-growth markets such as India, ASEAN, mainland China, the Middle East and Mexico. Around a third was from Wealth, which I will talk about shortly. Taken together, this means that more than 90% of our revenue comes from three high-quality streams. Moving to our strong deposit franchise, our customers trust the strength of our balance sheet and have chosen us to look after their deposits. This gives us a highly liquid and profitable balance sheet, which provides greater flexibility through the cycle. Within our $1.7 trillion deposit base, we have large deposit surpluses in each of our four businesses, giving us the funding capacity to support our clients. Turning now to our high-quality loan portfolio, we have always maintained a conservative approach to risk management, as evidenced by the quality of our loan portfolio. In the period since 2018, we have experienced a global pandemic, an energy crisis and the real-estate cycle in the US, in Hong Kong and in mainland China. Our average annual ECL charge over that period was 32 basis points of average gross loans, which is well within our medium-term planning range of 30-40 basis points. On our disciplined capital management, over the last two years, our capital generation has enabled us to return $47.7 billion to our shareholders. This comprises of $27.7 billion of dividends and $20 billion of share buybacks, including those announced today. Through the rolling series of share buybacks we have undertaken since the start of 2023, we have now repurchased 11% of our year-end 2022 issued share count. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. The external environment presents us with opportunities but also challenges. The interest rate outlook is benign but remains volatile. We can adapt to changing patterns of trade and economic growth, but there is a risk of disruption, and we have a major opportunity in wealth in Asia and the Middle East, but it is a highly competitive space. Despite these challenges, we have levers we can pull on to support us to deliver on our target. We’re confident we can take decisive action to do so. These levers are, first, driving operating leverage as an ongoing process through cost efficiency and optimisation, as well as continuous improvements in productivity, second, dynamic balance sheet management and capital allocation, which I’ll cover shortly, and third, investing for strategic long-term growth. Let me turn to this next. We're creating the capacity to invest for growth in the business and to drive efficiencies. We’re focusing our growing investment pot, as shown on this and the next slide. First, in our home markets, we intend to expand the number of wealth centres and enhance our wealth capabilities in Hong Kong, which is set to become the world’s leading cross-border wealth centre. We attracted around 800,000 new-to-bank personal banking customers in Hong Kong last year, and we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities as international customers choose Hong Kong as their cross-border wealth hub. In the UK, we plan to also grow the Wealth business, and we plan to improve our SME covering and proposition. This is an extremely attractive and profitable segment, where we will intensify our focus. Second, in CIB, we intend to leverage our network and further enhance our transaction banking capabilities, including in high-growth markets such as mainland China, ASEAN, India, the Middle East and Mexico. We are also looking to scale up our broad loan origination capabilities by underwriting more and distributing more to our institutional and wealth clients. This ability to leverage our loan origination for the purpose of distribution will give us larger opportunities to generate fee income, improve capital efficiencies and, in turn, improve CIB returns. Third, in IWPB, we intend to accelerate the wealth build-up in our home markets, and particularly also in key growth markets such as Singapore, the UAE, India and mainland China. In each of these, we aim to accelerate the hiring of relationship managers, establish new wealth centres, and expand our product offering. While we are benefiting from an underlying growth in this segment, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, we also aim to grow our market share by, first, better driving wealth penetration with our own wholesale or Premier customers, second, better capturing cross-border flows of our own customers in their outbound location, and third, increasing the proportion of mandates within our invested assets. Finally, underpinning all of this and across the Group, we aim to seize the opportunity of AI and generative AI. Our flagship initiatives will focus on improving customer service through both our mobile apps and our contact centres. We also intend to increase tech productivity with tools such as coding assistants, and improve process efficiency in areas such as onboarding, KYC, credit applications and many others. Mid-teens returns will give us a range of attractive options for capital deployment and will drive EPS and DPS growth over time. As the illustration on the right-hand slide of the slide demonstrates, a mid-teens return on tangible equity will enable us to deliver the 50% dividend payout ratio in 2025, and still have sufficient capital to grow the balance sheet, buy back shares, or both. Supporting our customers will always be our first priority, and we expect our loan book to grow in the mid-single digits over the medium- to long-term. However, fluctuations in customer demand for credit mean our loan book may grow at an uneven pace. Share buybacks remain our preferred method of returning excess capital to our shareholders, because they drive growth in EPS and DPS. For instance, in 2024, while our earnings grew by c.2%, our earnings per share grew by c.9%, reflecting the benefit from the c.6% reduction of share count through share buybacks in this year. So in summary, we’ve simplified the Group and, along with our continued focus on costs, are committed to delivering c.$1.5 billion savings to the bottom line. We’re focused on delivering for our customers by capturing growth opportunities where we have a clear competitive advantage and accretive returns. And we’re eliminating, over the medium term, an additional c.$1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities, and redeploying them into these priority growth areas. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027. With that, let me hand over to Pam.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thanks, Georges. Thank you, everyone, for joining. I would like to begin by sharing my approach as Group CFO. In short, I’m fully focused on discipline, performance and delivery. Discipline means prioritising with precision, maintaining strong cost control, and ensuring investment rigour for growth. Performance means gearing our financial strategy towards achieving our mid-teens returns target. Delivery means ensuring we remain agile and resilient, enhance operating leverage, and are always well positioned to support our customers. Let me now turn to the Q4 numbers. Starting with the highlights, profit before tax was $2.3 billion, or $7.3 billion excluding notable items. This strong performance enabled us to announce a further $8.4 billion of distributions in respect of the fourth quarter. This consists of a fourth interim dividend of 36 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we intend to complete before our first-quarter results in April. On this slide, you can see the impact of notable items on year-on-year revenue and profit growth. This was principally the $5.2 billion related to historical foreign exchange translation losses from the Argentina disposal. Excluding these, profit before tax was up 10% on the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue of $16.5 billion was up $1.2 billion on the fourth quarter of last year, driven by Banking NII and a strong performance in Wealth. On Banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina and other notable items, the Banking NII run rate remained broadly stable. Deposit growth and benefits from the structural hedge were partially offset by lower interest rates. Looking ahead, we expect Banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. To be clear, this is a change to the way we have given you guidance before. ‘Around $42 billion’ is not an underpin. It is our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections. We also want to give you some additional detail on the structural hedge. As you know, we have been building up the structural hedge to help manage our interest rate sensitivity. During 2024, we increased the notional balance by around $50 billion. We also extended the duration from 2.8 years to 3.1 years. This contributed to a further reduction in the interest rate sensitivity of our Banking NII last year. We have reduced our sensitivity to a 100-basis-point rate shock from around $7 billion in June 2022 to around $2.9 billion at the end of 2024. We’re also providing additional disclosures on the expected reinvestment profile of the structural hedge. We expect to reinvest around $95 billion of assets in each of 2025 and 2026, from a current average yield of around 2.8%. We also expect to reinvest around $90 billion of assets in 2027, from a current average yield of around 3.4%. Moving to fee and other income, Wholesale Transaction Banking was stable on last year’s fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of strategic transactions, primarily the sale of Canada, it was up by 3%, as we continue to leverage our global network and capitalise on our position as the world’s number one trade bank. The standout performance was again in Wealth, which was up 27% on the same quarter last year. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth. I’m pleased we added 234,000 new-to-bank Personal Banking customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. This brings the total number added in 2024 to 799,000, as Hong Kong continues to grow in importance as a cross-border wealth hub. I’m also pleased with the strong momentum in the business in January, which is in line with previous years. All of this gives us confidence that we can continue to grow this business further. Our medium-term target is to continue to grow fee and other income by double-digit CAGR. There are three trends that underpin this ambition. First, the multi-year growth in new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong underlines that the city is on track to becoming the number one cross-border wealth hub before the end of this decade. Our past experience suggests that new customers grow their total balances and wealth products over time, so this is expected to provide a tailwind. Second, the strength of our business in key international wealth hubs, particularly Hong Kong, has enabled us to grow invested assets in Asia at 17% CAGR. This was also the key driver of our 13% CAGR growth in invested assets at the Group level. There have also been strong multi-year inflows of net new invested assets, with Asia accounting for the majority. Finally, our CSM balance is a third bigger than it was two years ago, despite the reclassification of our French life insurance business in the fourth quarter. This reflects continued year-on-year growth in new business CSM from higher volumes, particularly in Hong Kong. As you know, the CSM balance is a store of future earnings, which released into the P&L at between 9% and 10% in the last two years. All things being equal, this means that future earnings growth has been built in. Also, last year the value of new business CSM was substantially greater than the CSM released to the P&L. On credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1.4 billion. $1 billion of this was in wholesale, including around $300 million from two clients, one in the UK and one in mainland China commercial real estate sector. Overall, our portfolios in our home markets remained strong. This brought our 2024 charge to 36 basis points of average loans, which is within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. We expect our 2025 charge to be within our medium-term planning range. On costs, we are committed to deliver $1.5 billion of simplification savings from our reorganisation to the bottom line, of which around $0.3 billion will be recognised in our 2025 P&L. We expect to incur around $1.8 billion of severance and other up-front costs by the end of 2026. The bulk of these costs will be incurred this year. Separately, we are also aiming to reallocate a further around $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic activities to priority growth areas. You will have seen that we have announced that we will begin to wind down our ECM and M&A activities in the UK, Europe and the US while refocusing on Asia. Those businesses were not materially profitable and exiting them will make around $300 million of costs available for reinvestment in our priority growth areas. The slide also shows some businesses that we have recently agreed to dispose of, German Private Banking and French life insurance, to which I’ll add the sale of our retail banking operations in Bahrain, which was announced today. These were not aligned with our four businesses where we will focus our investment dollars and our time. Through these actions, we are creating investment space in our priority areas within our strict cost discipline. As Georges said, these include Wealth in Asia and the Middle East, UK SME coverage and wholesale transaction banking. Entry to the extra investment list is a high hurdle requiring strategic alignment and financial returns. As we continue to work through exits of low return and non-strategic activities, we are confident the investment dollars they provide will deliver a higher return to the bank. The actions taken last year mean that 2024 costs were in line with our guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. We remain fully committed to cost discipline. We expect 2025 costs to grow by around 3% compared with 2024 on a target basis, which excludes notable items and the direct costs of the Canada and Argentina disposals. Our guidance of around 3% growth includes up to 4% underlying growth from inflation and investment, partly offset by around $0.3 billion of efficiency cost savings that we expect to realise this year. On loans and deposits, loan balances were stable. Deposits were up 3% in the fourth quarter. This included an increase in Hong Kong supported by customer growth as well as seasonality. As we have said before, I would caution you against annualising that number. Our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, above our target range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect the buyback of up to $2 billion announced today to have an impact of around 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter. We have reclassified our $7 billion legacy French home loan portfolio as hold-to- collect-and-sell in the first quarter. This will lead to recognition of an estimated $1 billion pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. In summary, we have set out our current expectations in respect of 2025 and the medium term, but our key target is mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. We will run the bank to deliver this.",False,-1.0,1

If I can have two, please, the first is on CIB. Thank you for the 14% trailing RoTE. So with the cost saves, etc, where do we expect the CIB RoTE to trend over the next couple of years and how would the management think about incremental capital allocation in that business division? I know that interest rates are having an impact. So implied question is - let’s say interest rates were a lot lower and payments, cash management, etc, earn us less. And then the second one is on International Wealth and Premier Banking. Thanks, again, for the 16% RoTE. So how should we think about incremental technology or new apps or gaining market share in the cross-border area as it relates to International Wealth, given that the RoTE is not so high? For example, Zing and those kinds of apps, where we were looking at competing with the fintech – how competitive would we want to be? Thank you so much.",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Georges Elhedery,Group Ceo,"Thank you very much, Gurpreet. I will handle the two questions. On CIB, we haven’t given specific medium-term returns for CIB. As Pam said, we’ve given a bank-wide target of mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We haven’t been business-specific, but let me give you some indications of how we’re looking at the business. First, this business will benefit from the largest of the reorganisation-related cost saves because this business is the result of the merger of two wholesale businesses and, as per any merger, you would expect a lot of cost synergies in areas where we had duplicative activities, be it mostly back-office activities that are duplicative where we will achieve the savings. This business also will benefit– we called it also the investment space – from additional capital allocation efficiencies. We will be looking for more originate and distribute model. We will be looking to churn the balance sheet more, sweat the balance sheet more, drive higher earnings and fee income from this balance sheet and create better efficiency in the capital, and therefore we have a number of activities that will support this business’s return on tangible equity performance. Remember also this business is a leading business in wholesale transaction banking. We’re the largest trade bank in the world for seven consecutive years. We’re a top-two bank in payments and a top-two bank in foreign exchange. We’re the largest bank in securities services across Asia and the Middle East, so we’re benefiting from an amazing transaction banking capability. We’re also benefiting from an amazing deposit franchise. As you’ve seen, this business is in the 50s percent loan-to-deposit ratio, and that is a highly stable and highly profitable proposition. So a lot of investment in this business is to support this direction of travel. I didn’t mention the activities such as debt capital markets, etc, which also remain core in the wider capital solutions we provide to our customers. On your second question about IWPB, I think you have to look at this business as one of the largest growth engines of this firm. Starting with Hong Kong, Hong Kong is on track to become the world’s largest cross-border wealth hub, ahead of Switzerland, by the end of this decade. We’re talking a few years. 800,000 new-to-bank customers, and we see this trend continuing. Then you look at various other parts of our network. Singapore is a major financial hub. The UAE has become a major wealth hub. We are the leading international wealth provider in mainland China and in India. So we continue to invest in these areas, and that investment will come in all forms, like more relationship managers, more wealth centres, more products on the shelf, more technology capabilities, and therefore, you have to expect that a lot of investment will go to this business, but this business is exhibiting already double-digit growth. This business, Wealth in particular, has grown more than 20% year on year, and if you look at Asia alone our Wealth business in 2024 has grown more than 30% year on year, and therefore it deserves a lot of investment, even if that means we will eat a little bit on our return growth because we want to really secure our future as a leading provider, and our brand in parts of the world, such as Asia and the Middle East, is frankly second to none and our capability to attract this. Cross-border is a very important area for us. Frankly, we have to punch at our weight. We’re punching below our weight in cross-border. Our customers are with us in a given location, and then we lose them as their wealth or part of their wealth moves to another location. By just setting the right referral mechanisms, the product capabilities cross-border, the internal incentives, there is so much we can capture. It’s our own customers. So the reach is fairly easy. It’s a self-help mechanism that we’re trying to just recover on. As for Zing, so Zing was a fantastic technology platform which we built and were rolling out to non-clients that we were building from scratch and built a few tens of thousands. What we did is we flipped it over its head, and we’re bringing in the technology platform right in the core proposition. As we roll this technology platform within our core proposition in the UK, 15 million clients will be able to benefit from it practically straight away, and we shouldn’t be preventing that. That, on the contrary, accelerates our acquisition of international customers. And then, as we start thinking, rolling these new technologies widely in our Wealth business, there’s a lot of potential we can get there. And that is a much faster gain than trying to build it from scratch in an area where we have non-customers working with a different brand than our very strong brand, HSBC.

Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Kian Abouhossein,Jp Morgan,"Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is related to the $1.5 billion reallocation of costs. I just wanted to understand a bit if you could talk around the revenues associated, the capital and the risk-weighted assets, so we get a bit of an idea of the optimisation of this capital, and secondly, also what the return on investment on this that you expect — you mentioned a high hurdle rate. And then the second question is more general to you, Georges. I mean, you are a CIB guy; you think about curveball issues all the time, spillover effects. So I’m quite interested about how you are planning for tariffs within the Group, and in particular how you’re thinking about the curveballs, not the direct impacts, but the indirect impacts that are impacting you from CRE to Wealth growth, etc, FX, and how you’re basically putting that in your planning on your outlook and sensitivities around that. Thanks.",True,1.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Georges Elhedery,Group Ceo,"Thank you, Kian. Okay. I’ll take the two questions, but if there are more details, additional granularity on CRE, I’m sure Pam can handle that, but I’ll just give you a general sense. So on your first question, $1.5 billion reallocation of costs, so what we did say is we would reallocate it from non-strategic or low-returning activities into activities where we have a competitive edge, where we have better returns, and where we have opportunities to grow. So you have to look at this as returns incremental. Just as an illustration, the wind-down of our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, US and Europe will give us $300 million of saves as we achieve them, that we can redeploy elsewhere. This cost was generating broadly break-even profits, so we’re marginally profitable in these activities. We do expect these to give us a much higher return as they’re reinvested, and we haven’t quantified that, but the expectation is that there’s an accretion of return. Second, if you look at the areas we’re looking to invest in, wealth, transaction banking, as big callouts, they are actually none or low balance sheet-consuming businesses. They’re materially fee and other income-driving businesses, with low, if any, impact on RWA growth. And if you look at the SME business, this business is essentially liability-driven and transaction banking- driven. The loans portion of this business is relatively small. The loan to deposit ratio is in the low-teens percentage points, which means, again, it’s a low RWA impact, high in Banking NII from deposits or transaction banking, but low RWA impact. In terms of your CIB curveball question, look, tariffs are not a new feature of global trade. There has always been various forms of tariffs on various products along various corridors, and we’ve always navigated those with our clients and supported them along the route. I think what’s changed now is maybe the speed at which the landscape will be evolving, the speed at which we may see new tariffs or changes in tariffs. But with the bank present on 85% of the trade corridors, with our global network, with our deep knowledge in all the markets where we operate, deep understanding of local rules and regulations, deep understanding of global rules and regulations, we’re actually very well placed to support our customers adjust and position their businesses to navigate these tariffs. Now, I add to that also, remember, most of the jurisdictions we operate in have pro-growth government policies. The UK is a good example, pro-growth government policy; the US is a very good example;. mainland China, pro-growth initiatives, consumer support initiatives. You look at Hong Kong, the removal of the cooling off measures on the commercial real estate or real estate in general. These measures have been effective, and we’re seeing the benefits in the economy and economic growth. So, there are a number of positive factors that also we can benefit from. We’ve seen that in January, by the way. The start of this year has been very encouraging. And look, the idea of all the simplification work we’ve done is that so we are simple, so we are agile, and agile means we can dynamically react and support our customers. And we will adapt quickly. We will react. We will make sure that we’re supporting our customers along these journeys. Thank you, Kian.",False,1.0,0

I just note that that hasn’t been mentioned in today’s update. What are your latest thoughts on your medium- term ambitions for the CET1 ratio and has there been any change in sentiment? And then, secondly, on costs in relation to your $1.5 billion of savings, you note that they will be taken to the bottom line, although presumably there’ll be offsets from drivers such as inflation. Maybe you could just clarify directionally what you expect the shape of costs will do coming out of 2025 and going into 2026 and 2027? Thank you.",True,2.0,0

And Ben, coming to your first question, we are very comfortable operating between the 14% to 14.5% range. The comment on looking at it again was removed some time ago, so no change for now in that respect. I want to just unbundle a little bit more on the cost point. So on the cost point, if you look at the guidance that we have, and this is the $1.5 billion of cost savings that are going straight to the bottom line. So the way we’ve looked at it is that it’s about 4%, if you look at inflation, as well as BAU investment. The benefit of that $1.5 billion this year that we are taking straight to the bottom line is $300 million. So if you compare to on a target basis, and you’re starting excluding disposals and hyperinflation, you start from 2024, it’s going to be a 3% year-on-year growth. So that’s what we are looking at. Now, severance and other one-off costs, they will be treated as notable items. Now, the timing of the $1.5 billion, yes, is $300 million this year. There’ll be more to come, clearly, in 2026.

I think, as a CEO, your feeling must be quite insightful. The second is about the new business areas you mentioned, along with your reform. I think many of them are non-capital consuming.

I’ll take your first question, and I’ll ask Pam to address your second question. So, look, trade and wealth. First, it’s very difficult to predict what will happen to global trade in an uncertain environment, but what we can say is, for the last eight years, that trade has started to become more disrupted. Global trade has continued growing, low-single-digit percentage points. The trade routes have reconfigured. ASEAN has become the largest trading partner of China, ahead of the US and Europe. We’ve seen more intra-regional trade pick up. We’ve seen more fragmentation of trade routes. So rather than the goods moving from point A to point B from, say, manufacturing to consumption, they’re usually going through multiple legs on the journey, across various other jurisdictions. Now, it so happens that we still have expectations that global trade will grow at low-single-digit percentage points. And it so happens that this reconfiguration segmentation is playing to our strength, because many of these new jurisdictions that have become major participants in global trade are jurisdictions where we have deep presence and, in some cases, leading presence as an international bank, and we are able to capture these flows and we will be supporting our customers along these routes. In wealth, again, if you look at various analysts and consultants’ consideration, Asia and Middle East wealth is expected to grow at high single digit into 10% CAGR for the next five years. So the underlying trend of the growth of the middle class in many of these Asian economies is there. And simply being a leading bank in this space, we benefit from this underlying trend, but what we are doing is we also want to increase our market share because, in some areas, apart from Hong Kong, where we’ve really been a leading player, in other places, we’ve been punching below our weight. And the idea is to be able to step up our product capabilities, our customer reach, the various metrics, which I shared in the slide without repeating. And the additional investment is not only to capture the underlying trend, but also to grow to our more natural share. This will be focused essentially on Asia and the Middle East. We recognise there are other pockets of wealth that will be important for us, but we’re not going to be a wealth player in the US because we don’t have the right to win. Pam.",False,3.0,0

So just in terms of our focus on both NII and fee income, clearly, as we sit today, our NII, given our strong balance sheet, deposit base, loans and advances, is a much bigger proportion of earnings compared to fee income. But given the guidance we’ve just shared with you, that we are looking at double-digit growth in Wealth over the medium term, even though it’s on a smaller base, whereas on loans and advances, we are looking at a mid-single-digit growth in the medium term. So that balance will tilt, but I won’t go over my skates just as yet because the baseline starting point is so much bigger for balance sheet-driven business as opposed to fee income, but in direction of travel, absolutely. And also, the two things are a bit correlated. Hopefully, with your customers, when you do more, it’s not just balance sheet-related products. You do more fee income-driven.

My first question is related to the capital distribution. Thank you for elaborating on the capital distribution hierarchy, but I recognise that you are guiding to a mid-teens RoTE for the next three years, but only a 50% dividend payout for 2025. So what are the implications behind it? And we can see the bank’s share price is above one-times price to book, so will that affect your future consideration between buybacks and maybe raise the dividend payout? And the second question is on the loan growth. HSBC has been consistently guiding to a mid- single-digit loan growth for the medium to long term, but it’s still very challenging in the near term. So what circumstances do you think might be necessary for the bank to finally hit the target, and to what extent is that loan growth assumption baked into our Banking NII guidance?

I’ll ask Pam to address both questions. Let me share some insight on capital distribution. Look, with a mid-teens return guidance, there’s plenty of space to do the 50% dividend payout ratio and to support the businesses to grow, which has always been the priority use of additional capital. But as you said, loan growth hasn’t been there for the last many quarters, and the opportunity for us was to return the excess capital through share buybacks. It remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through share buybacks, because we see this also as a means to create an accretion in our earnings per share and dividends per share, by reducing the share count. Pam?",False,4.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thank you, Georges. Firstly, in terms of our views on the 50% earnings per share, we are very comfortable with that number, and as you can see, we look at obviously distribution but also opportunities for growth that we can deploy our surplus capital. I’m very pleased that we are trading above tangible book value, and we absolutely don’t consider the tangible book value to be a ceiling for our buybacks. Share buybacks will continue to be our preferred mode of distribution going forward. The other thing on dividends is that you obviously have to look at where your CET1 is at a point of time. You have to look at regulatory changes. For now 50%, we’re very comfortable with. Now, in terms of your next question on loan growth, we need to unbundle it a little bit. Yes, loan growth is flat. It was down $3 billion in Hong Kong, up $3 billion for the rest of Asia, up $1 billion for the UK, down $1 billion for the rest of the world. We are optimistic that as the interest rate trajectory stabilises there will be customer demand, and when there’s customer demand we’ll be there obviously to support our customers. But what’s also really important is as we’re seeing that from a Hong Kong perspective there is some momentum coming back, we expect at least the loan trajectory in Hong Kong to stabilise and not reduce. Once that happens, given the other breakdown I’ve given you, that gives us more optimism in terms of loan growth.",False,4.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Andy Coombs,Citigroup,"Good morning. If I can have two follow-ups, please, firstly on the capital return and secondly on the costs. On the buybacks, if you could just clarify, the $2 billion is obviously a step down from $3 billion. Should we think about that as a permanent step down, given that you now need to absorb these upfront restructuring charges, or does the $2 billion reflect a shorter timing period between Q4 and Q1 results compared to other quarters? That’s the first question. The second question, I want to have another stab at the costs. Ben asked about this. I think the walk to 2025 is very clear, but if we then think about the walk to 2026, should we assume a similar level of inflation and investment? Is 4% a fair assumption for future years in your view as well? Then when we eyeball slide 29, which has that cost phasing, and it looks like there’s a $600-700 million step up in the cost saves in 2026, before the full run rate is recognised in 2027. So are we looking at a 4% increase in 2026 from that 2025 guide, less another incremental $700 million of cost saves, so a sub-$34 billion cost number? Anything you can give us in terms of how to frame, more explicitly, that 2026 and 2027 cost base would be really helpful. Thank you.",False,4.0,0

Let me deal with your capital question, and I’ll ask Pam to talk you through cost. But remember, we only guided return on tangible equity for 2026 and 2027. We haven’t given additional specific guidance. Look, on capital, $2 billion because we have two months until April and that amount will be reviewed on a case-by-case, quarter-by-quarter basis. We do not pre-commit on any future amounts. It will depend on the outlook and the loan growth and other parameters as we get to it.

Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thank you, Georges. In terms of cost, we are not giving a cost guidance beyond full-year 2025. The big moving parts always when we look at our cost is what’s the underlying inflation, staff costs and we also track very closely what’s the increase in fixed pay from a staff cost perspective. So it was expected 3.6% in 2025. It was 4.4% in 2024, so you can see the trajectory shifting as obviously inflation is coming down. We also include in that 4%, and we have for 2025, additional investments, so you can do the maths in terms of where we go to for 2026. But also let’s be mindful, so far we’re saying for 2025 we are only taking $300 million of the $1.5 billion down to the savings line, so there is an absolute tailwind for the rest of it coming through for 2026, so that’s how the maths works. As we go into 2027, I would expect two things to happen. You’ll see some normalisation on the inflation and the underlying built number. We will have the BAU investment, so that continues the same building block, but what’s important is even though the $1.5 billion has been taken down to the bottom line we expect through our simplification some of the additional efficiency costs beyond just FTE-related costs, i.e. the ways of working, so that will give us some tailwind, but obviously not to the same extent as you’ve had in 2026.",False,4.0,0

One is, again, just when you’re talking about the mid-teens RoTE target, so this year on a reported basis it was 14.6%, on ex. notable items 16%. I just wanted to see, are you thinking about that more in line with the underlying ex. notable items level that you’ve achieved this year and that you can maintain that given the cost savings and wealth management growth that you’re targeting, or are you looking at it closer to the reported number that you achieved in 2024? Then secondly, I just wanted to dig in a bit more in terms of the potential revenue impact or lack of from the cost actions, including the re-prioritisation, just to understand how you’re thinking about the marginal or negligible revenue impact. Is that because you just expect the revenue growth elsewhere from the reallocation of cost, or how you’re thinking about that? Thank you.",True,5.0,0

I’ll take your first question and I’ll ask Pam to address your second question about how we’re looking to phase cost and the reallocation and the revenue impact of that. Look, it’s quite simple for the first question. What we mean by mid-teens is around 14% to 16%, and our target is on return on tangible equity excluding notable items. This is how you should look at it. Pam?",False,5.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thank you, Georges and Amit. Just adding a little bit to the RoTE question, mid- teens is mid-teens, what it says on the tin: 14 to 16%. It’s a target and obviously, if the world’s in a better place, there is an upside, but you also have to look at the downside and that’s how we look at all scenarios in our assumptions. Coming back to your second question on the $1.5 billion. Firstly I want to clarify, the first $1.5 billion, which is simplification savings, has no revenue impact because it’s literally more senior roles, deduplication, simplifying the matrix. On that, there is no revenue impact and the whole savings is a tailwind which goes straight to the bottom line. On the second $1.5 billion, which is different, it is clearly a reallocation, which will happen from the individual business level, but we will take it all to the Group level. Now, when you take it all to the Group level, there is going to be some time lag between the cost coming up and re-investing, but we do think that the payback period is pretty quick because we know it’s in existing areas we want to reinvest. So that time lag on the revenue should not be that long and that will get compensated. But as we have said before, we are taking this reallocation of cost, particularly from two areas: ones where we are sub-scale, and so materially it doesn’t really make an impact in terms of your profit – they’re small-scale divestments – but there are others where in terms of profitability they are not materially profitable, like we said on the investment bank. Therefore, as we take them through into new areas with higher returns and being very focused on those which are our competitive strengths, we do think that positivity will come back pretty quickly.",False,5.0,0

I would like to ask about the second $1.5 billion. Have we factored that in in the mid-teens RoTE guidance? Because when we are exiting some business, we need some regulatory approval and it’s hard to gauge the timeline. What assumptions do we have regarding these parts in our mid-teens RoTE guidance? The underlying question is will we see some upside, because if we do it faster or slower? The second one, I still want to ask about CRE question. I think it’s an old question, but I think we still have a lot of people, a lot of investors care about it. Both in Hong Kong and China in last quarter we heard some events which led to some concerns on these areas. If I look at our Q4 numbers, I know that some are edging up on the ECL charges. Is any parts of that related to CRE and what is our outlook on CRE in both regions? Thank you.",True,6.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Georges Elhedery,Group Ceo,"Thank you, Katherine. I’m going to ask Pam to address both your questions but let me share with you just briefly my outlook on the CRE situation. So firstly, in mainland China we believe that we’ve hit a trough, really, in the challenges that the sector has faced. We believe the measures that have been taken to stabilise and start a normalisation process are working their way effectively through the economy. But more importantly, our exposure has materially reduced and therefore it is not going to be any more any major driver for our ECL. Second, about Hong Kong. We’re actually positive about the outlook of Hong Kong. Hong Kong, first the economy and certainly rate trajectory is going to support that, we’re seeing growth manifest in 2024, in growth outlook in 2025 and a number of sectors really have revived. But also in the CRE space, the underlying CRE market in Hong Kong is strong and resilient. The supply/demand equation is very supportive for the medium to long term and as we said, the rate outlook will also support that. But then if you look at our exposure to many of the borrowers in the space, the borrowers are much stronger and much less leveraged than what we’ve seen in the China CRE space. They are in a better balance sheet position, albeit they may have cash flow challenges due to high rates, etc, but the loan to valuation we have on our exposure is also very strong. We are in the 50s percent. Therefore, we do not think the Hong Kong CRE exposure in our books will be any material driver of our future ECLs. Pam can address your questions on cost and take you more specifically in the CRE elements.",False,6.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thank you for your question. Firstly, yes, we have factored the reallocation into our mid-teens RoTE guidance, and we’ll work as quickly as we can to reallocate costs to higher- return areas. Obviously, if it is faster than our assumptions – we tend to be a bit conservative, which is good space to be in – there’ll be some upside. But given regulatory approvals, etc, things can be slower. But all in all, we are still very comfortable to have a mid-teens RoTE for each of the next three years. I’ll take the China CRE question first, and then I’ll do Hong Kong CRE. Now China CRE, we’ve always been very comfortable with our onshore exposure, which has been secured. The issue really has been with the offshore exposure, which was unsecured, but that number is way down from where we started. We are now down to $2.2 billion net of ECLs, and, out of that, there is very little of the exposures where we feel that there is more headwind. And as you can see, the chart for ECL last year was much lower than the prior years. So that gives me a sense of optimism with regard to the trajectory of the China CRE outlook. And of course, you can have one-off cases, and things move on, but, overall, it’s based upon our exposure. Now, on Hong Kong CRE, just as a starting point, as long as the interest rate trajectory is high, of course you can see some customers facing headwinds, because it’s a cash flow issue, fundamentally, and that makes you bring more names into the stage 3s. But what’s very important to note is that, despite them coming into stage 3s, our ECLs haven’t increased, and the answer is quite simple. Most of the names coming through the stage 3s last year have been from a secured portfolio, which is 54% of our total portfolio. And as Georges said, there’s a very high level of collateralisation. Average LTV on sub-standard is 46% and, on the impaired, is at 58%, so there’s enough room in that space and there is strong collateral. So even when they go to stage 3, there is not an ECL increase, and the ECL increase this year has been minimal and we see nothing changing there. On the unsecured, 90% of it is investment grade, so 46% of portfolio is unsecured; 90% is investment grade. And it’s primarily with the conglomerates and strong developers and, because they have diversified cash flows, the inflow into stage 3 from this portion of the book is very small. So all in all, even though, with the increase in stage 3s, you see a minimal uplift in RWAs and the capital impact, but a very small capital impact, from an ECL perspective, there is really no material change in the ECL trajectory at this point of time, and we are very comfortable that it’s all well within our mid-term guidance of 30-40 basis points.",False,6.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Aman Rakkar,Barclays,"Good morning, Pam. Good morning, Georges. I had two questions. I think you’re pointing to much better pre-provision profit outlook than consensus. I guess we’ve laboured the discussion around costs, but my takeaway is that it is broadly flattish beyond 2025, and maybe a bit of growth, but well lower than where the street is. I think Banking NII guidance also speaks for itself, so there are two related questions to that. One is around non-interest income. There’s a lot of moving parts on non-interest income, but I think you’re coming in with significant momentum on non-interest income, in excess of consensus, but we do have a lot of moving parts there. Is there anything you can do to help us? I know you don’t like to talk too much about non-interest income, because there’s volatile line items in it, but you’ve got double-digit growth momentum in wealth management, trade that’s probably growing low to mid-single digits. Who knows what markets do, but they’re probably not going backwards. Then you’ve got a retail piece as well. But it just does feel like that is something that is trending well in excess. So if you were able to comment in respect of 2025 consensus, that would be really helpful. The second is about Banking NII. So the $42 billion guidance this year is great. And I know there’s a lot of focus on lending, but really it’s deposits that matter, right? You alluded to the strength of your franchise. And loans are going to be subdued for a while, but deposits are already growing and, indeed, they’re going to continue growing from here. Can you try and help us with that? Are you able to quantify the deposit growth and average interest-earning asset growth that we might look to expect? Because I think you can comfortably grow your balance sheet despite a subdued demand dynamic in your key markets. I think that would helps underpin the Banking NII beyond 2025. My last question, then, is around FX and if you were to mark to market any of the cost guidance, for example, for the spot FX rate, if that would affect any of your guidance or commentary today, that would be really helpful. Thanks so much.",True,8.0,0

I’ll ask Pam to handle your Banking NII question and the FX question, which will have an impact on our Banking NII guidance. I’ll take your first question by saying, ‘Nice try’. Unfortunately, I cannot give you more than what we shared. What we’ve shared is a confidence that we’re running the bank towards a mid-teens target on return on tangible equity excluding notable items for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We’re also guiding to a medium-term outlook on Wealth at double-digit growth, which we’re comfortable with, given this is an area where we’re investing in and we see the underlying trends supportive, but this is more a medium-term guidance. It’s difficult to evaluate what it means on a year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter basis. And we’re also comfortable that our wholesale transaction banking – given our strong leadership position in many of these areas, we will be able to ride the wave, and we think the wave – the macro is in a low-single-digit percentage growth. It’s subject to possible disruptions, but the underlying trend, if you look at global trade with all forms of corridors – not just some of the disrupted corridors – other corridors are likely to continue growing. I think this is how you should look at it. And remember the rate trajectory as well. It’s still uncertain, but that will be a way if we see faster rate cuts than we’ve implied.

Presentation Transcripts\2024\250220-annual-results-to-investors-and-analysts-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2024,Annual,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thank you, Aman. So firstly, our cost guidance is on a constant currency basis, so clearly, from an FX perspective, there could be an impact. In terms of the $42 billion guidance, you’re right. On loans, we say it’s mid-single-digit growth in the medium term, and lower rates will help to get some momentum back, but it’s also driven by overall market confidence, so I can’t really call out the timing of the return to loan growth exactly. Now, deposits, clearly, was a key one in the fourth quarter, but we know that, in the fourth quarter, there’s a bit of a seasonality effect, so I would very much caution you against annualising that number. But I think, in terms of deposits, if I look at just the drivers for the $42 billion guidance, there’s interest rates, which is a headwind at this point of time, given the market-implied rate curves, and then there is the structural hedge, which will be a tailwind. The loans, we have talked about. On deposits, we feel very lucky to have a strong deposit base, as you’ve said, and the trust of our customers to give us those deposits is a cornerstone for our strong balance sheet. The deposit benefit for next year is driven by what’s going to be the time deposit mix, because that held through in the fourth quarter. As the interest rates come down, we expect the time deposit mix to also come down. So in that context, you can factor that in as part of your overall calculation in terms of the headwinds and the tailwinds.",False,8.0,0

I’m Fas Yousaf, Group Treasurer, and I’m joined by Greg Case, Head of Debt Investor Relations, and Mark Phin, Head of Equity Investor Relations. I’ll keep my opening remarks brief as I’m sure you’ve had a chance to go through the results already today. As usual, there’s a comprehensive deck for fixed income investors available on our website. I So, we’re pleased with our strong 2024 results, which sets us up well for 2025 as we celebrate our 160th year. We’ve delivered record profit before tax of 32.3 billion or 34.1 billion excluding notable items. The return on tangible equity was 14.6%, or 16% excluding notable items, in line with our mid-teens RoTE guidance. We announced a total of 26.9 billion of distribution to our shareholders in respect of ’24, while retaining a CET1 ratio above our target operating range. In the fourth quarter, we announced actions to simplify HSBC. In pairing our two home markets, the UK and Hong Kong, we’ve enhanced the focus on our wealth proposition via the creation of international Wealth and Premier Banking, IWPB for short, and combined our two wholesale businesses, Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, into one Corporate and Institutional Banking division, CIB. Furthermore, today we’ve announced a commitment to deliver cost efficiency savings of $1.5 billion over the next two years that will have no meaningful impact on revenue. We are also aiming to reallocate around $1.5 billion of additional costs, from the non-strategic activities to priority growth areas over the medium term. As an outcome of these actions, we have confidence that we will generate a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, ’26 and ’27. HSBC continues to be strongly capital generative, with profits delivering 340 basis points of CET1 in ’24, which have largely been used to fund both dividends and buybacks to support our equity investment case. Our CET1 ratio of 14.9% remains above our target operating range of 14% to 14.5%, and you should expect us to bring it down back to this level over time. At the mid-point of our target operating range, we will have over 300 basis points of headroom above our MDA hurdle requirement. We have built up our structural hedge by more than $200 billion since June ’22, which has contributed to our sensitivity to our 100 basis point fall in interest rate, dropping by more than half. During ’24, we also increased a duration of the hedge from 2.8 to 3.1 years, and we will reinvest around 95 billion of assets in each of ’25 and ’26, which currently have a yield of around 2.8%. Excluding the impacts of the sales of our businesses in Canada and Argentina, the Banking NII quarterly run rate has been fairly stable through 2024, and we expect Banking NII of around 42 billion in 2025. This is based on the current market interest rate outlook, and our own growth projections. Now turning to credit quality, the ECL charge for the year was $3.4 billion, or 36 basis points as a cost of risk, which is in the middle of our 30 to 40 basis point guidance. The fourth quarter charge was 1.4 billion or 57 basis points, which included 0.3 billion related to two clients – one in the UK and one in the mainland China commercial real estate sector. We expect our 2025 charge to be within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. Stage three balances were 2.4% of customer loans, broadly stable in the fourth quarter, but up from 2% at the end of ’23. The increase during the year was driven by our Hong Kong commercial real estate book, which had a limited impact on the ECL charge due to the high levels of collateralisation of this lending. Next, moving onto the balance sheet and issuance. As I noted earlier, our CET1 position is a strong point at 14.9%. Our MREL ratio was 32.1%, broadly flat on the year-end, 4.8 percentage points above our requirement. This morning, alongside results, we published an additional announcement affecting some of our legacy Tier 2 debt, and one of our older senior holdco notes. In order to ensure we avoid infecting our remaining Tier 2 securities at the end of the CRR grandfathering period in June, we have proactively chosen to stop recognising $4.3 billion of legacy Tier 2 securities as both Tier 2 and MREL. In addition, for consistency, we’ve also chosen to stop recognising a $750 million senior holdco note as MREL. Both of these actions are effective immediately and will reduce our MREL ratio by 54 basis points. Moving onto liquidity, the Group retains a large and well-diversified deposit base, with strong levels of liquidity. We have a total deposit base of $1.7 trillion, and our loan-to-deposit ratio is 56%. Across our two home markets, our deposit base continues to skew significantly more toward current and savings accounts than we see across the broader market. We hold $0.8 trillion in high-quality liquid assets, and the Group LCR was 138%. As you will have heard me say before, the group consolidated LCR is calculated using conservative assumptions. We primarily manage liquidity at the subsidiary level, and our major subsidiaries all operate with LCRs that are significantly higher than the Group ratio. Finally, onto issuance. Last year we continued to focus on diversifying our currency mix and proactively managing our maturity profile via liability management. Two-thirds of our holdco senior issuance was in US dollars, and we are particularly pleased with the reception we received in Singapore dollar and Australian dollar. We expect our issuance plan in ’25 will be similar to last year, and net issuance needs will be modest. We will continue to look for opportunities to diversify our issuance, utilising our broad name recognition, particularly across Asia. Starting with holdco senior, we expect to issue around 16-18 billion, against maturities and calls of around 14 billion. In Tier 2, we expect $2-3 billion, against just under 3 billion of maturities. In AT1, we are planning for around $3-4 billion. We have recently announced the call of our only AT1 due this year, which will remove $2.5 billion in March. So, wrapping up before handing off to Q&A, another strong year which, combined with our increased focus on simplification and efficiency, sets us up to continue to deliver strong returns as we look out. We maintain prudent capital, liquidity and funding positions, and we have modest net issuance needs in ’25. On that note, let’s open the call up for the Q&A, Greg?",False,-1.0,1

Perhaps in answering that, perhaps I’ll take a step back and just explain why we made the decision today and a little bit about the background. So as you know, Greg, and I think many people on the call will know, we undertook a liability management exercise on the securities in ’22, which allowed us to reduce the overall stack from around $6.7 billion to the current level, which is $4.3 billion. So, we took out about a third, and a number of that was through participation from our core investors. We would’ve ideally liked to have that number be higher, but in looking at it after the event, we realised that a good chunk of the issuance sits with investors who are either unable to sell or unwilling to sell. We were at the point where we’ve continued to evaluate it since ’22, and these securities will, at the end of the grandfathering period, the CRR grandfathering period, as I said in the prepared remarks, in June ’25, would have posed an infection risk. So, we took the opportunity now to take the action and derecognise them. That was in liaison with the regulator, getting formal permissions, and was an internal call. In doing that we had actually prepared for a long while – we do these things over a number of quarters in terms of our overall Tier 2 stacks – so to the question that’s been asked, it won’t affect our future issuance plan. We’d already prepared for the actions that we’ve taken today, and indeed we wanted to take these actions today to provide clarity as quickly as possible to our investor base and to remove any questions about the infection risk that would’ve arisen had we not derecognised the securities. So, no changes to the funding plan – overall very comfortable with where we are in Tier 2.",False,-1.0,1

Presentation Transcripts\2024\250221-fy-2024-fixed-income-investor-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,Annual,Daniel David,Autonomous,"Congratulations on the results and thanks for taking my questions. I have three. The first one is just on legacy and just touching on some of the points you’ve just made. I’m interested, noting the derecognition, how should we think about these bonds now in resolution? What are they treated as? I guess why I’m asking is, is the Bank of England happy with you including these bonds as non-regulatory capital and MREL; i.e. are they pushing for you to reduce further rather than just to put them in a bucket, which gets rid of infection risk? And then maybe adding to legacy, in the past you’ve mentioned your priorities here. I think that the sterling make-whole, the “5.844s”, is the most focused on or most talked about bond. Is there any update with this, given you made whole with the dollar last year? The second one, on a slightly different topic, which you might be pleased to hear – one of your large Swiss peers brought up the subject of double leverage again, and I know we’ve talked about this in the past with HSBC. Looking at your accounts, I know that double leverage looks to be above 100% just at a high level. Is this being managed to that sort of level? Is this a priority for the PRA and what are the limits here? And then finally, more broadly, on one of the popular topics, I’m looking at slide 39 and the CRE exposure in Hong Kong. I note the comments on the call earlier. I’m just interested if you could give any guidance on where you think that stage three ratio could go and also the balance in Hong Kong ex-China – is there going to be a further push to reduce that balance? Any information would be interesting, thanks.",True,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\250221-fy-2024-fixed-income-investor-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,Annual,Faisal Yousaf,Group Treasurer,"Okay, thank you, Dan. There’s quite a lot there, but let me try and unpack it and give you answers to all three of your questions. So starting with legacy – so I’ll take it in the order you’ve given the questions. Starting with legacy and the derecognition, the way we look at these securities is we still believe these securities will be able to absorb losses in resolution. That’s always been the case and nothing has changed from our perspective. We’ve had to take the actions we’ve taken today to avoid the infection risk – that would have been automatic in June ’25 – but it’s still our belief that they’re there to absorb losses. In terms of the other part of that question, which is interactions with the Bank of England, yes, we have been interacting with the Bank of England. We’ve done this – we’ve sought the necessary approvals to do what we do, and we continue to liaise with the regulator on all such matters. The Bank of England, though, are keen, as we are, for us to reduce our legacy stack, and perhaps I’ll use this to jump onto the next part of the question, which is that we’ve taken a number of actions over past three years, really since the beginning of ’22, to reduce that stack. It’s gone from in excess of $14 billion to just over $7 billion now, and we’re committed over time to continue that reduction, but we’ve always said that whatever we do needs to be appropriate and proportionate, and that’s the same language and form of language that the Bank of England uses on such matters. So when we look at the securities in our legacy stack – we’ll evaluate them as time goes, and we’ve taken actions. You talked a little bit about if the security that we called in September of last year – so that was a make-whole security with a coupon in excess of 10%, and in evaluating that we looked at a number of factors. We looked at the coupon, the economics around it. We were also very conscious about our investor base and the sentiment coming from our investor base. The economics, though, are important, and we need to balance the investor sentiment with those of shareholders. In that case, for the holding issuance, dollar issuance, we were able to justify making the decision and calling the security. At the same time, as you might imagine, we looked at the other one, the 5.844 that you’ve talked about, and the situation there was a little bit different, and I think it’s probably safe for you to assume without security the economics just weren’t conducive at that time. Now, we’ll continue to keep this under evaluation. We’re quite aware that we’ve got a number of our core investor base in those securities, so we’ll keep on evaluating it. That’s a longwinded answer, but hopefully it’s thorough enough for your first question. I believe your second question was on double leverage, and my comment on that is we do use double leverage to reflect the fact that our subsidiaries often have higher capital requirements than they do when consolidated in the group. Our double leverage position really is not a concern for us. It’s within our risk appetite and we expect it to remain there. We have had conversations over time with regulators, ratings agencies, all of whom are comfortable with the level that we run and indeed our risk appetite, and we align to PRA policy on the matter. The final thing I’d say is, in respect of double leverage, we do hold a significant amount of liquidity at the holding company, so that’s in excess of $20 billion, and that’s to manage any cash flow risk. So overall on double leverage nothing of concern from our perspective. Then finally, getting on to your third question, so CRE in Hong Kong and the overall stage three balances, as I think your question alluded to, the stage three balances have picked up in 2024. We reported 2.4% of gross loans as stage three, but that did not impact our overall ECLs materially, and that’s largely because the books that we have in Hong Kong CRE have a low LTV and therefore, although they go into non-performing, they don’t lead to or haven’t led to credit losses, and overall the book – we’re very comfortable with the nature of the book in our Hong Kong business. I think that’s probably answered your question, but I’ll just open it up to Greg to see whether he wanted to add anything to any of that, in particular the CRE piece.",False,0.0,0

It will always be relatively hard to predict because obviously it’s inflows and outflows. You’ll see in the fourth quarter, for example, that there was a small inflow in Hong Kong commercial real estate to stage three. It was lower than we’d seen in Q2 and Q3, but we did have some write-offs in the mainland China real estate book, so it really will be a game of in and out, but we do have our eye very clearly on it.",False,0.0,0

So, we don’t have any raised hands at the moment, so please do raise your hand if you do have a question, but in the interim we do have a written submitted question from Lee Street at Citi. Sorry we can’t hear your voice, Lee. So two questions for you, Fas. So, firstly, from a business model perspective, can we presume that the current Group is close to an end state – i.e. we should not be expecting any more significant disposals and any acquisitions? Would small bolt-on acquisitions, i.e. less than 5% of group assets, be something you’d look at?",False,0.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2024\250221-fy-2024-fixed-income-investor-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,Annual,Faisal Yousaf,Group Treasurer,"Okay, so thank you, Lee. The way we think about acquisitions or actually surplus capital was laid out by Georges in the meeting earlier today, the investment presentation to analysts first thing this morning. We talked about using that capital in three real ways: first of all, to pay our dividends; second, in terms of the growth of balance sheet; and thirdly in terms of buy-back or acquisitions, and really that was the order of prioritisation. The way we think about acquisitions in general is that any acquisitions we make need to meet the return hurdles of the group. We’ll need to consider the impact in terms of management overhead of any acquisitions and the ease or otherwise of integrating anything within HSBC. We’ve always said we are open to consider bolt-on acquisitions, but only if they make sense for HSBC, so nothing has really changed there. In terms of the other part of your question, if I caught it correctly, the cost piece, [inaudible] is two parts to our cost plan, so we intend to take $1.5 billion out in terms of cost efficiencies within the group, and that will go straight to the bottom line in terms of saves for the group as a whole, but we also announced a further $1.5 billion, which is around streamlining some of the activity that we do within the group, repositioning businesses, and that is work that is ongoing. Pam listed in her set-piece presentation this morning two or three examples. We announced, for example, that we were disposing of our retail banking operations in Bahrain, and we announced earlier this year that the French insurance business will be an area that we look to dispose of. That’s in addition to prior disposals in ’24. So there continues to be a focus on things that will benefit the group strategy in terms of acquisitions or disposals and really we’ll announce them when they come.",False,0.0,0

So on this point we have had a number of conversations with various index providers and we are very cognisant that the primary index that’s in people’s minds is the JP Morgan so-called “JACI” index that one of our notable peers entered a couple of years ago. From our standpoint, as we understand it, the main yardstick they are looking at is the proportion of our total balance sheet that sits in EM countries. Now, you can look at that in a number of different ways, and of course JP Morgan will do that in their way. As we understand it, at this stage we are not at the level at which we would be eligible for inclusion, but of course that decision will always be down to JP Morgan, as they consider the balancing and the weight. So, yeah, we’ll wait and see on that, and nothing new to give you there. Of course, I’m sure JP Morgan would be happy to have that conversation with you, if you need to.

First, on Hong Kong, you talk about the unsecured portion, which appears to be long-held properties, probably generational. Despite the fact that interest rates have gone up and there are some questions about some of these buildings, have those entities – families, etc – who have owned these properties for quite some time, made a commitment or at least indicated that they’re willing to support these properties through an interest rate environment? If not, you talk about low LTV and that these are secured. If they do in fact want to negotiate handing over the keys or some other kind of arrangement, are there other buyers for these kinds of properties in Hong Kong today? I could use a little education on that. And then second question is on UK opportunity. Ring-fenced margin is pretty wide. What do you see the opportunity there in terms of the go forward? Is it margin expansion? Is it product expansion? Are there some geographies or segments that you don’t feel like you have enough market share? If you could outline that, I’d greatly appreciate it.

Just on the Hong Kong piece, this is a wide and varied book. Pam went through some of the details of it, Pam, our new CFO, on the call this morning, but, just for background, a few points. As you noted, 54% of the Hong Kong domestic book is secured and the remainder is unsecured. The secured piece is where we’ve typically seen the flow into stage three so far, and the LTVs there remain strong. So in the impaired book, which was around 4.6 billion at the year-end, 58% LTV on that component, and that’s clearly why you’ve seen very, very minimal levels of ECL coming off those flows into stage three so far. To give you some context in terms of the next stage up in terms of credit criteria, what we class as substandard, so the credit grading just above impaired – that book right now is about $3.7 billion and has a 46% LTV, so again, to the extent that we see further deterioration in ratings and a potential move into stage three, we do continue to have pretty strong LTV protection. The unsecured piece, as you note, is more toward the conglomerate-type large developers, who are often listed and well rated. In fact, 90% of that book, as it stands, is currently rated equivalent to an investment-grade rating with an external credit rating. So in that book what we’ve seen is typically quite a competitive market to lend to those types of names, and I think we’re more than happy to continue to support that sector. So I’ll leave it at that at this stage.",False,0.0,0

Actually, I might just add a few comments on Hong Kong more broadly. We have, as you know, Rob, seen headwinds in the Hong Kong commercial real estate market, where some of our clients have faced some debt servicing challenges, but there’s a number of things that provide reasons for optimism. Hong Kong has proven over some time how highly resilient it is, and there are a number of new growth areas that are emerging. It continues to offer a bridge, for example, for outbound revenue from China to the rest of the world. Hong Kong is building stronger links across ASEAN and also the Middle East. We know about its status as a financial hub and the regulatory foundations, but also, as was called out in the call this morning, we see a number of structural opportunities in wealth management, and we believe Hong Kong is really well positioned, actually, to become the world’s leading cross-border wealth hub over the next decade or so, so HSBC is well positioned to capture those opportunities as they arise. As rates start to go down, it’s my expectation that that pressure on clients that are facing debt service challenges will relax somewhat, so we’ll keep an eye on that, and we’re here to support our customers through that journey.

However, we are always looking to see opportunities to diversify, especially when the funding spreads are good. I think this year we’ll be looking at the usual markets, so sterling, euro, potentially Swissy, Sing, Aussie as areas where diversification could occur. On AT1, I would say we’ve probably got a strong preference for US dollars largely because of the FX exposure that it generates, and when we don’t use FX – so where we don’t go for US dollar and we have some cross-currency risk, it will be where we have the opportunity to downstream into an entity that has a functional currency that matches the AT1 that we issue.",False,0.0,0

So I’m just wondering – I’m noting the big cash balance you have at the holdco. Is there anything driving this? Are you expecting MREL requirements to go up, for instance?

At the results presentation, you said that you were, I think – I don’t remember the word, but optimistic or had the view that, with low interest rates, the Hong Kong loan growth would stabilise. We’re seeing some clearing in commercial real estate, which, for me, suggests that maybe it’s going to take a while longer. Is there anything you’re seeing on the ground that gives you that optimism? And where I’m coming from is, if loan growth is going to be positive, then I think the $42 billion NII guidance looks conservative, so I’m trying to reconcile – if rates are going to take longer to come down and loan growth is not that bad, maybe there’s a missing piece, and I think it might be loan growth, but I’m happy to be corrected. And then the second question is on the reallocation. You’ve obviously called out the $1.5 billion and given some colour on the revenues, but are there any capital-intensive businesses further down the line that we could look forward to in terms of RWA savings that you could reallocate?

So, firstly, the NII – our current best estimate for the year, we are holding that at $42 billion. There is a lot of benefit from deposits, not just from loan growth. In terms of Hong Kong loan growth, you’re right. There’s no specific signs to call out. The only thing I’d said was that, in January, there had been a bit of pick-up of volume and price stabilisation, but we have to see it in the context of coming from a very low base, so I wouldn’t run too fast with it for now, which doesn’t say that, from our own book’s perspective, an ECL perspective, we consider there to be any material headwinds. So that’s the picture, but I would wait a little longer to see how the loan growth comes through. And also, from loan growth, there are broader factors to consider: global, macro, uncertainties and a bit more predictability and confidence needed in the market to go for capex rather than opex spend. So I would keep to the $42 billion, as we’ve said. In terms of the reallocation, just to remind, the reallocation really comes from those businesses which are either sub-scale or not strategic, so there’s nothing specific, from an RWA perspective, which is highly concentrated, that’s being considered as part of that picture.

We are not giving any more guidance on that reallocation, and the reason is quite simple: for the first $1.5 billion, we know it’s direct FTE savings from the reorganisation, named teams, etc, so therefore, the severances are straight through. In the other one, it’s not related to just changes in market participation or shrinking footprint. There could be sales.

I presume you’re talking about the NII sensitivity to a 100 basis point move. There was a marginal uptick from Q3 to Q4. I think the first point I would make is that there will be slight variations in that as things happen, and as the rate environment moves around, and as we do things within our portfolio. The trajectory, as you’ve called out, has been downward for some time, going from $7 billion down to the current level of $2.9 billion. The reason for the uptick – probably a couple of things I would call out: the Hong Kong market and the deposit flooring in Hong Kong so, as rates go down, the sensitivity varies somewhat. We’ve also got, as I’m sure you’re aware, a set of euro French mortgages that we’ve put available for sale now, and the hedging of that has had a slight influence on the sensitivity for the euro currency, so that’s really driven a bit of the movement there as well, but it is very minor in the scheme of things. $0.2 billion, I think, was the change.",False,1.0,0

We’re broadly paying about 25 basis points1 now on savings accounts, so, if you think about further rate cuts, you’ll get to a point, as we pass through, where it hits zero, and then that naturally means your NII sensitivity past that point will increase.",False,1.0,0

Just about pass-throughs, previously, we’ve talked about – I think your disclosed sensitivity assumes a 50% pass-through, but Georges has previously really laid out the potential upside of betas coming in better. He talked about a $600 million swing if you get a 10% better pass-through. Could you just lay out your pass-through experience in Q4 and whether you think you can replicate that kind of level going forward? It sounds like we should think about lower pass-throughs going forward than what you’ve executed in Q4. There’s a question about BoCom recapitalisation I’m getting a lot from clients this morning. There’s news flow this morning about China looking to recapitalise banks. Could you help us just work through what the capital impact is if that was to take place and if there’s any consideration from a fair value calc on the value in use going forward? What’s the net impact of a BoCom recap? On Wealth, what’s the outlook for relationship managers, net new money going forward? I think my take is that your Asia piece is doing well. I think you underperform some of your peers, actually, from an AUM point of view. I know there’s a definitional difference here. So I wanted to – my guess is that part of that $1.5 billion that you’re recycling is about, for example, hiring 1 Correction: this was incorrectly stated as 62.5 basis points during the meeting RMs in Asia. So can you help us understand the outlook for RMs and, ideally, net new money, AUM formation, in light of that recycling, please? Thank you so much.",True,2.0,0

Ming, please add on the Asia piece. So, for Wealth, we’ve said it is a real strategic priority for us, and part of that is both in terms of building on Wealth in Hong Kong, whether it’s building in terms of opening new wealth centres, hiring RMs, and looking at the segmented market, from $100,000 up, when we look at from our view of defining wealth, and particularly focusing around the people with AUMs around $500,000. We think that’s a sweet spot, so we’ll add more there, but in addition to Hong Kong, we are also going to invest more in Singapore, and that’s where the investment is in terms of whether it is doing more from a technology app perspective, hiring of RMs, and then linking it through to what we’re doing also in the UAE, plus India, because if you look at the triangulation of the wealth piece, it’s not just from an Asia perspective, but it’s connectivities with the diaspora who come from – whether it’s from the sub-continent, linking back to the UAE and to Singapore. So that’s really our broader sweet spot. I would just say that, in terms of growth numbers and the rest, it’s always good to compare with our competitors to say it is X percentage growth over what baseline, so when you are growing from a higher baseline and at a similar rate to your competitors, you actually increase the gap between yourself and the competitors. So, like for like, a double-digit growth from a smaller base versus another is not the same. So I’m very comfortable both in our investment prioritisation, management focus and the linking through from our experience in Hong Kong and leveraging it, whether it’s product, whether it’s applications, whether knowing what has worked from an RM hiring, training, embedding perspective.

Presentation Transcripts\2024\250228-fy-2024-equity-analysts-meeting-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,Post-Results FY Event,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Firstly on BoCom, I don’t think you should assume anything. We are very comfortable with our investment, the way it stands. We don’t know the full details on how the capitalisation is going to be, and we will look at it as it comes through, so please don’t assume anything. On strategy – this is my third role in HSBC, but I’ve been a part of the GEC for the last 12 years, and I’ll tell you why this is different. In the past, when we have streamlined or shrunk, it’s been a cost-driven exercise. It has been very much at reducing the junior-level staff, moving people offshore, doing the normal productivity, efficiency things that people do piecemeal, and then streamlining some businesses. This time, why it’s different is that, firstly, we made it very clear what our four pillars are. So we have made a distinction between how we look at our two home markets, Hong Kong and the UK. We have made the matrix much simpler; we have given much more personal accountability because we think they are the drivers of growth. What’s come between us and our growth sometimes is the speed with which we could react and respond, and the matrix was part of that. So that’s the real objective, and the cost saving and the rest comes as a consequence of the reorganisation and de-duplication. Secondly, in terms of our businesses, we have very clearly put our stake out to say we have our network, which primarily supports our wholesale transaction banking business, whether it’s FX, trade, payments, or leveraging our own capital financing, debt financing capabilities, because it’s the strength of our balance sheet and our deposit base which is the cornerstone of the franchise. We’ve never before made this delineation between saying, ‘This is what we will do, and this is what we will not do’, hence the call also on the investment bank, and it’s not just the amount of money, and it’s not token. It’s a very much cultural shift to say we know what our competitors’ strengths are. We are very comfortable with them, but in the same token, we also know where we have a right to compete, and when, and where we don’t. So there’s no point being number 20 or number 40 in any particular business or product line. The piece on the WPB is very important because, in the past, what we have done is looked at our businesses as one whole lot. We are now saying there are two markets where we have scale and where we want to absolutely be looking at the full spectrum of the retail business. But elsewhere, we are very much pivoting to a premium, affluent base, and that’s a much greater shift too, not just from lending, but more fee income. That’s the difference in terms of how we are doing the reorganisation, the degree of change, and what we are driving to in terms of rebalancing the totality of HSBC, rather than just relying on our very strong balance sheet, which will always be there, but there is lots to add on to that. I would look at it as a focused growth drive with the confidence of having targets which are over three consecutive years in terms of RoTE with sufficient levers to pull, because that’s the reshaping.",False,5.0,0

So the clarification – on the strategy – just to make sure I’ve got it completely clear in my head, in terms of the $1.5 billion of cost saves and reallocation, what proportion has already been identified and is already set in action, versus what proportion is still to be decided and to be seen?

I’m curious what you think, or what the main levers would be, for you to get beyond that mid-teens and to get to that 18% so you get full recognition of performance, so the main levers there. On the 2025 plan, there’s a metric on fee growth in excess of balance sheet growth, and I think the consensus has got something like 5% fee growth and 3% balance sheet growth, so about a 2 percentage points delta.

What Georges is going to be paid, I’m going to be paid, is a RemCo decision, and our target is right at the centre of what our performance-related pay is. There is the downside, and there is also the upside. We’ve always said the target is what we manage to, but we aim to beat the target as the market environment and other opportunities come through. The kind of thing that could happen would be where there’s volatility in the macroeconomic environment, market confidence in terms of loans. I think for fee income there’s a pretty strong demographic trend – the market environment doesn’t that much change it - so that’s very much being competitive and being in that space.

It’s very modest, but it’s still there. In terms of the businesses that you’ve talked about divesting, they’re all very sub-scale, and I agree they do add up, but it’s very small elements, adding up, so I won’t read too much into it. From a growth perspective, I want to make one point - we are very committed to supporting our customers in every market we are. We have our lines. We hold to them. But at this point of time, given the demand, there are commitments which are not utilised, so we do expect that that will flow through over time, and that’s not going to be something we are showing as an RWA shift.

I know we flagged a double-digit Fee and other income growth in Wealth, but then Wholesale Transaction Banking growth, we didn’t say anything. It seems like the global FX market is growing by mid-single digit, which is half of this Wholesale Transaction Banking. Trade and payments, is the other half, and trade flows are growing at, let’s say, at the very least, 4%. So if you assume mid-single digit here, and then double-digit, even 10%, in Wealth, why can’t we have 7% or high-single digit growth? I know we don’t have guidance. I’m not looking for that, just for colour in the wholesale transaction banking, so we will reach 6, 7, 8% on the non-banking NII. That’s not what the market is expecting, and implicit is not what the guidance is also on the RoTE. So why is this Wholesale Transaction Banking slower growth for us compared to industry data? And the related question is, am I missing something else like credit card and other account fees, which is not in these two things, but accounts for non-banking NII, and that can be flattish, or no growth.

On revenue, the way we are looking at this is, when we reallocate the costs, the costs come off, they come to the group, and then the group determines where it’s going to reinvest, and there is a bit of a time lag. So you get the benefit of the costs as a tailwind, but you haven’t reinvested as yet in the other area. It’s not a lot, but there’s still some time lag. Similarly, the revenue that you lose as a headwind - you expect that to come through where you’ve reinvested, and at a higher return. So I don’t think there is any link between saying, ‘We’re cutting these costs and this is the revenue stream’, because it’s not a reallocation of costs which is going to the bottom line and not being reinvested for growth purposes. If you look over the medium term, this is not a story of cutting down footprint, reducing revenue and just driving costs.

In Hong Kong, about 54% of our exposures are secured and 46% unsecured. The secured ones have very low LTVs, very strong collateral, and therefore, even when because of cashflow reasons they go into a stage 3, the ECLs are minimal. From a regulation perspective, the HKMA was very forward looking. They’ve got very strict guidelines on the LTVs and lending, and that really helped the market to stay stable, even through the various price shocks that the Hong Kong markets had had over the years. In terms of the unsecured, 90% of it is investment grade, and it’s investment grade in the hands of conglomerates who also have property exposure, but by the nature of their business have diversified cashflows.

I’m joined here in London by Pam. Before Pam takes you through the numbers, I would like to begin with some opening remarks. Overall, there was a strong quarter, marked by three key drivers – momentum in our earnings, discipline in our execution, and confidence in our ability to deliver our targets. First, we have strong momentum in our business. We had a strong first quarter, with profit before tax up 11%, and an annualised return on tangible equity of 18.4%, both excluding notable items. We had our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Wealth, and attracted net new invested assets of $22 billion, as well as another 300,000 new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong, continuing the trend from last year. We also had a strong performance in Transaction Banking, in particular in FX, and our equities and debt trading businesses, benefiting from higher client activity on the back of higher volatility. Second, we remain focused on executing our strategy with discipline, and are on track to deliver the cost actions we set out in February. We are progressing at pace to deliver on the simplification-related cost saves, as well as the strategic cost reallocations. We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our investments and capital allocation to drive growth across our four businesses. We will provide you with a full update on this at the half-year results in July. Third, the external macroeconomic environment is less favourable and more uncertain than it was in February, as the uncertainty around trade policy dampens business confidence and constrains investment. However, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our targets. Our balance sheet is strong. This is reflected in the deposit surpluses we hold in every major currency in each of our four businesses, in every geography in which we operate. This is why our clients place their trust in us during times of predictability, and even more so during times of unpredictability. These provide us with a steady recurring income stream and underpin the lion’s share of our Banking NII. Growing our structural hedge has reduced the sensitivity of these revenues to interest rate cuts. Our balance sheet is also underpinned by a strong capital position and a high-quality credit portfolio. We also have resilient recurring fee income from stable flow-based activities in Transaction Banking and in Wealth, with a much smaller contribution from Investment Banking event-driven business. I encourage you to keep the diversity and quality of our earnings in mind when considering how changes in trade policy will affect our business. Our Wholesale Transaction Banking business covers much broader activities than those related to cross-border trade. And within our trade finance business, we have diverse products and cover all major global and intraregional corridors. To assess the impact higher tariffs could have on our business, we modelled scenarios that contemplate significant but plausible increases in tariffs by the world’s largest trading blocs, resulting in a notable slowdown in global trade, as well as a slowdown in global GDP growth. In a plausible downside tariff scenario, we estimate that there will be a low-single-digit percentage impact on the group’s revenues. Separately, our consensus downside scenario models a slowdown in global trade and GDP growth as a result of an increase in tariffs. The impact of this scenario would be incremental ECLs of $0.5 billion. On this basis, we remain confident in delivering a mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027, and are reaffirming all of the guidance that we gave in February. We recognise, though, that the broader impacts of the current conditions are more difficult to quantify, and we will continue to monitor these as we formulate our ongoing outlook. Importantly, in the current environment, customers look for the strength, stability and expertise of a trusted partner. We are extremely well-positioned to support all of our customers, wherever they are, however their needs evolve and whatever the market conditions. Finally, we’re also pleased to announce an up to $3 billion share buyback, and a 10 cents per share interim dividend, reflecting our continued focus on capital returned to our investors. With that, let me hand over to Pam.",False,,1
Presentation Transcripts\2025\250429-1q-2025-earnings-release-investors-and-analysts-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,1,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thank you, Georges. Thank you, everyone, for joining. The momentum in our business has enabled us to deliver a strong first-quarter performance, headlined by an annualised return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We had very good underlying profit and revenue performances. Credit remained stable, and we maintained a disciplined approach to cost management. We are pleased to announce a first interim dividend of 10 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $3 billion. The buybacks we completed over the last 12 months have helped take us closer to our target range of 14-14.5% CET1. We will continue to return surplus capital to shareholders, with buybacks remaining our preferred method. As always, a decision on any share buyback will be made on a quarterly basis. It will depend on organic capital generation and the capital needs of the business. Unpacking the revenue story, excluding notable items, revenue of $17.7 billion was up $1.1 billion on the first quarter of last year, driven by fee and other income. It also included a $0.3 billion increase in debt and equity markets, driven by higher volatility, and a favourable impact of $0.2 billion in the quarter from the disposal of Argentina, which we completed at the end of last year. On banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina and other notable items, the banking NII run rate remained broadly stable on the fourth quarter. The impact of interest rate cuts and two fewer days in the quarter were offset by the repricing of liabilities and structural hedge assets, and some favourable changes in asset mix. We continue to expect banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. As previously stated, this is not an underpin. It remains our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections. Moving to fee and other income, Wholesale Transaction Banking was up 13% on last year’s first quarter. This was driven by a strong FX performance, as elevated volatility drove substantial volumes of client hedging activity. Excluding the impact of disposals, Global Payment Solutions was up 3% year on year, and Global Trade Solutions was up 6%. In Wealth, the strong momentum from the fourth quarter continued as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth. High client activity levels in Asia, primarily Hong Kong, were the key driver, and there was broad-based growth. We are pleased that the investment we are making in our Wealth products, distribution channels and customer journeys is translating into results – a record new business CSM, 301,000 new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong, and $22 billion of net new invested assets, $16 billion of which was in Asia. The CSM balance, which is a store of future value, was up again this quarter. As you know, the CSM balance is subject to market fluctuations, and sensitivities to key indices are in the earning release. On credit, our first-quarter ECL charge was $0.9 billion, equivalent to an annualised charge of 37 basis points as a percentage of loans and advances. This included a $150 million provision to reflect heightened economic uncertainty. Excluding this, the first-quarter charge was broadly the same as in the first quarter of 2024. The credit risk metrics that we track remain stable, and we continue to monitor them closely. Thinking about the potential impact of tariffs on credit’s performance, ECLs will be sensitive to macroeconomic performance, the outlook for which remains uncertain. We consider a variety of scenarios as part of our ECL calculation. One of these is the consensus downside scenario in which an increase in tariffs results in a global economic slowdown. In this scenario, there would be an incremental ECL charge of around $0.5 billion. Page 2 of 13 On costs, we are taking a disciplined approach to cost management, and are on target to achieve our target of around 3% cost growth in 2025 compared to 2024 on a target basis. We are also on track to deliver $0.3 billion of simplification savings into the P&L in 2025. On loans and deposits, loan balances were broadly stable quarter on quarter, as growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking was offset by the reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio. Deposits were also broadly stable quarter on quarter, with a partial reversal of some of the seasonal inflows we saw in Q4. Year on year, deposits were up 6%, with growth in all entities and businesses. Our CET1 ratio was 14.7%. The reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio led to a $1.3 billion pre-tax loss in the quarter, recognised in fair value through other comprehensive income. This had a capital impact of around 0.2 percentage points of CET1. Looking ahead, we expect the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points in the second quarter. You will have seen that Bocom has announced that it has approved a share issuance of up to RMB120 billion. Upon completion, we expect to recognise an accounting impact dilution loss of between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on our stake. This will be treated as a material notable item and will have no material impact on CET1 and no impact on the dividend. Let me end by summarising. First, we have momentum in our earnings. We had a strong first-quarter performance, with an annualised return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We have also continued to perform well in the quarter to date.

Firstly, you mentioned in the release that you’ve launched a strategic review of Malta. At full-year results, we were relatively early in the strategic refresh process. Are there other geographies that you’re also strategically reviewing? At full-year results, you talked about $1.5 billion of gross cost saves. Now you’re deeper into that process, have you seen any potential to be able to achieve cost saves in excess of that target? And then, secondly, one of the features of your Q1 results was the strength in fees and other income. Can you provide some colour on how substantial that print is and how much is driven by the augmented volatility? Thank you.",True,0.0,0

So we’ve announced, in February, $1.5 billion of cost saves from the organisation and simplification, which we expect to take to the bottom line. And as Pam shared earlier, we are on track to deliver those and we’re moving at pace. We separately announced $1.5 billion from strategic reallocation of costs from activities that are non-strategic or low-returning into our core strategy, where we have competitive strength. We continue to progress at pace on those, and we’ve made a number of announcements, which we’ve shared, including Investment Banking in Europe and the US, including the French insurance, the private bank in Germany, etc, and we’re progressing with those at pace. And again, on both items, we continue the execution with discipline and pace, and we remain unfazed with the external environment for the execution of those. This is our primary focus now, just focusing on delivering those. Cost efficiencies is a matter of BAU. If we identify cost efficiencies, we will, of course, be taking them as a matter of BAU, but our primary focus is to deliver on those commitments. With regards fees and other income, we’ve talked to the plausible downside scenario, it’s an adverse scenario, but it is a plausible scenario, and it will slow down parts of our business – trade flows, but also the implication it has on other aspects of our business, including volumes in general. But outside, I would say, this adverse scenario, we continue to see strength in the Page 3 of 13 Wealth business – five quarters double-digit growth, which we expect to continue in the medium term, at least for the medium term – and we continue to invest in this space.

Congrats on a strong set of numbers and some clarity on your thinking on the path forward. Can I just ask on the plausible downside scenarios for the low-single-digit impact on revenue? I guess, what was the point of undertaking that exercise? Was it to, basically, show that the perception of the bank as a global trade bank, in some ways, may be exaggerated about how, basically, you’re not overly reliant on any particular corridors? And I guess, what kind of elements went into that scenario in terms of magnitude of the drawdown on trade? And then, secondly, just on that, could you opine on any opportunities that you’re seeing or that you foresee as a result of what’s happening – not that what’s happening is necessarily certain at the moment, but just any opportunities that you can see, based on any initial discussions?

We homed in on one scenario after looking at a range of possible outcomes, which, as you know, are uncertain and remain very wide. Page 4 of 13 So the specific scenario which we homed into was based on a significant increase in tariffs, as well as retaliatory tariffs. We also took a holistic approach. We considered different businesses, different geographies, as well as customer segments, and this scenario resulted in a significant decline in trade and a significant slowdown in global GDP growth. We looked at the impact of this both in terms of revenue through lower balances, but also on flow-based income.

I just want to be clear that the scenario does not include the secondary impact of any change in policy rates in terms of the revenue-related scenario. Secondly, none of these two scenarios have what you call an extreme downside to scenario, with a double-digit contraction of GDP like we saw in the Covid period, just to give you some guardrails.

Thanks very much for the various updates and sensitivities that you’ve given us. I had two questions just around customer behaviour. So I just wondered if you’d observed any material shift in the way that your customers are transacting with you. Have you seen any forward indicators around sentiment, any signs of de-risking or de-leveraging, any shift in particularly your corporate customers that might be on the receiving end of trade tariffs? Any insights there would be really helpful. And then the second is, definitely get the message around continuing to execute on the existing strategy. I guess just two related points to that, one around capital returns. It’s great that you’ve announced a $3 billion buyback. You’re talking about a more subdued outlook for lending by extension RWAs, so presumably you might be quite capital generative this year. So it seems like you’re committed to distributions despite the uncertainty. It’s an uncertain backdrop, but the pace of distributions that you’re executing on, it feels like you’re committed to that. Is that the right read? Should we be confident around things like the buyback sustainability from here? Page 5 of 13 And just the related part of that question, then, is just around, you talk about divestiture on track – the $1.5 billion. But in terms of the redeploy, because I think you talked about some potential revenue opportunities from the redeploy or cost savings, if it doesn’t come through, are you minded to delay any of this redeploy, basically, given the volatile backdrop?

I’m going to take your first question about customer behaviour, and I’ll ask Pam to address both our capital return strategy, as well as the cost redeployment from the reallocations. So in terms of customer behaviour, I think nothing that would really surprise you. Corporate customers, essentially, are in a wait-and-see mode, so some of the capex or large investments are on hold. Certainly, some of the shipments from China, specifically to the US, have slowed down, but we’ve seen no panic. So there’s been no significant drawdowns. Deposit behaviour has remained normal, so nothing really to call out beyond the wait and see. In terms of personal banking and Wealth customers’ activity, this has been quite strong. Remember, we have a diversified product offering. So we’ve seen customers rebalance their investments between various offerings, be it various geographic equity exposure or other assets, such as mutual funds or structured products. And when customers want to take a risk-off approach, we see the money flow into our deposit base, so we capture the customer assets either in invested assets or in deposits. But when we look at our NNIA for the first three months of the year, it remained positive, strong, so we remain positive on the outlook of the growth in this business. Remember also, we’re investing in this business, so we’re capturing the underlying growth in the market, but we’re also capturing market share in the way we’re investing in this business.

Presentation Transcripts\2025\250429-1q-2025-earnings-release-investors-and-analysts-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,1,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thanks, Aman. So just one point to add on the Wealth customer behaviours. Our strength really lies in our very broad product proposition. So as we see the mix shift between US equities or Asian equities, or, indeed, into short-term fixed income products, we are there to support our customers, as well as in terms of insurance on more protection and savings-related products. So that gives us confidence that this double-digit growth continues, and we have seen the same trend even through April, and the same trend also, no panic, no drawdowns, and deposit behaviour normal through April. So that’s just to set that. So coming down to distribution, just as a starting point, we have our policy on ordinary dividends. I’m assuming your question is much more on share buybacks, but let me see overall on the process we follow. Every quarter, we look at where we are in terms of our CET1, and you know our CET1 operating range is between 14% to 14.5%. We also look at our capital generation, less the capital needs or capital deployment that we want to do. And what’s very important is, routinely, we look at a range of scenarios in terms of the macroeconomic environment, and then, based on that, we look at the quantum on share buybacks. And clearly, if we have excess capital, share buybacks continues to be our preferred method to return capital. We have not changed our view on capital redeployment, but, as I’ve said, we look at opportunities, we look at the generative capability, quarter on quarter, and that’s how we make the decision on the quantum of share buybacks.",False,3.0,0

The first, Georges, HSBC is a signatory to a letter suggesting to the UK regulators that ringfencing is something that should go. I think that’s the right view, but we’ve got a lot of investor demand for a sense from you as to the motivation for that. What is it that you’d say in terms of opex funding costs and Page 6 of 13 what restructuring charges may go with that? So when you made that motivation, what was the maths behind it? And then, secondly, very strong performance in costs in Q1, but guidance held constant for the year ahead. I guess that implies potentially some slippage in efficiency ratios in the quarters to come, notwithstanding the cost-saving actions that are underway. Could you talk a little bit about the moving parts, just quarter-to-quarter volatility? Is there anything we should be thinking about in the upcoming quarters as far as cost inflation is concerned?

Presentation Transcripts\2025\250429-1q-2025-earnings-release-investors-and-analysts-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,1,Georges Elhedery,Group Ceo,"Thank you, Jason. Let me address your first question on ringfencing, and Pam will take your second question on the cost. So our view on ringfencing is that there’s been major enhancement to the prudential regulations for banks in the UK – in particular, the broader regimes of capital, of loss absorbency through MREL, of liquidity, recovery and resolution, etc. All these measures have, basically, put the bank in a much better, safer prudential space that have made ringfencing, effectively, redundant. The second thing to say is that the UK is the only major economy that has applied ringfencing, so it’s quite unique to the UK. So as an outcome, it’s increased the cost to operate as a bank. It created capital inefficiencies. It trapped liquidity. It, effectively, exposed our customers, including businesses and SMEs, to higher costs. It did somewhat also stifle competition. The bar to be able to compete in the UK for banks has become stiffer and more difficult. So therefore, we believe that removing ringfencing, or at least scaling back on some of the ringfencing considerations, will improve the outcome for customers and, ultimately, therefore, will support growth in the UK. Now, just to reiterate, we are very supportive of the government’s growth agenda, and we will play our role in the UK for that. And as regards the financial impact of the removal or the scaling down of ringfencing, we haven’t done a full analysis, but we believe this will be positive for both capital, cost and our ability to compete and support the growth of the UK economy and our customers.

So firstly, we manage costs to a full-year number. And quarter on quarter, you can see some volatility. But just to clarify, our full-year 2025 guidance of plus 3% is on a base of $31.9 billion, which is the full-year ’24 restated to the average FX for Q1 2025. So just unbundling that, the 3%, the dependency is on the 4% inflation investment spend and the benefit of $0.3 billion, so the 1% from the P&L saves from the simplification as we guided at Q4, and the actions that are going to realise that $300 million in the year have been already broadly taken, so the P&L will come through in subsequent months.",False,4.0,0

Great results, but, clearly, the focus is on the new tariff world, and I want to try to understand, first of all, your targeting guidance around interest rates in particular, but also GDP assumptions. You mentioned mid-April, but, clearly, a lot happened in April, so I’m just trying to understand what date or what week we should use as guidance in terms of interest rate assumption, if you could give maybe GDP assumptions. And secondly, coming to your sensitivities or your analysis around tariff impact, if you could discuss again interest rate assumptions, in particular in GDP, but also your assumptions about China as a trading counterparty in terms of your revenues versus the corridors you talk about, because, clearly, really, in the new world, the corridors seem to be impacted as well. So are you assuming corridors can grow, or do you assume corridors would also be negatively impacted in a new tariff world? And lastly, in that context, can you just talk about cost flexibility, as you didn’t discuss that?",True,5.0,0

Kian, I’m going to make some broad comments on the view of corridors and, overall, our business, and I’ll ask Pam to give you additional information on the tariff scenarios, as well as on the cost implications, okay? So a couple of things to note. The first one is, as we did say, the lion’s share of our banking NII is driven by our deposit franchise. This deposit franchise is a hallmark of our balance sheet, Page 7 of 13 and we’re on 50s loan-to-deposit ratio in three of our four businesses. And in the UK, we’re on 80s, which is the lowest. Therefore, we have deposit surpluses in every currency, every geography, every business line. And this franchise is very robust and is a driver of a very important, the lion’s share, for banking NII, a very important revenue stream. The second, when you look at our fee income, wealth so far has continued to grow at double-digit returns, and we do expect it to continue to grow at double-digit returns in the medium term, given the underlying market opportunities and market growth, as well as our own investment, to continue gaining market share. So transaction banking is the one we really are diving into. Remember, first, transaction banking is a wide set of products that cover various areas outside trade. And remember, a lot of our business is, let’s say, with multinational customers operating in Asia or in China. A lot of their business is in China for China, or in Asia for Asia, where they produce and manufacture locally and distribute locally, with limited impact on tariffs, albeit some may be impacted by tariffs. But even within trade, we have seen growth of trade corridors intra-Asia or within Asia and Middle East, at a very fast pace, and a number of these corridors have become structurally resilient and on a growth trajectory. Now, some of the China plus one trade patterns that are still meant to ultimately distribute or export to the US will be affected insofar that there’s intra-Asia trade flows for that ultimate purpose, but there is a much bigger intra-Asia, intra-Asia and Middle East trade flows that are two-way, and that are related to domestic manufacturing for the purposes of domestic consumption, which we continue to see as structurally growing. Our scenarios have really looked at differentiation between the areas of structural growth and the areas that will be widely impacted by tariffs, which Pam can talk to.",False,5.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2025\250429-1q-2025-earnings-release-investors-and-analysts-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,1,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thank you, Kian. So firstly, just to reiterate, the $42 billion banking NII continues to be our best estimate for full-year 2025. Now, we’ve looked at a range of reasonable upside/downside assumptions, including rates, but we are not immune to all scenarios, despite the stress work that we have done. Our Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion puts us on a good trajectory, given that range of scenarios we’ve looked at – all plausible upsides and downsides. Now, as always, there are four key drivers. The rates that we have included are based on the mid-April curves. The structural hedge will be a tailwind to this headwind of rates. We have $75 billion maturities in the remainder of the year, and they are on 2.8% yield at the moment, so there’ll be an upside to that. The other two elements are harder to forecast, particularly in terms of balance sheet growth, as we’ve said before, and loans stay muted. Having said that, loans and advances were slightly up in the first quarter of this year, primarily because Hong Kong loans and advances were stable compared to Q4 last year where they had contracted. Now, the deposit migration trend from Hong Kong has stayed stable over last year into this year, at 39%, and that is continuing even through April. So if I look at it in the round in terms of deposit behaviours of our customers, both from a corporate side as well as from a retail side, we stay quite comfortable. So on tariffs, just in terms of the broad piece, what we have looked at from a tariff perspective is – and it’s all in terms of seeing the various scenarios, in terms of delivering the mid-teens RoTE. Firstly, we looked at our income stream beyond banking NII, which is Wholesale Transaction Banking, and it has many more products beyond trade finance. It also is in diverse products within trade finance and their diverse global and intra-regional corridors. When we have looked at the downside scenario, we’ve looked at higher tariffs, we have looked at impact on GDP, we have looked more broadly at policy rates, inflation – the big picture – but again, to say we have not looked at GDP to the stress level of a downside two scenario that we have called out in our release, which is like a double-digit contraction of GDP as we saw in the Covid period. So if we look at all that, we come to a low single-digit percentage impact on revenues, and within that and within the incremental $500 million ECLs, we stay very confident for our mid- teens RoTE for the next three years. Now, the broader impacts are going to be hard to quantify. These are your second, third order impacts, but we continue to monitor them through our various scenarios and review them quarter-on-quarter. Page 8 of 13 On costs, our cost trajectory is on track, and given this, there’s no shift on that, and we will still continue through our envelope to be able to invest in the areas which we have been, as Georges has said, because we can see the direct benefit coming very quickly in those areas, even in the current environment and continuing through April, and that’s primarily on the wealth side.",False,5.0,0

A potential follow-up, actually, to Kian’s question. Thank you, and I understand essentially that plausible downside tariff scenarios are pretty similar or closer to the ECL downside one rather than the downside two type case. Again, just coming back in terms of the broader profitability mid-teens target, so essentially, you’re saying that if we were to see that plausible downside scenario, you still believe you can achieve that mid-teens profitability level, and that’s before factoring in any further cost actions, or would that be with any kind of re-jigging or additional cost action taken by the group to mitigate some of that impact? And then secondly, I just wanted to check – when I look at the downside one ECL scenario now versus at full-year, it seems like the China and Hong Kong drawdown is not quite as severe. I see the US is maybe a little bit – 30 bps more severe, so I was also kind of curious why that downside scenario is not quite as negative, perhaps, as what you assessed at the full- year stage.

And within that scenario, without additional cost actions than the one that we have set out to do and are on-track for doing, and obviously committed to do, we are confident we can achieve our targets, in particular our targets of mid- teen returns for ’25, ’26 and ’27.

So just in terms of the scenarios, just to confirm, they are not identical scenarios, but in terms of severity and plausibility, you’re right in the ballpark because the ECL scenario stresses a lot of things on interest rates, inflation, etc from a range of factors, and this one on tariffs is quite specific on the revenue line. And to clarify on ECLs, we had to build our reserve for this quarter, change the weightings of the downside one from 15% to 30%, and when we look at the 500 million potential impact, that is if you change the downside one scenario weighting to 100%, so just to say that’s 500 additional to the 150. Now, in terms of Hong Kong and China CRE – absolutely. In terms of both from an individual customer level, as well as on the forward economic guidance given the starting point, there is a lesser impact, and overall, there has been very little noise from a Hong Kong CRE and a China CRE other than isolated names in this quarter. There can be credit downgrades over a period of time. We saw a few now, but the impact from an RW perspective is very modest. If you look from a US perspective, also there was a specific name, and when we look at the credit downgrades, so that’s also in the quarter. I wouldn’t really build any trend from this quarter into a full year, and all these factors, bottom-line, are part of the scenario analysis which we do on upside and downside before we reaffirm our RoTE guidance and target.",False,6.0,0

Good morning. So really on banking NII, a couple if I may, please. First is Q on Q banking NII held up pretty much flat, whereas interest rates would have added a headwind of, as per my calculation, 170 million. So can you please double-check and tell us how much was the benefit from the deposit price through being not that high, and then improved asset makes and then the structural hedge? That’s one. And then second, again on banking NII, around 42 billion guidance – how much are we assuming for average interest earning assets growth? Because as I see, deposit growth has been consistent, but that somehow on an YoY basis, it’s now showing up as 4% growth, but then Q on Q there’s no growth and previously on YoY also, we could not show any growth. Page 9 of 13 And then what is the around? Is a $41.5 billion outcome around $42 billion? Does that tick the box and help us meet the target? Thank you.",True,7.0,0

So firstly, banking NII was flat on a quarter-on-quarter, constant currency basis, excluding notable items and Argentina, but we don’t split out the dollar impact of every moving part, but let me just unbundle. So the headwinds were too few a days in the quarter as well as lower interest rates, but the tailwinds were reinvestment of maturing hedge assets at high yields, a bit of change in the mix of our market treasury assets, as well as the benefit of deposit passthroughs, particularly in the UK, which come through with a delay of 90 days. So the interest rate cuts which we saw in August came in through for a full quarter in this quarter, and then we saw a bit of a tail of the November cuts as well, so that’s the impact there. In terms of your other question, of course we look at various upsides and downsides in that $42 billion, and I just want to reiterate that $42 billion is not an underpin. It is just around $42 billion, our current best estimate based upon what we see in terms of deposit betas, based upon what we see in terms of actual deposit flows coming through, updated not just for the quarter but also considering the trends we’ve seen through April.",False,7.0,0

If I could have a couple on the organisational simplification and then also just one clarification on wealth. On the organisational simplification, you previously guided to $1.8 billion of restructuring costs, and you said the majority of that is expected to be booked in 2025. I think you only took $141 million in Q1, so presumably, we should expect a big step-up in the restructuring charges from Q2 onwards for the rest of this year. And then the second question attached to this is you said that the actions you’ve taken to date would already translate into $300 million of annualised savings. I appreciate in Q1, you’ve had very little of that, but nonetheless, you’re still guiding to $300 million for the full year 2025 when you’ve already achieved $300 million annualised and there’s presumably more to come over the remaining year with the additional restructuring. So can you just clarify a bit there on why more of the savings are not flowing into full-year 2025 compared to 2026? And then on wealth, given the new segmental split, is it possible to get the split of the Asian invested assets and the $16 billion Asian net new invested assets this quarter that’s attributable to Hong Kong? Thank you.",False,7.0,0

Andrew, I’m going to ask Pam to address the first two questions with regard to the organisation simplification. Just saying that, we will give, as I said earlier, a more thorough update at the interim results, and on your final question, let us take it forward and see what we can communicate. $16 billion of net new invested assets in Asia with the majority in Hong Kong, but we will take it forward to see what additional granularity we’re likely to share.

Presentation Transcripts\2025\250429-1q-2025-earnings-release-investors-and-analysts-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,1,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Thanks, Andy. So firstly, in terms of the actions taken and the P&L coming through for the year, the actions taken typically is when you have colleagues put through at risk and decisions made, communicated. There is always a time lag typically between that and colleagues leaving the platform. Typically, in tends to be about a quarter – 90 days. So when you see an action has been taken, you know a saving is going to come through but there is going to be a time lag between that decision and the savings feeding into the P&L. So when we said the majority of the actions have already been taken, the annualised savings that we calculated, it’s for the full year. So it’s not as though these actions are already banked and there’s going to be further, so that’s the main piece. Now, on restructuring costs, you’re absolutely right that there is going to be the majority of the restructuring cost taken in 2025 rather than 2026, and I would expect most of that to come through Q2, Q3 and then some Q4 and tapering down as we go into 2026.",False,7.0,0

Presentation Transcripts\2025\250429-1q-2025-earnings-release-investors-and-analysts-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,1,Ed Firth,Kbw,"Good morning, everybody. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I just had a couple. The first one – I noticed that your cost guidance is based on an average Page 10 of 13 exchange rate in Q1, but the US dollar is off 6% since then, so I assume that if we were to actually do that at today’s exchange rate, your cost number would be somewhat higher than that. I’m just trying to check – is your revenue guidance also based on those exchange rates? Is it effectively like we should gear up both revenue and costs for the weakened dollar in terms of our expectations? That’s the first point. I guess partly related to that, are we actually in the plausible downside scenario now? Trade flows from China to the US are down 45% booking, something like that. That feels to me like a pretty downside scenario. Should we assume that as we go through Q2 and Q3, we are actually in that scenario now? Is that effectively where we are, assuming nothing changes? And I guess nobody has any idea what will happen in terms of the changes, but assuming we stay where we are today. And then my second question was just about Bocom. I can’t really understand the accounting, because you’re still running with a valuation that’s $10 billion above the market value, but you didn’t subscribe for new shares with the capital raise, which I assume you would have done if you had thought it really was worth that much more. Should we be expecting you to correct that down to what would be a market price rather than just the $1.6bn? Should we be revisiting how you do the – I think you call it value in use, something like that. Thanks very much.",True,8.0,0

Let me take your plausible downside scenario, and I’ll ask Pam to address the cost question as well as the Bocom accounting question. So the adverse plausible downside scenario is a scenario that is further adverse from where we are today, with significantly higher global tariffs on major trading blocks on an aggregate basis, and we’ve looked at their impact across obviously our trade business but more importantly across over all our volumes and the economic outlook of our businesses on the whole. We do recognise that there is uncertainty and it’s very difficult to understand how much downside or upside there is in the future outlook for this, but we believe this plausible downside scenario is not the expected scenario, as in it is a lower probability downside than the expected scenario.

So agree the downside scenario is not something where we are now, because the downside scenario clearly has broader impact in terms of GDP and other areas which then gives the significant impact that we talked about, so just to make that clear. And you’re absolutely right – the target cost base of $31.9 billion, equivalent of a full-year ’24 cost, was rebased on first quarter’s average exchange rates. All things being equal, the US depreciation would put an upward pressure on an absolute cost, but in the same way, it would put an upward pressure, i.e. have some benefit, on the revenues and we would do that on the same principle quarter-on-quarter as we progress. Now, FX rates have been volatile. We will continue to update you quarter-on-quarter. So in terms of Bocom, in simple terms, at this point in time, we continue to say Bocom is an associate. We have done the assessment as we do every year in terms of further impairment and there has been no impact for this quarter. The dilution impact into P&L, we will have an accounting impact on the completion of the share issuance, and that’s where it will be taken. But I just want to reiterate, all said and done, there is an insignificant impact from this dilution on our CET1, and because it’s a material notable item, there is no impact on dividend or distribution.",False,8.0,0

We were happy with our holding as it is, and therefore we’re happy with the outcome. With regards to the actual accounting value, I would probably point you to the investor relations team which can take you through some of the specificities of the equity accounting principles which are quite unique in the way we treat the associate accounting of Bocom. I just want to re-emphasise we’re happy with our holding in Bocom. We’re happy with our strategic relationship with Bocom and the fact that they give us exposure to the domestic economy in China, be it retail, SME, outlook, which is not something our organic business is involved in, and very importantly, what Pam said – the valuation in our NAV is Page 11 of 13 deducted from CET1, which means these impairments have a very minimal second order impact on our CET1 ratio, and therefore also do not impact our distribution capability.",False,8.0,0

The first one, I still want to ask about the tariff scenario, because I think for at least investors in this part of the world, I think it’s widely expected that the Chinese government will have more stimulus policy because of the tariffs. So in your downside scenario analysis, have you incorporated some of the positive impact from the stimulus policies which could potentially be benefitting the Hong Kong, China market? I think this is number one. Number two, I still want to ask about loan growth, because now the guidance is there will be muted loan demands in 2025. When we’re giving this type of guidance, what sort of tariff environments are we incorporating? Also, is there any guidance on, say, for example, deposit growth and also banking asset or interest-generating asset growth? How should we look at this whole thing? Thank you.",True,9.0,0

Katherine, I’m going to make some comments on your first question and I’ll ask Pam to take it forward, as well as the loan growth question which gives you an overlook. Firstly, we recognise indeed there is a lot of potential for China to take policy measures and other measures to stimulate the economy, and we would be very encouraged by that. We’re confident about the outlook for China. We’re optimistic that these measures, as they are taken and they will be taken, will have a positive impact on the economy. We believe in the foundational strength of the Chinese economy and we’re very encouraged to see the pick-up in retail sales and therefore the pick-up in domestic consumption also. So on the whole, our main scenario is that we are confident in the medium- to long-term outlook in China. This being said, in the plausible adverse downside scenario, we have not taken into account some of these potential positive impacts which may be, or are unlikely to come. Pam?",False,9.0,0
Presentation Transcripts\2025\250429-1q-2025-earnings-release-investors-and-analysts-call-transcript.pdf,HSBC,2025,1,Pam Kaur,Group Cfo,"Yeah, thanks, Katherine. So absolutely, being a stress downside scenario, plausible but severe, we typically take the downside. We don’t take the upside of the mitigating actions or any other policy measures. It’s purely tariffs and retaliatory tariffs in a plausible range. So all said and done, just want to reaffirm it was all calculated as part of the target RoTE guidance that we are giving. On loan growth, the situation is, in some ways, similar to where were at the end of Q4, because macroeconomic uncertainty delays decision-making, so we are not seeing any of those capex decisions being brought forward. They were delayed. They will continue to be delayed. Hopefully at some stage, some certainty remains there will be loan growth. We are also monitoring very closely to see if there is any increase in drawdowns, just like we observed in Q2 of 2020. At this point of time, there is no increase in drawdowns. So overall from a loan growth perspective, I will say still muted in terms of what we are seeing. The only thing I would say is that if there is continued tariff uncertainty, you will see maybe a little bit of pick-up from an OpEx perspective on working capital, because then you have to pay important duties up front and there’s some delays and some of the money’s coming and so on, so that will have an impact. But from a materiality perspective, the real driver for our banking NII guidance of $42 billion is really deposits, for which we have a very strong franchise. We are in a privileged position to be a trusted partner for our customers, and we expected that to grow. Of course, there’ll be a bit of seasonal fluctuation quarter-on-quarter, but overall that trend has continued.",False,9.0,0

First, the customers aren’t taking any decisions in panic. Customers are essentially in wait-and-see mode. A number of capex or large investments have been slowed down, and certainly trade between China and the US, we’ve seen a major slowdown. But on the whole, customers are looking at their business models. They are looking at their supply chains. They’re looking at ways to create more resilience in their business, and we’re definitely here to help them. As I said earlier, we are our customers’ trusted banking partner. They trust our financial strength, the strength of our balance sheet, of our proposition. They trust the stability of our commitments to support them through their needs and through all predictable and unpredictable times, and very importantly, they trust our expertise. We have more than 5,000 trade experts in more than 50 jurisdictions working with clients to help them think through what this means for their business model, and how they can help them adapt and adjust and create resilience. So therefore, in an environment like this one, we expect to deepen relationships with clients. We expect to acquire new clients and to consolidate our position as a leading trade bank, and we expect to make hopefully a difference for our customers in navigating these uncertainties. Thank you very much, Yan. I think we addressed all the questions, so I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your questions.
