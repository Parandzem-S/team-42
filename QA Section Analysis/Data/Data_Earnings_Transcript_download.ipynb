With that, let me hand over to Christian.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Christian Sewing',\n","  'text': \"Thank you, Silke, and a warm welcome also from my side. It's a pleasure to be discussing our third quarter and nine-month results with you today. These results show our continued progress on the path to our targets in several respects. First and foremost, we continue to demonstrate strong earnings momentum. We generated profit before tax of €5 billion in the first nine months, after absorbing nearly €950 million in non-operating costs including restructuring related to operational efficiencies. Our post-tax RoTE was 7% and would have been nearly 9% excluding these non-operating costs and with bank levies apportioned equally across the year. This reflects progress on our path to meet our 2025 target of above 10%. Second, we are seeing progress across all three dimensions of accelerated execution of our Global Hausbank strategy, namely revenue growth, operational efficiency, and capital efficiency. Strong operating performance is driven by business momentum through a well-balanced business model. Revenues in the first nine months were €22.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year, well above our target growth rate. Private Bank and Asset Management together attracted net inflows of €39 billion alongside €18 billion of deposit growth at the Group level in the third quarter. We also continue to make progress on the second dimension of our Global Hausbank strategy, operational efficiency. We have progressed with existing measures and we have additional measures in flight. And in terms of capital, we are delivering on our distribution commitments. We are on track to complete the €450 million share repurchase announced in July, thereby delivering total distributions across 2022 and 2023 of €1.75 billion. We finished the third quarter with strong capital. Our CET1 ratio was 13.9%. In addition, we have identified further capital opportunities and we now see scope to free up additional capital of €3 billion, enabling us to accelerate our strategy and boost returns, above our original expectations, from now to 2025 and beyond. This gives us added potential to increase capital distributions to shareholders while also deploying capital to support clients. Before we move on to progress in our businesses, let me give you an update on the Postbank IT migration. This was one of the largest IT migration projects in European banking and is essential to lay the foundations for a more digital bank offering at Postbank. We successfully migrated 50 billion records of 12 million Postbank customers; however, we saw unexpected levels of client enquiries which led to backlogs. We have put measures in place to work through these backlogs. This not only includes an increase of temporary staff, but also accelerating measures already underway such as implementation of automation and process optimization tools. And I am pleased that we have reduced the operational backlog by about two-thirds over the past weeks, and we expect 70% of all impacted Postbank customer processes to run against service level commitments again by end of October, including processes which have been particularly critical for our clients. We are confident that the remainder will be completed in the fourth quarter. Let me now turn to the key highlights of our resilient performance over the nine months on Slide 2. We delivered operating leverage of 4% on an adjusted basis in the first nine months, with revenues up 6% and adjusted costs up 2%. As a result, our pre-provision profit for the first nine months was up 5% year-on-year to €6 billion. In addition, we continue to reap the benefits of disciplined risk management and a high-quality loan book; provision for credit losses for the first nine months remained in line with our full year guidance at 28 basis points of average loans. Our balance sheet proved its resilience. Deposits rebounded by €18 billion to €611 billion in the third quarter. We saw franchise momentum across the board. And furthermore, we strengthened our capital position. Our CET1 ratio rose to 13.9% during the quarter, thanks, primarily, to strong organic capital generation from earnings and the results of our capital optimization efforts. This more than offset negative regulatory impacts, mostly model changes, and deductions for dividends and share buybacks. Let me now discuss the growth and balance across our business on Slide 3. The Corporate Bank delivered a post-tax RoTE of 17% in the past nine months. Strong revenue growth, combined with flat adjusted costs driven by tight expense discipline, produced operating leverage of 24%. Our momentum with key clients is encouraging; we saw an increase of around 40% in incremental deals won with multinational corporate clients which will drive future revenues. Our client focus, strong core capabilities and standing as an innovative thought leader in the market have been evidenced by The Banker's Transaction Banking Awards 2023, where Deutsche Bank has been voted Best Bank for Cash Management as well as Transaction Bank of the Year for Western Europe for the second consecutive year. In the Investment Bank, we have a well-diversified business portfolio, supported by our leading Financing business, which contributed €2.2 billion or approximately 35% of FIC revenues, year-to-date. We have invested into our Origination & Advisory business, taking advantage of market opportunities which are expected to drive future revenues, including through the acquisition of Numis, which we recently completed. We are also seeing clear signs of recovery in the market, led by Debt Origination. Turning to the Private Bank, the business grew revenues attracted inflows of €22 billion, supported by new money campaigns, and made further progress in streamlining our distribution channels. And finally, we also grew volumes in Asset Management. Assets under management grew by €38 billion, including €17 billion of net inflows in the first nine months of 2023, driven by strong inflows into Passive, including Xtrackers. The business launched 18 new products in the third quarter alone, including our first thematic ETFs in the U.S. market. To sum up, we delivered revenues of €28.5 billion in the last 12 months to September 30th, up over 6% versus the equivalent prior period. We also see forward momentum from net inflows, investments, and business wins with key clients. Our businesses are strongly complementary and well balanced. All of this supports our conviction that we will continue to grow our franchise and exceed our revenue growth targets. Now let me turn to the progress we’re making to accelerate the execution of our Global Hausbank strategy on Slide 4. First, on revenues, with compound annual revenue growth of 6.9% over 2021, we are well on track to outperform on our revenue growth target of 3.5% to 4.5%. And we will continue to benefit from the higher rate environment which drives sustainable performance in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank. We also made progress with our own initiatives that are expected to drive fee income. We are confident that the new addition to the family, Deutsche Numis, will enable us to take added advantage of an expected pickup in corporate finance activity. With €39 billion of net asset inflows in nine months, we expect the growth of our assets under management to drive fee income in future quarters. Second, on operational efficiencies, our existing savings measures are largely proceeding in line with or ahead of plan. This includes streamlining of front-to-back processes and headcount management. We are also optimizing our distribution network and we have reduced branches by more than 90 over the first nine months of 2023. And this enabled us to keep our adjusted costs essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter, despite absorbing inflationary pressures and investments in growth and controls, and we continue to work on further measures. And third, turning to capital efficiencies, as I mentioned earlier, we have made considerable progress on several fronts. We have already delivered, after two quarters around €10 billion of the €15 billion to €20 billion RWA reduction we planned by the end of 2025. Other measures are already ongoing, mainly focused on hedging and reductions in sub-hurdle lending. And, given progress to date, we have identified additional opportunities to reduce RWAs further, and this enables us to raise our target by €10 billion to €25 billion to €30 billion. Let’s now discuss what this means for us on Slide 5. As just mentioned, we will deliver a further RWA reduction of around €10 billion from our capital optimization measures. And on top of this, we now anticipate a lower impact from Basel III, by €10 billion to €15 billion, which James will discuss in a moment. Taken together, these two factors give us potential to free up additional capital of around €3 billion through 2025. We believe that our enhanced capital outlook will support accelerated and expanded distributions to shareholders while increasing our ability to invest in our platforms to boost growth and profitability. We will deliver this by sharpening our business model around capital-light and at-scale businesses, while applying rigorous hurdle rates to our portfolios to drive returns. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we see a clear opportunity to shift gears through a self-reinforcing process of franchise growth, operating leverage, and increased returns, and to create more lasting value for our shareholders as our Global Hausbank grows. With that, let me hand over to James\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 8 and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. Christian outlined the business momentum and our well-balanced revenue mix, which resulted in revenue growth of nearly 7% on a compound basis for the last twelve months relative to 2021. This performance puts us well on track to deliver revenue growth above our 2025 target. Our strong revenue growth combined with cost management led to a 2-percentage point improvement in the cost income ratio to 73% and our return on tangible equity was 7% in the first nine months of 2023. These ratios would have improved by almost 5% and 1.8 percentage points if adjusted for higher non-operating costs and if bank levies were apportioned equally across the year. Our capital position remained strong with the CET1 ratio at 13.9% this quarter after absorbing regulatory headwinds and the impact of the share repurchase. Our liquidity metrics also remained strong. LCR was 132%, in line with our target of around 130%, and the net stable funding ratio was 121%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our resilience and our confidence in reaching or exceeding our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the third-quarter highlights on Slide 8. Group revenues were €7.1 billion, up 3% on the third quarter of 2022 or 6% excluding specific items. Non-interest expenses were €5.2 billion, up 4% year on year, mainly driven by higher non-operating expenses. Non-operating expenses this quarter included litigation charges of €105 million and €94 million of restructuring and severance provisions. Adjusted costs increased 2% year-on-year, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Provision for credit losses was €245 million or 20 basis points of average loans. We generated a profit before tax of €1.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Net profit of €1.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year reflecting an effective tax rate of 30% compared to 23% in the prior year quarter. Our cost income ratio was 72.4% and our post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 7.3% in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share was $0.56 in the third quarter and tangible book value per share was €27 and $0.74, up 5% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results, starting with interest revenues on Slide 9, average interest earning assets increased by €6 billion quarter-on-quarter, driven by the increase in our deposit levels, led by the Corporate Bank. Net interest margin in the Corporate Bank declined by approximately 25 basis points due lower lending income and a higher cost of liquidity reserves; however, net interest income on the corporate deposit books remained stable over the quarter. Net interest margin in the Private Bank remained broadly stable in the third quarter. Overall, our deposit betas continue to outperform our models. At the Group level NIM is down 12 basis points of which approximately 5 basis points relates to an accounting impact in C&O, similar to the first quarter, and the balance relates to the NIM reduction in the Corporate Bank. With that, let’s turn to adjusted costs, on Slide 10. Adjusted costs excluding bank levies were €4.96 billion, in line with the prior quarter and up 2% year-on-year. The increase is driven by inflationary pressures, ongoing investments in controls and business growth which were partially offset by active cost management measures. All cost categories except for other costs were broadly flat to the prior year quarter. The variance in other non-compensation costs includes the non-recurrence of benefits in the prior year quarter, which related to deposit protection cost as well as movements in operational taxes. In addition, we see a normalization of marketing spend and we continue to invest into talent. Let’s now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 11. Provision for credit losses in the third quarter was €245 million, equivalent to 20 basis points of average loans. The decline compared to the previous quarter reflected a reversal of approximately €100 million of Stage 1 and 2 provisions driven by model changes and improved macroeconomic forecasts, mainly impacting the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank. Stage 3 provisions of €346 million were broadly in line with the previous quarter. Provisions this quarter were driven by the Private Bank and Investment Bank, while the Corporate Bank benefited from a lower level of impairments. For the full year, we continue to expect provisions to land at the upper end of our guidance range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. Before we move on the next two slides starting with Slide 12. Our third quarter Common Equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.9%, a 19 basis point increase compared to the previous quarter. Regulatory changes, principally from the go-live of now-approved wholesale and retail models, resulted in a decline of 38 basis points, slightly below the low end of our previous guidance. Optimization initiatives generated 27 basis points from lower Credit Risk RWA, principally reflecting improvements in our data and certain process changes. Further 19 basis points of ratio support came from diligent risk management in our businesses. Finally, 11 basis point increase came from strong organic capital generation, that is net income, offset by deductions for the share buy-back, dividends and AT1 coupons. Building on Christian’s earlier comments, let me give updated guidance on our capital outlook on Slide 13. As mentioned, regulatory changes led to a reduction of 38 basis points in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. With the go-live of the now-approved wholesale and retail models, the ECB has completed the review of approximately 85% of the relevant portfolio, and we expect only a limited ratio impact from the remainder. Next, we announced in the first quarter of this year a targeted €15 billion to €20 billion RWA reduction by end of 2025 through several capital optimization initiatives. We accelerated some of the anticipated data and process optimization initiatives into the third quarter which brings the cumulative RWA reductions to €10 billion to-date. The work we have done over the past several months gives us the confidence to increase the original target by €10 billion to €25 billion to €30 billion. Lastly, let me touch on our Basel III estimates, the latest review of our impact assessments indicates an RWA increase of only around €15 billion compared to the €25 billion to €30 billion, we have previously guided. The majority of the improvement comes from our Market Risk and Credit Valuation Adjustment, FRTB program, the impact estimates for which matured significantly. Credit Risk estimates are still under review and remain dependent on final CRR3 legislative text. Overall, let me highlight that current estimates are based on our interpretation of current draft regulation and therefore remain subject to change. Cumulatively, these changes in our outlook are significant and support Christian's earlier statements relating to our enhanced ability to execute our strategy and improve our return profile. Let's now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 15. Corporate Bank revenues in the third quarter were €1.9 billion, 21% higher year-on-year driven by an improved interest rate environment and pricing discipline with double-digit growth across all client segments. Sequentially, revenues decreased slightly due to lower net interest income from lending and a higher cost of liquidity reserves. However, pricing discipline in our deposit businesses remained exceptionally strong, with limited pass-through and higher business volumes, resulting in strong deposit income. We continue to anticipate a normalization of our deposit revenues over the coming quarters which we expect to be partially offset by growing non-interest-rate-sensitive revenue streams, including commissions and fees. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank was €117 billion, down by €12 billion compared to the prior year quarter, but €1 billion higher compared to the low point in the prior quarter. Deposits were €286 billion, €15 billion higher than in the second quarter, with growth in both overnight and term balances in Euro and U.S. dollar and essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter, despite the market events in March. Provision for credit losses was €11 million or 4 basis points of average loans. The decrease compared to the prior quarter reflects a lower number of impairments in the third quarter and further benefits from Stage 3 recoveries as well as model changes impacting Stage 1 and 2 performing loans. Non-interest expenses were €1.1 billion, a decrease of 2% year on year driven by FX movements. Sequentially, expenses decreased by 7%, predominantly driven by the non-repetition of litigation charges. Profit before tax was €805 million in the quarter, doubling year-on-year and driving the post-tax return on tangible equity to 18.3%, with the cost income ratio at 57%. I'll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 16. Revenues for the third quarter were essentially flat excluding the impact of DVA and 4% lower year-on-year on a reported basis. FIC Sales & Trading decreased by 12% against what was a strong prior year quarter. Rates, Foreign Exchange and Emerging Markets revenues were all lower compared to a very strong prior year quarter and reflected a less volatile market environment. Financing revenues remained strong on an absolute basis, though down year-on-year, due to the non-repeat of a material episodic item in the prior year quarter. Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher driven by ongoing improvements in the flow business and continued strong performance in Distressed. Moving to Origination & Advisory, revenues were up over three-fold, materially driven by the non-recurrence of leveraged lending markdowns in the prior year. However, excluding these markdowns, Origination & Advisory performance was still significantly higher and outperformed the industry fee pool. Debt Origination revenues were significantly higher benefitting from the non-repeat of the aforementioned markdowns and improved LDCM performance, which saw a partial recovery in both the industry fee pool and our market share versus the prior year. Advisory revenues were significantly lower reflecting a decline in the industry fee pool. However, as previously stated, with signs that deal activity is starting to recover, we expect our investments in Origination & Advisory to result in a significant improvement in performance into 2024. Non-interest expenses and adjusted costs were both essentially flat year-on-year. Risk-weighted assets were broadly stable year-on-year. Leverage decreased year-on-year driven by the impact of foreign exchange movements. Provision for credit losses was €63 million, or 25 basis points of average loans. The decrease versus the prior year was primarily driven by model changes affecting Stage 1 and 2 performing loans, partially offsetting Stage 3 impairments from Commercial Real Estate. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 17. Revenues were up 3% year-on-year or 9% if adjusted for specific items in the prior year period which related to Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Net interest income was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter, and higher deposit revenues in the third quarter were mainly offset by higher mortgage hedging costs following the Postbank transition, which were held centrally before. In the Private Bank Germany, revenues increased by 16% due to higher deposit revenues. A decline in fee income mainly reflected changes in contractual conditions impacting insurance products. Reported revenues in the International Private Bank were down 13% or up 2% year-on-year if adjusted for the non-recurrence of both specific revenue items in the prior year quarter and revenues from the divested Financial Advisory business in Italy, as well as FX impacts. Growth was driven by deposit products in Europe which were in part offset by continued client deleveraging in Asia. Revenues in Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs declined by 21% or 3%, if adjusted for the aforementioned effects. Revenues in Premium Banking increased by 14%, supported by higher interest rates. Turning to costs. The increase of noninterest expenses mainly reflects continued higher internal service cost allocations including investments in controls as well as restructuring provisions and severance related to strategy execution. The prior year period included a benefit from deposit protection costs. Provision for credit losses was €174 million or 27 basis points of average loans in the quarter and included an impact of approximately €25 million driven by the temporary operational backlog at Postbank. Overall, credit quality remained stable across our portfolios. The Private Bank attracted net inflows of €9 billion in the quarter with €6 billion in AUM deposits and €3 billion in investment products. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 18. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Assets under management remained stable at €860 billion in the quarter, supported by net inflows and positive FX effects, largely offset by €13 billion of market depreciation. Net inflows were primarily in Passive, continuing the momentum in our Xtrackers products we have seen throughout the year. As you will have seen in their results, DWS saw a decline in revenues compared to the prior year; however, with slightly lower non-interest expenses, profit before tax was essentially flat. This development principally reflected a 6% decline in management fees to €589 million due to prior year declines in assets under management, driven by net outflows excluding cash and market developments in 2022, as well as FX movements. Performance fees declined by €19 million. Other revenues declined due to lower mark-to-market valuations of co-investments, partly offset by favorable outcome of deferred compensation hedges. Non-interest expenses and adjusted costs were both 8% lower than the prior year. Compensation costs were lower driven by a significant decline in carried interest expense, partially due to lower performance fees in the period. Non-compensation costs were also lower, reflecting effective cost reductions across almost all cost categories. Profit before tax of €109 million in the quarter was down 18% compared to the prior year reflecting revenue performance. The cost income ratio for the quarter was 75% and return on tangible equity was 13%. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 19. Corporate & Other reported a pre-tax loss of €195 million this quarter versus a pre-tax loss of €28 million in the third quarter of 2022. This year-on-year change was driven in part by valuation and timing differences, which were positive €158 million in this quarter, versus €199 million the prior year quarter. The V&T result in this quarter was driven in particular by the reversal of prior period losses. Expenses associated with shareholder activities were €170 million in the quarter, compared to €144 million in the prior year quarter. And, the pre-tax loss associated with legacy portfolios was negative €137 million, driven primarily by litigation charges. Turning to the Group outlook for the full year on Slide 20. We remain focused on delivering positive operating leverage, as we drive our revenue growth initiatives and execute our cost reduction measures. We now expect full year 2023 revenues to be around €29 billion. Our noninterest expenses will be slightly higher reflecting a series of non-operating items; however, we expect our adjusted costs to remain essentially flat, in line with our guidance. Provision for credit losses is expected at the upper end of the 25 to 30 basis points range of average loans for the full year. Thinking ahead, our fourth quarter earnings are expected to be impacted by a number of one-off items, both positive and negative, including an accounting impairment of the goodwill from the Numis acquisition, a potential restitution payment from a national resolution fund, further restructuring and severance, as well as year-end tax adjustments. And finally, as both Christian and I have mentioned earlier, our capital outlook is substantially improved by further RWA reductions we have identified and we plan to engage with supervisors on the scope for further additional distributions to shareholders. With that, let me hand back to Silke and we look forward to your questions.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Silke Szypa',\n","  'text': 'Thank you very much. Operator, we are ready to take the questions.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': '[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nicolas Payen from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Nicolas Payen',\n","  'text': 'I have two please, on capital. The first one is on your increased capital efficiency. Could you give us a bit more color on how you managed to increase your reduction targets by €10 billion? And also regarding the €3 billion of potential additional freed up capital to 2025, what does it mean for your capital distribution and your targeted €8 billion shareholders distribution? Should we expect a meaningful increase as soon as next year? And then on the regulatory capital outlook and the improved Basel III outlook, is the new guidance related to the input floor? And also do you have any chance regarding your output for guidance? Thank you.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Christian Sewing',\n","  'text': \"Well, good morning, and thank you, Nico, for your question. Let me take the first part and then I hand over to James. Look, let me start that this is a very important and I think very good day for Deutsche Bank, because I think what we show now also on the capital side is nothing else than further evidence that our long-term strategy and obviously, the diligent execution around it is paying off more and more and obviously more to come. To your capital distribution question and how we did arrive, yes, it's a good day for shareholders, with material progress on our capital measures and scope to freeing up additional capital of the mentioned €3 billion from now through 2025. And as both James and I said in our prepared remarks, we see the outlook improvements regarding capital efficiency and Basel IV is providing us with the opportunity to both accelerate and expand our distribution right path. Amongst other things, it gives us the confidence to go beyond our earlier expectations In terms of buyback potential already next year. The better than expected third quarter RWA optimization and the improved outlook are both relatively recent changes and hence and hope you understand that it is a bit too early to provide exact details of how and when, we will be in a position to accelerate exactly this distribution path. And Nico, as you would expect, we are obviously in discussions with our supervisor on the revised capital plan. As we have laid down though a very clear path for dividends, i.e., a 50% increase per year the next two years. Extra distributions would come in form of share buybacks and subject to further dialogue with our supervisors. We would expect a significant proportion of the incremental capital to be distributed to our shareholders. And for instance, one way to think about this trajectory, Nico, from here is that it gives us the opportunity to move to a 50% payout ratio sooner than we initially expected. So I think at this point, we can safely say that shareholder distributions is a key priority for Deutsche Bank and for more details, I hand over to James.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"Sure. Thank you, Christian, and Nicolas, thank you for the question. So to give you a little bit of color on what is the optimization been that we've accomplished so far. You've seen us do three securitizations over the past couple of quarters including one on the Italian consumer portfolio in this quarter, and so that's been sort of quicker and more effective than we might have expected. And then when we talk about data and process improvements, the data is quite powerful, and by the way, this is where also we're getting the Postbank portfolio onto the same systems as DB is helpful, because we're able to apply, for example, SME support factors, infra support factors on the portfolio, in a way that we couldn't in the prior landscape. So it's enhancing the data, enhancing the way that our portfolio, if you like interacts with the rules. We think there's still a distance to go with that. And although we've worked on it for years, as rules change, one always finds additional optimization measures, so that's been very encouraging. If I think about, your question about input, output put floors on Basel III, we've really been focused on the 1125 impact and, as you've seen, dramatic improvement based on better visibility into the FRTB models as we mentioned. At this point, the output floor is still some years away, so I think of that as biting maybe in 2030. If you want guidance, we would probably stick with the 30 billion impact, at that point, but to be fair, we haven't really done this next round of mitigation in terms of portfolio shifts and what have you, so that's still a long way out. Hopefully, that helps, Nicolas, on your questions.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Adam Terelak from Mediobanca.

I appreciate you don't want to front run exactly, what we're going to look, what this is going to look like in the short-term, but you're on the tape this morning discussing higher payout next year than in your original planning. Can you confirm that that original plan was the plus 50% on the buyback to match the dividend increase? And can you also discuss whether we can look at more regular capital return over the next few years rather than having to wait for full year results each year? Secondly, on revenues, NII clearly stepped back in corporate bank, Private Bank this quarter. That's kind of been guided to, but can you give us some more color about the shape from here and use that to reference your confidence in revenue growth for the group into 2024?\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Christian Sewing',\n","  'text': \"Look, let me start on briefly again on the capital question. And again, I think it's good order to discuss all the details with our regulator first. But I think you're right, the 50% dividend pass, we always said, and we also said that this is quite a good guidance for our past guidance on the share buybacks. So in this regard, I think you have a good assumption. And as I just said, I think with the scope now of the additional 3 billion. Obviously, we would like and we intend then to start increasing the share buyback already in 2024, beyond that what we already communicated in our previous correspondence. So clearly an acceleration and expansion that's our goal and that will focus now -- this is our focus in our discussions with the regulators going forward. With regard to the revenues, I will hand over to James for more details in particular when it comes to NII. But also here I think very good messages because the clear jump off point for 2024 is now the 29 billion in 2023. You have seen a good development in the third quarter. Again, a very stable development also by the way on the NII side in both Corporate Bank and Private Bank, We see that momentum going forward into Q4 and therefore there is a high confidence in delivering 29 billion number for the full year 2023. On top of that, and I think we refer to that in our previous calls already. The geopolitical environment, the economic environment is something where at the end of the day, the advice which is asked by the clients, on the private banking side, on the corporate banking side, also with regard to our investment banking services is increasing and increasing. And therefore, we also said in our prepared remarks a 40% increase in mandated deals from the corporates in these first nine months of 2023 versus the same time period of 2022 is just one signal how much we are actually and see the momentum with our corporate clients around the world to think about how to best position in these geopolitical situations where we are. And hence, in particular also the investments which we are doing on the corporate side, in the investment banking on the advisory side, the investments which we have done on the wealth management side, now the finalization of the Numis transaction will grow also the non-NII business in 2024 a lot. And therefore, seeing the stability actually also in the NII business in 2023 plus the growth we see from the advisory, our clear goal is to show a 2024 revenue number of 30 billion. Regarding the composition, James will outline further but we can see a momentum which is simply unbroken.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"So, Adam couple of things on your comments, well let me start with the comment that our group NII number is a very noisy line and we've talked about it before the impact of the FX swap book and therefore the rate differential between euros and dollars plays a role here as does hedging results and other parts of the treasury piece, which is why it's actually I think more instructive to look at the net interest income and the margins of the businesses especially PB and CB. Now, there we show you margins that were actually reasonably stable quarter-on-quarter, some pressure in PB and CB rather. But interestingly this quarter the principal drivers were not the deposit margins. There was again noisy even at that level around mortgage hedging for example in the private bank, you know the excess of deposits over loans impacting the margin in the Corporate Bank, so things outside of the deposit margins. That difference was about 130 million if you take the two businesses together. We think Q4 will be about the same level, so flat to that. Really as deposit margins come in a little bit, but some of this other noise kind of clears through the system. So as Christian says, we feel good about the trajectory looking forward one even two quarters in those two businesses. And that of support, of course, supports our view going into to 2024. I think the other thing just briefly you mentioned on the timing of the buyback and distribution announcements, it's a fair point. It would take a lot of pressure off of us and the supervisors to do this more frequently and let's see is the short version. We want to -- the nice thing is if you split it out over the year, you can be a little bit more dynamic to the market environment and conditions. On the other hand, I think to some degree shareholders have sought the greatest degree of confidence as early as possible. So we're going to need to balance those two things but I could certainly envisage multiple requests in the year going forward.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Chris Hallam',\n","  'text': \"Just two from my side first on cost. Could you give us a sense of the size of the inflation headwinds you were able to offset and underlying costs in the quarter and maybe also where you'd expect to end the year given the Q4 one offs you flagged and how that sets the business up heading into 2024? And then secondly, maybe looking a bit further out to 2025, obviously, the revenue momentum is working out in your favor as you just discussed, but there's also still a disconnect between your targets on cost to income ratio and return on tangible equity for 2025 and the latest consensus. So just what are the main moving parts over the next two years that give you confidence on reiterating those 2025 targets?\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Christian Sewing',\n","  'text': \"Yes. Potentially, I start on your second part and obviously James shall add. Look on the difference in the 2025 targets I think it comes from both sides. Number one, a further increasing revenue line James just outlined, the 2024 pass, our confidence in the 30 billion in 2024. And obviously, we see that momentum also going then into the next year in 2025. And in particular in 2025 as we always said before, we have another NII tailwind actually in the private bank, which is not to be underestimated. So therefore, on the revenue side, Chris, further growth to be seen clearly. On the cost side, I'm really confident, because you know that we have given the goal of 2.5 billion, 2 billion already with our IDD in 2022. These 2 billion is actually based on our so-called key deliverables, i.e., the Germany optimization, the front to back, the technology architecture, the infrastructure efficiencies, real estate savings and so on. And there we really have a high confidence to deliver these 2 billion based on all the structural work which we have done over the last the 18 months since the IDD and we can see progress every quarter. On the remaining 500 million, obviously we are working diligently but also there good progress. We discussed with you the reduction in force program in April. We have actioned on that. We have 900 reduction delivering more than 100 million of annualized savings now from now on starting. James said it this morning rightly so. We have additional measures, which are now in execution and in flight that we further reduce our workforce. By the way, also with regard to the overall remediation which we have seen over the last years, we can see now that we think we have seen the peak in our workforce and we will further reduce. And this, if you want to mention it reduction in force 2.0 will be from a size and number bigger than the reduction we have seen in April 1.0. So that is the next part. And in line with our goal of achieving these additional 500 million, obviously, we are doing other things like third-party spending whether it's consulting marketing spending, which will save us a meaningful number also in 2024 versus 2023. We are obviously also with the peak in workforce which we have seen. We are obviously very selective and cautious also when it comes to new hirings. And in this regard, we have very good side on the 2.5 billion. That with the growing revenue number, which I just outlined. We are in full confidence that we can achieve the 10% or what we always wanted to do and where we still stand by to actually exceed the 10% RoTE in 2025.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"So Chris just on your inflation question and perhaps a little bit more on the targets. So inflation, it depends very much on what you're looking at. Compensation costs, elements of non-compensation for example software, there can be quite varied impacts. But I would say we're facing across the world, probably 4% to 5% inflation on average in both comp and non-comp costs that we need to work to offset. So far, I think we've been quite successful, in both line items. You need to work very hard on workforce composition. As Christian outlined, we've got a lot of measures underway there whether it's internalization, location strategy or just managing with discipline across the Company. And then on the non-comp, you've really got to focus on demand. And that's where I think that, passing some of the what I'll call the inflection points that we've been passing whether that's you know technology implementations, whether that's, control investment remediation, it does give us more flexibility to manage the demand side there. And so that gives us some comfort. If I think to run rates which I think was embedded in the second part of your question. We've talked over the course of the year about run rates, maybe made it too complex for you, but we're trying to manage in that 4.95 billion to let's say, 5 billion per quarter in adjusted cost range. We've had some pressure this year not just in inflation which I think we've been successful offsetting but also some of the investments that we've been making. In the fourth quarter, we may have some additional sort of unexpected costs associated with Postbank remediation that may push us up closer to or perhaps slightly above the 5 billion level in Q4 with all of that baked in including the additional Numis costs. I think we've talked about 4.975 billion back in July. But overall, a continued sort of evidence of I think discipline and control across the Company. That would represent a good step off also into 2024, whereas you know the goal that we have and Christian just outlined is to continue to crystallize these cost savings measures in order to manage overall flat notwithstanding inflation and investments.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Anke Reingen from RBC.

Can you talk a bit about the implications on costs? I think you just mentioned it and revenues near-term, and is there also risk as in, it could potentially delay, the target of cost savings? And if you can please talk about, I mean, if you can, about what we might expect in terms of potential actions by, BaFin could it be like fines operational risks or similar? And then secondly on the NII or the headwinds to your revenues in the Corporate Bank, the higher funding costs. Should we expect you increase the deposit collection further in Q4 and expect further headwinds? And is this related to, TLTRO maturities? I mean, I guess it offsets the benefit of the higher rates, so how much more of a headwind should we see there?'},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"I'll try to be brief. Look, we don't see a revenue impact of the Postbank integration or operational backlog issues and we wouldn't necessarily expect one going forward. Obviously, we want to work hard to put these issues behind us and sort of pivot to a very different customer experience and that's the focus of the management team there. You've seen, a cost of provisioning cost impact in Q3 that could also extend into Q4, but ultimately, we would expect to get that back as really we get back on track in terms of the collections activity where there's been some diversion of the operational staff. So call it zero or close to zero in those two lines when all is said done. On expenses, it's probably been in the high-single-digits in Q3, in terms of the remediation costs and if you kind of look to that in Q4, somewhere between 30 million to 35 million of incremental spend on the remediation, but we would expect that to tail off relatively quickly in 2024 as we put the operational issues behind us. And frankly invest in automation and improved capabilities going forward, so we feel it'll be a temporary impact. As it relates to sort of crystallizing the long-term benefits of the unity project, no change there, we're at work in app decommissioning and the various elements of the project that, particularly on the technology side, we're going to drive, the benefits, too early to make any comments on fines, frankly. We're working very closely with the BaFin, collaboratively with them and the monitor, and I think our interests are very well aligned that we want to put the backlog behind us and cease any disruption to our clients. On the liquidity and funding costs, it's interesting. I mentioned earlier that it's this excess of liabilities over assets in the corporate bank that can sometimes be a drag. The interesting sort of corollary there is we haven't yet seen a benefit in the NIM of loan growth. And so for the Corporate Bank in particular and then at the group level, we would benefit from putting the deposits to use. We're looking forward and believe that we should start to get some momentum in terms of loan growth going forward, and hence that imbalance can begin to help us. As it relates to TLTRO, you've seen that you've prefunded some of the maturities, the December maturities, and so TLTRO is becoming a less and less impactful, sort of part of our overall balance sheet and funding profile. Yes, there's a little bit of a drag going into 24% coming in that, but that, at this point is in sort of low very low double digits per quarter in the coming several quarters.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Christian Sewing',\n","  'text': \"We just had one point, Anke, to your first question, and James is absolutely right that there we don't expect an impact on our revenues just to support that in Q3 '23 versus the previous year Q3. We increased in particular the German private banking business by 16%. And I think this is another evidence actually that from a revenue point of view, it is so far not affecting us and I also don't expect that. And I have to say what the people in the private bank are doing in Germany is a fantastic job. Actually, A, to make sure that we reduce the backlog and we are doing really good progress, and secondly, actually take care of our clients.

Please go ahead.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Mate Nemes',\n","  'text': \"Good morning and thank you for your presentation. I have two questions please. The first one, I want to go back to the 3 billion potential additional capital freed up in the next two years as a result of Basel IV and an RWA reduction. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense to what extent do you expect actually to deploy some of that additional capital into the business organically or perhaps inorganically? And if so, what are the areas where you see perhaps and clear opportunities for that redeployment, and mindful that you mentioned that significant proportion is obviously for distribution? So that's the first question. And the second question is on the Corporate Bank. And I just wanted to pick up on the comment from you James on so far you haven't put those additional deposits into work. Yet we're seeing a very small uptick in loans in the corporate bank. So, the combination of the two suggests perhaps you have somewhat of a better outlook in terms of deployment and new lending, if you could just share your thoughts on that? Thank you.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"Yes, Mate, thank you very much for the question, and it's a great question. We've spent some time looking at this actually, and I want to give you a little bit of sort of color looking at the last seven quarters of where the capital has gone. So on average, we've generated about 27 basis points of capital, each quarter over the last year and change, and this is what's interesting. About a third of that has gone to support the distributions that we've been making so far, the 1.75 billion. About a third has gone into the regulatory changes, and about a third has gone into the ratio improvement up to now close to 14%. Almost none has gone into the business so far, and one of the reasons we think this sort of inflection point is so important is, first of all, we think we can step up the profitability, so the 27 basis points doesn't, by any means, have to be the cap in terms of what we can generate. But I think there is scope to increase the business deployment beyond, where what we've been doing the past couple of years especially as that reg build falls away, and we're at a ratio level now that is entirely comfortable for us in terms of buffers. So, there is capacity both for business deployment and for significant, distribution increases. Now to your point about Corporate Bank, yes, revenue loan growth in the past year and change has been quite slow across both businesses. And we'd like to think that there's, again, some signs of life. You mentioned a small increase, about 1 billion in the quarter in loans in the Corporate Bank. We've been waiting for that to come. We'd like to see it, and we think we may see it already in the fourth quarter, but then extending into 2024. And with our loan to deposit ratio now again below 80%, we have the capacity to support loan growth both from a capital and from a funding perspective. So we do think, we're turning the corner in terms of the ability to redeploy in both of those senses. In private bank, perhaps a little bit more sluggish. As you know, we've made a decision, not to kind of, emphasize mortgage lending, in Germany both given the market environment and given capital requirements, but we think we have capacity to grow margin lending in wealth management as that comes back to grow unsecured consumer lending. So that may take a little bit longer to come back, but also in that business, there's potential to grow loans to redeploy capital. Lastly, and this came up in a recent conference, we are careful in how we manage the capital that's committed to the investment bank, so those are portfolios that while there is opportunity to grow within our risk appetite. We are careful to manage the capital to that business, devoted to that business within constraints that we set. And so while we think there are attractive lending, opportunities there, we're going to be cautious about growing especially in an environment where there is still some uncertainty in the in credit environment. So look, short version is real capacity now for deployment in the businesses while we're in a very different, environment in terms of distribution potential.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Stuart Graham from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Stuart Graham',\n","  'text': \"I had two, please, both on capital. First, can I just press a little bit more on the RWA optimization measures, please? I hear what you say on the I guess, the support factors that you've been optimizing for a long time, and I guess I was surprised to find out that it's now in this one call? [Technical Difficulty] How do you think about the opportunities to invest that 3 billion of extra capital in growing the IB? On the one hand [Technical Difficulty] ex capital off your consensus 25 leverage ratio, I guess, just 4.6% suggest you have a lot of scope if you will [Technical Difficulty] that traffic. Please?\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"So, Stuart, it's James. You were cutting in and out a little bit, but I'll go with what I believe the questions were and you may need to follow-up. On RWA optimization, to be honest, so are we surprised, we've been, I'd like to think at the more sophisticated end of this type of balance sheet management over the years and to find more opportunity, is on the one hand encouraging, on the other hand you know suggest that there was something left on the table in the past. Now the securitization piece is a step change and what we're looking at and willing to do. But we've, as we've talked about before, we still like the economics of securitization. So we would estimate for example that the revenue to RWA relationship of the securitization we did this quarter was about 1.5% maybe 1.6% and so we can redeploy that capital at better, sort of equity margins call it than that. So there is still more to do. And as I mentioned earlier, you know, as the data environment improves more and more, we see scope to continue optimization. Of course, Basel III is entirely new, so the work on the models there, the visibility into the impact of hedging strategies that's also new. So it's a bit of an ongoing story. The redeployment I talked about a moment ago really to Mate's question. Again, there is scope to support growth in the businesses, but frankly the extra capital that we now have doesn't really change the growth potential of the businesses, and won't change our risk appetite. As you know, we've been disciplined about risk appetite. And we also intend to be different disciplined around capital allocation as I mentioned earlier, especially recognizing that that's a focus of attention around the investment bank. And finally, on the leverage balance sheet, we see them as sort of moving a little bit in tandem. So as our CET1 ratio goes up, so too is the leverage ratio. And while there's a bit more flexibility in managing the leverage balance sheet, we think we can very comfortably remain in the mid to high 4s, over time and if you like optimize the revenue footprint of that leverage balance sheet. So, hopefully, those answered your questions even though there was a little bit of signal challenge.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Stuart Graham',\n","  'text': \"Apologies for that.

But I do not see us changing dramatically our strategies put it that way, in terms of leverage deployment. I would think that on a comparative basis, we've been on the more conservative end in terms of the deployment of our leveraged balance sheet. And I don't see that changing dramatically, Stuart, even in light of some of the changes that you're seeing in the U.S.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Christian Sewing',\n","  'text': \"And Stuart, to James' point with no dramatic changes, I think if you talk to Ram Nayak, he has the clear strategy where he wants to be in Europe but also in the U.S. And that -- where he wants to be in the U.S. was already for him in the plan before the potential changes to the Basel requirements for the U.S. banks. So I agree with James. I think for us, it is good, on the one hand, that there is more capacity, but the strict adherence to risk return and to our capital allocation in this regard will not change. We want to grow our profitability. Now we have a bit more capacity to do this and we will do this, but we will not leave our risk appetite nor our clear reward expectations we have from the businesses.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Tom Hallett from KBW. Please go ahead.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Tom Hallett',\n","  'text': \"I suppose one of the debates for investors has been around the sustainability of profits, and within that, what normalized trading pools look like. If we take this year, it looks like your FIC revenues could land around the 8 billion mark with consensus expecting something similar over the next couple of years. But this is 2.5 billion higher than what we saw in 2018 and '19, and I appreciate the rent environment is very different. There's been a bit of balance sheet growth there as well. So what makes you confident that the 8 billion is sustainable given a pretty well documented normalization of the wider industry? And then secondly, on government taxes, it's been a key theme for the sector over the last few months. And again, I appreciate the impacts on you. Will it be limited so far, but do you see any risk for Germany to follow suit?\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Christian Sewing',\n","  'text': \"Let me start. Look, what makes me confident on the fixed side that this kind of 2.5 billion higher than three or four years ago is something sustainable. It's 3, 4 points, but number one, the healing of the bank. I mean this is the most important if you talk to our institutional clients, but also to the corporate clients. And I cannot even tell you -- and that was our focus, the transformation, the healing and with that obviously the rating upgrades which we have received from all the major rating agencies. That resulted in a completely different way how we can deal with our clients and that a lot of clients actually return to Deutsche Bank. And to be honest, we are still in the documentations of clients who have returned after the last increase and improvement of the rating agencies because you know how long it takes to get the documentation is the agreements, right? And in this regard, I can still see the benefits from that. So the healing of the bank is one of the key reasons. Number two, I think it's the focus which we have given ourselves, and in particular, Ram has done in the FIC business, in the trading business. It was exactly right to focus on that, where we are strong from a regional point of view starting with Europe, then obviously going into our emerging markets franchise also covering Asia, but also investing very focused in the U.S. And Ram has a clear plan how to grow also our FIC business in the U.S. over the next 12 to 18 months, and he put the right investments into that. Number three, it's the front-to-end reengineering of our processes in FIC. Also that is obviously which is not only making us more efficient, but at the end of the day, front-to-end always results in one thing. This is client experience for our clients. And with that, obviously, we make ourselves more attractive to deal with us. So, I think it's the overall healing of the bank but also the real focus and reengineering of the platform Ram has done to the FIC business, which makes me comfortable that the €8 billion which we have seen so far is a very good number to actually plan for the future and, in my view, if I look at his plan to even increase from there. Nevertheless, always said, we even want to make the investment banking business more balanced and therefore the investments into the O&A businesses. And also in the prepared remarks, we said how stable actually within the FIC business the financing part is. It's 35% of the FIC business. And that is coming through year by year, I think, with a very good and solid underwriting scheme. Regarding government taxes, look, it's always hard for me to judge what is coming. But on this end in Germany, on this side in Germany, I'm very calm. We have clear statements that these kind of excess taxes, I think, is not supported, in particular not by our finance minister. There is really no active discussion on this one. And therefore, it is for me a non-topic.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Andrew Lim from Societe Generale.

It doesn't seem like you're prepared to increase the €8 billion overall capital return envelope, but it does seem that you're more confident on reaching that 50% payout sooner rather than later. Is that the best way to think about it? So that €3 billion capital, that's being released as it were. That doesn't really become additive to the €8 billion? And then with that, if you look at your actions to optimize capital and RWAs, I guess that reduces risk weight density. And is that the way you see it? And so that being the case, maybe your guidance on the output floor there. Your comments earlier are that we should maybe stick to the €30 billion RWA impact there. And just very lastly, on the Corporate Bank NII, it does seem like the largest impact there is from the increase in liquidity reserve costs. What's your expectation there for how that should develop going forward, please?\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"So Andrew, the answer to the first question is no, that's not the correct way to think about it. So think about it this way. We had a capital commitment to shareholders of €8 billion at a point in time where our outlook and our step off were weaker than they are today. What we're not able or willing to say at this point is how much of that increment is going to come out to shareholders and how soon. We obviously owe you an answer on that in time, and we'll work through that internally in our capital planning and then with supervisors. But no, we would see it as incremental to the €8 billion. In terms of optimization, it's complex just because at a point in time, we're going to need to optimize around the output floor. That's not something that we've really done. Ironically, the impetus there would be to take on higher-risk density assets and so sort of optimize in that way. And actually, it goes a little bit also to Stuart's question. The -- what regulation asks you to do now is run this complex optimization algorithm across all of those resources in time. So, it's advanced approaches RWA, it will be standardized approaches RWA and then the leveraged balance sheet, And we're going to need to find the optimal use of the balance sheet under all three of those tests. In the case of the standardized, we have until 2030 when we think the out floor bites. I wouldn't expect -- just on the CB NII piece, I wouldn't expect that to change sequentially in the next couple of quarters. Again, a little bit depending on whether -- on how the loan and deposit sort of trajectory for the business go from here. We'd like to think we can continue to grow deposits and grow the loan balances, but it's the relationship between the two that really drives the question of the liquidity funding in the CB business.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Kian Abouhossein from JP Morgan.

If you have to, if you have to have the break, due to market conditions changing. Can you talk about the flexibility of cost? As you indicate, there's a lot of stickiness, there's inflation in cost, and I just try to understand your flexibility in that respect. How we should think about the elements of cost reduction in a different environment, and how you model that internally? And then secondly, the question is regarding your remarks on cost of risk. You mentioned model changes and improved macro forecast leading to reversals in Stage 1 and 2 provisions. Can you help me understand what's driving this more optimistic outlook, please? And if you could talk a little bit about the health of large corporate and Mittelstand in particular clearly in Europe, sorry, in Germany.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"Well, look, we've about this over the years, the P&L sensitivity, and I'd like to think. In fact, I'm confident that both sides of that equation have improved over the last several years. So start with the revenue side, as our revenue mix has shifted over time, I think our revenue sensitivity has declined dramatically, and not just because more of the revenues are coming from the businesses that we describe as more stable, but also because the revenue composition in the Investment Bank, I think has firmed up as well and our market position as Christian has outlined. So, I think that revenue sensitivity is lower than you might think, and by the way you also see us take relatively conservative decisions whether that's about risk type or on our interest rate risk management. So we manage that, it's not just an accident. And then on the cost side I have said over the years that that less is of the cost base is variable than I would like it to be. I think that equation is also changing for the better. Let's start with just the investment profile. As we shift from, I'll call them non-discretionary investments, investments that needed to be made in technology and in controls to a more discretionary profile, we can hit the brakes on those investments. And the other thing is that as we get deeper and deeper into the structural cost saves that Christian outlined, more of the cost base ends up being variable, and that can be variable compensation, but it can also be other elements of the cost base. So, the short version I think we're improving both aspects of that equation Kian relative to where we were a few years ago. On the cost of risk just in the detail there we had €100 million net on the Stage 1 and 2. Actually what that was a €100 million model benefit associated with the PD LGDs in the new wholesale and retail models plus about €30 million of FLI, forward looking indicator benefits, offset by about €30 million of in Stage 1 and 2 of portfolio changes, including sort of internal ratings and that sort of thing. Now why did the FLI improve? The point in time is always hard to remember, but the last time we booked this on a quarterly basis was in July where the outlook for the soft landing particularly in the U.S. was actually less optimistic than it became through the third quarter, so what you're seeing is a bit of a lag effect as to where things stood at that time.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Christian Sewing',\n","  'text': \"And Kian, on your last question, I think on the German corporates, large corporates and Mittelstand. Look, we're observing a very stable situation in terms of their credit worthiness. They benefit hugely from the resilience. I think I said it in one of the previous calls if I compare the situation of German Mittelstands clients with 15 years ago, we have a capital ratio, we have a liquidity ratio, liquidity position of those clients which is in much better shape than 15 years ago after the global financial crisis, they all worked on themselves. So, I think despite the no growth situation in Germany, we can really attest a very resilient portfolio. And hopefully with growth coming back in '24, albeit very low growth in '24, we then will also to see that there is obviously growth coming back into those slides. So for the time being also from our rating downgrades versus upgrades, no negative or no deterioration to that what we have seen three or six months ago.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","  'text': \"If I could just briefly follow-up on the cost flexibility and I know I've asked this question, but you're trading at 0.3x tangible book value for a reason and that's a reflection of the concern that in a different scenario, you will not be able to manage cost to some operating leverage, let's put it this way. So can you quantify and give us more confidence in your cost stability and managing your cost stability in a different scenario?\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Christian Sewing',\n","  'text': \"Look, let me start and James will follow-up. First of all, I do believe that it's most important for our credibility that we achieve those cost targets which we have given to the market and we will do so. That's therefore, I ran you through the structural cost savings and that what we now put on top actually in order to get to the 2.5 billion. Secondly, of course, if this would happen, you have three or four layers, of course, where we can very quickly reduce the spending. That is the variable comp which means -- with regard to investments. Obviously, we are reviewing those investments on a quarterly basis. Also adhering, obviously, to the profile on the business side and whether the performance is the right one. I think we have a very good monitoring in place on this one. Secondly, yes, there is always the flexibility on the variable comp, which we obviously would adjust to the performance -- to the revenue performance. I think we have also shown that in the past that we are able to do this, and we will do this. So this is obviously, if you look at our variable comp, that is not an insignificant number, which we could reduce like for the CTB, i.e., change the bank investment. And then you have those items where Rebecca is going actively after already now but which also plays into this one, which is everything on third-party costs, which means also consultancy, which means marketing. And easily in this regard from a flexibility point of view, Kian, you are in a very high 3-digit million number. And in this regard, I would say this bank has clearly the ability to react. But most important for us is obviously to first of all deliver that what we promised to you and this is the €2.5 billion.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Timo Dums from DZ Bank.

So starting with Q4, maybe you could provide specifics on the one-offs you flagged for the current quarter.

So this would be my question number one. And my second question is on the outlook on O&A. So again, a strong recovery here. So what's your view on the last quarter? Should we expect another pickup despite the seasonal patterns? And what are your expectations looking further down the road?\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"Briefly on the second question, yes, we would see a continued improvement sequentially in O&A, and we would look to a much more significant improvement going in then to 2024. So, we're optimistic there. On the Q4 one-offs, why don't I meet you halfway? On the DTA, I would expect and here it's a different geography from last year, where the DTA related to the U.S. I would size it today at about 5 million of opportunity in the tax line, potentially larger. It all depends on our forward-looking view of profitability in the UK entities and jurisdiction going forward. That's to the positive. The Numis goodwill, it's too early to give an exact number given we're going through the purchase price allocation process sort of as we speak. But to give you a ballpark, I would expect us to book about €250 million in -- as a non-operating cost around that Numis goodwill. The numbers that I can't really guide you on today would be, one, the restitution payment to the upside. And then as you all know, restructuring and severance and legal litigation items are always subject to some uncertainty. And so as we get more visibility, if we get an opportunity, we'll give you an update on that. I'd like to think the net of those four things is biased to the positive, but we have to wait and see how it all plays out.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Giulia Miotto from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Giulia Miotto',\n","  'text': \"So, the first one on CRE, commercial real estate. Thank you for the detail provided in the slides at the back. If I compare your level of provisioning, especially on the U.S. side with what U.S. banks have been seeing so far this quarter, it seems like you have -- your provisions are lower. I was wondering what gives you the confidence of these passively lower provisions in these markets specifically, especially for U.S. office, which seems particularly challenged? And then on Numis, I know it's early days. The acquisition closed 13th of October, I believe. But I was wondering if you have any early thoughts that you would like to share now that this is part of Deutsche Bank. And then a quick technical one. DTAs, with all these DTAs being written back, what's the benefit for the tax rate in the coming years?\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"Thanks, Julia. So I'll try to -- well, starting with CRE, it's just hard to say because we have no insight into our competitors' portfolios. And so we can tell you what we think of ours. And as we've said sort of consistently from the start of this cycle, we think we have a high-quality portfolio. It's -- to the extent it's concentrated -- obviously, there's an office exposure, but it's concentrated in Class A strong sponsors and what have you. And what we -- but we're happy to share this time in the appendix material is, frankly, the experience that we've had. So now we're sort of four, five quarters into this cycle in commercial real estate. And we think that the relationship between the loan modifications and the expected credit losses that arise from that speak to the quality of the portfolio. Now that, we're, call it, halfway through that. But you can see that if trends continue or even deteriorate a little bit, this should be an entirely manageable situation for that. Coverage is hard to measure on a comparative basis. But we think we're taking provisions and collateral allowance and collateral together. We think we're sort of reasonably in line with the peers. On Numis, we're very excited about the transaction. I mean, the first few days and the process with the Deutsche Numis organization have been very successful. Both the Deutsche U.K. corporate finance team going into Numis and the relationship with the Numis leadership and staff is off to a great start, and the client feedback has been extremely positive ever since the announcement. So, it's early days in terms of revenue production, if you like, but we're very encouraged by what we see so far. Ultimately, on the DTA, it doesn't really affect the tax rate. So you should expect us to advise an effective tax rate continuing to be in the sort of 29% to 30% range, going forward, always a little bit of variation in that. But the DTAs are one-off. And I would think of it as complete, if you like, this year when we revalue the U.K. tax characteristics.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'The next question comes from Amit Goel from Barclays. Please go ahead.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Amit Goel',\n","  'text': \"So just coming back on the cost base. Obviously, you've reiterated the conviction in terms of getting down to that kind of €18.5 billion, €19 billion type level. I'm just curious, I mean, I think unless you change the exit rate for this year, it's a bit higher than the level achieved this year or will be. So I mean, when should we expect to see those costs coming out? So would that be more in the second half of '24 or into '25? Or could it be sooner? And then secondly, just related to that, I mean, if costs proved to be a bit more sticky, are you seeing potential distribution of the RWA efficiency savings as the other or another lever to help get to that 10% RoTE target or above? Or are these kind of just two very independent things? And then just one follow-up, I guess you just mentioned, obviously, on PB, the revenue tailwind in 2025. I was just wondering if you can potentially size that or give us an indication of how much you're expecting from that.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"Sure. Thanks, Amit. Look, actually, the middle part of your question is a really good one. The RWA and the RoTE are, in fact, linked. And ironically, you start to have denominator problem and, therefore, a strong incentive to distribute capital in order not to have the RoTE dragged down by higher tangible equity. In fact, you're seeing that already this year. The biggest part of the RoTE decline in the third quarter versus last year was just higher capital. The tax rate played a big impact as well. But leaving that aside, it's higher capital. So we are incentivized to push out capital. If I think about the exit rate, yes, the 5% is a little higher than we'd like it to be. And to your point, to get to a full year number of adjusted costs in line with this year, we would need to start bringing it down in the second half. But look, if we're traveling in the 4.9 to 5 area next year in each of the four quarters, we think we're doing okay. And we will -- to Kian's earlier question, we think we've got more levers to help to drive that going forward. On the tailwind into '25, this is some distance ahead, but I would quantify it as €200 million to €300 million just from the deposit hedges kind of rolling over, so a nice tailwind for that business, for the PB business going forward.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': '[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jeremy Sigee from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.'},\n"," {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee',\n","  'text': \"Just a couple of quick numbers questions, please. The expectation was that you'd be getting to just over €400 billion of RWAs in 2025. If I adjust that for the undershoot today, the extra savings, the Basel IV, it would come out more like €370 billion. Is that a fair expectation? Or is it likely to be higher than that with redeployment? So that's my first question. And then different numbers question on NII, you've talked a bit about deposit NII pressure in 4Q. If rates stay at this level and beta gets to its sort of medium-term resting place and also term assets re-price fully, what would we be subtracting and adding to NII? And I'm particularly focused on the Corporate Bank and the Private Bank. So just those two big numbers, if we fully did the beta and fully re-priced any term assets that take time, what would we be adding and subtracting?\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'James von Moltke',\n","  'text': \"So Jeremy, on the RWA, I would -- in brief, I would anchor off of €380 billion rather than €370 billion. So, the walk was from, call it, €420 billion, which was the earlier consensus number for the end of '25, which we said was pretty close. We took that down to €405 billion with the €15 billion, and now the €10 billion and the €15 billion improvement should get you to about €480 billion. That doesn't account for the redeployment. So, we'll see if that number still holds, there may be more opportunity to redeploy than we had originally anticipated, which is why, it's early days in the capital plan. In terms of fully phased in, I'll be honest, I haven't thought about it in the -- in just the two deposit books. And as I say, there's a lot of noise in the NII number. But in round numbers, we've -- on a reported basis, we've held steady at 13.5. Some of -- most of the NII upside that we saw this year actually went into the noninterest revenue lines. if I look to a normalized level, you'd like to see it, frankly, at 13.5 or better, especially going into '25 and beyond given, in the answer to Amit's question, the uplift that you get in both businesses from the deposit hedges moving. So, whatever the dip is next year, hopefully small, we think that we're sort of currently traveling at a baseline that's a pretty good baseline to grow from into '25 and '26. And that's before all of the noninterest revenue upside that we see and that Christian went through in his earlier comments. So that underscores, if you like, the optimism we have for the revenues next year and beyond. And we don't see any reason why the compound annual growth rate target would actually step back significantly from here over the next two years. So a 3.5 to 4.5 is something that you'd like to -- I say, I think we can achieve from this point or even better.\"},\n"," {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","  'text': 'There are no further questions at this time.

Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse first quarter 2020 earnings release and remind you that our first quarter 2020 financial report and accompanying financial statements for the period will be published on or around May 7. We would also like to remind you that our Annual General Meeting of shareholders will be taking place next week, on April 30. I will now hand over to our CEO, Thomas Gottstein and CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Kinner. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our first quarter 2020 results, my first as Group Chief Executive. Before I start with the slide presentation, allow me to make a few personal comments. As you know, I took office on 14th of February, little did I know then how the world would change within less than a month. During my first three weeks, I had the opportunity to meet with many colleagues in meetings in townhalls with key clients, investors, including most of our top 30 shareholders, analysts, regulators and journalists. These meetings took place in Switzerland, in London and in the U.S., and were very valuable for me personally to exchange views and discuss the strategic priorities and prospects of Credit Suisse with key shareholders and stakeholders. Unfortunately, the global COVID-19 pandemic then became a reality, which changed circumstances completely. Suddenly traveling was not possible and my priorities shifted to the safety of our employees, ensuring business continuity and being there for our clients in the face of a crisis. I am incredibly proud of how our organization has reacted to the challenge and demonstrated the strength of the Credit Suisse culture, based on its can-do attitude, teamwork, entrepreneurship and solidarity. I want to thank all our 48,000 employees for what they have done and achieved over the last few weeks in very difficult circumstances. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Executive Board and on the Board of Directors for their leadership and partnership, which allowed us to quickly react to the recent events in a coordinated fashion. Let me now take you to the slide presentation. I will take you through some of the highlights of the numbers this morning, as well as detail our response to the COVID-19 and the impact that it had, its having on our business. It is clearly an uncertain time for all in financial markets. However, I do believe that we have been able to demonstrate our resilience in the first quarter, as well as placing our clients, employees and communities at the center of everything that we do. Let's go to the first slide. In the first quarter, we generated CHF1.2 billion of pre-tax income, up 13% year-on-year. This was supported by a 9% increase in revenue across our Private Banking franchises, excluding the gain from the final closing of the InvestLab transfer in the quarter and a 25% increase in our sales and trading revenues. I would note that the increase in pretax income for the group was achieved despite an over CHF1 billion reserve build. We reduced total operating expenses by 6% year-on-year to CHF4 billion and now expecting around CHF16 billion of adjusted operating expenses for the full year 2020. Excluding the provision for credit losses, mark-to-market losses and gain from the InvestLab transfer, our pretax income for the quarter would have been CHF1.9 billion, a 66% increase year-on-year. This shows how much we have further improved the operating leverage of our business model. At CHF1.3 billion, we delivered the highest quarterly net income in the last 5 years and the return on tangible equity of 13.1%, in part benefiting from the closing of the InvestLab transfer and the negative tax rate. At the revised tax rate guidance for the full year 2020 of 20% to 25%, our ROTE for the quarter would have been around 9% to 9.5%. I would also add that the 13.1% ROTE achieved in the first quarter was the highest in the last 5 years. In the current market turmoil, we also benefit from our strong capital and liquidity position. In terms of capital, our CET1 ratio stood at 12.1% and our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8% at the end of the first quarter. We also maintain a strong liquidity position with one of the highest liquidity coverage ratios among international peers at an average LCR of 182% for the first quarter. And, to further protect our capital base, we have suspended our share back, buyback program and delayed the decision on the second half of our 2019 dividend until later in the year as previously communicated. Finally, and as you may have seen from our announcement last week, we received regulatory approval to become a majority shareholder in our securities joint venture, Credit Suisse Founder Securities Limited, marking a significant milestone in the Bank's China strategy. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to look at our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a little more detail. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had on markets, economies and our society is profound. At Credit Suisse, we have adopted a three-pronged approach in response to the pandemic. First, my focus and that of the Executive Board has been on the well-being of our employees. We have established numerous support measures for our employees to overcome the challenge of the pandemic, including early engagement of medical advisors in Switzerland and globally, paid family leave in all markets in which schools are closed for those colleagues who are unable to work from home and honoring the contracts of future hires and pushing forward with remote on-boarding. As a result of detailed business continuity management, we were able to move quickly to remote working, and now approximately 90% of our employees can work remotely, with approximately 70% to 80% doing so and health measures in place for those still working from our office locations. Second, we have continued to serve our clients through these challenging times. We continued to provide bespoke client solutions given the market dislocation, whether that's to our Private Banking clients across region or to our wholesale clients in Investment Banking. We have leveraged our digital banking model to ensure business continuity, for example, by onboarding clients digitally. And in Switzerland, we continued to serve our retail clients through branches, 2/3 of which remain open and are following social distancing rules and increased hygiene measures. We also have played an active role from the beginning in the development of the CHF40 billion bridging loan program to SMEs sponsored by the Swiss government, of which more in a moment. Third, we are working in our communities to provide support where we can. We have launched a bank-wide donor-advised matching program to encourage employee donations to charities working to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. As part of that, myself and every member of the Executive Board has committed to donating at least 20% of 6 months' base salary or equivalent. The Chairman of the Board of Directors has also committed to donate to a similar extent. We have also made local donations of masks to hospitals and health care providers in a range of locations and made donations through our regional foundations to a range of charities. Next slide, please. Here in Switzerland, I'm proud to say that we have been able to play an active role from an early stage in the development of a highly effective and innovative CHF40 billion bridging loan solution for Swiss SMEs and we have done so in conjunction with the Finance Ministry, the Swiss National Bank, FINMA and the Swiss Bankers Association. The details of the 2 programs are referenced here targeting small- and medium-sized companies, providing access to funds quickly and without onerous paperwork requirements. The programs were modeled on an idea originally from Credit Suisse using the trade export guarantee system as a basis and involve significant government guarantees at 85%. As you can see from the slide, from the original idea to the program being implemented on March 26 was a matter of days. Eligible customers were able to access funds within 0.5 hour of completing a simple 1-page form. The success of the program overall is reflected in the decision on April 3 to increase the overall lending guarantee from the original amount of CHF20 billion to CHF40 billion. To date, Credit Suisse has granted approximately 14,000 loans with a total volume of CHF2.4 billion under both the SME and the corporate facility. Where we make a profit on these loans, if any, we have said from the outset, we will donate it to organizations focused on helping the Swiss economy. The program is a testament to the strength of the Swiss financial center working together for a common cause at a time of great need. Next slide, please. As I mentioned earlier, our results for the first quarter contained a gain from the second and final closing of the transfer of InvestLab to Allfunds. Including this transfer, pretax income rose 13% to CHF1.2 billion. Excluding the gains from the transfer, but including the over CHF1 billion reserve build, which we'll cover later in this presentation, pretax income was down 11% on the same quarter of last year. Next slide, please. As mentioned at the outset of my presentation, we have delivered the highest quarterly net income in the past five years at CHF1.3 billion. In part, this was supported by a negative tax rate that David will discuss in more detail later on. Next slide, please. This brings us to return on tangible equity. Despite credit provisioning and mark-to-market losses, we achieved a return on tangible equity of 13.1%, significantly increased from the 7.8% reported in the first quarter of 2019. Here, again, we see the benefit from the earlier mentioned gains from the InvestLab transfer and the negative tax rate. Based on a tax rate in line with our new guidance of 20% to 25% for the full year, our return on tangible equity for the first quarter would have been around 9% to 9.5%. Next slide, please. Our Private Banking businesses are at the core of our strategy and continued to demonstrate their importance during the first quarter despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Within Private Banking, we saw growing net interest income, stable recurring revenues and strong transaction activity, up 31% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period a year ago. Overall, Private Banking net revenues rose 9%, and this excludes the gain from InvestLab, showing continued strong momentum in these businesses. Next slide, please. Our integrated International Trading Solutions, ITS, business, a collaboration between SUB, IWM and Global Markets, continues to be an important differentiating factor in our model, providing trading solutions to Private Clients. During periods of market dislocation, as we are currently in, Private Clients are often seeking innovative solutions in order to protect their positions and best-in-class trading execution across all asset classes, including equities, bonds, FX, OTC derivatives and structured products. ITS is also at the heart of our lombard and share-backed lending effort to our Private Clients and once again proved its worth, as reflected in the 64% increase in revenues between the first quarter of 2018 and the quarter just ended. Next slide, please. Here, we are showing the makeup of our total Investment Banking net revenues across advisory and underwriting, equity sales and trading, and fixed income sales and trading. Both equity and fixed income sales and trading had strong first quarters, up 24% and 26%, respectively. Those strengths in our diversified Investment Banking portfolio, however, were offset by weakness in advisory and underwriting in March, resulting in 38% lower revenues from this business in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the mark-to-market losses of $459 million incurred in the first quarter, overall Investment Banking net revenues stood at $2.9 billion, up 23% on the same quarter a year ago. Next slide, please. This slide provides an overview of our comprehensive reserve build during the first quarter as a response to the challenging environment and continued pressure on oil prices. As a U.S. GAAP reporting Bank, we also incorporated appropriate CECL provisioning, taking into account updated relevant macroeconomic forecasts. David will provide further details on our modeling approach and underlying assumptions in his section. For the first quarter, we saw an increase in allowance for loan losses of CHF585 million as you can see from the bar in the center of this chart. On top of that, we took CHF284 million of mark-to-market losses in leveraged finance and a further CHF160 million for the APAC Financing Group. Together, that gives a total reserve build of just over CHF1 billion. CHF376 million of this amount relates to CECL provisioning, which, as you know, reflects general credit risks and non-specific client exposures. Next slide, please. I just wanted to take a moment to reinforce the importance of our home market in the current environment. From the start of 2017 until the end of 2019, on average, the Swiss Universal Bank contributed 38% to Group profit. The Swiss Universal Bank accounts for 58% of the Group's net loans on its books as shown in the pie chart on the lower left of this slide. Swiss loan quality has proven to be particularly resilient when compared to other countries. This is displayed on the right side of this page, showing provisions for credit losses and non-performing loans, respectively, as a percentage of total loans across some of the biggest banks in each of these markets. When looking at our balance sheet, the strength of our home market and its strategic importance should not be underestimated nor forgotten. To sum up the main part of my presentation, let me turn to the following slide. Here in the right-hand bar, we show the net revenues for the Group in the quarter, excluding the gains from the InvestLab transfer and the aforementioned mark-to-market losses. The light blue section of the bar shows the total operating expenses, which we have incurred to deliver these revenues. And the dark blue section depicts the pre-provision profit for the quarter, if it weren't for the appropriate credit provisions reflecting current market conditions. At CHF1.9 billion, this represents a CHF773 million increase compared to the same quarter of last year and shows that we have further strengthened our combined Private Banking and Investment Banking franchise, our profitability and delivered substantial operating leverage. And with that, I would like to hand over to David for the discussion of our financial results in more detail.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Thomas. Good morning, everybody. And I like to take you through the financial numbers in more detail. As Thomas has mentioned before, Credit Suisse's businesses delivered a resilient first quarter despite the challenging market and operational environment. As with prior quarters, to be helpful with comparisons and to better illustrate our financial performance, you will see that we've included a table at the bottom that includes our results excluding gains relating to the transfer of the InvestLab fund platform to all funds group. This will be the last time that we break out such gains for InvestLab as we've now completed the second and the final closing at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Gains in the first quarter from InvestLab totaled CHF268 million. Now, overall net revenues in the first quarter of 2020 were CHF5.8 billion, that's an increase of 7% year-on-year, including the impact of the gains from InvestLab that I just mentioned. If we were to exclude those gains, net revenues for the quarter would have been CHF5.5 billion and that's an increase of 2% year-on-year. Now, just looking at our business lines. In the first quarter, Wealth Management-related revenues increased by 7% compared to the same quarter in 2019, again including InvestLab. Wealth Management-related results excluding that gain, suffered from mark-to-market losses, say in Asset Management and in the APAC Financing Group portfolio. But Private Banking revenues, even excluding InvestLab was strong. We saw an increase of 9% compared to the prior year, and overall within Private Banking, we saw significant growth in transaction revenues, as well as a resilient result in net interest income and in recurring commissions and fees. If we look at our other operations, our markets businesses across both GM and Asia Pacific, we saw a combined revenue growth of 22% for the quarter, stated in U.S. dollars. These businesses benefit from a significant increase in market volumes and volatility during the quarter. Our Investment Banking and Capital Markets activities had an initially strong start to the year and we saw a pick-up of momentum and deal closings in January and February. But as we moved into March, the global response to COVID-19 made for a markedly more difficult environment for this business. We saw a reduction in primary activity, as well as the increase in credit provisions and in mark-to-market losses. Thomas has already touched on the reserve build in the first quarter, and I'll give you some more detail shortly, but you'll note that we had a provision for credit losses of CHF568 million and that compared to CHF81 million in the first quarter of 2019. We saw these provisions across all divisions, but in particular, they were focused on the Corporate Bank, which adversely affected IBCM and GM, as well as our credit exposures in Asia Pacific. I think it's clear that given the deterioration in the operating environment, cost management is going to remain critical this year. Our total operating expenses in the first quarter stood at CHF4 billion and that's down 6% year-on-year. We're going to remain very disciplined on costs for the whole of 2020, with adjusted operating expenses expected to be around the CHF16 billion level. Overall, and notwithstanding the substantial reserve build, we generated pre-tax income of CHF1.2 billion in the quarter and that's an increase of 13% year-on-year. As we've noted, and as Thomas has already referred to, our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative. That was a result of substantial and positive progress on deductions on our interest cost deductibility with international tax authorities. We benefited from the reassessment of the adverse marginal impact of the BEAT legislation in the United States as well as certain other significant U.S. rule change, which includes a carryback gain for prior years. Now if I look forward to the full year 2020, given this improvement, I'd reduce our guidance for the 2020 tax rate from the 26% to 27% level that I gave at the Investor Day last December to be at the lower range of 20% to 25% for the current year. Net income to shareholders stood at CHF1.3 billion, and that's an increase of 75% year-on-year and equated to a return of tangible equity of 13.1% for the first quarter. But as Thomas said, if you were to apply that guidance for the tax rate of 20%, 25%, you'd end up with return on tangible equity something in the 9% to 9.5% for the first quarter. Let's turn to the CET1 ratio. So our CET1 ratio for the quarter was 12.1%, and that compares to 12.7% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Now already included in this capital ratio, both at the end of last year and at the end of the first quarter, is a full capital deduction for the full year 2019 dividend, both for the first payment of CHF0.1388 that our shareholders will vote on at the AGM next week and for the second payment that the Board will review in the autumn and would intend thereafter to propose to an extraordinary general meeting at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Now given market volatility and the overall pressure on the global economy, the Swiss regulator, FINMA, has decided to phase in the CHF12 billion of RWA inflation from the Bal III reforms, primarily related to SA-CCR and certain other measures, which we briefed you on in the past, over the whole of 2020. Accordingly, we therefore recognized CHF3 billion in the first quarter rather than the CHF12 billion that I've guided to before. I'd also note that FINMA, like other major regulators, has introduced certain temporary exemptions relating to backtesting exceptions in the model approach to market risk. Risk-weighted assets overall increased from CHF290 billion at the end of the fourth quarter to CHF301 billion at the end of the first quarter. RWA increases relating to net business usage was primarily driven by corporate lending drawdowns and by increased market volatility during the second half of the quarter. There was a CHF3 billion reduction in RWA due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc. But as you know, we hedged that so that's had a negligible CET1 ratio impact. And clearly, as I've noted already, we also saw a CHF3 billion increase in RWA from the phase-in of the SA-CCR-related Bal III reforms. Our share buyback program is on hold until at least the third quarter of 2020 when we will then reassess our position, and I would hope that we'll be with better understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets and the economies in which we operate. Just in terms of guidance for the CET1 ratio for the balance of 2020. Given the industry- and market-wide increase in risk-weighted assets due to the heightened level of volatility and increased lending drawdowns and adverse migrations, together with the phase-in of the SA-CCR measures, I think it's prudent to say that I would expect us to operate at a CET1 ratio of around 11.5% for the balance of this year rather than the 12% that we previously guided. Let's turn now to leverage, please. So on this slide, I show our CET1 leverage and our Tier 1 leverage ratios. FINMA has decided to allow us and our peers temporarily to exclude cash held at central banks adjusted for any upcoming 2019 dividends from the calculation of leverage ratio. This exclusion applies at least initially until the 1st of July 2020. At the end of the first quarter, excluding CHF88 billion of net cash held at central banks, by which I mean this has been adjusted for the planned dividend payments as requested by the FINMA's rules, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 5.8%. Now if you were to adjust onto the previous basis and include the cash held at central banks, just to be transparent on this, the ratio would have been 5.3%. So that's a small decline compared to the 5.5% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. The CET1 leverage ratio, excluding net cash held at central banks, stood at 4.2% at the end of the first quarter. Now our leverage ratio increased through the quarter on a like-for-like basis due to the market volatility that we saw and the increase in the net cash positions that we held at central banks. But this was then offset by the exclusion of those increased central bank deposits subject to the dividend adjustment as FINMA permits. If you look at the chart, you can see, first, the impact of the strengthening of the Swiss franc, which led to a CHF10 billion reduction in leverage. Next, the higher levels of cash that we held at central banks at the end of the first quarter resulted in a CHF15 billion increase. We then saw a CHF43 billion increase in leverage exposure in certain parts of our businesses in the first quarter and that was primarily in Global Markets and reflects the market volatility, increased margin requirements that we saw in March, increased sales, drawdown’s to the Corporate Banking book as well as reduced netting at quarter end. These increases were then offset by the exclusion of the central bank deposits. So that led to an overall reduction in leverage of CHF40 billion. Now just in terms of the absolute amount of leverage, I would expect the adverse impact on leverage from volatility to largely normalize during the course of 2020. And even including central bank deposits, our CET1 leverage ratio by the end of the year should be in line with our previous guidance to be around 4%. Clearly, if, as other regulators have done, the central bank exclusion is actually extended by FINMA, the ratio will be high, so probably around 4.3%. Okay, let's just turn to look briefly at costs, please, on Page 21. The focus we have on cost efficiency and productivity remains an absolute priority, particularly in these times. During the first quarter, our total operating expenses amounted to CHF4 billion, and that was a decrease of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We've continued to fund very strategic investments for growth across the Bank, particularly in our Wealth Management-related divisions, as well as investments intended to improve digitalization and to increase the Bank's efficiency. But as we've said before, the pace of these investments are dependent on market and on economic conditions and given the current environment, I want to just reiterate that we will maintain a various high level of focus on cost discipline for 2020. Clearly, COVID-19 and the move to remote working for some, much of our workforce does provide the potential to reduce our costs in certain areas, but it will increase in others. Just in terms of guidance, as I said, we're going to be very disciplined for 2020, and I think I'd expect adjusted operating expenses to be at around the CHF16 billion level. Let's turn to tangible book value per share, please. What we show here is the progression of our tangible book value per share since the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. It grew from CHF15.88 to CHF18.25 per share at the end of the first quarter, that's an increase of 15%. But let's just focus on the major items. Clearly, one of the most significant components was net income in the quarter that added CHF0.54 per share. But clearly, the other major component is the CHF1.81 per share, resulting from the widening of credit spreads in March. Now, just recognizing that this should only be a temporary change, without it, our tangible book value per share would have been CHF16.44, an increase of 4% on the quarter. So, let's now turn to our credit provisions, please, and look at the overall reserve build that we took in the first quarter. So, I think in common with some of our peers, obviously, it's been most of the U.S. banks that have reported so far. We thought it would be useful to give an overview of the total of incurred, but as yet unrealized losses related to our credit exposures, and that's both accrual, which comes through in the PCL line, and fair value elected, which comes through in contra revenues. Now, the increase that we are reporting this quarter reflects the adverse impact of the deterioration economic environment on our portfolio; the mark-to-market impact of credit spread moves, mostly, entirely in March, and the, mostly in March, and the increase in our CECL reserves. You will see that we show on this slide two interrelated charts. Now, if we start on the left, we just show the movement in the allowance for credit losses as per accounts. As you know, Credit Suisse reports under U.S. GAAP. And the first quarter of 2020 mark the introduction of the current expected credit loss rules. Now, these are similar but substantially more conservative than IFRS 9, which was introduced for reporters a year ago and the difference, there was a number of differences but the most important one relevant today is the CECL includes a provision for losses over the entire life of the loan, which we continuously assess depending on our assessment of the economic outlook, whereas IFRS 9 requires that for only one year under most conditions. So, if we look at the chart on the left, first we're reflecting our allowance for credit losses for our loan book. We entered the fourth quarter, sorry, the end, we ended the fourth quarter of 2019 with an allowance for credit losses of CHF1.15 billion. The adoption of the CECL rules from the 1st of January led to an impact on the CHF1.15 billion of an additional CHF72 million. We then built in, we then took CHF568 million for credit losses in the first quarter, of which approximately CHF304 million comes from CECL. Net write-offs and other adjustments, i.e., things we've realized charge-offs generated a reduction of CHF55 billion, and that left our allowance for credit losses on loans amortized cost of CHF1.7 billion, an increase of CHF585 million compared to the previous quarter. Now, if we move to the second chart, we combine the movement of credit provisions with other unrealized credit-related exposures. Now, this is important because Credit Suisse has a higher proportion of fair value-related assets on its balance sheet than many other banks. So, you do need to look at both parts of this together. We take the CHF585 million from the previous chart and we add to it based on fair value marks at the end of the first quarter, CHF284 million of unrealized leveraged finance mark-to-market losses and CHF160 million unrealized APAC Financing Group mark-to-market moves. And that results in a total reserve build of just over CHF1 billion for the quarter. Now, just like to give you some context for this reserve build. It's important to understand that normal PCLs pre-CECL moves are generally related to specific positions, generally. CECL is a broadening and replacement for FAS 5 and it's a general provision related to our entire accrual elected loan book. And in order to calculate that, we have to use a range of scenarios against the economies and the markets to which our business is exposed to, to estimate it. So, we include a downturn in excess of 20% in U.S. GDP in the second quarter and double-digit levels of U.S. unemployment. We expect to see something similar in the EU markets in the second quarter and we will see, we also expect, and quite importantly for us, a smaller fall in the second quarter here in Switzerland. And I think just to be clear, that does mean that we obviously expect recession in the United States, in EU, and in Switzerland in the full-year 2020. Now, I think if you've looked at the U.S. banks that reported last week, I think it's very important to understand some similarities, but also some differences. First, we don't have the large exposures to U.S. consumer lending that the major U.S. banks have. We are exposed, as Thomas has already summarized, to a much more resilient Swiss economy, Swiss consumer base, Swiss market. Second, though, if you actually look at our GM and IBCM lending, our reserves represented 0.88%, 88 basis points, which I think is comparable to the marks that we estimate the U.S. banks took, which I think was in a range somewhere between 80 and 90, but IR can give you more details if that would be helpful after this call. So I think having given an overall summary, let's just now turn to the divisional performance, please. And let's start, please, with the Swiss Universal Bank. Now excluding the InvestLab gain, the Swiss Universal Bank generated CHF1.5 billion of revenues in the first quarter of 2020. That was an increase of 8% year-on-year. On the same basis, i.e., ex InvestLab, pretax income increased by 3% to CHF564 million. The Swiss Universal Bank saw strong results across all major revenue lines with increased client activity and higher revenues from International Trading Solutions, as you know, the collaboration between SUB, Global Markets and IWM, which benefited from higher volumes and higher market volatility. Operating expenses in SUB were stable with investments in growth offset by ongoing cost discipline measures. Now as Thomas has already said, it's part of our efforts to support our home market, our clients and our communities. We granted bridging loans worth approximately CHF2.4 billion to support small and medium enterprises as part of the Swiss scheme. Now if we turn to Private Clients, net revenues increased by 8% with increases across all major revenue categories and exceptionally high levels of client activity. For net new assets, we did see continued gross inflows in the period. However, we also recorded net asset outflows of CHF4.2 billion, mostly driven by a single low-margin outflow in the ultra-high net worth segment. Corporate & Institutional Clients, excluding the gain from InvestLab transfer, reported an 8% increase in net revenues year-on-year, and that was driven by strong ITS and by strong Investment Banking revenues. NNA for C&IC totaled CHF4.8 billion, reflecting the continued momentum in our pension fund business. Now let's turn to the next slide, Slide 25, please. Now going forward, we're going to give a rolling track record of our divisions against a number of our metrics, as certain of our peers do. I've included that in this presentation for each division for the first time, but I'll not necessarily comment on these metrics. But it's clear for SUB, the charts clearly demonstrate the strength of revenues, the continued positive progression on cost-to-income, the consequent gains in pretax income and the return on capital. Let's turn to IWM. Our International Wealth Management division saw high levels of client activity during the first quarter with resilient asset-based revenues and net interest income, but we did suffer unrealized losses on fund investments within the Asset Management business. As a result, IWM's pretax income, excluding InvestLab, was CHF319 million, down by 39% year-on-year. Net revenues, excluding InvestLab were down by 9%. If we look at Private Banking, pretax income was down by 7% year-on-year, but that does include the CHF15 million gain from the InvestLab transfer. But I would note that in the same quarter of last year, we benefited from a CHF27 million release of major litigation provisions in the first quarter. Net new assets for Private Bank in the first quarter are pretty good, CHF3.7 billion. That's a 4% annualized growth rate. Just turning to Asset Management. Excluding the CHF203 million InvestLab gain as well as the unrealized losses on seed money in the asset management funds of CHF101 million, we made a pretax income of CHF60 million. And net new assets for Asset Management were broadly stable, I think, up CHF0.1 billion in the quarter. Let's turn then to Slide 28, please, and look at Asia Pacific. Our Asia Pacific division recorded a pretax income of CHF227 million, excluding InvestLab, up by 24% year-on-year. Net revenues excluding InvestLab were up by 17% at CHF1 billion the first quarter and this was largely due to strong results within Private Banking within WMC as well as by APAC markets. This offset unrealized mark-to-market financing losses on the fair valued lending portfolio and our financing businesses and included in WMC. So if you look at WMC, if we exclude InvestLab, pretax income was CHF60 million and that included CHF160 million of unrealized mark-to-market moves on our fair valued lending portfolio in the financing businesses and CHF96 million of provisions against credit losses mainly related to three single cases, the largest of which was caused by a single default on a share backed loan linked to a Chinese food and beverage company. We saw record Private Banking revenues this quarter as transaction-based revenues increased by 67% year-on-year. But clearly, that was offset by the adverse impact in the financing portfolio. Net new assets totaled CHF3 billion. I think that's a stable performance given market conditions. If we turn to APAC Markets, we saw a strong performance with high level of transaction and gains from hedging. Revenues from APAC Markets increased by 60% as both fixed income and equity sales and trading delivered strong year-on-year increases in revenues. Equity sales and trading benefited from higher revenues in prime, partly offset by lower revenues in equity derivatives, whilst fixed income sales and trading benefited from higher revenues of structured products, emerging market rates and FX, partly offset by a weak performance in credit. Okay. Let's turn to Slide 30 now and move to IBCM. IBCM began the year on a strong footing of increased activity in Capital Markets and higher deal flow. Momentum in January and February was, though, offset by the closure of primary markets for most of March. Net revenues was down by 47% year-on-year, driven by mark-to-market losses in leveraged finance and net losses on hedges in respect of IBCM's uncollateralized corporate derivatives exposure. If we were to exclude those, then division will have seen net revenues up by about 4% year-on-year. As I've already said, IBCM's results were adversely affected by negative developments in our Corporate Bank, which is split with Global Markets. These provisions were mainly related to the oil and gas sector. Mostly -- that was the single largest component. More details of our exposure to which, which has fallen significantly since 2015 I've included in the appendix. We also saw an increased provision for credit losses due to borrower drawdown’s of approximately $11 billion of revolving credit facilities with the related impact under the new CECL rules. This drawdown clearly also increases RWA requirements in the quarter, let me just conclude then with a few words on Global Markets. I think, as Thomas and I indicated on March 18, the division benefited from the substantial increase in volumes across equity and fixed income markets. And as we said then, I think generally has navigated the market dislocation that we saw in March particularly well. Pre-tax income in the first quarter increased by 21% year-on-year on a 14% increase in revenues, and as Thomas has already said, we saw robust ITS revenues in the first quarter, reflecting higher volatility and continued momentum with Wealth and Institutional Clients. If we look at the main business lines, fixed income revenues were up by 17% year-on-year with higher trading activity in macro and global credit products, offsetting unrealized mark-to-market losses in leveraged finance. Equity revenues were up by 22% year-on-year with a marked increase in equity derivatives, continued momentum in cash and solid prime. As we note, the other line was impacted by a loss on a single name counterparty. Clearly, GM has also suffered its share of the increase in credit provisions in the Corporate Bank, both specific and CECL linked, which I've already covered. Now, as I mentioned before, RWA and leverage exposure for Global Markets increased due to the significant increase in market volatility in the second half of the quarter. RWA usage stood at $72 billion at the end of the first quarter. That's up from $58 billion in the same quarter a year ago. With regard to leverage, we saw a similar step-up due to volatility, increased margin requirements, a high level of fails at the end of March, GM's share of the drawdowns in the corporate banking book, as well as reduced netting. As I said before, though, I would expect the majority of this to reverse over the next two to three quarters. And with that, I'd like to conclude the finance presentation and hand back to Thomas. Thomas?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, David. I would now like to close the formal part of today's call with two final slides. Chart 35 shows how we have managed to increase the tangible book value per share over the last nine quarters, as well as our profitability measured by return on tangible equity. And as you can see in the table below, we achieved this profitability increase while maintaining strong capital ratios and further increasing our risk density toward 35%, a level commensurate with the expectations of FINMA and the Swiss National Bank when they calibrated too-big-to-fail capital requirements as part of Swiss approach to adopting the Basel III capital rules. Final slide, please. Let me reiterate one message that is of particular importance for me during this challenging time. We understand our responsibility toward our employees, clients and the communities we operate in and take it very seriously. We will continue to do that, and we will do everything in our power to limit the impact this severe crisis has on all of our stakeholder groups. Amid this profound market dislocation and despite significant reserve building, we delivered solid first quarter financial results and saw a good revenue momentum in Private Banking, as well as in our sales and trading businesses. However, the scale of the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis is still difficult to assess and I would caution that we might see a further reserve build in the coming quarters, particularly affecting our Corporate Bank, as well as other loans, in particular outside Switzerland. We might also record further impairments relating to our asset management investments. Additionally, we would caution that the recovery in underwriting and advisory fees might be limited at least in the short-term until COVID-19 pandemic eases and the global economy begins to recover. Credit Suisse, however, has entered this crisis with a number of key strengths and advantages, which are depicted on the right side of this slide. First, we have high dependency on the strong and resilient Swiss economy. Second, we have a very stable and growing Private Banking franchise, contributing significantly to our revenues and pre-tax income of the Group. Third, over the past years and through our restructuring, we have significantly reduced our cost base and risk exposure in our market businesses. Fourth, we have a robust capital and liquidity position. We are well prepared to continue to serve our clients and we believe we can maintain a resilient financial performance through the crisis. Thank you all for your attention. I will now hand back to Kinner for Q&A.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. Operator, let's open the line.\\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa. Please go ahead, from Morgan Stanley.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Thank you very much and good morning to everyone. I've got two questions, one, about the capital walk kind of this year, in 2020, and one about kind of your thoughts about the reserve build, and I do appreciate there is a lot of uncertainty in both. So, let's start with the capital conversation. You've implied to us that you think that you're going to end 2020 or kind of throughout with a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. Could you help us kind of run through the components of the move from the current 12.1% to the 11.5%? You've given us some. Of course, we've got still the CHF9 billion of the regulatory inflation to come through in the remaining three quarters, you've kind of given us a little bit of a view on the market risk-weighted assets, i.e., your expectations that they're going to come down with volatility. But how do you see the credit side of the equation, and also the operational side of the equation on the risk-weighted assets, as you have got a little bit of a relief on the model in the 1Q from that side as well? Just to kind of give us a sense of the moving parts on the risk-weighted asset side as you see it.\\nDavid Mathers: Magdalena, very good to speak to you. Thank you very much for the question. It seems a long time since March 18 and I'm very glad that I'm not on video today, so you can't see my haircut, or lack of haircut should we say. Look, I think we wanted to be as clear and transparent as possible. I think if we looked at the CET1 ratio that we reported for the end of the first quarter of 12.1%, I mean, it was similar to what we guided to back on the 13th of February when we did our end, year-end numbers, but obviously the components were notably different, because rather than CHF12 billion of SA-CCR and related impact, we only had CHF3 billion and yet you end up with the same number. And that does give you an idea of the inflation or the increase in RWA that we have seen from the volatility in March and how that actually flows through into some of our bar numbers. The adverse CVA migrations you're actually seeing, and clearly, the drawdown on the corporate loan book, which actually does increase both RWA and result in a CECL provision in respect to that. Reality is most of the RWA increase was actually due to that measure. There wasn't a great deal of discretionary business increases in the RWA. It was due to the market impact. And I mean, let's be clear. I mean, I think you've seen very similar drops amongst the U.S. banks last week, and I'm not particularly surprised. I think looking forward to the second quarter, I think it's worth remembering, as you know, as Mel and I do, that a lot of these metrics and changes are only actually averaged in during the whole of the quarter. So you've only seen some of the impact of that volatility within the RWA numbers you see now. And I would expect to see a significant increase in both CVA and market risk-related RWA as that actually flows through the time series. I think drawdowns have pretty much come to a halt in the last week or so. But I think we are going to see migration impacts as credit ratings and rating agencies catch up with the events of the last month and start to make estimates of what we're going to see, economic-wise, over the next quarter or so. So I think I have to warn you, I think we will see an increase in credit-related RWA as a consequence of that. And then, obviously, you have the mathematical consequence of CHF3 billion of SA-CCR related. But essentially, that would obviously take you down from 12.1 down to about 11.9, 12.0. So the rest, as you might say is an estimate, which I think will be partly offset by our own actions to actually reduce that of that inflation in the first quarter. So I mean, I just would caution. Generally, in the past, we've been very precise around CET1 numbers. I think due given the level of volatility around this process at this point, I think when I said around, I meant around. And I think when I spoke at your conference, Magdalena, I said around 12%, I do mean around in that sense. I think there's a degree of unpredictability here. And I think quite clearly as well, we also do respect, and it's very important to us that we look after our clients at this moment, and that's obviously led to some RWA increases in the first quarter. So we will see some consequence, and that's another factor as to thinking. So I think around 11.5% is my broad guidance, basically. And I would probably expect us to be at around 11.5% by the end of the second quarter because by that point, you should see it fully phased in.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: That's very clear, David. And my second question is largely connected because, of course, you've mentioned the kind of migration impact, the credit migration impact on the capital. But of course, we're going to have it on the impairment side as well. So when you think about your kind of impairments and potential for marks going forward, how should we think about the kind of the levels there?\\nDavid Mathers: Okay. Yes, it's been a complex month, shall we say. There's one point I just want to make clear to, Magdalena, and I think I did refer to this middle of last year at some point, which is the capital deductions under the IRB approach for credit losses actually exceeds the CECL effect. So therefore, the increase in CECL reserves that we took at the end of the first quarter, and indeed, the transition at the end -- the 1st of January did not have any meaningful CET1 deduction effect. And that will be the case, provided any further CECL increases that we see in the balance of this year and second quarter, I think, is obviously the focus, do not exceed the IRB allowance. And that's got to be a little more helpful. There's a couple of hundred million left before the CECL numbers would actually exceed IRB, plus/minus. So that might be helpful to you, Magdalena. If you're thinking about CECL, which to me reminds me of an old-fashioned general provision, it isn't. It's a completely different accounting concept, but perhaps I'm feeling my age. Obviously, PCL is more specific because that doesn't fall into that. So the PCL component, to the extent we see an increase in specific provisions in the second quarter as we see how this -- the economic effects of COVID-19 pans out, would be capital relevant. The CECL would not be provided. It doesn't exceed more than a couple of hundred million, at which point we would actually exceed the IRB calculation and then move forward. So I hope that's helpful, Magdalena.\\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher, UBS.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: I wanted to ask about the RoTE ambition, which you disclosed at the Investor Day and I think reiterated with Q4 results, the 10%, how you think about that at this stage, whether you're happy to reiterate that at this point. And then, secondly, on the mid-March, 19th of March, I think you -- I mean, you gave us very helpful numbers and you talked about the first 2 months. If I now look at the PBT of CHF1.2 billion, strip out all funds, pretax profit was probably just around above CHF900 million. So how can I just link today's numbers with what you said back then? I guess, the big explanation is some of these risk costs and mark-to-market moves. But if I strip that out, was March still loss making? Or what was sort of the picture in March? And then very lastly, more a strategy question on the IB. I mean, assuming the world remains a challenging and somewhat volatile place, how you think about your IB franchises in that context and in terms of resourcing, head count, balance sheet usage. I mean, it's obvious that it produces some volatility in the results. I mean, obviously, the environment is extreme, but how you think about it as being part of your overall portfolio that's -- what's the positioning in there? And just very lastly, sorry, the CVA/DVA on credit, I mean, I see the CHF78 million benefit in the comp line on Slide 46. But can you tell us what the impact was on the revenue side?\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. I will take the first and the third question, and maybe, David, you can take the second and the fourth question. So starting with RoTE, it's clear that this quarter's 13.1% benefited from a very low, actually negative tax rate. But as we said, if you adjust it to our new guidance, it's still 9% to 9.5%. But also, if you take a bigger picture and if I refer you to Page 35, actually, if you look over the last four quarters and you take the average, we're actually at or above the 10% and we had very high tax rates in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. So I think on average it's now over those four quarters, 18%, which is not significantly below our guidance. So I think we have proven actually over the last four quarters, that we have a franchise that can deliver something around 10%, and it's gotten very clear to me, that continues to be our target, at least in the midterm. But it's also clear that in the short term. Over the next, you know, two, three quarters with COVID-19 and the impact of it, the RoTE is going to be challenged, but it's still clearly our goal to be at or above 10%, because that's where we think in a normalized world, the cost of equity is of our business and we want to earn in excess of that. Maybe I will hand over to David for the risk cost, then I will take IB franchise question and then the fourth question around on credit, back to David.\\nDavid Mathers: I'm not going to give you an exact number for March, but perhaps putting myself in your shoes, perhaps, the way I think about this is, obviously Thomas and I said on 18th March, that our profit for the end of February exceeded the CHF106.2 million that we made in the whole of the first quarter 2019. So just setting that as a minimum basically, you take the CHF106.2 million, you drop out, as a starting point, you take our number of CHF102.1 million, and you deduct CHF268 million, you'd end up with a number ex invest lab of CHF933 million. So at the limit and obviously there was a degree of comfort, and what we said on March 18, you'd be talking about a loss between CHF106.2 million to CHF933 million, which I think is CHF129 million. Now so, if we then look at the various provisions we actually took, you really have got the mark to market move in the leverage finance book, which was CHF284 million that was taken entirely in March. If you look at the APAC CHF160 million, that was taken partially, perhaps mostly in March. And if you look at the CECL adjustments, the add-on to day two to component which we had given before, that was taken, over CHF300 million, that was actually taken almost entirely in March as well. So I think you can see pre the reserve build, March would have been very substantially profitable, even allowing for, I have not told you, which is the degree of buffer that Thomas and I had, when we actually made our statement on the 18th. Is that helpful, Daniele?\\nDaniele Brupbacher: That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay, Daniel. So as we come to your question on Investment Banking, the way I look at our Investment Banking franchise globally, we obviously have sales and trading in global markets, but we also have sales and trading in APAC markets. And in addition to that, in IBCM, you have to really look at our investment banking capabilities also within APAC, Wealth Management and Connected, as well as in the SUB, Swiss Universal Bank. And if you look at page 13, you can actually see that we have had a very positive trend, both in fixed income sales and trading and equity sales and trading, which on this page actually includes APAC market. And if you look at advisory and underwriting, excluding mark-to-market losses, we are actually also on a positive trend. So just because we have some mark-to-market losses in our lev fin book doesn't really change my view on that. And quite the opposite, if you look at the composition of our advisory and underwriting fees, revenues actually in the first quarter, we have been up compared to the first quarter '19 in each of debt capital markets, equity capital markets, M&A and fixed income derivatives and, so that's the first point. The second point I want to make, I'm convinced that our strength of ultra high net worth clients and family offices can only be further strengthened, if we continue to provide Investment Banking type of additional services beyond what pure play private banks can offer, be it in the sales and trading environment, be it through advice related to M&A, IPOs or otherwise. So my conviction very much is that the differentiating factor from Credit Suisse to other private banks, is that we can actually offer these services. I hope that answers the question?\\nDaniele Brupbacher: Yes, absolutely. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Final question was actually on CVA and DVA basically, I think that was your fourth question. I don't have a complete answer to that question, but perhaps we should just look briefly at page 36 of the earnings release, which does give you some useful disclosure around the corporate center. So I think, if we actually look there, you can see that we saw losses of CHF279 million with respect to owned credit spread moves in the corporate centers. So that was there. But I think you should also know just clearly, is that this was largely offset by other gains that we actually saw in the period. So I don't think you should be working around adding that back in. You can see we had CHF179 million of fair value money market instrument gains. We had CHF94 million relating to the fair value option volatility on own debt. So I wouldn't encourage you to add that back, but I don't know if you'd seen that, but that is useful disclosure. And just to clear up any other points, that is not related to the issue around structured notes which I discussed at length in previous quarters. Actually the hedge on the accretive portion, the structured notes actually worked almost perfectly in the first quarter, and there was almost nil impact from that at this point, and we've also extinguish part of that portfolio, in what was obviously a fairly extreme interest rate move basically. So it's something quite separate. So I think that's, probably strictly speaking, most of the answer to your question, Daniele, basically, but please don't go back adding things up in that sense. I think there is gains and there is losses in this whole thing. And you're right, there is the DVA gain of CHF78 million relating to the credit spread widening on the compensation instruments, to which we award employees and I would expect that to reverse clearly in the course of 2020, as our credit spread narrows.\\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs, Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. If I could just follow up on some of the idiosyncratic loss numbers. I think you went into PCL in quite a lot of detail. But on the unrealized fair value mark, if I could start there, let's break it down to three parts; the unrealized fair value marks first; the U.S. banks obviously took similar, some of the U.S. banks flagged potential for that potentially to reverse in the second quarter given subsequent credit spread movements. So then if you could just elaborate on any thoughts there on the impact in 2Q based on movements to date. Second part would be with regard to the asset management loss on seed money, CHF101 million a quarter, and you said there's a risk of further losses here in your outlook statement. Is there any way you can help us frame the magnitude, the potential impact there? So how much of your AUM is seed money? How much investment is there in place? And then, finally, on global markets in the revenues and the other items, there's a loss on a single name counterparty. Can you just elaborate on exactly what that relates to? Is it acting as a clearing member? Or is that a credit exposure that you book through there? Just we can get a feel for whether that's potentially recurring as well.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much, Andrew. So let's just take those 3 questions in turn. So if we look at, I mean, probably Page 23 as the use was anything else as an aide-mémoire for this, you have CHF284 million of leveraged finance mark-to-market losses and you have CHF160 million relating to the AFG financing group. I think if you look at our slide deck, I think in the first page, I believe it was in the appendix, I actually also included the leveraged finance exposure numbers, which I think we did give at the MS conference last month. But just to give you an idea, essentially, oil and gas exposure, there was CHF9.1 billion in the fourth quarter of '15, CHF7.7 billion now, of which CHF2.9 million is non-investment grade, which I think is the most important component. Leverage finance exposure was CHF11.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter '15, down to CHF7.3 billion. So that gives some degree of background around this. I think if we just go back to Page 23, again, basically, let me just talk around those different components. Firstly, the leveraged finance mark-to-market, these are underwriting commitments that we had coming in during the quarter. Now, these are fair value elected. So even though these deals have not yet financed in large part, I would caution, we have to estimate at the end of March what the market would have been, had they been financed at the end of March on a probability-based metric. And essentially, as the widening of high-yield credit spreads in the course of March had actually gone through flex and through the margin, you actually end up with a potential loss in respect to those underwriting commitments. Now obviously, as you rightly say, since the end of the March, you've seen significant normalization on those spreads. And the Federal Reserve Bank, as you know, has actually been buying some of these assets, which has clearly contributed to that narrowing. So yes, there is clearly potential for that. These are unrealized losses. But I think just a word of caution, I think these deals are not yet closed. So they will close at some point in the next few months. So it will depend on what the credit spreads are at that point. And I think if markets continue to normalize, then you would expect to see recovery, at least in part of that MTM number. And if they weren't, then you wouldn't, basically, Andrew. And I think it's a little bit dangerous to make forward-looking comments in the slightly stressed environment that we still see. I'm just obviously just looking at what happened in the WTI market over the course of the last 72 hours. Actually, APAC mark-to-market is actually almost simpler. We have a CHF4 billion portfolio of fair value elected financing positions there. Most of those have been marked to proxies, emerging market loans. Those are often very liquid and somewhat distressed markets, but we mark against those. It's not that we've actually seen defaults against them, it's just essentially you see a mark-to-market effect. So you would expect to see that normalize again, clearly subject to how these markets evolve and develop over the course of the next six months. And that's why I thought I want to be super clear about breaking that number out. So hopefully, that answers those two points in terms of that component, the reserve build. I think on the asset management point I made before, there's about CHF100 million of impairments, of which around two third relates either to seed money or to joint ventures with partners. As you know, our asset management business, really oversimplifying a bit, consists of an equity and a long fixed income and a real estate business closely associated with our wealth management business, particularly here in Switzerland, and then the alternatives business in the United States. So this really relates to the seed money in the alternatives business. And that -- it was in respect of that, about two third was due to that. And just to be clear, just to be transparent, the other one third was in respect to the 5% retention in CLOs you have to hold under European rules, not U.S. rules, which we also mark. So those are those two components. I mean, I think we've just been cautious. In terms of investments that asset management has, it's around about CHF2.4 billion, of which half is in external asset management’s and about half basically is in these types of seed money investments. I think we'll need to see how these investments perform in the balance of the second quarter. But I think it was worth being explicit because I think it's important to be transparent about these things that this is obviously a risk for the second quarter. Final point then in terms of the GM other revenue number, there's not much I'm going to add. I mean, essentially, the increase in the other revenue loss between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, as I've said, is in respect of a single counterparty, and it's clearly not something I've included in the reserve build. So that says something as well to you. But it was a single counterparty. And obviously, it was a distressed position, and we've marked it appropriately.\\nThomas Gottstein: And just if I can add on the left fin book, we have observed the reversals in the first few days. Whilst it's difficult, obviously, to predict the future in the current market, but the leverage loan index is 165 basis points tighter now compared to the end of March and the yield has reduced from 880 to 715 basis points. So clearly going in the right direction, but it's very difficult to predict the future.\\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann, Autonomous.\\nStefan Stalmann: I have three questions, please. In your CET1 capital waterfall, you have a negative, roughly CHF600 million impact from what you call goodwill reversal. And in fact, your deduction for goodwill now is higher than the goodwill that you carry in the balance sheet. Could you explain what happened there, please? The second point regarding your exposures, and I hope I haven't missed a previous question on this. But you have CHF7.7 billion oil and gas and you have CHF7.3 billion leveraged finance. Is there an overlap between those two exposure buckets, please, and how big, will that be? And the third question, inspired I guess by what we have seen from some American banks, do you book any significant funding valuation adjustments during the quarter? And if so, where will I find them please?\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much, Stefan. So let's just take those three questions in turn. I think just for the benefit of everybody, I think you're referring to page 43 of the earnings release and the CET1 walk across, where you see a reversal of goodwill and tangible assets of CHF618 million. That is in respect of the second phase of the InvestLab transfer, because there is a significant amount of intangible assets associated with that. Whilst that generates a gain under our equity and for that matter in a total equity base, that is not CET1 eligible. Therefore, we actually deduct it at this point. So that's what's actually driving it, in terms of the numbers. So you see a gain, but the second phase actually results in that intangible been deducted from CET1. I think the second question I'd say straightforward. I don't think there's any particularly material overlap, actually probably no overlap between the leverage finance and the oil and gas exposure. So two separate numbers. Although it's a very good question, Stefan, but there isn't any. In terms of FVA or we tend to call it XVA because the number of different derivative adjustments. I think you note, you should know obviously, that we did disclose, I think it was only IBCM page. So let me just get you that page number. I think it's actually on page 30, that we take net losses of CHF51 million for hedges on uncollateralized corporate derivative exposure. That is, I think, we'd call an XVA loss, because it relates to the derivative, the funding components of this. That is the largest component. There is also a smaller component I think within the APAC business, but, that's where it is. I'm afraid, I don't have the APAC number to mind, I'm afraid, but it was I think slightly less than the IBCM one.\\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jernej Omahen, Goldman Sachs.\\nJernej Omahen: I had some problems with the line before. So good morning from my side as well. Well done on the results, particularly in the Investment Bank. I have three questions please. So the first two are just sort of technical nature. The first question is on collateral management and your lombard loan book. David, can you please give us a sense what the change of total lombard loans and for the Group outstanding was during the first quarter of the year? And just to confirm, right, so if there is a recall of some of the lombard loans that comes toward the net new money outflow, if I'm not mistaken? And the second question I have on levered loans. So can you maybe just have the question, if I may ask the question this way, what is the notional amount of leveraged loans that the mark that you've taken relates to? And then finally, I have a question more of a conceptual nature, and I think it falls into two parts. So the first question is, I think I understood from your presentation well, what you're not afraid of, as Credit Suisse Group, and what type of scenarios don't scare you and what type of scenarios you think are manageable? Thomas, I would like to ask you, what does scare you, at this point in time? And the reason why I ask this question, as I look at the pre-tax profitability, which is fine, it gets you underlying through, as you point out, an 8%, 9% ROE. On an annualized basis that's 40 basis points of leverage exposure, 120 basis points of risk-weighted assets. I mean, does it take much imagination if the current environment persists to see those profits disappear, and Credit Suisse starts loss making? Thanks.\\nDavid Mathers: Let's just take those questions in order then. So I think on collateral and lombard loan exposure to mind I don't actually have an exact number on the lombard move quarter-on-quarter, maybe we can get that and give it to you later, Jernej, but I'll refer to my IR colleagues on that. What I would say, is that was not to my knowledge at least, any material component of net new asset moves that we actually saw in the quarter. Obviously the biggest thing was, this transfer of a single, low margin ultra high net worth mandates from Credit Suisse to a different bank, which was the bulk of what you actually saw in SUB, and that was definitely not related in any way to a leverage loan. I think we have seen some deleveraging as you'd expect and face these markets and if you actually look at the components of assets under management, it's up to about 32% cash now across all three of our private banking business. So there definitely has been some deleveraging as part of that. But that's all I'd say at this point. I think your second question was on the leverage finance exposure. I'm not really going to add more to what I've said before. The marks that we've taken are in respect of the CHF7.3 billion book. Clearly, some of those positions will have a higher mark than others, but I'm not going to sort of break it down any further. I think you should just assume it's in respect to that entire book, basically. I think your third question, perhaps I'd refer to Thomas in sense of what are we worried about?\\nThomas Gottstein: Before I get to the third question, I mean on the on the collateral management and the lombard loan question, the first one, I mean if you look also at our loans in the three private banking led divisions, you can see actually it increased in Switzerland, but it went down both [indiscernible] and in APAC and that really is, as David said, a result of some deleveraging we saw there. But the same time a lot of our clients are now positioning themselves to reengage, as they see the lock downs in various countries, especially in Europe to ease and they are taking increasingly positive views on the market, obviously, in a cautious way. That leads me to what scares me or first of all, I can say, I can sleep well and it's I think probably the worst scenario would be, if we all went back to the offices too quickly, lockdowns to follow, some think we have a second wave of infections, and that will then result in prolonged crisis, and I think that will be bad for the economy and indirected end for us and capital markets generally. So that is certainly something that we all have to factor into our scenarios as well. But broadly seen, I'm actually taking a lot of comfort of how we have managed at least so far through this crisis. If I look at our capital, if I look at our liquidity, if I look at our earnings growth in Private Banking, if I look at our ability in trading, be it equity or fixed income, to navigate the markets have been very encouraged by that. So, I can assure you that we are very cautious. We are very aware of the overall slowdown in the economy. We expect, as it was mentioned also by David, a recession, not only in the U.S., but also in Europe and Switzerland. But I'm not losing any sleep. So thanks for asking.\\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\\nKian Abouhossein: The first question is regarding CECL. Can you just run us a little bit to how you forecast CECL in terms of how you do the modeling? And in that respect, I think I missed some of the assumptions. Could you just repeat and maybe add not just to the assumptions, I think you mentioned the U.S., but just the GDP and unemployment numbers for some of the key regions for 2020 as well as 2021 that you're assuming in CECL? And lastly, on CECL, are you using a phased-in approach? And if you do so, what would be the fully loaded impact on your CET1? The second question I have is, it was partially discussed. But if I look at your valuation, you're roughly at 0.5x tangible book, and mainly, I would say it's because of your IB concerns by the market or market concerns on the IB, not your concern, clearly. I was trying to understand how you square your view around why this is a good business in the long term, especially, I assume in ITS, and maybe you can share that with us, you sell basically no credit products to your private banks, why you need a credit business considering post restructuring, it again made losses. Why you need a credit business, i.e. the investment bank, in light of a wealth management business? And thirdly, if I may ask one more question. In respect to your capital ratio, at what level would you be uncomfortable doing a buyback?\\nDavid Mathers: Perhaps if I take the first question and then hand over to Thomas, really, in terms of your question around the credit business, I believe, within the wholesale operations. I think the number of questions is really about CECL. So I think the approach that we take is similar, the same, as I understand, that the U.S. banks take. We have a significant number of models, which we apply across our different businesses, both IB related and wealth management related. Those include a different range of inputs, which we actually probability weight in order to actually calculate the outturn. In terms of the key assumptions, I think what I said was that if we think about the U.S., then we are assuming a quarter-on-quarter reduction in excess of 20% for the second quarter. We are expecting something not dissimilar in the year '27, but a lower impact in Switzerland. In terms of unemployment in the U.S., we're assuming double digit, which I think is similar to what most of the U.S. banks are actually also assuming. And in terms of -- I mean -- and clearly, we expect all three of the economies I've just mentioned to be in recession for the whole of 2020, and we do not really expect to see a recovery until the first quarter '21, i.e., positive GDP growth. So those are our set of assumptions that we made. And I think those are probably the most -- the key ones to actually think about, not the only ones, but the key ones, basically. So hopefully, that helps, Kian. Now in terms of the capital impact, as I said in response to an earlier question, the capital reduction for CECL, we'd have no significant capital reduction for CECL because we already did make a capital deduction in respect of the IRB capital model, which exceeds the CECL provision. So we already have a greater deduction. So therefore, increasing the CECL does not, therefore, reduce our capital. And as I said before, I think to be helpful, there's about another CHF200 million of buffer that CECL would have to increase by before it exceeds the IRB buffer. And then at that point, you get into these interesting questions around phase and everything else, but that's just not relevant at this point, and hopefully, does not become relevant in the future in terms of capital reductions. So that's what I'd say to your technical question, Kian, I think. Thomas? Just on CECL, can you just highlight what assumptions you make for GDP and unemployment in 2021? Actually, that's more interesting from my perspective, at least. Should we just use consensus numbers on Bloomberg as a good indicator? Or are you different from that assumption?\\nDavid Mathers: I think it's not that different. I mean, it's closely aligned to, but not quite the same as the house view we give externally. So we expect a 2%, 3% GDP growth in '21 across actually the U.S. and Swiss markets basically has recovered from that. I don't have the -- well, yes, and I -- yes, we do expect to see U.S. unemployment reduce, but it's still going to be well above trend in our numbers in 2021.\\nKian Abouhossein: And just on CECL, the CHF200 million is on a phased-in basis or fully loaded, the buffer?\\nDavid Mathers: I think we don't have a phased-in question at this point, Kian. I think we have a -- we already have under the FINMA's IRB model, a capital reduction, which exceeds that from a CECL one. If our CECL losses were to increase by CHF200 million at some subsequent quarter from the level they are now, then basically, we would start to see a capital reduction and then we -- then I think that's when the phasing question actually kicks in, but it's not relevant at the moment, Kian.\\nKian Abouhossein: Okay.\\nDavid Mathers: Okay. So I think the way I think, we have a full deduction ready. There's no phase-in effect.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay, so your other three questions on valuation on the credit business and the buyback. So first on valuation, I very much believe in the correlation between return on tangible equity and price to tangible book value, and I think there is a clear dislocation at the moment from where we are, against that line and where we are trading. So I think it's our task to deliver quarter-on-quarter, to get as close as possible to that line. At the moment, we are clearly way below our tangible book value, which is not a Credit Suisse idiosyncratic problem. I think most most banks suffer from the same, but we just have to prove quarter-over-quarter that we can deliver on our returns, and that's how we look at valuation. Secondly on the credit business, I have to say that, don't quite understand your question, because our credit business is actually profitable. If I look in Global Markets, it has had actually an excellent quarter as part of our fixed income and this is even after absorbing their share of the unrealized markdowns. Now if you refer to more the lev fin business, clearly it was an extraordinarily difficult quarter, not only for us, but also for the U.S. banks that are mainly our competitors in that market. But over a mid to long-term cycle, we very much believe that private equity related business will continue to be a main driver of Investment Banking fees going forward. If you look at our CHF7 billion exposure in the context of our CHF300 billion loan book, I think it's a small exposure. We have significantly reduced it after the financial crisis. This was, I think from the peak, we went down 85%. So clearly lev fin had a bad quarter, but I think we are well positioned in that business and it is actually also, in many cases, relates also to M&A, for example, where we have a lot of clients now approaching us about public-to-private, with low valuations and you can only discuss that, if you also have people at the table that understand lev fin markets. And from that perspective, I'm actually very clear of the opinion, that it fits well with our overall strategy. On the buyback, very clear, we have suspended it in March, and we are now observing the market. We are in the first instance, focused on the second part of the dividend -- of the 2019 dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter. Secondly, we are focused on paying a dividend for the year 2020, and then only in the third instance on the share buyback, so that's how I look at it. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: And to your first question, sorry, Kian, I think the confusion or the point I have to clarify really comes down to IRB, their standard models. So the IRB model, as approved by the FINRA, is extremely conservative and that's why the capital reduction exceeds the CECL number. If we were operating under a standardized approach, as opposed to an IRB approach, then I understand what you mean at that point, because at that point, CECL would then be more closely aligned to capital, but we are operating on IRB, the approved model for that is very conservative, and that's why we have a buffer. So just to be clear, that's the core reason for the difference between Credit Suisse and any other CECL banks you've looked at.\\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee, Exane. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you very much. Just three quick follow-ons. Firstly, just clarifying a comment that you made a moment ago, Thomas, you talked about the full year 2020 dividend. Did you say, are you accruing a dividend in these 1Q numbers, that's my first question? Secondly, again a clarification, when you warned of further asset Management loss risks, would that require fold in the market level from today, or would it even be risk of losses, even at today's market levels? And then my third question is, do you see any loss risks around ETFs that you operate? For instance, I saw that you are closing a small oil ETF with a loss of client money, is there a risk divided on that or other ETFs that the bank loses money, or is subject to investigation risks? Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Jeremy, could you just repeat the first question? At one point...\\nThomas Gottstein: Accruing 2020 dividend, was the question? The answer is yes, we are accruing not only the full dividend for '19, but also accruing for our '20 dividend, yes.\\nDavid Mathers: And I think on the second question, in terms of AM losses. Yes, it's partly dependent on market levels, but it is an alternative to franchise. So you have a number of complex assets there, which are not directly linked to long equities. And I think that's, I think we will have to assess that in the course of the second quarter. We're seeing obviously, despite obviously the reduction in volatility since mid-March, there is still quite a lot of, should we say unusual market events going on at this point and I think it's only appropriate to warn that there is risk exposure there I think. Jeremy. Was there a third question, Jeremy, or no?\\nJeremy Sigee: Yes. ETFs.\\nDavid Mathers: ETFs.\\nJeremy Sigee: You're closing on oil ETF?\\nDavid Mathers: Nothing, we wouldn't expect anything material Jeremy.\\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you. I think we'll leave it here. Many thanks to all for your time this morning, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to follow-up with the IR team. Thank you.\\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call for analysts and investors. A recording of the presentation will be available about two hours after the event. The telephone replay function will be available for 10 days. Thank you for joining today's call. You may all disconnect.\",\n","  'transcript_split': [{'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, operator.

For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse first quarter 2020 earnings release and remind you that our first quarter 2020 financial report and accompanying financial statements for the period will be published on or around May 7. We would also like to remind you that our Annual General Meeting of shareholders will be taking place next week, on April 30. I will now hand over to our CEO, Thomas Gottstein and CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Kinner. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our first quarter 2020 results, my first as Group Chief Executive. Before I start with the slide presentation, allow me to make a few personal comments. As you know, I took office on 14th of February, little did I know then how the world would change within less than a month. During my first three weeks, I had the opportunity to meet with many colleagues in meetings in townhalls with key clients, investors, including most of our top 30 shareholders, analysts, regulators and journalists. These meetings took place in Switzerland, in London and in the U.S., and were very valuable for me personally to exchange views and discuss the strategic priorities and prospects of Credit Suisse with key shareholders and stakeholders. Unfortunately, the global COVID-19 pandemic then became a reality, which changed circumstances completely. Suddenly traveling was not possible and my priorities shifted to the safety of our employees, ensuring business continuity and being there for our clients in the face of a crisis. I am incredibly proud of how our organization has reacted to the challenge and demonstrated the strength of the Credit Suisse culture, based on its can-do attitude, teamwork, entrepreneurship and solidarity. I want to thank all our 48,000 employees for what they have done and achieved over the last few weeks in very difficult circumstances. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Executive Board and on the Board of Directors for their leadership and partnership, which allowed us to quickly react to the recent events in a coordinated fashion. Let me now take you to the slide presentation. I will take you through some of the highlights of the numbers this morning, as well as detail our response to the COVID-19 and the impact that it had, its having on our business. It is clearly an uncertain time for all in financial markets. However, I do believe that we have been able to demonstrate our resilience in the first quarter, as well as placing our clients, employees and communities at the center of everything that we do. Let's go to the first slide. In the first quarter, we generated CHF1.2 billion of pre-tax income, up 13% year-on-year. This was supported by a 9% increase in revenue across our Private Banking franchises, excluding the gain from the final closing of the InvestLab transfer in the quarter and a 25% increase in our sales and trading revenues. I would note that the increase in pretax income for the group was achieved despite an over CHF1 billion reserve build. We reduced total operating expenses by 6% year-on-year to CHF4 billion and now expecting around CHF16 billion of adjusted operating expenses for the full year 2020. Excluding the provision for credit losses, mark-to-market losses and gain from the InvestLab transfer, our pretax income for the quarter would have been CHF1.9 billion, a 66% increase year-on-year. This shows how much we have further improved the operating leverage of our business model. At CHF1.3 billion, we delivered the highest quarterly net income in the last 5 years and the return on tangible equity of 13.1%, in part benefiting from the closing of the InvestLab transfer and the negative tax rate. At the revised tax rate guidance for the full year 2020 of 20% to 25%, our ROTE for the quarter would have been around 9% to 9.5%. I would also add that the 13.1% ROTE achieved in the first quarter was the highest in the last 5 years. In the current market turmoil, we also benefit from our strong capital and liquidity position. In terms of capital, our CET1 ratio stood at 12.1% and our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8% at the end of the first quarter. We also maintain a strong liquidity position with one of the highest liquidity coverage ratios among international peers at an average LCR of 182% for the first quarter. And, to further protect our capital base, we have suspended our share back, buyback program and delayed the decision on the second half of our 2019 dividend until later in the year as previously communicated. Finally, and as you may have seen from our announcement last week, we received regulatory approval to become a majority shareholder in our securities joint venture, Credit Suisse Founder Securities Limited, marking a significant milestone in the Bank's China strategy. Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to look at our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a little more detail. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had on markets, economies and our society is profound. At Credit Suisse, we have adopted a three-pronged approach in response to the pandemic. First, my focus and that of the Executive Board has been on the well-being of our employees. We have established numerous support measures for our employees to overcome the challenge of the pandemic, including early engagement of medical advisors in Switzerland and globally, paid family leave in all markets in which schools are closed for those colleagues who are unable to work from home and honoring the contracts of future hires and pushing forward with remote on-boarding. As a result of detailed business continuity management, we were able to move quickly to remote working, and now approximately 90% of our employees can work remotely, with approximately 70% to 80% doing so and health measures in place for those still working from our office locations. Second, we have continued to serve our clients through these challenging times. We continued to provide bespoke client solutions given the market dislocation, whether that's to our Private Banking clients across region or to our wholesale clients in Investment Banking. We have leveraged our digital banking model to ensure business continuity, for example, by onboarding clients digitally. And in Switzerland, we continued to serve our retail clients through branches, 2/3 of which remain open and are following social distancing rules and increased hygiene measures. We also have played an active role from the beginning in the development of the CHF40 billion bridging loan program to SMEs sponsored by the Swiss government, of which more in a moment. Third, we are working in our communities to provide support where we can. We have launched a bank-wide donor-advised matching program to encourage employee donations to charities working to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. As part of that, myself and every member of the Executive Board has committed to donating at least 20% of 6 months' base salary or equivalent. The Chairman of the Board of Directors has also committed to donate to a similar extent. We have also made local donations of masks to hospitals and health care providers in a range of locations and made donations through our regional foundations to a range of charities. Next slide, please. Here in Switzerland, I'm proud to say that we have been able to play an active role from an early stage in the development of a highly effective and innovative CHF40 billion bridging loan solution for Swiss SMEs and we have done so in conjunction with the Finance Ministry, the Swiss National Bank, FINMA and the Swiss Bankers Association. The details of the 2 programs are referenced here targeting small- and medium-sized companies, providing access to funds quickly and without onerous paperwork requirements. The programs were modeled on an idea originally from Credit Suisse using the trade export guarantee system as a basis and involve significant government guarantees at 85%. As you can see from the slide, from the original idea to the program being implemented on March 26 was a matter of days. Eligible customers were able to access funds within 0.5 hour of completing a simple 1-page form. The success of the program overall is reflected in the decision on April 3 to increase the overall lending guarantee from the original amount of CHF20 billion to CHF40 billion. To date, Credit Suisse has granted approximately 14,000 loans with a total volume of CHF2.4 billion under both the SME and the corporate facility. Where we make a profit on these loans, if any, we have said from the outset, we will donate it to organizations focused on helping the Swiss economy. The program is a testament to the strength of the Swiss financial center working together for a common cause at a time of great need. Next slide, please. As I mentioned earlier, our results for the first quarter contained a gain from the second and final closing of the transfer of InvestLab to Allfunds. Including this transfer, pretax income rose 13% to CHF1.2 billion. Excluding the gains from the transfer, but including the over CHF1 billion reserve build, which we'll cover later in this presentation, pretax income was down 11% on the same quarter of last year. Next slide, please. As mentioned at the outset of my presentation, we have delivered the highest quarterly net income in the past five years at CHF1.3 billion. In part, this was supported by a negative tax rate that David will discuss in more detail later on. Next slide, please. This brings us to return on tangible equity. Despite credit provisioning and mark-to-market losses, we achieved a return on tangible equity of 13.1%, significantly increased from the 7.8% reported in the first quarter of 2019. Here, again, we see the benefit from the earlier mentioned gains from the InvestLab transfer and the negative tax rate. Based on a tax rate in line with our new guidance of 20% to 25% for the full year, our return on tangible equity for the first quarter would have been around 9% to 9.5%. Next slide, please. Our Private Banking businesses are at the core of our strategy and continued to demonstrate their importance during the first quarter despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Within Private Banking, we saw growing net interest income, stable recurring revenues and strong transaction activity, up 31% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period a year ago. Overall, Private Banking net revenues rose 9%, and this excludes the gain from InvestLab, showing continued strong momentum in these businesses. Next slide, please. Our integrated International Trading Solutions, ITS, business, a collaboration between SUB, IWM and Global Markets, continues to be an important differentiating factor in our model, providing trading solutions to Private Clients. During periods of market dislocation, as we are currently in, Private Clients are often seeking innovative solutions in order to protect their positions and best-in-class trading execution across all asset classes, including equities, bonds, FX, OTC derivatives and structured products. ITS is also at the heart of our lombard and share-backed lending effort to our Private Clients and once again proved its worth, as reflected in the 64% increase in revenues between the first quarter of 2018 and the quarter just ended. Next slide, please. Here, we are showing the makeup of our total Investment Banking net revenues across advisory and underwriting, equity sales and trading, and fixed income sales and trading. Both equity and fixed income sales and trading had strong first quarters, up 24% and 26%, respectively. Those strengths in our diversified Investment Banking portfolio, however, were offset by weakness in advisory and underwriting in March, resulting in 38% lower revenues from this business in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the mark-to-market losses of $459 million incurred in the first quarter, overall Investment Banking net revenues stood at $2.9 billion, up 23% on the same quarter a year ago. Next slide, please. This slide provides an overview of our comprehensive reserve build during the first quarter as a response to the challenging environment and continued pressure on oil prices. As a U.S. GAAP reporting Bank, we also incorporated appropriate CECL provisioning, taking into account updated relevant macroeconomic forecasts. David will provide further details on our modeling approach and underlying assumptions in his section. For the first quarter, we saw an increase in allowance for loan losses of CHF585 million as you can see from the bar in the center of this chart. On top of that, we took CHF284 million of mark-to-market losses in leveraged finance and a further CHF160 million for the APAC Financing Group. Together, that gives a total reserve build of just over CHF1 billion. CHF376 million of this amount relates to CECL provisioning, which, as you know, reflects general credit risks and non-specific client exposures. Next slide, please. I just wanted to take a moment to reinforce the importance of our home market in the current environment. From the start of 2017 until the end of 2019, on average, the Swiss Universal Bank contributed 38% to Group profit. The Swiss Universal Bank accounts for 58% of the Group's net loans on its books as shown in the pie chart on the lower left of this slide. Swiss loan quality has proven to be particularly resilient when compared to other countries. This is displayed on the right side of this page, showing provisions for credit losses and non-performing loans, respectively, as a percentage of total loans across some of the biggest banks in each of these markets. When looking at our balance sheet, the strength of our home market and its strategic importance should not be underestimated nor forgotten. To sum up the main part of my presentation, let me turn to the following slide. Here in the right-hand bar, we show the net revenues for the Group in the quarter, excluding the gains from the InvestLab transfer and the aforementioned mark-to-market losses. The light blue section of the bar shows the total operating expenses, which we have incurred to deliver these revenues. And the dark blue section depicts the pre-provision profit for the quarter, if it weren't for the appropriate credit provisions reflecting current market conditions. At CHF1.9 billion, this represents a CHF773 million increase compared to the same quarter of last year and shows that we have further strengthened our combined Private Banking and Investment Banking franchise, our profitability and delivered substantial operating leverage. And with that, I would like to hand over to David for the discussion of our financial results in more detail.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Thomas. Good morning, everybody. And I like to take you through the financial numbers in more detail. As Thomas has mentioned before, Credit Suisse's businesses delivered a resilient first quarter despite the challenging market and operational environment. As with prior quarters, to be helpful with comparisons and to better illustrate our financial performance, you will see that we've included a table at the bottom that includes our results excluding gains relating to the transfer of the InvestLab fund platform to all funds group. This will be the last time that we break out such gains for InvestLab as we've now completed the second and the final closing at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Gains in the first quarter from InvestLab totaled CHF268 million. Now, overall net revenues in the first quarter of 2020 were CHF5.8 billion, that's an increase of 7% year-on-year, including the impact of the gains from InvestLab that I just mentioned. If we were to exclude those gains, net revenues for the quarter would have been CHF5.5 billion and that's an increase of 2% year-on-year. Now, just looking at our business lines. In the first quarter, Wealth Management-related revenues increased by 7% compared to the same quarter in 2019, again including InvestLab. Wealth Management-related results excluding that gain, suffered from mark-to-market losses, say in Asset Management and in the APAC Financing Group portfolio. But Private Banking revenues, even excluding InvestLab was strong. We saw an increase of 9% compared to the prior year, and overall within Private Banking, we saw significant growth in transaction revenues, as well as a resilient result in net interest income and in recurring commissions and fees. If we look at our other operations, our markets businesses across both GM and Asia Pacific, we saw a combined revenue growth of 22% for the quarter, stated in U.S. dollars. These businesses benefit from a significant increase in market volumes and volatility during the quarter. Our Investment Banking and Capital Markets activities had an initially strong start to the year and we saw a pick-up of momentum and deal closings in January and February. But as we moved into March, the global response to COVID-19 made for a markedly more difficult environment for this business. We saw a reduction in primary activity, as well as the increase in credit provisions and in mark-to-market losses. Thomas has already touched on the reserve build in the first quarter, and I'll give you some more detail shortly, but you'll note that we had a provision for credit losses of CHF568 million and that compared to CHF81 million in the first quarter of 2019. We saw these provisions across all divisions, but in particular, they were focused on the Corporate Bank, which adversely affected IBCM and GM, as well as our credit exposures in Asia Pacific. I think it's clear that given the deterioration in the operating environment, cost management is going to remain critical this year. Our total operating expenses in the first quarter stood at CHF4 billion and that's down 6% year-on-year. We're going to remain very disciplined on costs for the whole of 2020, with adjusted operating expenses expected to be around the CHF16 billion level. Overall, and notwithstanding the substantial reserve build, we generated pre-tax income of CHF1.2 billion in the quarter and that's an increase of 13% year-on-year. As we've noted, and as Thomas has already referred to, our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative. That was a result of substantial and positive progress on deductions on our interest cost deductibility with international tax authorities. We benefited from the reassessment of the adverse marginal impact of the BEAT legislation in the United States as well as certain other significant U.S. rule change, which includes a carryback gain for prior years. Now if I look forward to the full year 2020, given this improvement, I'd reduce our guidance for the 2020 tax rate from the 26% to 27% level that I gave at the Investor Day last December to be at the lower range of 20% to 25% for the current year. Net income to shareholders stood at CHF1.3 billion, and that's an increase of 75% year-on-year and equated to a return of tangible equity of 13.1% for the first quarter. But as Thomas said, if you were to apply that guidance for the tax rate of 20%, 25%, you'd end up with return on tangible equity something in the 9% to 9.5% for the first quarter. Let's turn to the CET1 ratio. So our CET1 ratio for the quarter was 12.1%, and that compares to 12.7% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Now already included in this capital ratio, both at the end of last year and at the end of the first quarter, is a full capital deduction for the full year 2019 dividend, both for the first payment of CHF0.1388 that our shareholders will vote on at the AGM next week and for the second payment that the Board will review in the autumn and would intend thereafter to propose to an extraordinary general meeting at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Now given market volatility and the overall pressure on the global economy, the Swiss regulator, FINMA, has decided to phase in the CHF12 billion of RWA inflation from the Bal III reforms, primarily related to SA-CCR and certain other measures, which we briefed you on in the past, over the whole of 2020. Accordingly, we therefore recognized CHF3 billion in the first quarter rather than the CHF12 billion that I've guided to before. I'd also note that FINMA, like other major regulators, has introduced certain temporary exemptions relating to backtesting exceptions in the model approach to market risk. Risk-weighted assets overall increased from CHF290 billion at the end of the fourth quarter to CHF301 billion at the end of the first quarter. RWA increases relating to net business usage was primarily driven by corporate lending drawdowns and by increased market volatility during the second half of the quarter. There was a CHF3 billion reduction in RWA due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc. But as you know, we hedged that so that's had a negligible CET1 ratio impact. And clearly, as I've noted already, we also saw a CHF3 billion increase in RWA from the phase-in of the SA-CCR-related Bal III reforms. Our share buyback program is on hold until at least the third quarter of 2020 when we will then reassess our position, and I would hope that we'll be with better understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets and the economies in which we operate. Just in terms of guidance for the CET1 ratio for the balance of 2020. Given the industry- and market-wide increase in risk-weighted assets due to the heightened level of volatility and increased lending drawdowns and adverse migrations, together with the phase-in of the SA-CCR measures, I think it's prudent to say that I would expect us to operate at a CET1 ratio of around 11.5% for the balance of this year rather than the 12% that we previously guided. Let's turn now to leverage, please. So on this slide, I show our CET1 leverage and our Tier 1 leverage ratios. FINMA has decided to allow us and our peers temporarily to exclude cash held at central banks adjusted for any upcoming 2019 dividends from the calculation of leverage ratio. This exclusion applies at least initially until the 1st of July 2020. At the end of the first quarter, excluding CHF88 billion of net cash held at central banks, by which I mean this has been adjusted for the planned dividend payments as requested by the FINMA's rules, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 5.8%. Now if you were to adjust onto the previous basis and include the cash held at central banks, just to be transparent on this, the ratio would have been 5.3%. So that's a small decline compared to the 5.5% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. The CET1 leverage ratio, excluding net cash held at central banks, stood at 4.2% at the end of the first quarter. Now our leverage ratio increased through the quarter on a like-for-like basis due to the market volatility that we saw and the increase in the net cash positions that we held at central banks. But this was then offset by the exclusion of those increased central bank deposits subject to the dividend adjustment as FINMA permits. If you look at the chart, you can see, first, the impact of the strengthening of the Swiss franc, which led to a CHF10 billion reduction in leverage. Next, the higher levels of cash that we held at central banks at the end of the first quarter resulted in a CHF15 billion increase. We then saw a CHF43 billion increase in leverage exposure in certain parts of our businesses in the first quarter and that was primarily in Global Markets and reflects the market volatility, increased margin requirements that we saw in March, increased sales, drawdown’s to the Corporate Banking book as well as reduced netting at quarter end. These increases were then offset by the exclusion of the central bank deposits. So that led to an overall reduction in leverage of CHF40 billion. Now just in terms of the absolute amount of leverage, I would expect the adverse impact on leverage from volatility to largely normalize during the course of 2020. And even including central bank deposits, our CET1 leverage ratio by the end of the year should be in line with our previous guidance to be around 4%. Clearly, if, as other regulators have done, the central bank exclusion is actually extended by FINMA, the ratio will be high, so probably around 4.3%. Okay, let's just turn to look briefly at costs, please, on Page 21. The focus we have on cost efficiency and productivity remains an absolute priority, particularly in these times. During the first quarter, our total operating expenses amounted to CHF4 billion, and that was a decrease of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We've continued to fund very strategic investments for growth across the Bank, particularly in our Wealth Management-related divisions, as well as investments intended to improve digitalization and to increase the Bank's efficiency. But as we've said before, the pace of these investments are dependent on market and on economic conditions and given the current environment, I want to just reiterate that we will maintain a various high level of focus on cost discipline for 2020. Clearly, COVID-19 and the move to remote working for some, much of our workforce does provide the potential to reduce our costs in certain areas, but it will increase in others. Just in terms of guidance, as I said, we're going to be very disciplined for 2020, and I think I'd expect adjusted operating expenses to be at around the CHF16 billion level. Let's turn to tangible book value per share, please. What we show here is the progression of our tangible book value per share since the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. It grew from CHF15.88 to CHF18.25 per share at the end of the first quarter, that's an increase of 15%. But let's just focus on the major items. Clearly, one of the most significant components was net income in the quarter that added CHF0.54 per share. But clearly, the other major component is the CHF1.81 per share, resulting from the widening of credit spreads in March. Now, just recognizing that this should only be a temporary change, without it, our tangible book value per share would have been CHF16.44, an increase of 4% on the quarter. So, let's now turn to our credit provisions, please, and look at the overall reserve build that we took in the first quarter. So, I think in common with some of our peers, obviously, it's been most of the U.S. banks that have reported so far. We thought it would be useful to give an overview of the total of incurred, but as yet unrealized losses related to our credit exposures, and that's both accrual, which comes through in the PCL line, and fair value elected, which comes through in contra revenues. Now, the increase that we are reporting this quarter reflects the adverse impact of the deterioration economic environment on our portfolio; the mark-to-market impact of credit spread moves, mostly, entirely in March, and the, mostly in March, and the increase in our CECL reserves. You will see that we show on this slide two interrelated charts. Now, if we start on the left, we just show the movement in the allowance for credit losses as per accounts. As you know, Credit Suisse reports under U.S. GAAP. And the first quarter of 2020 mark the introduction of the current expected credit loss rules. Now, these are similar but substantially more conservative than IFRS 9, which was introduced for reporters a year ago and the difference, there was a number of differences but the most important one relevant today is the CECL includes a provision for losses over the entire life of the loan, which we continuously assess depending on our assessment of the economic outlook, whereas IFRS 9 requires that for only one year under most conditions. So, if we look at the chart on the left, first we're reflecting our allowance for credit losses for our loan book. We entered the fourth quarter, sorry, the end, we ended the fourth quarter of 2019 with an allowance for credit losses of CHF1.15 billion. The adoption of the CECL rules from the 1st of January led to an impact on the CHF1.15 billion of an additional CHF72 million. We then built in, we then took CHF568 million for credit losses in the first quarter, of which approximately CHF304 million comes from CECL. Net write-offs and other adjustments, i.e., things we've realized charge-offs generated a reduction of CHF55 billion, and that left our allowance for credit losses on loans amortized cost of CHF1.7 billion, an increase of CHF585 million compared to the previous quarter. Now, if we move to the second chart, we combine the movement of credit provisions with other unrealized credit-related exposures. Now, this is important because Credit Suisse has a higher proportion of fair value-related assets on its balance sheet than many other banks. So, you do need to look at both parts of this together. We take the CHF585 million from the previous chart and we add to it based on fair value marks at the end of the first quarter, CHF284 million of unrealized leveraged finance mark-to-market losses and CHF160 million unrealized APAC Financing Group mark-to-market moves. And that results in a total reserve build of just over CHF1 billion for the quarter. Now, just like to give you some context for this reserve build. It's important to understand that normal PCLs pre-CECL moves are generally related to specific positions, generally. CECL is a broadening and replacement for FAS 5 and it's a general provision related to our entire accrual elected loan book. And in order to calculate that, we have to use a range of scenarios against the economies and the markets to which our business is exposed to, to estimate it. So, we include a downturn in excess of 20% in U.S. GDP in the second quarter and double-digit levels of U.S. unemployment. We expect to see something similar in the EU markets in the second quarter and we will see, we also expect, and quite importantly for us, a smaller fall in the second quarter here in Switzerland. And I think just to be clear, that does mean that we obviously expect recession in the United States, in EU, and in Switzerland in the full-year 2020. Now, I think if you've looked at the U.S. banks that reported last week, I think it's very important to understand some similarities, but also some differences. First, we don't have the large exposures to U.S. consumer lending that the major U.S. banks have. We are exposed, as Thomas has already summarized, to a much more resilient Swiss economy, Swiss consumer base, Swiss market. Second, though, if you actually look at our GM and IBCM lending, our reserves represented 0.88%, 88 basis points, which I think is comparable to the marks that we estimate the U.S. banks took, which I think was in a range somewhere between 80 and 90, but IR can give you more details if that would be helpful after this call. So I think having given an overall summary, let's just now turn to the divisional performance, please. And let's start, please, with the Swiss Universal Bank. Now excluding the InvestLab gain, the Swiss Universal Bank generated CHF1.5 billion of revenues in the first quarter of 2020. That was an increase of 8% year-on-year. On the same basis, i.e., ex InvestLab, pretax income increased by 3% to CHF564 million. The Swiss Universal Bank saw strong results across all major revenue lines with increased client activity and higher revenues from International Trading Solutions, as you know, the collaboration between SUB, Global Markets and IWM, which benefited from higher volumes and higher market volatility. Operating expenses in SUB were stable with investments in growth offset by ongoing cost discipline measures. Now as Thomas has already said, it's part of our efforts to support our home market, our clients and our communities. We granted bridging loans worth approximately CHF2.4 billion to support small and medium enterprises as part of the Swiss scheme. Now if we turn to Private Clients, net revenues increased by 8% with increases across all major revenue categories and exceptionally high levels of client activity. For net new assets, we did see continued gross inflows in the period. However, we also recorded net asset outflows of CHF4.2 billion, mostly driven by a single low-margin outflow in the ultra-high net worth segment. Corporate & Institutional Clients, excluding the gain from InvestLab transfer, reported an 8% increase in net revenues year-on-year, and that was driven by strong ITS and by strong Investment Banking revenues. NNA for C&IC totaled CHF4.8 billion, reflecting the continued momentum in our pension fund business. Now let's turn to the next slide, Slide 25, please. Now going forward, we're going to give a rolling track record of our divisions against a number of our metrics, as certain of our peers do. I've included that in this presentation for each division for the first time, but I'll not necessarily comment on these metrics. But it's clear for SUB, the charts clearly demonstrate the strength of revenues, the continued positive progression on cost-to-income, the consequent gains in pretax income and the return on capital. Let's turn to IWM. Our International Wealth Management division saw high levels of client activity during the first quarter with resilient asset-based revenues and net interest income, but we did suffer unrealized losses on fund investments within the Asset Management business. As a result, IWM's pretax income, excluding InvestLab, was CHF319 million, down by 39% year-on-year. Net revenues, excluding InvestLab were down by 9%. If we look at Private Banking, pretax income was down by 7% year-on-year, but that does include the CHF15 million gain from the InvestLab transfer. But I would note that in the same quarter of last year, we benefited from a CHF27 million release of major litigation provisions in the first quarter. Net new assets for Private Bank in the first quarter are pretty good, CHF3.7 billion. That's a 4% annualized growth rate. Just turning to Asset Management. Excluding the CHF203 million InvestLab gain as well as the unrealized losses on seed money in the asset management funds of CHF101 million, we made a pretax income of CHF60 million. And net new assets for Asset Management were broadly stable, I think, up CHF0.1 billion in the quarter. Let's turn then to Slide 28, please, and look at Asia Pacific. Our Asia Pacific division recorded a pretax income of CHF227 million, excluding InvestLab, up by 24% year-on-year. Net revenues excluding InvestLab were up by 17% at CHF1 billion the first quarter and this was largely due to strong results within Private Banking within WMC as well as by APAC markets. This offset unrealized mark-to-market financing losses on the fair valued lending portfolio and our financing businesses and included in WMC. So if you look at WMC, if we exclude InvestLab, pretax income was CHF60 million and that included CHF160 million of unrealized mark-to-market moves on our fair valued lending portfolio in the financing businesses and CHF96 million of provisions against credit losses mainly related to three single cases, the largest of which was caused by a single default on a share backed loan linked to a Chinese food and beverage company. We saw record Private Banking revenues this quarter as transaction-based revenues increased by 67% year-on-year. But clearly, that was offset by the adverse impact in the financing portfolio. Net new assets totaled CHF3 billion. I think that's a stable performance given market conditions. If we turn to APAC Markets, we saw a strong performance with high level of transaction and gains from hedging. Revenues from APAC Markets increased by 60% as both fixed income and equity sales and trading delivered strong year-on-year increases in revenues. Equity sales and trading benefited from higher revenues in prime, partly offset by lower revenues in equity derivatives, whilst fixed income sales and trading benefited from higher revenues of structured products, emerging market rates and FX, partly offset by a weak performance in credit. Okay. Let's turn to Slide 30 now and move to IBCM. IBCM began the year on a strong footing of increased activity in Capital Markets and higher deal flow. Momentum in January and February was, though, offset by the closure of primary markets for most of March. Net revenues was down by 47% year-on-year, driven by mark-to-market losses in leveraged finance and net losses on hedges in respect of IBCM's uncollateralized corporate derivatives exposure. If we were to exclude those, then division will have seen net revenues up by about 4% year-on-year. As I've already said, IBCM's results were adversely affected by negative developments in our Corporate Bank, which is split with Global Markets. These provisions were mainly related to the oil and gas sector. Mostly -- that was the single largest component. More details of our exposure to which, which has fallen significantly since 2015 I've included in the appendix. We also saw an increased provision for credit losses due to borrower drawdown’s of approximately $11 billion of revolving credit facilities with the related impact under the new CECL rules. This drawdown clearly also increases RWA requirements in the quarter, let me just conclude then with a few words on Global Markets. I think, as Thomas and I indicated on March 18, the division benefited from the substantial increase in volumes across equity and fixed income markets. And as we said then, I think generally has navigated the market dislocation that we saw in March particularly well. Pre-tax income in the first quarter increased by 21% year-on-year on a 14% increase in revenues, and as Thomas has already said, we saw robust ITS revenues in the first quarter, reflecting higher volatility and continued momentum with Wealth and Institutional Clients. If we look at the main business lines, fixed income revenues were up by 17% year-on-year with higher trading activity in macro and global credit products, offsetting unrealized mark-to-market losses in leveraged finance. Equity revenues were up by 22% year-on-year with a marked increase in equity derivatives, continued momentum in cash and solid prime. As we note, the other line was impacted by a loss on a single name counterparty. Clearly, GM has also suffered its share of the increase in credit provisions in the Corporate Bank, both specific and CECL linked, which I've already covered. Now, as I mentioned before, RWA and leverage exposure for Global Markets increased due to the significant increase in market volatility in the second half of the quarter. RWA usage stood at $72 billion at the end of the first quarter. That's up from $58 billion in the same quarter a year ago. With regard to leverage, we saw a similar step-up due to volatility, increased margin requirements, a high level of fails at the end of March, GM's share of the drawdowns in the corporate banking book, as well as reduced netting. As I said before, though, I would expect the majority of this to reverse over the next two to three quarters. And with that, I'd like to conclude the finance presentation and hand back to Thomas. Thomas?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, David. I would now like to close the formal part of today's call with two final slides. Chart 35 shows how we have managed to increase the tangible book value per share over the last nine quarters, as well as our profitability measured by return on tangible equity. And as you can see in the table below, we achieved this profitability increase while maintaining strong capital ratios and further increasing our risk density toward 35%, a level commensurate with the expectations of FINMA and the Swiss National Bank when they calibrated too-big-to-fail capital requirements as part of Swiss approach to adopting the Basel III capital rules. Final slide, please. Let me reiterate one message that is of particular importance for me during this challenging time. We understand our responsibility toward our employees, clients and the communities we operate in and take it very seriously. We will continue to do that, and we will do everything in our power to limit the impact this severe crisis has on all of our stakeholder groups. Amid this profound market dislocation and despite significant reserve building, we delivered solid first quarter financial results and saw a good revenue momentum in Private Banking, as well as in our sales and trading businesses. However, the scale of the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis is still difficult to assess and I would caution that we might see a further reserve build in the coming quarters, particularly affecting our Corporate Bank, as well as other loans, in particular outside Switzerland. We might also record further impairments relating to our asset management investments. Additionally, we would caution that the recovery in underwriting and advisory fees might be limited at least in the short-term until COVID-19 pandemic eases and the global economy begins to recover. Credit Suisse, however, has entered this crisis with a number of key strengths and advantages, which are depicted on the right side of this slide. First, we have high dependency on the strong and resilient Swiss economy. Second, we have a very stable and growing Private Banking franchise, contributing significantly to our revenues and pre-tax income of the Group. Third, over the past years and through our restructuring, we have significantly reduced our cost base and risk exposure in our market businesses. Fourth, we have a robust capital and liquidity position. We are well prepared to continue to serve our clients and we believe we can maintain a resilient financial performance through the crisis. Thank you all for your attention. I will now hand back to Kinner for Q&A.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': \"Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. Operator, let's open the line.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa. Please go ahead, from Morgan Stanley.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much and good morning to everyone. I've got two questions, one, about the capital walk kind of this year, in 2020, and one about kind of your thoughts about the reserve build, and I do appreciate there is a lot of uncertainty in both. So, let's start with the capital conversation. You've implied to us that you think that you're going to end 2020 or kind of throughout with a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. Could you help us kind of run through the components of the move from the current 12.1% to the 11.5%? You've given us some. Of course, we've got still the CHF9 billion of the regulatory inflation to come through in the remaining three quarters, you've kind of given us a little bit of a view on the market risk-weighted assets, i.e., your expectations that they're going to come down with volatility. But how do you see the credit side of the equation, and also the operational side of the equation on the risk-weighted assets, as you have got a little bit of a relief on the model in the 1Q from that side as well? Just to kind of give us a sense of the moving parts on the risk-weighted asset side as you see it.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Magdalena, very good to speak to you. Thank you very much for the question. It seems a long time since March 18 and I'm very glad that I'm not on video today, so you can't see my haircut, or lack of haircut should we say. Look, I think we wanted to be as clear and transparent as possible. I think if we looked at the CET1 ratio that we reported for the end of the first quarter of 12.1%, I mean, it was similar to what we guided to back on the 13th of February when we did our end, year-end numbers, but obviously the components were notably different, because rather than CHF12 billion of SA-CCR and related impact, we only had CHF3 billion and yet you end up with the same number. And that does give you an idea of the inflation or the increase in RWA that we have seen from the volatility in March and how that actually flows through into some of our bar numbers. The adverse CVA migrations you're actually seeing, and clearly, the drawdown on the corporate loan book, which actually does increase both RWA and result in a CECL provision in respect to that. Reality is most of the RWA increase was actually due to that measure. There wasn't a great deal of discretionary business increases in the RWA. It was due to the market impact. And I mean, let's be clear. I mean, I think you've seen very similar drops amongst the U.S. banks last week, and I'm not particularly surprised. I think looking forward to the second quarter, I think it's worth remembering, as you know, as Mel and I do, that a lot of these metrics and changes are only actually averaged in during the whole of the quarter. So you've only seen some of the impact of that volatility within the RWA numbers you see now. And I would expect to see a significant increase in both CVA and market risk-related RWA as that actually flows through the time series. I think drawdowns have pretty much come to a halt in the last week or so. But I think we are going to see migration impacts as credit ratings and rating agencies catch up with the events of the last month and start to make estimates of what we're going to see, economic-wise, over the next quarter or so. So I think I have to warn you, I think we will see an increase in credit-related RWA as a consequence of that. And then, obviously, you have the mathematical consequence of CHF3 billion of SA-CCR related. But essentially, that would obviously take you down from 12.1 down to about 11.9, 12.0. So the rest, as you might say is an estimate, which I think will be partly offset by our own actions to actually reduce that of that inflation in the first quarter. So I mean, I just would caution. Generally, in the past, we've been very precise around CET1 numbers. I think due given the level of volatility around this process at this point, I think when I said around, I meant around. And I think when I spoke at your conference, Magdalena, I said around 12%, I do mean around in that sense. I think there's a degree of unpredictability here. And I think quite clearly as well, we also do respect, and it's very important to us that we look after our clients at this moment, and that's obviously led to some RWA increases in the first quarter. So we will see some consequence, and that's another factor as to thinking. So I think around 11.5% is my broad guidance, basically. And I would probably expect us to be at around 11.5% by the end of the second quarter because by that point, you should see it fully phased in.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"That's very clear, David. And my second question is largely connected because, of course, you've mentioned the kind of migration impact, the credit migration impact on the capital. But of course, we're going to have it on the impairment side as well. So when you think about your kind of impairments and potential for marks going forward, how should we think about the kind of the levels there?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Okay. Yes, it's been a complex month, shall we say. There's one point I just want to make clear to, Magdalena, and I think I did refer to this middle of last year at some point, which is the capital deductions under the IRB approach for credit losses actually exceeds the CECL effect. So therefore, the increase in CECL reserves that we took at the end of the first quarter, and indeed, the transition at the end -- the 1st of January did not have any meaningful CET1 deduction effect. And that will be the case, provided any further CECL increases that we see in the balance of this year and second quarter, I think, is obviously the focus, do not exceed the IRB allowance. And that's got to be a little more helpful. There's a couple of hundred million left before the CECL numbers would actually exceed IRB, plus/minus. So that might be helpful to you, Magdalena. If you're thinking about CECL, which to me reminds me of an old-fashioned general provision, it isn't. It's a completely different accounting concept, but perhaps I'm feeling my age. Obviously, PCL is more specific because that doesn't fall into that. So the PCL component, to the extent we see an increase in specific provisions in the second quarter as we see how this -- the economic effects of COVID-19 pans out, would be capital relevant. The CECL would not be provided. It doesn't exceed more than a couple of hundred million, at which point we would actually exceed the IRB calculation and then move forward. So I hope that's helpful, Magdalena.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And your next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher, UBS.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Daniele Brupbacher',\n","    'text': \"I wanted to ask about the RoTE ambition, which you disclosed at the Investor Day and I think reiterated with Q4 results, the 10%, how you think about that at this stage, whether you're happy to reiterate that at this point. And then, secondly, on the mid-March, 19th of March, I think you -- I mean, you gave us very helpful numbers and you talked about the first 2 months. If I now look at the PBT of CHF1.2 billion, strip out all funds, pretax profit was probably just around above CHF900 million. So how can I just link today's numbers with what you said back then? I guess, the big explanation is some of these risk costs and mark-to-market moves. But if I strip that out, was March still loss making? Or what was sort of the picture in March? And then very lastly, more a strategy question on the IB. I mean, assuming the world remains a challenging and somewhat volatile place, how you think about your IB franchises in that context and in terms of resourcing, head count, balance sheet usage. I mean, it's obvious that it produces some volatility in the results. I mean, obviously, the environment is extreme, but how you think about it as being part of your overall portfolio that's -- what's the positioning in there? And just very lastly, sorry, the CVA/DVA on credit, I mean, I see the CHF78 million benefit in the comp line on Slide 46. But can you tell us what the impact was on the revenue side?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Okay. I will take the first and the third question, and maybe, David, you can take the second and the fourth question. So starting with RoTE, it's clear that this quarter's 13.1% benefited from a very low, actually negative tax rate. But as we said, if you adjust it to our new guidance, it's still 9% to 9.5%. But also, if you take a bigger picture and if I refer you to Page 35, actually, if you look over the last four quarters and you take the average, we're actually at or above the 10% and we had very high tax rates in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. So I think on average it's now over those four quarters, 18%, which is not significantly below our guidance. So I think we have proven actually over the last four quarters, that we have a franchise that can deliver something around 10%, and it's gotten very clear to me, that continues to be our target, at least in the midterm. But it's also clear that in the short term. Over the next, you know, two, three quarters with COVID-19 and the impact of it, the RoTE is going to be challenged, but it's still clearly our goal to be at or above 10%, because that's where we think in a normalized world, the cost of equity is of our business and we want to earn in excess of that. Maybe I will hand over to David for the risk cost, then I will take IB franchise question and then the fourth question around on credit, back to David.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"I'm not going to give you an exact number for March, but perhaps putting myself in your shoes, perhaps, the way I think about this is, obviously Thomas and I said on 18th March, that our profit for the end of February exceeded the CHF106.2 million that we made in the whole of the first quarter 2019. So just setting that as a minimum basically, you take the CHF106.2 million, you drop out, as a starting point, you take our number of CHF102.1 million, and you deduct CHF268 million, you'd end up with a number ex invest lab of CHF933 million. So at the limit and obviously there was a degree of comfort, and what we said on March 18, you'd be talking about a loss between CHF106.2 million to CHF933 million, which I think is CHF129 million. Now so, if we then look at the various provisions we actually took, you really have got the mark to market move in the leverage finance book, which was CHF284 million that was taken entirely in March. If you look at the APAC CHF160 million, that was taken partially, perhaps mostly in March. And if you look at the CECL adjustments, the add-on to day two to component which we had given before, that was taken, over CHF300 million, that was actually taken almost entirely in March as well. So I think you can see pre the reserve build, March would have been very substantially profitable, even allowing for, I have not told you, which is the degree of buffer that Thomas and I had, when we actually made our statement on the 18th. Is that helpful, Daniele?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Daniele Brupbacher',\n","    'text': \"That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Okay, Daniel. So as we come to your question on Investment Banking, the way I look at our Investment Banking franchise globally, we obviously have sales and trading in global markets, but we also have sales and trading in APAC markets. And in addition to that, in IBCM, you have to really look at our investment banking capabilities also within APAC, Wealth Management and Connected, as well as in the SUB, Swiss Universal Bank. And if you look at page 13, you can actually see that we have had a very positive trend, both in fixed income sales and trading and equity sales and trading, which on this page actually includes APAC market. And if you look at advisory and underwriting, excluding mark-to-market losses, we are actually also on a positive trend. So just because we have some mark-to-market losses in our lev fin book doesn't really change my view on that. And quite the opposite, if you look at the composition of our advisory and underwriting fees, revenues actually in the first quarter, we have been up compared to the first quarter '19 in each of debt capital markets, equity capital markets, M&A and fixed income derivatives and, so that's the first point. The second point I want to make, I'm convinced that our strength of ultra high net worth clients and family offices can only be further strengthened, if we continue to provide Investment Banking type of additional services beyond what pure play private banks can offer, be it in the sales and trading environment, be it through advice related to M&A, IPOs or otherwise. So my conviction very much is that the differentiating factor from Credit Suisse to other private banks, is that we can actually offer these services. I hope that answers the question?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Daniele Brupbacher', 'text': 'Yes, absolutely. Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Final question was actually on CVA and DVA basically, I think that was your fourth question. I don't have a complete answer to that question, but perhaps we should just look briefly at page 36 of the earnings release, which does give you some useful disclosure around the corporate center. So I think, if we actually look there, you can see that we saw losses of CHF279 million with respect to owned credit spread moves in the corporate centers. So that was there. But I think you should also know just clearly, is that this was largely offset by other gains that we actually saw in the period. So I don't think you should be working around adding that back in. You can see we had CHF179 million of fair value money market instrument gains. We had CHF94 million relating to the fair value option volatility on own debt. So I wouldn't encourage you to add that back, but I don't know if you'd seen that, but that is useful disclosure. And just to clear up any other points, that is not related to the issue around structured notes which I discussed at length in previous quarters. Actually the hedge on the accretive portion, the structured notes actually worked almost perfectly in the first quarter, and there was almost nil impact from that at this point, and we've also extinguish part of that portfolio, in what was obviously a fairly extreme interest rate move basically. So it's something quite separate. So I think that's, probably strictly speaking, most of the answer to your question, Daniele, basically, but please don't go back adding things up in that sense. I think there is gains and there is losses in this whole thing. And you're right, there is the DVA gain of CHF78 million relating to the credit spread widening on the compensation instruments, to which we award employees and I would expect that to reverse clearly in the course of 2020, as our credit spread narrows.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you.

If I could just follow up on some of the idiosyncratic loss numbers. I think you went into PCL in quite a lot of detail. But on the unrealized fair value mark, if I could start there, let's break it down to three parts; the unrealized fair value marks first; the U.S. banks obviously took similar, some of the U.S. banks flagged potential for that potentially to reverse in the second quarter given subsequent credit spread movements. So then if you could just elaborate on any thoughts there on the impact in 2Q based on movements to date. Second part would be with regard to the asset management loss on seed money, CHF101 million a quarter, and you said there's a risk of further losses here in your outlook statement. Is there any way you can help us frame the magnitude, the potential impact there? So how much of your AUM is seed money? How much investment is there in place? And then, finally, on global markets in the revenues and the other items, there's a loss on a single name counterparty. Can you just elaborate on exactly what that relates to? Is it acting as a clearing member? Or is that a credit exposure that you book through there? Just we can get a feel for whether that's potentially recurring as well.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much, Andrew. So let's just take those 3 questions in turn. So if we look at, I mean, probably Page 23 as the use was anything else as an aide-mémoire for this, you have CHF284 million of leveraged finance mark-to-market losses and you have CHF160 million relating to the AFG financing group. I think if you look at our slide deck, I think in the first page, I believe it was in the appendix, I actually also included the leveraged finance exposure numbers, which I think we did give at the MS conference last month. But just to give you an idea, essentially, oil and gas exposure, there was CHF9.1 billion in the fourth quarter of '15, CHF7.7 billion now, of which CHF2.9 million is non-investment grade, which I think is the most important component. Leverage finance exposure was CHF11.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter '15, down to CHF7.3 billion. So that gives some degree of background around this. I think if we just go back to Page 23, again, basically, let me just talk around those different components. Firstly, the leveraged finance mark-to-market, these are underwriting commitments that we had coming in during the quarter. Now, these are fair value elected. So even though these deals have not yet financed in large part, I would caution, we have to estimate at the end of March what the market would have been, had they been financed at the end of March on a probability-based metric. And essentially, as the widening of high-yield credit spreads in the course of March had actually gone through flex and through the margin, you actually end up with a potential loss in respect to those underwriting commitments. Now obviously, as you rightly say, since the end of the March, you've seen significant normalization on those spreads. And the Federal Reserve Bank, as you know, has actually been buying some of these assets, which has clearly contributed to that narrowing. So yes, there is clearly potential for that. These are unrealized losses. But I think just a word of caution, I think these deals are not yet closed. So they will close at some point in the next few months. So it will depend on what the credit spreads are at that point. And I think if markets continue to normalize, then you would expect to see recovery, at least in part of that MTM number. And if they weren't, then you wouldn't, basically, Andrew. And I think it's a little bit dangerous to make forward-looking comments in the slightly stressed environment that we still see. I'm just obviously just looking at what happened in the WTI market over the course of the last 72 hours. Actually, APAC mark-to-market is actually almost simpler. We have a CHF4 billion portfolio of fair value elected financing positions there. Most of those have been marked to proxies, emerging market loans. Those are often very liquid and somewhat distressed markets, but we mark against those. It's not that we've actually seen defaults against them, it's just essentially you see a mark-to-market effect. So you would expect to see that normalize again, clearly subject to how these markets evolve and develop over the course of the next six months. And that's why I thought I want to be super clear about breaking that number out. So hopefully, that answers those two points in terms of that component, the reserve build. I think on the asset management point I made before, there's about CHF100 million of impairments, of which around two third relates either to seed money or to joint ventures with partners. As you know, our asset management business, really oversimplifying a bit, consists of an equity and a long fixed income and a real estate business closely associated with our wealth management business, particularly here in Switzerland, and then the alternatives business in the United States. So this really relates to the seed money in the alternatives business. And that -- it was in respect of that, about two third was due to that. And just to be clear, just to be transparent, the other one third was in respect to the 5% retention in CLOs you have to hold under European rules, not U.S. rules, which we also mark. So those are those two components. I mean, I think we've just been cautious. In terms of investments that asset management has, it's around about CHF2.4 billion, of which half is in external asset management’s and about half basically is in these types of seed money investments. I think we'll need to see how these investments perform in the balance of the second quarter. But I think it was worth being explicit because I think it's important to be transparent about these things that this is obviously a risk for the second quarter. Final point then in terms of the GM other revenue number, there's not much I'm going to add. I mean, essentially, the increase in the other revenue loss between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, as I've said, is in respect of a single counterparty, and it's clearly not something I've included in the reserve build. So that says something as well to you. But it was a single counterparty. And obviously, it was a distressed position, and we've marked it appropriately.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"And just if I can add on the left fin book, we have observed the reversals in the first few days. Whilst it's difficult, obviously, to predict the future in the current market, but the leverage loan index is 165 basis points tighter now compared to the end of March and the yield has reduced from 880 to 715 basis points.

In your CET1 capital waterfall, you have a negative, roughly CHF600 million impact from what you call goodwill reversal. And in fact, your deduction for goodwill now is higher than the goodwill that you carry in the balance sheet. Could you explain what happened there, please? The second point regarding your exposures, and I hope I haven't missed a previous question on this. But you have CHF7.7 billion oil and gas and you have CHF7.3 billion leveraged finance. Is there an overlap between those two exposure buckets, please, and how big, will that be? And the third question, inspired I guess by what we have seen from some American banks, do you book any significant funding valuation adjustments during the quarter? And if so, where will I find them please?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much, Stefan. So let's just take those three questions in turn. I think just for the benefit of everybody, I think you're referring to page 43 of the earnings release and the CET1 walk across, where you see a reversal of goodwill and tangible assets of CHF618 million. That is in respect of the second phase of the InvestLab transfer, because there is a significant amount of intangible assets associated with that. Whilst that generates a gain under our equity and for that matter in a total equity base, that is not CET1 eligible. Therefore, we actually deduct it at this point. So that's what's actually driving it, in terms of the numbers. So you see a gain, but the second phase actually results in that intangible been deducted from CET1. I think the second question I'd say straightforward. I don't think there's any particularly material overlap, actually probably no overlap between the leverage finance and the oil and gas exposure. So two separate numbers. Although it's a very good question, Stefan, but there isn't any. In terms of FVA or we tend to call it XVA because the number of different derivative adjustments. I think you note, you should know obviously, that we did disclose, I think it was only IBCM page. So let me just get you that page number. I think it's actually on page 30, that we take net losses of CHF51 million for hedges on uncollateralized corporate derivative exposure. That is, I think, we'd call an XVA loss, because it relates to the derivative, the funding components of this. That is the largest component. There is also a smaller component I think within the APAC business, but, that's where it is. I'm afraid, I don't have the APAC number to mind, I'm afraid, but it was I think slightly less than the IBCM one.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jernej Omahen, Goldman Sachs.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jernej Omahen',\n","    'text': \"I had some problems with the line before. So good morning from my side as well. Well done on the results, particularly in the Investment Bank. I have three questions please. So the first two are just sort of technical nature. The first question is on collateral management and your lombard loan book. David, can you please give us a sense what the change of total lombard loans and for the Group outstanding was during the first quarter of the year? And just to confirm, right, so if there is a recall of some of the lombard loans that comes toward the net new money outflow, if I'm not mistaken? And the second question I have on levered loans. So can you maybe just have the question, if I may ask the question this way, what is the notional amount of leveraged loans that the mark that you've taken relates to? And then finally, I have a question more of a conceptual nature, and I think it falls into two parts. So the first question is, I think I understood from your presentation well, what you're not afraid of, as Credit Suisse Group, and what type of scenarios don't scare you and what type of scenarios you think are manageable? Thomas, I would like to ask you, what does scare you, at this point in time? And the reason why I ask this question, as I look at the pre-tax profitability, which is fine, it gets you underlying through, as you point out, an 8%, 9% ROE. On an annualized basis that's 40 basis points of leverage exposure, 120 basis points of risk-weighted assets. I mean, does it take much imagination if the current environment persists to see those profits disappear, and Credit Suisse starts loss making? Thanks.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Let's just take those questions in order then. So I think on collateral and lombard loan exposure to mind I don't actually have an exact number on the lombard move quarter-on-quarter, maybe we can get that and give it to you later, Jernej, but I'll refer to my IR colleagues on that. What I would say, is that was not to my knowledge at least, any material component of net new asset moves that we actually saw in the quarter. Obviously the biggest thing was, this transfer of a single, low margin ultra high net worth mandates from Credit Suisse to a different bank, which was the bulk of what you actually saw in SUB, and that was definitely not related in any way to a leverage loan. I think we have seen some deleveraging as you'd expect and face these markets and if you actually look at the components of assets under management, it's up to about 32% cash now across all three of our private banking business. So there definitely has been some deleveraging as part of that. But that's all I'd say at this point. I think your second question was on the leverage finance exposure. I'm not really going to add more to what I've said before. The marks that we've taken are in respect of the CHF7.3 billion book. Clearly, some of those positions will have a higher mark than others, but I'm not going to sort of break it down any further. I think you should just assume it's in respect to that entire book, basically. I think your third question, perhaps I'd refer to Thomas in sense of what are we worried about?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Before I get to the third question, I mean on the on the collateral management and the lombard loan question, the first one, I mean if you look also at our loans in the three private banking led divisions, you can see actually it increased in Switzerland, but it went down both [indiscernible] and in APAC and that really is, as David said, a result of some deleveraging we saw there. But the same time a lot of our clients are now positioning themselves to reengage, as they see the lock downs in various countries, especially in Europe to ease and they are taking increasingly positive views on the market, obviously, in a cautious way. That leads me to what scares me or first of all, I can say, I can sleep well and it's I think probably the worst scenario would be, if we all went back to the offices too quickly, lockdowns to follow, some think we have a second wave of infections, and that will then result in prolonged crisis, and I think that will be bad for the economy and indirected end for us and capital markets generally. So that is certainly something that we all have to factor into our scenarios as well. But broadly seen, I'm actually taking a lot of comfort of how we have managed at least so far through this crisis. If I look at our capital, if I look at our liquidity, if I look at our earnings growth in Private Banking, if I look at our ability in trading, be it equity or fixed income, to navigate the markets have been very encouraged by that. So, I can assure you that we are very cautious. We are very aware of the overall slowdown in the economy. We expect, as it was mentioned also by David, a recession, not only in the U.S., but also in Europe and Switzerland. But I'm not losing any sleep. So thanks for asking.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': \"The first question is regarding CECL. Can you just run us a little bit to how you forecast CECL in terms of how you do the modeling? And in that respect, I think I missed some of the assumptions. Could you just repeat and maybe add not just to the assumptions, I think you mentioned the U.S., but just the GDP and unemployment numbers for some of the key regions for 2020 as well as 2021 that you're assuming in CECL? And lastly, on CECL, are you using a phased-in approach? And if you do so, what would be the fully loaded impact on your CET1? The second question I have is, it was partially discussed. But if I look at your valuation, you're roughly at 0.5x tangible book, and mainly, I would say it's because of your IB concerns by the market or market concerns on the IB, not your concern, clearly. I was trying to understand how you square your view around why this is a good business in the long term, especially, I assume in ITS, and maybe you can share that with us, you sell basically no credit products to your private banks, why you need a credit business considering post restructuring, it again made losses. Why you need a credit business, i.e. the investment bank, in light of a wealth management business? And thirdly, if I may ask one more question. In respect to your capital ratio, at what level would you be uncomfortable doing a buyback?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Perhaps if I take the first question and then hand over to Thomas, really, in terms of your question around the credit business, I believe, within the wholesale operations. I think the number of questions is really about CECL. So I think the approach that we take is similar, the same, as I understand, that the U.S. banks take. We have a significant number of models, which we apply across our different businesses, both IB related and wealth management related. Those include a different range of inputs, which we actually probability weight in order to actually calculate the outturn. In terms of the key assumptions, I think what I said was that if we think about the U.S., then we are assuming a quarter-on-quarter reduction in excess of 20% for the second quarter. We are expecting something not dissimilar in the year '27, but a lower impact in Switzerland. In terms of unemployment in the U.S., we're assuming double digit, which I think is similar to what most of the U.S. banks are actually also assuming. And in terms of -- I mean -- and clearly, we expect all three of the economies I've just mentioned to be in recession for the whole of 2020, and we do not really expect to see a recovery until the first quarter '21, i.e., positive GDP growth. So those are our set of assumptions that we made. And I think those are probably the most -- the key ones to actually think about, not the only ones, but the key ones, basically. So hopefully, that helps, Kian. Now in terms of the capital impact, as I said in response to an earlier question, the capital reduction for CECL, we'd have no significant capital reduction for CECL because we already did make a capital deduction in respect of the IRB capital model, which exceeds the CECL provision. So we already have a greater deduction. So therefore, increasing the CECL does not, therefore, reduce our capital. And as I said before, I think to be helpful, there's about another CHF200 million of buffer that CECL would have to increase by before it exceeds the IRB buffer. And then at that point, you get into these interesting questions around phase and everything else, but that's just not relevant at this point, and hopefully, does not become relevant in the future in terms of capital reductions. So that's what I'd say to your technical question, Kian, I think. Thomas? Just on CECL, can you just highlight what assumptions you make for GDP and unemployment in 2021? Actually, that's more interesting from my perspective, at least. Should we just use consensus numbers on Bloomberg as a good indicator? Or are you different from that assumption?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"I think it's not that different. I mean, it's closely aligned to, but not quite the same as the house view we give externally.

I don't have the -- well, yes, and I -- yes, we do expect to see U.S. unemployment reduce, but it's still going to be well above trend in our numbers in 2021.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': 'And just on CECL, the CHF200 million is on a phased-in basis or fully loaded, the buffer?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"I think we don't have a phased-in question at this point, Kian.

If our CECL losses were to increase by CHF200 million at some subsequent quarter from the level they are now, then basically, we would start to see a capital reduction and then we -- then I think that's when the phasing question actually kicks in, but it's not relevant at the moment, Kian.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein', 'text': 'Okay.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Okay. So I think the way I think, we have a full deduction ready. There's no phase-in effect.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Okay, so your other three questions on valuation on the credit business and the buyback. So first on valuation, I very much believe in the correlation between return on tangible equity and price to tangible book value, and I think there is a clear dislocation at the moment from where we are, against that line and where we are trading. So I think it's our task to deliver quarter-on-quarter, to get as close as possible to that line. At the moment, we are clearly way below our tangible book value, which is not a Credit Suisse idiosyncratic problem. I think most most banks suffer from the same, but we just have to prove quarter-over-quarter that we can deliver on our returns, and that's how we look at valuation. Secondly on the credit business, I have to say that, don't quite understand your question, because our credit business is actually profitable. If I look in Global Markets, it has had actually an excellent quarter as part of our fixed income and this is even after absorbing their share of the unrealized markdowns. Now if you refer to more the lev fin business, clearly it was an extraordinarily difficult quarter, not only for us, but also for the U.S. banks that are mainly our competitors in that market. But over a mid to long-term cycle, we very much believe that private equity related business will continue to be a main driver of Investment Banking fees going forward. If you look at our CHF7 billion exposure in the context of our CHF300 billion loan book, I think it's a small exposure. We have significantly reduced it after the financial crisis. This was, I think from the peak, we went down 85%. So clearly lev fin had a bad quarter, but I think we are well positioned in that business and it is actually also, in many cases, relates also to M&A, for example, where we have a lot of clients now approaching us about public-to-private, with low valuations and you can only discuss that, if you also have people at the table that understand lev fin markets. And from that perspective, I'm actually very clear of the opinion, that it fits well with our overall strategy. On the buyback, very clear, we have suspended it in March, and we are now observing the market. We are in the first instance, focused on the second part of the dividend -- of the 2019 dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter. Secondly, we are focused on paying a dividend for the year 2020, and then only in the third instance on the share buyback, so that's how I look at it. Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"And to your first question, sorry, Kian, I think the confusion or the point I have to clarify really comes down to IRB, their standard models. So the IRB model, as approved by the FINRA, is extremely conservative and that's why the capital reduction exceeds the CECL number. If we were operating under a standardized approach, as opposed to an IRB approach, then I understand what you mean at that point, because at that point, CECL would then be more closely aligned to capital, but we are operating on IRB, the approved model for that is very conservative, and that's why we have a buffer. So just to be clear, that's the core reason for the difference between Credit Suisse and any other CECL banks you've looked at.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your last question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee, Exane.

Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion, we refer you to the Credit Suisse second quarter 2020 financial report, other published materials and the accompanying financial statements for the period published this morning. I will now hand you over to Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run you through the numbers and strategic initiatives.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Kinner. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our second quarter 2020 results, my first full quarter since becoming Group CEO on the 14th of February. Before I start with the slide presentation, allow me to make a few remarks. Our first priority was and remains the safety and well-being of our employees, clients and communities in which we operate around the world. I want to thank all our roughly 48,000 employees for what they have achieved over the last few months in very difficult circumstances as evidenced by our second quarter 2020 figures today showing the highest second quarter net income attributable to shareholders in a decade and double-digit return on tangible equity. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Executive Board and on the Board of Directors for their partnership, which allowed us to deliver on our primary objective: providing solutions to our clients around the world and helping them navigate extremely volatile markets amid intense economic uncertainty. Let me now take you through the slide presentation. Today, I will take you through some of the highlights of the second quarter 2020 and then explain the strategic initiatives we announced earlier today to improve effectiveness and generate efficiencies for further investments in digitalization as well as to accelerate growth as a leading wealth manager with strong global investment banking capabilities. Let’s turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we generated CHF 1.6 billion in pretax income, up 19% year-on-year, and CHF 1.2 billion of net income attributable to shareholders, up 24% year-on-year and the highest second quarter result in a decade. Our second quarter growth was supported by 11% year-on-year growth in revenues with a strong contribution from our Global Markets, Investment Banking and APAC Market franchises and solid performances in our Private Banking businesses. The increase in net income for the group was achieved despite adding CHF 296 million in additional provision for credit losses last quarter for a total of CHF 864 million for the first half of the year. Our total allowance for credit losses on our balance sheet was CHF 2 billion as of the end of the second quarter, of which over 1/2 was non-specific reserves including CECL. As you know, the U.S. GAAP CECL approach to provisioning leads to earlier recognition of potential credit losses. It’s worth noting that 84% of our loan book is collateralized, and the Swiss Universal Bank accounts for almost 60% of our loans. Our home market, Switzerland, has a strong track record of historically low credit loss experience versus other regions. As our total operating expenses in the second quarter rose 2% year-on-year, we reported our 15th straight quarter of operating leverage. We are expecting CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion of adjusted total operating expenses for the full year 2020 depending on market and economic conditions. We delivered a strong RoTE of 11% in the second quarter, 12% over the first six months of 2020 and 10.4% in the last 12 months. Our balance sheet is the strongest it has been for many years. Our CET1 ratio increased from 12.1% in the first quarter to 12.5% in the second quarter, and our CET1 leverage ratio increased from 4.2% to 4.5%. We also maintained a strong liquidity position with one of the highest liquidity coverage ratios amongst international peers at an average LCR of 196% for the second quarter, up from 182% in the first quarter. We are building on the success of our strategy and intend to continue to allocate the majority of our capital into wealth management going forward. We are also optimizing our model, which is expected to capture new growth opportunities by creating one global investment bank, combining our risk and compliance functions and creating a new Executive Board-level function, Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions or SRI. I will provide details on each of these shortly. Finally, our Board of Directors intends to propose to the shareholders the second half of the 2019 dividend at an Extraordinary General Meeting on November 27, 2020. Subsequent to the EGM, the Board intends to review the share buyback program. Both the dividend and the buyback are subject to market and economic conditions. Slide 6, please. As I mentioned earlier, our results today are a testament to the hard work and resilience of our employees and commitment to our clients. At Credit Suisse, roughly 90% of our staff were enabled to work remotely at the height of the pandemic, and currently, around 80% are still working from home. Free antibody testing is being offered in our home market, Switzerland, where we first launched the offer, and a global rollout of the program is being prepared. Our roughly 48,000 employees have been successfully supporting our clients. We leveraged technology and digitalization to deliver solutions, and we ensured strong technology-driven private banking engagement and high-volume execution across fixed income and equities. As a global bank, operating in over 50 countries, we showed our commitment to our communities. In this context, I would like to commend the Swiss government and other domestic public authorities for a rapid and robust response to the pandemic. This has cushioned the economic effects, and thus far, allowed the public here in Switzerland to return to many aspects of their normal lives while maintaining heightened vigilance. Working with the government and other authorities, we were able to design a CHF 20 billion loan guarantee program to small-and medium-sized companies that got money into the hands of main street-type businesses within days of the national emergency being declared in March. We are proud at Credit Suisse to have played an early role in helping to establish this program, which played to many of the strengths of the Swiss economy. We stand ready to work with the public sector as needed in the coming months. Finally, our employees responded with significant charitable contributions, including to charities working to alleviate the impact of COVID-19, and support those segments of society that are most heavily affected by its economic effects, which were matched by the bank. Over a period of about two months, we raised CHF 25 million through this initiative, the most on record for a charity fundraising program at Credit Suisse. And this money was distributed globally. I will now go into our key results in greater detail, Slide 7. This page shows the financial highlights for the quarter. I covered the key group numbers on the left side of this page already in my introduction. Our divisional results, depicted on the right side of this page, highlight the breadth of our strong performance. Each of our divisions generated strong returns on regulatory capital between 17% and 24%. Next slide, please. Over the last five years, we have steadily grown our return on tangible equity, averaging 12% in the first half of the year amid a challenging market environment. This is the upper end of our medium-term ambition of delivering an RoTE of 10% to 12% in a normalized environment, subject to market conditions and economic conditions. For the first half of the year, we achieved CHF 2.5 billion in net income attributable to shareholders, as I said, the highest in a decade. As I stated before, Credit Suisse benefits from Switzerland – sorry, we are on Page 9 now. As I stated before, Credit Suisse benefits from Switzerland’s historically low credit losses compared to other regions. There are, of course, two sides to this coin: the stability of Switzerland’s economy and political system also makes the Swiss franc a safe haven currency that tends to strengthen in times of global turbulence, which affects us as a company that generates significant non-Swiss franc revenues. As you see from this slide, our reported Private Banking net revenues grew by a solid 4% year-on-year during the first half of 2020 despite the significant economic slowdown. On a normalized basis and excluding the FX impact and certain other items, global Private Banking revenues were actually up 7%. The effect was most pronounced in IWM, where we reported a 1% year-on-year revenue decline in the first half of the year. Excluding the negative FX impact, which resulted primarily from the Swiss franc strength against the U.S. dollar, the Brazilian real and the euro and certain other items, revenues would have grown 4%. This highlights the underlying strength of our Private Banking divisions benefiting from our integrated and regional approach. Slide 10, please. Our Investment Banking business has not only shown resilience, but also benefited from the market environment. Revenues were up 21% on a reported basis and would have been up 26% in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 excluding mark-to-market effects. The revenue growth was spread across products with particularly strong growth in fixed income sales and trading. Now turning to Slide 12 and the strategic initiatives that we have announced today. We reaffirm our strategy launched nearly five years ago to be a leading wealth manager with strong global investment banking capabilities. The core of our growth strategy remains to be the bank for entrepreneurs with a focus on ultra-high net worth individuals. We continue to see potential for significant growth and attractive returns in Wealth Management with a balanced approach between mature and emerging markets. We also continue to believe in our regional wealth management model with proximity to our clients and empowering regional decision-makers. Slide 13, please. As you can see from this slide, we have truly transformed our business since we began our restructuring in late 2015. Our success is reflected across our financial metrics. Firstly, we have significantly and successfully derisked our Global Markets business. We have significantly lowered our group cost base from over CHF 21 billion in 2015 to below CHF 17 billion for the last 12 months. At the same time, our look-through CET1 capital has increased by almost 30% to over CHF 37 billion. Secondly, our capital allocation has shifted significantly in favor of our historically high return, less volatile Wealth Management businesses where we allocate today roughly 2/3 of our capital. Thirdly, as you can see, excluding significant items, our Wealth Management businesses have demonstrated strong growth in assets under management, net revenues and pretax income during this time. Going forward, in a normalized environment, we plan to broadly maintain this capital allocation split of 2/3 in Wealth Management and 1/3 in Investment Banking and continue to target in the medium term an RoTE of 10% to 12% and a payout ratio of roughly 50%. Slide 14, please. In order to further optimize our business model, we now have taken steps to better align our organizational structure with secular trends such as digitalization, sustainability, growth in private markets and lower-for-longer interest rates. As I mentioned earlier, these trends have been accentuated by COVID-19. While we strongly believe in our regional approach to wealth management with proximity to clients, we are combining our Global Markets, Investment Banking and Capital Markets and APAC Markets operations into one single global Investment Bank. We will also combine our risk and compliance functions. Finally, we are launching a newly formed Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions unit, called SRI, at the Executive Board level, combining Impact Advisory and Finance; Investment Solutions & Products, which is currently housed in IWM; equity research, which is currently housed in Global Markets and in the APAC divisions; and finally, the Marketing and Branding operations. In doing so, we address a certain degree of fragmentation, improved effectiveness, and together with additional efficiency plans in SUB and other corporate function areas, expect to generate run rate savings of approximately CHF 400 million per annum from 2022 onwards. We expect to reinvest these savings, depending on market conditions, into our four divisions with a particular emphasis in APAC, but also in IWM and SUB as well as in our continued digitalization and sustainability efforts. These changes are intended to align our business and resources for growth. The combination of risk and compliance will enhance alignment in our control functions. The SRI will align sustainability with our thought leadership in investment solutions and in content. And the single Investment Bank will build alignment in what we deliver globally to corporate, institutional and entrepreneurial clients. Let me go into each of these aspects in greater detail, Slide 15, please. Firstly, our single Investment Bank will create a globally integrated client-centric platform built on sales and trading, underwriting and advisory to maximize global connectivity. It will be led by Brian Chin. Brian has successfully led Global Markets and strongly improved returns. We will integrate capital markets origination and execution. This function will be led by David Miller in addition to the capital-light advisory business, where we tend to make further investments. David has done an excellent job leading our Investment Banking unit and has been a main driver of this combination. I thank him for his contribution and look forward to continuing to work with him in a great partnership. Given the success of ITS, our International Trading Solutions, and which is our trading and sales collaboration between Global Markets, SUB and IWM, we are creating GTS, Global Trading solutions, by combining ITS with our successful APAC Solutions businesses. This should allow us to align our global technology, risk and execution efforts in this area. GTS will have close regional connectivity to Wealth Management and bring global products to local markets. In addition, we shall integrate the APAC Equities into – sorry, we shall integrate our APAC Equities business into our global Equities franchise, ensuring global solutions for large institutional clients without compromising client proximity across Asia. The new IB division should also enable a more dynamic allocation of capital, consolidate our support functions and optimize global risk, technology and execution platforms. This series of refinements should allow us to deliver our medium-term ambition for a return on regulatory capital in excess of 10% for the investment bank. Secondly, we shall be integrating our risk and compliance functions under the leadership of Lara Warner, who, as you know, has been our Chief Risk Officer for over a year now and has previously successfully led the compliance function. We expect to leverage scalability and technology and data platforms used by both units and strengthen our digital capabilities. This should reduce fragmentation and complexity, address a certain degree and duplication across non-financial risks and allow us to consistently execute and deliver our control framework across all risk types while increasing coordination and the speed of decision-making. Thirdly, we are excited to launch our new Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions unit to build on our strong research and CIO capabilities to deliver unique global insights and investment solutions with a single best-in-class House View. We expect a function to also drive a globally consistent sustainability strategy. It will be led by Lydie Hudson, who has been our Chief Compliance Officer,and who previously successfully led our change program within Global Markets. This decision should allow us to further develop differentiated investment and advisory solutions across wealth management, corporates and institutional clients. It is also intended to increase connectivity of research, fully integrate ESG principles into our research approach and drive unique and market-leading insights across both public and private companies in all relevant sectors. Page 16. These organizational refinements are aimed at accelerating growth across our four divisions with a medium-term ambition for return on regulatory capital of greater than 20% for our three Wealth Management businesses combined and greater than 10% for the Investment Bank. In APAC, we intend to broaden our successful coverage of ultra-high net worth and entrepreneur clients with investments in relationship managers and bankers by expanding our wealth-linked client solutions and deepening our onshore franchises to tap faster-growing markets particularly in Greater China. As part of this strategy, last month, we completed the transaction to become a majority shareholder in our China securities joint venture, Credit Suisse Founder Securities, in which we aim to take full ownership. In IWM, we aim to double the revenue growth contribution from ultra-high net worth strategic clients over the next three years. We will expand our systematic solution delivery through the newly established International Financing Group. We are also looking to build on the success of IBCM in APAC and Switzerland, which, by the way, will both stay in these two respective divisions and where we have number one positions by integrating our IBCM, EMEA mid-market capabilities into IWM to increase connectivity with entrepreneurial clients especially in M&A. Furthermore, we will optimize our regional Private Banking coverage and create a more systematic solution delivery model. For our SUB, we will continue to build on our high-touch strategy for ultra-high net worth, corporate and institutional clients by leveraging digital solutions for our high-tech, retail and smaller corporate clients in our Direct Banking business area that we launched last year. We are now aiming for a reduction in the cost/income ratio from the high to the mid-50s. This is intended to be achieved as we optimize and improve collaboration with subsidiaries and front-to-back efficiencies. At our Investment Bank, we expect to leverage our newly established globally integrated platform to capture growth opportunities, particularly in the asset-light areas of advisory, M&A, ESG and Private Markets. Slide 17, please. Now let me put a special emphasis on the topic of sustainability. With the establishment of the SRI unit, we are now seizing the opportunity to drive a cohesive approach to position Credit Suisse as a progressive sustainability leader meeting the evolving needs of our stakeholders and society in general. Whilst we have already made great progress in the last few years, as seen on the left side of the slide, we are announcing new steps to become a leader in sustainability across our Wealth Management and Investment Banking client franchises. Sustainability will be represented in the Executive Board, underlying the significant importance and opportunities we see in this area and Iris Bohnet will take the newly created role of Board of Directors Sustainability Leader to drive our sustainability agenda and support execution. That said and aligned with the establishment of SRI, we today announced a series of sustainability goals including to provide at least CHF 300 billion of sustainable financing over the next 10 years in areas such as renewables, lower carbon solutions, green bonds, transition bonds and other projects that contribute to the delivery of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and to financing our clients' transition to a sustainable future. Furthermore, we are further tightening our exclusion guidelines around coal mining, coal power, Arctic oil and gas and other fossil fuel industries to transition towards lower carbon solutions that contribute to the achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement. In particular, we will generally not provide lending or capital markets underwriting to any company deriving more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal extraction or from coal power, and we will not provide financing related to offshore and onshore oil and gas projects in the Arctic region. We are aligning our industry groups to better pursue opportunities in the energy transition space by combining our oil and gas and our power and renewables businesses in IB. We are also enacting energy transition plans for each of our high-carbon industries to ensure clients that we are working with in these industries have plans to address their footprint. Next page, please. Let me summarize our financial ambitions. We aim to achieve 10% to 12% RoTE over the medium term in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions; run a CET1 ratio of around 12% and a CET1 leverage ratio of around 4%. As mentioned, in terms of our capital distribution, we expect approval of our second half 2019 dividend at an EGM on November 27. After the EGM, the Board intends to review the share buyback program, subject to market conditions. Looking forward into 2021 and beyond, we expect to distribute at least 50% of net income through dividends and share buybacks in a normalized environment. We are currently accruing for a 2020 dividend consistent with this policy, namely, a dividend that we expect to grow by at least 5% per annum. And with that, I would like to hand over to David for the discussion of our second quarter financial results in more detail.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Thomas. Good morning, everybody. And I’d now like to take you through the numbers in some more detail, please. So as Thomas has already summarized, our businesses performed robustly in the second quarter, notwithstanding the ongoing economic stress and the market uncertainty resulting from the pandemic. But before I do get into details, I think I’d just emphasize that with a CET1 ratio of 12.5% and a total allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet of CHF 2 billion, we feel well prepared for the continued economic stress that we will see in the second half of this year as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Let’s turn to the financials. So overall net revenues in the second quarter of 2020 were CHF 6.2 billion, and that’s an increase of 11% year-on-year. Now if we look at the business lines on the slide, you can see that in the second quarter, our Investment Banking & Capital Markets division saw an increase in revenues of 61% compared to the second quarter of 2019. And our Markets revenues across both Global Markets and Asia reported an increase of 33%. Now whilst our Wealth Management-related revenues did fall overall by 2% compared to the same quarter in 2019, as Thomas has already mentioned, this was impacted by the strength of the Swiss franc in which we report by comparison to the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real. On a constant currency basis, our Wealth Management-related revenues would have increased by 1%. Now we continue to take an appropriate stance with regard to the provisioning for our credit exposures against the economic stresses resulting from the pandemic. With regard to CECL, our total debt exposures were roughly constant, although we did see some deterioration in the economic projections compared to the end of the first quarter. As I’ll discuss in some more detail, we did see an uptick in certain of our specific provisions but not as much as in the first quarter. Net-net, as I’ve already mentioned, we come into the third quarter with a total allowance for credit losses on our balance sheet of CHF 2 billion. Now total operating expenses in the second quarter were 2% higher than the same period last year at CHF 4.3 billion. That mainly reflects two factors: first, increased compensation accruals due in part to the substantial pickup in trading activity and transaction activity in the quarter; and second, a CHF 53 million increase in certain expenses, resulting from the mark-to-mark movements on deferred comp instruments relating to the narrowing of our credit spreads in the quarter. Overall, we generated pretax income of CHF 1.6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-on-year. Now our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. Now if you include the benefit of the tax reversals that I discussed three months ago, that takes our year-to-date tax rate to 10%. Now I’d reiterate and maintain the 20% to 25% guidance that I gave for the full year, although, clearly, given our performance in the second quarter, I would expect the rate for the full year to be very much at the lower end of this range for 2020. If we look to 2021, on the basis of our current plans, I’d expect our tax rate to be somewhere in the mid-20s for next year. But this will, of course, depend on any taxation changes in the countries in which we operate, and in particular, it’s clearly possible that there could be a change in U.S. tax rules following the elections this autumn. Our net income attributable to shareholders stood at CHF 1.2 billion, and that’s an increase of 24% year-on-year. That equates to a return on tangible equity of 11% for the second quarter, which takes the total for the first half to 12%, which is in line with our medium-term guidance of an RoTE of between 10% and 12%. Let’s look at the CET1 ratio. So the CET1 ratio for the quarter was 12.5%, and that compares to 12.1% at the end of the first quarter. I’m sure you’ll recall that in April I warned that our capital ratio could fall in the second quarter compared to the first, reflecting the concerns we had that we could see a further increase in lending in our corporate bank drawdowns in the period as well as the adverse impact of market and credit risk volatility on our RWA. Now if we look at the second quarter, we did see the risk-weighted asset inflation that we expected, both from the phase-in of the SA-CCR reforms here in Switzerland as well as the increase in RWAs from the volatility of March. We also did see some impact from ratings migration. But overall, our CET1 ratio at the end of the second quarter benefited from very strong levels of capital generation, a reversal and not an increase in our corporate bank drawdowns and from the reductions in our leverage finance exposure as we completed deals during the second quarter. I think we’re also more successful than I would have expected in mitigating some of the volatility-driven increase in RWAs. And the net effect is that RWAs fell from CHF 301 billion to CHF 299 billion over the period. Now if we look forward to the balance of the year that there is still considerable economic uncertainty, I think our capital position means that I’m confident to reinstate the previous guidance we gave at our Investor Day last December of a ratio for our CET1 of approximately 12% for the end of the year. In terms of capital distribution, we expect to maintain our long-standing dividend policy and to continue to accrue for a dividend as we did in the first quarter in anticipation of an increase of at least 5% in the 2020 total compared to 2019. With regard to the second installment of the 2019 dividend, please note that we have announced today that we’re planning to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting on the 27th of November. Following a final review by the Board, we would expect that shareholders will be asked to vote on the approval of the payment of the second half of the 2019 dividend at that meeting. Now as Thomas has already said, we remain committed in the medium term to a payout ratio of at least 50% following next year of a gradual increase in the dividend and share buybacks. And following the EGM that we planned for the end of November, the Board intends to review the resumption of the share buyback program. Let’s turn to leverage. During the second quarter, our CET1 leverage ratio increased by approximately 30 basis points to 4.5% and our Tier 1 leverage ratio by approximately 40 basis points to 6.2%. That was driven by the strong earnings generation I mentioned already and by a partial reduction of the elevated leverage exposure that we had at the end of the first quarter particularly in Global Markets, due to improved netting and reduced margin requirements and fails as well as lower leveraged finance exposure. Now given the economic stress, we have continued to take a conservative approach to our liquidity requirements, and you’ll note that our LCR ratio increased to 196% over the quarter, which I would expect to be amongst the highest of the major banks. Let’s turn to look at tangible book value per share, please. What we show here is the progression of tangible book per share for the first six months. This grew from CHF 15.88 to CHF 17.03 during the period, an increase of 7%. I’d like to make three key points about this: first, you can see the net income generation of CHF 1.0 per share; second, you’ll see that we have seen volatility in our tangible book value per share due to the moves in the value of our own credit with the widening in the first quarter followed by a narrowing in the second quarter, leading to a net addition of CHF 0.71 overall; and finally, the strength in the Swiss franc against other currencies has had an adverse impact of CHF 0.43 over the six months period. Let’s turn to cost now, Slide 24. We remain committed to our program of continuous improvements in productivity. And as Thomas has already summarized, we’re planning further measures to support this. So far, expenses have fallen from CHF 8.5 billion in the first half of 2019 to CHF 8.4 billion for the first six months of 2020. We saw some increase in expenses in the second quarter compared to the first as a consequence of the moves in the value of our own credit as well as revenue-related expenses, predominantly comp-linked, for which we have accrued to reflect the strong revenue performance this quarter. This has been partly offset by reduced travel and related expenses. Now our expectations for costs for the full year will clearly depend on the level of business activity, but I would expect our adjusted cost number in the year to be in the range of CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion. So next, I’d like to talk in some more detail about our loan book and our provisions for credit losses. I thought it’d be useful to give some detail on the disclosure, which we’ve included now in Page 71 of our financial report, and that relates to the composition of our loan book. Firstly, you can see the majority, 84%, are collateralized loans at amortized costs. I think the second point is something I’m sure you’re all familiar with, the largest component of our loans are made here in Switzerland with 59% of group gross loans residing in the Swiss Universal Bank. I’ve said before that one clear point of differentiation for us is that we do not have a significantly large exposure to U.S. consumer lending, and our credit exposure is instead biased towards our more resilient Swiss home market. The Swiss economy continues to benefit from low levels of unemployment, low levels of consumer indebtedness and to a low credit loss experience compared to other markets. But I think it’s also fair to say that the Swiss government has moved quickly to protect its citizens and its economy from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we would continue to expect the Swiss credit experience to be substantially better than the rest of the world in the coming months. Let’s turn now to look at the quarter-on-quarter move in credit provisions. What I’m showing here is an updated version of the slide that I presented three months ago. As I’m sure you remember, the first quarter marks the introduction of the current expected credit loss rules under U.S. GAAP, which came into effect on the 1st of January. It’s worth remembering that Credit Suisse is unusual in being a European-based bank reporting under U.S. GAAP rather than IFRS, and therefore, subject to the much more conservative CECL rules. As you know, CECL generally upfronts more of the impact of credit losses than IFRS. If you look at the summary, remember the rules that I’ve shown here for the first three months of the year, at the end of which our allowance for credit losses stood at CHF 1.7 billion. Now the level of the CECL provision depends overall both on the absolute level of our credit exposure that we have and the economic outlook for that credit exposure. What we’ve seen in the second quarter is that our exposure has been broadly stable and that the outlook that is clearly worse at the end of the second quarter than at the end of the first has not seen the pace of deterioration that we saw in the first quarter. After all, I think at the end of December 2019, no one had actually heard of COVID-19. So therefore, our additional provision for credit losses was substantially lower in the second quarter than in the first at CHF 296 million, of which CHF 130 million was related to CECL and CHF 166 million was related to specific provisions. And that takes our total to CHF 2 billion at the end of June. Now I just wanted to update the comparison that we gave at the end of the first quarter, which shows here the level of credit losses that we have against the loan books for our Global Markets and our IBCM businesses, and that should be broadly comparable to the loan exposures of those peer banks that have already reported and for which we have the necessary data. As at the end of the second quarter, this figure stood at 2.2%, which exceeds that of all those peers who’ve reported so far and have published comparable data. The increase compared to the first quarter reflects both the increased credit provisions we’ve taken, but also the reduced exposures for this calculation as we’ve seen corporates who’ve refinanced themselves in the debt capital markets and paid down corporate loans in the period. Now before I turn to the divisional summary, I did want to discuss the accounting implications of the restructuring measures that Thomas has already briefed you on. Just to recap, we’re amalgamating IBCM, Global Markets and APAC Markets into a single global investment bank. We’re combining and integrating our risk and compliance functions. We are creating a new function called Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions. And we’re accelerating our efficiency and digitalization initiatives here in Swiss Universal Bank. These measures will require a restatement of our earnings onto the new divisional basis, which we would expect to provide to you at the beginning of October. We will be taking some restructuring charges as a result of these measures expected to be approximately CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million. And these should generate approximately CHF 400 million of run rate savings. The program will run over the course of the next 12 months with a full run rate savings achieved from 2022 onwards. Let’s turn now to our divisional performance and start with the Swiss Universal Bank. Our Swiss Universal Bank generated pretax income of CHF 687 million, an increase of 5% compared to the same period last year. That includes a gain of CHF 134 million from the revaluation of our equity investment in the Pfandbriefbank in the second quarter of 2020. Revenues increased by 2% to CHF 1.5 billion driven by higher revenues from International Trading Solutions, or ITS, and increased revenues in our ultra-high net worth segment as well as by the revaluation gain. We’ve taken additional provision for credit losses of CHF 30 million compared to CHF 124 million that we took in the first quarter, and this increment was primarily driven by our consumer finance business in Switzerland. Operating expenses was 3% lower than the second quarter of 2019 at CHF 787 million, the result of ongoing cost discipline which helps our cost/income ratio to fall to 52%. If we turn to Private Clients, net revenues increased by 3% year-on-year driven by the strong performance of the ultra-high net worth segment where revenues rose by 12% and by the Pfandbriefbank gain. But this was partly offset by lower revenues from our investment in the Swisscard credit card issuing joint venture. In terms of net new assets, we saw further outflows of CHF 1.6 billion due to deleveraging by certain of our ultra-high net worth clients this quarter. But I would note that client business volume, which include net loans, assets under management and assets under custody, was up by 4% Q-on-Q. Corporate & Institutional Clients reported stable net revenues year-on-year with increased ITS and Swiss Investment Banking revenues as well as higher fees from lending activities, which offset reductions in FX transactions. C&IC saw net new assets of CHF 1.6 billion for the quarter, mainly reflecting continued momentum in our pension fund business. Now I’m not going to cover the next slide in detail, but you can see that notwithstanding the adverse economic environment and acknowledging the Pfandbriefbank gain, the return on regulatory capital was stable at 20% for the year – sorry, for the quarter, and we saw continued growth in pretax income and net margin. With that, let’s turn to the next slide to look at IWM. In terms of performance, the division has seen significant increase in underlying client activity this quarter. Comparisons with the same quarter last year are complicated by the fact that most of the businesses IWM transacts in is in U.S. dollars, the Brazilian real and the euro, all of which have fallen significantly against the Swiss franc, and this has had the effect of reducing revenues by CHF 71 million year-on-year. If we exclude for this and for the real estate gains from the same period last year, the division’s revenues was down about 1% compared to the 7% headline rate we report today. This underlying performance also reflects a fall in recurring revenues due to the delayed impact of the fall in markets in the first quarter together with pressure on net interest income due to the reductions in U.S. dollar interest rates. Overall, we saw a 22% decline in pretax income for the division, which fell from CHF 444 million to CHF 348 million year-on-year. Our Asset Management revenues fell by 7% with pretax income lower at CHF 80 million, although I would note that the comparative figure did include a very substantial sales gain from a private equity investment in the second quarter of 2019. We’ve seen good inflows in the quarter with contributions from emerging markets in Europe taking the NNA total to CHF 1.8 billion in Private Banking. In Asset Management, we saw net new assets of CHF 4.1 billion with strong institutional flows driven by Index Solutions and Credit. Let me turn now to Asia Pacific. Our Asia Pacific division reported a strong performance for the second quarter with pretax income improving by 26% year-on-year to CHF 298 million, the highest level since 2015, with net revenues up by 17% year-on-year at CHF 1.1 billion. With our costs broadly stable, the cost-to-income ratio fell by 10% year-on-year. Predominantly driven by strong markets and IBCM performances, which offset an increase in credit provisions, these numbers delivered a return on regulatory capital of 22% for the quarter. If we look at Wealth Management & Connected, our pretax income was CHF 123 million. That included a CHF 33 million recovery of the unrealized mark-to-market gains on our fair value lending portfolio in our financing business, but this was offset by hedging losses and costs of CHF 72 million. Within Private Banking, which like IWM was also adversely affected by the strength of the Swiss franc compared to the U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar-linked currencies, we saw lower NII and lower recurring commissions and fees due in part to the fall in average assets under management which offset increased transaction-based revenues. Our advisory, underwriting and financing revenues, which increased 9% year-on-year, reflect increased equity-linked activity. Net new assets for the quarter totaled CHF 4.5 billion, representing an annualized growth rate of 9% and taking NNA for the half year to CHF 7.5 billion. If we turn to APAC Markets, the positive market environment and higher client activity drove net revenues 60% higher year-on-year, fixed income revenues increased by 151% whilst equity sales and trading revenues increased by 23% driven by both cash equities and equity derivatives. Let’s turn to IBCM. Our Investment Banking & Capital Markets division also saw strong second quarter revenues, up by 61% year-on-year to US$732 million. With operating expenses broadly flat year-on-year, that translates into a pretax income of US$212 million. Additional provisions for credit losses totaled US$69 million, compared to US$161 million in the first quarter of 2020 and are driven primarily by CECL charges due to the deteriorating economic outlook in North America. In terms of specific provisions, we saw limited adverse effects with only US$7 million allocated to specific cases. Just to update you on our leveraged finance exposure, this has fallen sharply by a further US$4.3 billion since the end of the first quarter to US$3 billion outstanding at the end of June. We saw strong client activity across our advisory and underwriting businesses with clients taking advantage of positive debt and equity markets to secure additional financing and to refinance their balance sheets. Our equity underwriting revenues increased by 65% year-on-year, buoyed by strong follow-on and convertible issuance performances. And we were ranked number one in IPOs for both the second quarter and the first half of the year. Our M&A revenues also increased by 32% as we took market share on the back of completing previously announced transactions, although I would caution, as some of our peers have done, that the pipeline in terms of advisory work is less strong than it was a year ago due to the impediments that the COVID-19 pandemic makes on initiating new transactions. Our debt underwriting revenues improved by 83% in part due to strong investment-grade debt activity. I’d note though that contributing to this performance was IBCM’s share of the 73% recovery of the mark-to-market losses of US$147 million that we took in leveraged finance in the first quarter. This reflects reduced credit spreads as well as the completed – completion and syndication of a number of transactions. Let me conclude then with a few words on the performance of Global Markets. In our Global Markets business, we saw a continuation of the elevated level activity and volatility that we benefited from in the first quarter, combined with the increase in debt and equity issuance activity supported another robust performance by the division. Our pretax income was up by 71% at US$615 million on net revenues of just under $2 billion, an increase of 27% year-on-year. And that resulted in a return on regulatory capital of 17% for the quarter. As we’ve noted already, robust ITS revenues have contributed to this performance and are a testament to the collaboration between our Markets and Wealth Management businesses. Higher trading activity and market share gains delivered strong fixed income revenues, an increase of 42%. And like IBCM, GM benefits from the write-back of the 73% recovery of the unrealized mark-to-market losses of US$147 million and the leveraged finance underwriting book. In Equities, we did see share gains in cash trading and underwriting and that offset a reduced performance by equity derivatives in the second quarter. In terms of credit loss provisions, as with IBCM, the decrease in corporate exposure due to debt paydown partly offset the adverse impact on credit loan provisions due to deterioration of the U.S. economic outlook. Our additional provisions for credit losses totaled US$80 million, and that compares to US$156 million in the first quarter. And again, like IBCM, these were primarily related to the CECL scenarios with only US$7 million allocated to specific positions. Our expenses increased by 8% predominantly as a result of higher compensation accruals partly offset by certain efficiency measures. With regard to risk-weighted assets, I think you’ve seen that we’ve been successful in reversing a substantial component of the volatility-driven increase that we saw in the first quarter. That was driven by a reversal of the drawdown in corporate lending as well as other mitigating steps to reduce the adverse impact of the March volatility. And with that, I’d like to conclude my part of this presentation and hand back to Thomas. Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, David. I would now like to close the formal part of today’s call by summarizing our overall performance and priorities for 2020 and beyond. Please go to the next slide, Page 40. Thank you. As I stated earlier, our return on tangible equity over the last 6 months was 12% and over the last 12 months was 10.4%, exceeding our pre-COVID ambition of delivering approximately 10% for 2020. The strong results show that our operating model is working even in a challenging market environment and during a time when we built significant credit reserve. Furthermore, we have been able to grow our tangible book value per share, which was over CHF 17 at the end of the second quarter. With that being said and with the organizational changes we announced today, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value, invest in growth, serve our clients and navigate the challenging market environment while driving the sustainability agenda. Thank you all for your attention. I will now hand back to Kinner for the Q&A.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, Thomas and David. So we will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. Operator, let’s open the line, please.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa, Morgan Stanley.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: I’d like to concentrate on your strategy in both of my kind of questions. We know your top-down targets, the return on tangible, 10% to 12%. But could you give us a sense of two things competitively. How do you think about your kind of overall Private Banking business. And let’s take it kind of 3 years out, where would you like to take it? And where do you see that growth acceleration that you have described in the strategic document? What are you thinking about? Is it a combination of an AUM growth, better penetration, revenue growth, financing? You’ve also mentioned ultra-high net worth business. So there was a lot of moving parts. But could you kind of give us a sense holistically where you want that Private Bank of yours to be on a three-year view? And my second question is similar because, of course, we have seen the combination of the global kind of Investment Bank. And when you think about that 10% return on regulatory capital medium term, where is it mostly coming from? Do you see it on the revenue side from the perspective of the 10% line or on the cost side given how you combine the businesses from pretty much three to one?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Magdalena. So on Private Banking, as you saw on one of the slides, that we grew in the first half by 7% on an adjusted basis in an environment which was, frankly, quite hostile and it shows that the Private Banking business as a whole and that Credit Suisse is on a healthy growth trend even in a difficult environment. Now clearly, there are some headwinds, be it on U.S. dollar interest rates, be it in our strong Swiss franc. And clearly, in the current environment, it’s difficult to win new clients as clients are relatively, let’s say, conservative at the moment. But nevertheless, we continue to believe in the overall growth rate of the private banking industry as a whole. And we think that Credit Suisse is extremely well positioned in all three regions, be it Asia, be it EMEA region including Switzerland and be it in Latin America. And we have continued to invest in these businesses, be it through hiring of relationship managers; be it by improving our offering, working together with the Investment Bank; and to be the bank for entrepreneurs in all of these regions. So I have mentioned some of the initiatives like, for example, the establishment of the IFG, International Financing Group, here in Switzerland in IWM, which will incorporate all share-backed lending activities we do in this time zone, including also for institutional clients and for SUB clients. We want to improve also the collaboration of IWM with IBCM and especially for mid-market transactions for entrepreneurs in M&A but even also in the lending space for corporates where we see quite a lot of potential still to tap market share and increase market share. And from that perspective, we continue to target high single-digit revenue growth in our global Private Banking business. On the IB side, your question was how we’re going to integrate this and how we’re going to drive revenues and the 10% return on capital. I mean in order to get to 10% return on capital for the full year, we have to do CHF 1.6 billion PTI. We have now made CHF 1.1 billion in the first 6 months if you take the three areas together, Global Markets, IBCM and APAC Markets. So I’m very confident that we have a good, strong base to work from. I see further growth opportunities in each of the areas, be it in Equities, be it in fixed income, be it in the M&A and underwriting business. Clearly, there are headwinds in the current environment, but we continue to expect volatility, which should generally help our trading business. We continue to see the desire of corporates to refinance themselves in the capital markets, be it in equity capital markets, be it in debt capital markets. So I do think that there continues to be very decent volumes in capital markets. Clearly, M&A will be tough in the second half because announced M&A volumes in the first half is down over 50% globally. I’m talking about Street numbers. And there is a delay, as you know, for M&A revenues. So I think overall Street will have a tough time in the second half in terms of M&A revenues. But at the same time, we see our pipeline growing. We also saw recent announcements of M&A transactions. So from that perspective, I think momentum is building.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Can I just follow up on the Investment Banking side because I – so I understand that this year has been kind of very strong in the first half. So the 10% return on tangible is not really a question for 2020. It was a question for kind of delivering that on a more sustainable level as we kind of look through medium term. And also, by the combination of the businesses, I’m sure that you’re likely to extract some cost savings. And so the question really is how do you think about maybe the operational leverage in that business particularly with that 10% return on tangible in mind more medium term.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. There are definitely some cost synergies by putting the two together especially in the support areas. But the combination of IBCM, Global Markets and APAC Markets is less driven, frankly, by cost consideration, that’s a positive side effect, but it’s more driven by the increased revenue growth opportunities that we see. We, for example, to create a global Equities platform, will help us also with our large institutional clients; or for example, to put together the underwriting business, where we had a 50-50 joint venture, will simplify things. We want to invest in M&A with an asset-light business and we continue to see opportunities there to grow. So overall, we see various areas. We are actually top 6 in 84% of our revenues in Investment Banking, we are in the top six position. So we have concentrated on areas where we are globally competitive. And from that perspective, we are confident to build on the success. You saw we are number one in the first six months in IPOs globally, so strong leveraged finance, strong private equity franchises. So we have a very strong base to work from.\\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann, Autonomous.\\nStefan Stalmann: I have two, please. The first one, going back to the restructuring and the combination of the Investment Banking unit, will this also encompass the advisory, underwriting and financing activities that are currently in APAC Wealth Management, please? And is there any business in APAC Markets that will remain in the APAC division or will it be totally going to the Investment Bank – to the new Investment Banking division? And the second question relates to liquidity. You mentioned the increase of the LCR ratio during the quarter, but it’s really basically back to where it was late in 2019. So from your perspective, have you actually incurred excess cost of liquidity during the second quarter? And if so, is that excess cost still sitting in the Corporate Center or have you allocated it to the divisions?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Stefan. So I will take the first question, and David will take the second question. So if you look at our IB business in Asia, we basically have three areas. One is what we would call the IBCM business in Asia, so M&A and Capital Markets business, which is currently in the segment Wealth Management & Connected, and that will stay 100% part of APAC. And then within the Markets business, you have, on one side, Equities, cash and prime, which will be fully part of the global Equities business, and therefore, fully part of Global Markets but with local reporting lines, obviously. And then you have APAC Solutions, which is now being merged with ITS, which – and will be Global Trading Solution, GTS. Yves-Alain Sommerholder used to run both businesses, so he was spending 50% of his time out of Zurich running ITS and 50% out of his time in Hong Kong running ITS. He now runs both together. So this has been, if you want, already prepared and there will be local reporting lines. There is a revenue-sharing setup in the same way that we have a revenue-sharing arrangement today between Global Markets, SUB and IWM for ITS, and we’ll have the same thing in Asia. So from that perspective, hopefully, that answers your question on the Asia-based Investment Bank.\\nDavid Mathers: Stefan, just on the second point then, so just a few numbers then. So you’re correct, the LCR ratio of 196% is very similar to the LCR ratio of 198% that we had at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. However, due in part to the 1Q events, the net – NCOs are actually higher, CHF 83 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, increased to CHF 104 billion. So in terms of our HQLA position, the CHF 203 billion average actually compares to CHF 165 billion in the end of the fourth quarter of last year. So that just gives the sort of full picture in terms of the liquidity position. And I think we just regard this as a prudent thing to do. It gives us much greater reserves at the central parent entity as well as in our subsidiaries, and it prepares us for whatever stresses we may or may not see in the autumn. In terms of your question about the increased cost to that, there is an increased cost to that. That has predominantly been allocated to divisions, particularly Global Markets and IBCM. So the numbers you see for both of them are actually after the – that increase in costs. There are some costs also sitting in the Corporate Center, not dissimilar, I think, to the CHF 90 million that UBS talked about, and those will be allocated in due course as we actually move forward. But the majority has actually gone out to the markets-based operations already and it’s actually in our run rate number, Stefan.\\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank.\\nBenjamin Goy: Also two questions from my side, please. First, on strategy, when I read Slide 13 correctly on the capital allocation, it should stay broadly the same. But you talked in the midterm basically twice the return in Wealth Management versus the Investment Bank. So just wondering why not you are more ambitious saying three quarters, 1 quarter or even 80/20, really thinking out a couple of years down the line. And then the second question following up on net interest income. To some extent, in APAC and IWM, I guess, the U.S. dollar pressure is clearly visible on the U.S. interest rates. Just wondering whether you have seen most of it or is there more to come in Q3, Q4 in terms of pressure. Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Benjamin. I will take the first question again and David will take the second question. Yes. Look, the – our business model, as we said numerous times, is to be a global leader in Wealth Management with strong Investment Banking capabilities. And it’s very clear that based on these two fundamentals, we need to have the appropriate capital allocation. So to have a strong investment bank helps us directly and indirectly with our entrepreneur clients. And if you want to advise an entrepreneur around his private wealth, he usually wants to talk first about his company and how he can grow it and how he can make acquisition and how he can finance it and potentially make an IPO or whatever. So you need to have strong investment banking capabilities to holistically advise entrepreneurs, and that’s why it’s very important we maintain a minimum size in there. And a lot of the revenues that we’re actually making in Private Banking and profitability, we are making because we have a strong investment bank, global investment bank. And I think with the 10% target returns, which we see as a minimum for the Investment Banking business, we have a realistic number to support that business. It’s above our cost of capital in the long term. And from that perspective, we think that’s the right mix. There will also be, as you know, over the coming years, certain changes in Basel III RWA modeling around the FRTB, for example, and that will increase obviously the RWAs especially on the Investment Banking side and that’s why we have taken this approach. And obviously, you also have to look at it not only from an RWA perspective, but also from a leverage perspective where today we are above 1/3. And that’s why on a mid-to long-term approach, the 1/3, 2/3 is the right mix for us.\\nDavid Mathers: So I think in terms of net interest income guidance, actually – I’ve not actually been asked this question since the Investor Day back in December, so I think you may recall at that point, we indicated that as a combination of the dollarization of our operational risk RWA plus the measures we were taking here in Switzerland, that we expected our net interest income to be higher by about CHF 250 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Now a lot’s happened in the last six months and particularly the move in U.S. dollar rates. But it’s – I would still expect our net interest income to be up by about CHF 100 million in 2020 compared to 2019. It’s a combination of those measures. And you know the exemption threshold at the SNB is also – was actually increased in the first quarter. But the benefit for that will be almost entirely in the Swiss Universal bank because you are obviously seeing the adverse impact of lower dollar rates on an NII basis in both IWM and in APAC. And I would caution that you would see further pressure on net interest income in 2021 if interest rates remain at this level as the various swaps and structures that we put in place with the dollarization begin to roll off towards the end of 2021. So that’s – I hope that’s helpful in terms of the guidance. Much more resilient here in Switzerland, less so elsewhere, although clearly the reported net interest income numbers will also depend on our loan activity over the course of the next year or so.\\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.\\nAndrew Coombs: Perhaps just a follow-up on some of the gross margins. Notably, actually Asia Pacific, the Private Banking gross margin within that dropped down to 79, part of that’s normalization and transaction activity. There’s a big drop in fee and recurring income. So if you could just elaborate a bit more on what’s driving that, please, as well. And then secondly, on the costs, you’re guiding to CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion for 2020. You’re then talking about this CHF 400 million of cost saves. Can I just check, is that CHF 400 million of cost saves relative to the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion target this year? And is that a net reduction target? Or is that prior to reinvestment spend?\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much. I mean I think looking at different components, clearly, if we’re talking about the APAC PB business, you have seen the similar pressure that we saw in IWM from the weakness of dollar and dollar-linked currencies against the Swiss franc. I mean just to remind you, we were actually trading at parity against the U.S. dollar a year ago and latest rate is, I think, somewhere between 0.93 and 0.94 today, which is quite a material move. And not relevant for APAC, but I mean, if you look to the Brazilian real, it’s down about 30% against the year. So there’s a lot of currency moves. And I would just remind you, we obviously report in Swiss francs, not in U.S. dollars. And that does have an impact on our APAC PB businesses across the line. In terms of the specific line items, the pressure you’re talking about in terms of recurring activity in APAC was actually linked to some of the insurance products that we actually sell in Asia Pacific and that’s what caused the slowdown in the second quarter. It wasn’t anything beyond that.\\nAndrew Coombs: Okay. And on cost?\\nDavid Mathers: Sorry. On costs, your second question, well, I think we’ve probably summarized it already, which is we do remain committed to achieving our 2% to 3% productivity savings each year. The measures that we’ve announced today should generate about CHF 400 million of cost saves, which we will see during 2021 and realized in full by 2022. But I think the question is how much we actually let drop through to the bottom line for that will depend critically on the markets we actually see over the next six to 12 months. Clearly, if conditions remain difficult, if we see a further economic slowdown, then I think the pace of reinvestment is going to be extremely limited. If, on the other hand, we continue to see a gentle recovery in economic activity, then I would expect to allow a much higher level of reinvestment of that CHF 400 million number. So I mean that’s why I’ve given guidance for this year of a range of between CHF 16 billion and CHF 16.5 billion because I think there is considerable uncertainty over the next six months. And clearly, part of the rationale and the reasoning for taking these measures is to actually drive further efficiency measures and to give us greater flexibility either to reduce our costs or to free up resources for growth elsewhere. We need to be nimble in the face of this environment.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher, UBS.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: Yes. Just two smaller numbers question and then again on costs. In CIC, the Swiss business, risk costs were basically close to 0, CHF 2 million, I believe. Can you just talk about what you’re seeing domestically with the corporates and how’s the quality outlook there and how we should think about that going forward? And then in IWM transaction-based revenues were again relatively soft at least versus my expectation in the second quarter. If you could just talk about what is happening there and what the outlook is. I remember there were some headwinds in the first quarter regarding unrealized losses, CHF 101 million, whether there was something similar in the second quarter. Sorry. And just on the cost saves, I mean that the targets overall, they look relatively similar to what you had previously, but you seem to require restructuring charges now to deliver these cost targets. So has the nature of the cost saves changed versus previously? Or why do you need now those cost restructuring charges to deliver those cost saves.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. So let me start with maybe the Swiss business, which I still know very well from our previous side and then maybe we’ll talk about IWM and the overall cost targets. So on CIC, as you see on Page 44, in the first quarter, we actually provisioned CHF 112 million in the first quarter, CHF 86 million CECL related and CHF 26 million specific. And the second quarter, we had CHF 11 million specific, but we had a reversal of CHF 9 million in CECL based on an update we’ve done on our economic assumptions, which actually slightly improved for Switzerland. So overall, if you take it together, we have CHF 114 million provision in the first half. For our corporate business, it’s actually still a pretty big number. So – and anecdotally, when I speak to our Head of Corporate Banking, be it on the large risk corporate side, be it on the SME side, we feel that our clients are overall feeling extremely well with the crisis. Clearly, there is pressure points and there are certain areas where our corporate clients or certain sectors, especially in tourism and in other areas where they are challenged, but we feel relatively comfortable with where we are year-to-date on that side. And maybe, David, you want to take the IWM and cost target question?\\nDavid Mathers: Yes. I mean I think in terms of the transaction revenues for IWM, I think two points. Firstly, the point we’ve made already around the moves against these currencies. I mean 30% for the Brazilian real, and that’s an important part of the IWM business. I mean I think, let’s not overlook, that’s a big move. 6% in the U.S. dollar, these actually do depress our reported transaction revenues when you actually look at the numbers in Swiss francs. But I would also note, which might be helpful, that we did see about a CHF 21 million loss in respect of hedging of certain derivative positions in IWM, which we have noted in general terms in the MD&A. So that’s probably the other factor in there. So that might help you, Daniele, in terms of the models. And that basically just relates to the moves in credit spreads in the second quarter compared to previous periods. I think you asked a question around CHF 101 million, I think. That was actually in Asset Management, not in the PB side basically. So that was an AM issue, not the PB side. We have disclosed we’ve seen a write-back of about CHF 20 million of that CHF 100 million in the second quarter, but that’s clearly the other subdivision from IWM PB, if that helps. I think on the more general point around costs, I mean I think there’s a few points to make. Firstly, Credit Suisse does have, I think, a very good track record in terms of delivering cost saves. We delivered over CHF 4.2 billion through our committed program. And that program is very much ongoing in terms of what we’re actually doing today. Secondly, we’re not changing our targets for return on tangible equity. We’re not moving back from reported to adjusted or anything like that. The key metric for the bank remains the reported metrics. What we do have though is, as a consequence of the measures that Thomas has announced this morning, we will see a slight step-up in terms of those restructuring costs that ordinarily we just let flow through our P&L. And therefore, the reason why we’re disclosing it today is just so you know that is coming and to make clear that essentially we will be giving that disclosure going forward. But our numbers remain measured on a reported basis. But as we’re taking these bigger steps, essentially, in the interest of transparency, we wanted to let you know that there will be a slight step-up in these costs, which otherwise would actually flow through our P&L without requiring disclosure. So it’s more of a disclosure point in terms of this. We’re not going back to some kind of adjusted type metric in terms of how we actually judge ourselves. It’s clearly part of the ongoing measures we’re actually taking. And I think that’s the kind of key point. You should see it more as how we basically double down on our existing strengths across our business and give ourselves some more cost flexibility going forward.\\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim, Societe Generale. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nAndrew Lim: So I guess with regards to strategy, management has to balance out the benefits of having a local focus versus a centralized focus. So obviously, with IB, you’ve gone down the centralized route and merged a lot of the disparate geographic functions. But with Wealth Management, you still remained local, which is completely the opposite of a peer of yours. So I’m just wondering what your thoughts of that in terms of doing something with the consolidation of your global Wealth Management functions. And then, secondly, obviously, you benefited on the CET1 ratio with credit drawdowns being repaid back. Just wondering if that has any follow-through into the year, the third quarter or are we mostly done in there?\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. I’ll take the first one, Andrew, and the second one for David. So as I said in the presentation, we are convinced that a regional approach within our Wealth Management is the right approach. So we have empowered executives in Asia, in the SUB for Switzerland, in IWM and even within those divisions than we have on the N-2 levels, people in charge for various subregions or sub-businesses in Switzerland, for example, for premium clients and then for the non-premium clients business. So we very much believe in this regionalization empowering. And the Private Banking business is a local business, is a regional business and it’s quite different from the Investment Banking business, which is a global trading, underwriting and advisory business built on strong infrastructure, et cetera. So we very much believe that this is the right approach. And as I also mentioned earlier, at the time when Global Markets and IBCM were split, that was really to fix the Global Markets business. We had too much capital, too much risk-weighted assets in that area. We reduced the risk. And we want to protect the IBCM business. We did do that in the restructuring phase. And this is the right thing now to do to put the global Investment Bank back together. And from that perspective, it’s a natural step. But I definitely would never want to go to a global wealth management structure.\\nDavid Mathers: Okay. I think your second question then was more of a numbers question in terms of the reversal of the credit drawdowns that we saw in March. I think the answer to that is we’ve only seen a partial repayment of the credit facility drawdown that we saw in the first quarter. So I would assume that if conditions continue to normalize and given the continued levels of central bank intervention in debt markets, that we should see further payback of facilities as we actually go through the rest of this year. But no, it is not fair to say that we’ve seen the full extent of that reversal as yet. And I guess to that extent, therefore, it does remain a benefit in terms of our overall credit exposures to see.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee, Exane. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nJeremy Sigee: Firstly, could I just pick up on that previous comment you made about capital movements looking out into 3Q and 4Q? So you said that you could get more repayment of drawdowns. Could you just walk us through any other sort of moving parts that you expect? I think there’s a little bit more RWA inflation still to come through. But if you could just sort of walk us through what you think the major moving parts are potentially on capital in 3Q and 4Q, and in particular, what the risk is of the ratio slipping back to the 12% or lower levels, that would be very helpful. And then, secondly, a sort of briefer question. You mentioned hoping to review share buybacks at the end of November. And I just wondered whether you have any indications from your regulators whether that’s going to be politically acceptable at that point, whether you have any indications of that or whether it’s just still wait and see.\\nDavid Mathers: Okay. Well, thanks very much, Jeremy. Let me take the first one. So in terms of RWA movements for the second half, I think the – there are probably three points I’d want to make. Firstly, we still do have the phase-in of the SA-CCR reform here in Switzerland. So that’s another CHF 3 billion in the third quarter and another CHF 3 billion in the fourth quarter, but I think you know about that. Second point, I think it is important to point this out, that the inflation of risk-weighted assets that resulted from the volatility in March is still largely in the system and in our numbers and it will probably take another year or so for that to be completely amortized out. It doesn’t just drop out in one quarter or two quarters. So we will see, though, if volatility remains at these sorts of levels, some reduction in RWA in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and then into 2021 from that, and that is likely to be the order of – similar sort of order of magnitude, say, CHF 3 billion to CHF 4 billion type magnitude. The third component then is ratings migrations. We did see some increase in RWA in the very low billions from rating migrations in the second quarter. And we may see some further rating migrations in the third quarter, although that clearly will depend on the credit environment which we actually operate. Now just to be clear, Jeremy, so if you add all that up, David is telling me that there is going to be some benefit because I would expect, honestly, at this point, the volatility gain to exceed the ratings migration plus you have the SA-CCR effect, why are we guiding to 12%. And I think the answer is that is intended as a conservative guidance and a reinstatement of what we actually said at the end of 2012. There’s nothing more you should read into that. I think we – I think the key message you should take away from this presentation is preparedness. We do not really know what level of infection we’re going to see in the second half, how governments will choose to respond to that in terms of either lockdowns or extension of state measures or anything else. And therefore, I think being conservative on our capital guidance is the right thing to do. But I think I’ve given you the numbers. There’s nothing else there to read into it in terms of that and that’s why we went back to the 12% number, but it is intended as, I think, a conservative guidance looking forward on our CET1 ratio. I think on the share buyback comment, I would merely say that we informed both the FINMA and all of the core college regulators of everything we’ve said today in advance. So I think our regulators are fully informed of this. I’m sure, basically, we’ll have further discussions with them as we actually go through the preparations for the EGM on the 27th of November and everything else we say there afterwards. But this has obviously been made in the full cognizance of FINMA and the core college.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. I think the question was not only about share buyback and about dividends. And I think we have an excellent relationship with our regulator, and we were not forced to do the first half dividend split, but we – this was a result of constructive discussions and we agreed together with a couple of other banks to do it this way, to look at how second quarter and third quarter are developing. There are other banks in Switzerland that did pay the full dividend and this was the result of very constructive discussions. We have now a situation where we have not only confirmed first quarter, but actually improved on the first quarter in terms of pretax income and profitability. The overall situation is much more stable, so it’s a very constructive dialogue and we don’t have any indications that there are any issues with us paying that second half dividend. In any event, this is the decision by the shareholders.\\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nKian Abouhossein: The first question is regarding the Global Market trading environment. I was wondering if you – I’ve seen your statement, but I was wondering if you could maybe share a little bit more color in terms of your credit business, in particular, how that’s doing in July, but also how you see the second half developing considering we have seen a superb environment clearly in the second quarter and how you’re thinking through the year, which would help us immensely. And in that context, your staff numbers have gone up in Global Markets 9% year-on-year. Just wondering if you could comment what that is related to. The second question is on your overall Wealth Management business especially Asia, if you could talk a little bit about cash balances, where we stand, how they have developed, and in that context, how the client behavior is and what you’re expecting in terms of transactions.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Kian. So generally, July numbers have started reasonably. As you would expect, there’s a certain seasonable slowdown anyway that you have every year. Clearly, the volumes are not at the level that we had, to a large part, in the second quarter, but we are actually satisfied with the start generally in Global Markets in the third quarter. And that is also true for the credit trading. Staff up in GM, I will have to refer to David, but I just want to make a general comment on staff. I mean staff is up globally over the last 12 months and that’s also a result of our disciplined approach of not having engaged on any structural initiatives in the first half of this year, and clearly, generally, in the industry, a lower turnover, if you want, of staff generally.\\nDavid Mathers: Yes. And I think, specifically, I think we referred to this, I think, a couple of quarters ago. We’ve actually done a significant amount of in-sourcing both in IT and in our HR functions. So what you’re seeing there is the allocated component of that flowing through to GM in respect to their use of corporate functions. I think I’d also point out, I mean, those costs – or those heads are almost entirely in our lower cost operations, particularly in India. They’re not an increase in staff in some of the higher cost locations. So that’s what’s actually driving that. I think your second question, Kian, was actually around cash balances, so I’ll just give you a few numbers. I mean it has something in common with other things we’ve seen, which is they’ve fallen but they’re still not back to where they were pre-COVID. So at this point, basically, in terms of PB AUM, it’s running at 30%, is actually wholly in money market liquidity. That compares to 32% at the end of the first quarter but basically also compares to 28% in the second half of 2019. So as you see, generally speaking, there has been some drop in cash balances but not back to the levels we saw before. I think you asked specifically about Asia. Asian cash balances are actually around 25%. But the same comment applies basically. It was 27% basically because they dropped back somewhat and that’s kind of true across our Wealth Management businesses. So reduced, but not by any means back to pre-COVID-19 levels.\\nKian Abouhossein: That’s super helpful. May I just ask also on transaction margins or transaction activity, I should say within the Asian client base, in particular, do you see any trend changes?\\nDavid Mathers: I think it’s – I mean it’s definitely been resilient and that’s continued so far in July. I mean I think Asia Wealth Management is probably one of our strongest transactional areas so far this quarter.\\nThomas Gottstein: Absolutely. It’s – of all the three regions, it’s the strongest start also the third quarter is in Asia.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Piers Brown, HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nPiers Brown: Yes. I’ve just got a couple left. The first one is just sort of on a different angle in terms of the earlier question on the regulatory dialogue. I wonder if you could just share some color on what sort of regulatory dialogue you may have had on the strategy change and whether there’s anything in there which might change any of the resolvability rebates in terms of the FINMA capital requirements. That’s the first question. And then the second question is a short one in terms of the timing for booking the CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million restructuring charges. Should we think about being more or less front-loaded into the next couple of quarters? Or what sort of timing should we be thinking about for modeling those charges?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Piers. I will take again the first question and David will take the second. So of course, we discussed with our regulator and not only here in Switzerland, but also with our U.S. and UK regulators the plan changes and they were very supportive. And those regulatory changes actually were totally independent on any capital discussions which we’re also having. But as you know, during the last two quarters, the Swiss approach was to actually get less forbearance than probably some of our European neighboring countries benefited. Quite the contrary, we continue to have, for example, the increase in SA-CCR CHF 3 billion per quarter during this year. So the discussions we are having with the regulator are very constructive and we’re very constructive and allowed us also to make this announcement today about those organizational changes.\\nDavid Mathers: Yes. I think in terms of two points really. One, did it make any impact on resolvability? No, there’s been no change in any of the resolvability assessments for Credit Suisse. So no comment, no point – no change in that. One point, which I think Thomas alluded to, which relates to regulatory capital relief, which I think has obviously been much more limited in Switzerland than it has been elsewhere, one point I should make, and this is coming back, I think, Jeremy, if you’re still on, to the question you had about capital ratios. We did decide not to take a CHF 3 billion procyclical relief at the end of the second quarter because the volatility had actually dropped so much in the second quarter. So I guess, Jeremy, there’s probably CHF 3 billion of RWA move there, which I should just complete on. But we took that out because, frankly, this isn’t the volatility in the market to actually justify it. So as Thomas said, there’s not a great deal of regulatory relief in terms of these numbers in terms of our RWA numbers, so just to be very clear on that point. I think your second question then was actually around the time and restructuring costs. I would expect them to be accrued relatively evenly over the course of the next four quarters with the cost savings to flow through pretty much on a three to six month lag as we actually complete those measures. I just would reiterate, the reason we’re giving you visibility on this restructuring cost issue is just so you have transparency. The metrics remain reported. But I think it’ll make it easier in subsequent quarters when we actually break that out in the MDA to know that this is what we’re actually telling you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jernej Omahen, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nJernej Omahen: I just have two questions left actually. The first one is on Page 15 when you talk about putting the various parts of the Investment Bank back together. And I think, Thomas, you outlined nicely why it was important to kind of ring-fence the various parts back in 2015. I just want to ask you one question. So you say here that reconstituting the Investment Bank is going to allow you to do a number of things, one of them is a more dynamic capital allocation. I was just wondering if you can actually contextualize this for us. What does that actually mean, right? Or a question put differently, what will Credit Suisse be able to do under the new structure that it’s not able to do today? And then the second question I have is on Page 18. So you lay out your new targets. But when we look at these targets, so you got a return on tangible of 10% to 12% and you’re at 12% today and 10% over the past 4 quarters; core Tier 1 of 12%, you’re above that; and core Tier 1 leverage of 4%, you’re above that. So I was just wondering, I mean, how should we think about the level of ambition that’s embedded in these targets? Or are you trying to tell us that the group is over-earning today and there’s going to be significant headwinds? I mean what makes this RoTE target of 10% to 12% ambitious or difficult to achieve?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Jernej, for these two questions. So the dynamic capital allocation was not always so easy between IBCM on one side, Global Markets on the other then APAC Markets as a third component. The way we manage RWA, we have year-end targets, but we also have quarterly updates. And the way we have to manage it depends also very much on the overall market environment. There are times when the primary business is very strong and we want to allocate more business – more RWA to the primary business and there are times where the primary business is not very strong and we want to allocate more to the trading business, and that type of flexibility was much more difficult when you have two separate divisions. And now we have it as one division, so that will allow us to be more nimble and more, frankly, able to take faster decisions along the markets. And the RoTE question and the target question, it’s very clear that in some areas, we are above those, but RoTE last 12 months is 10.4%. We said at the Investor Day last year, we want to be 10% for 2020, and then 2021, 2022, 11% to 12%. And that was obviously before COVID. We have now, in my perspective, in my humble opinion, proven that our model works actually very well also in a financial crisis. And the ambition clearly is to still go to the 11% to 12% range, as we said at the Investor Day, and we are now at 10.4% on a rolling four-quarter basis. So we want to continue to improve. And the CET1 ratio around 12%, we just want to give ourselves a certain cushion and a certain flexibility also because you do not really – you cannot really plan that well in a COVID-19 environment in the short term. And in the mid to long term, we have FRTB. But our view through the cycle is for a business like Crédit Suisse, a 12% CET1 ratio is about right; and CET1 leverage ratio of 4%, which basically tells you a roughly 33% risk density which is more or less where we will operate on, so I think that’s the reason why we have those targets.\\nDavid Mathers: Yes. I mean I think just to reinforce what Thomas has said, I think we are being cautious and we’re being conservative in this. We discussed the CET1 ratio. Thomas has gone through the RoTE ratios. And you can – obviously, we’re talking about how we basically accelerate some of the measures we talked overall in terms of cost savings, or for that matter, doubling down with the expansion of ITS to form GTS. I think that’s – but I think that’s appropriate in terms of where we are amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We have high levels of liquidity as well. Now I think, as I said, if we see a continued gentle recovery, then I think that will position Credit Suisse phenomenally well with this degree of preparedness to actually run off some of those excesses and to reinvest into the business. On the other hand, clearly, if we see a significant slowdown again for whatever reason in the autumn, then I think we’re very well prepared to withstand that as well. And I think that’s the appropriate place for us to be. And I think speaking where we are now halfway through the year, I think we need to be cautious and balanced in terms of what we’re saying. But there’s nothing that we’re seeing that you’re not seeing.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen, Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nAnke Reingen: I just had a follow-up question on the CHF 400 million of cost savings. Just to confirm, they are on top of your 2% to 3% annual efficiency gains you are planning. And would it be fair to conclude that considering the CHF 400 million, we should be looking at a flattish cost corridor versus the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion in 2020? And then relative to previous indications, you have given us the cost sensitivity and the RoTE. But is it fair to say if you’re closer to the 10% RoTE, more of the CHF 400 million cost savings would come through to the bottom line – to the net line; and the higher end, it’s probably going to be absorbed?\\nDavid Mathers: I mean I think it’s fair enough in this sense we obviously are still very much committed to our 3% saves for 2020 compared to 2019, and that’s part of our book of work. This clearly gives us the ability to extend those saves into 2021 and into 2022 together with everything else we’re actually doing. And therefore, it gives us the ability to very much remain in that type of cost corridor. But I think we’ll probably be able to give you greater guidance towards the end of the year as we see how the environment actually shapes up because, quite clearly, I think we are going to see business opportunities at Crédit Suisse probably in Wealth Management as a consequence of the stressed environment we’re actually seeing and I think we need to be prepared to take advantage of that, and I don’t think we’d rule that out in terms of our steps going forward. But it’s about giving ourselves the flexibility to do that. Quite clearly, if things are difficult, then the cost measures give us that cushion. I don’t think I’d mechanically link it to 10% to 12% type thing. I think that’s a little bit too granular in terms of how we think. But clearly, directionally correct to the extent to which we see things more difficult, we allow the cost saves to drop to the bottom line. To the extent we see things lesser, then we’ll actually choose to make reinvestment decisions.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. Or put it in other words, I very much believe in the concept of self-funding growth. And what we are doing here is allowing us to self-fund our growth initiatives that we have globally. And if you just think, for example, the build-out in China for our onshore banking, those will be significant investments; if you think about our digitalization efforts, about our sustainability efforts, about what Philipp Wehle wants to achieve in the various regions in IWM in terms of investments, et cetera. So this is really about – more about self-funding growth investments than just cost cutting.\\nAnke Reingen: And just to confirm, the CHF 400 million comes on top of the 2% to 3% per year?\\nDavid Mathers: Well, just to be clear, what I said is we’re committed to 3% for 2020 compared to 2019. We also said the CHF 400 million comes through only in full in 2022. So it will be clearly part of our 2021 and 2022 plan. So yes, I’ll leave you to make your own model basically, but I think it gives us the momentum to continue what we’re doing right through into 2022 now.\\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Amit Goel from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nAmit Goel: So two questions. I mean maybe they are a little bit of a follow-up on what’s been said a bit before. But so just in terms of the overall profitability and the kind of 10% to 12%, so when I’m looking at the kind of the broader businesses and so with 2/3 of the group targeting the kind of 20% return on regulatory capital and then 1/3 at 10%, am I to assume then that either there’s obviously maybe some conservatism or Corporate Center and/or ongoing kind of non-core-type impact? Just trying to reconcile the two parts. Obviously, I appreciate there’s a difference between reg cap and seen out, but clearly, there’s still a bit of a differential there. And a second question, again, just on the cost savings and just the broader strategy you’ve kind of reached out for, in particular, on the IB. Just trying to understand, I mean, I guess, over the last three years since 2015 when the business was kind of split into the various parts, that kind of helped to drive better productivity and profitability and some of the cost reduction we’ve seen to date. Just curious in terms of going back to that combined structure, is there also some potential offsets or costs in terms of productivity, et cetera, that we should also be aware of?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you. Yes, of course, if you take the 2/3 at 20% and 1/3 at 10% gives you more than 12%, but yes, there is the Corporate Center that you have to factor in as a reduction. And whether it’s conservative or not, we are above these numbers at the moment. That’s clear. You saw that if you look at the four divisions, but at the same time, these are realistic ambitions, in my view. And I will obviously push Brian and the team to be above, 10.01%, maybe more like 11%, 12% or 13% in that area. And I know he has that ambition. And there are certain areas within the three Private Banking divisions where 20% is probably at the low end, like IWM, but typically operates more at the mid-20s in terms of returns, whereas in Switzerland, high teens. But that there are some differentiations within that as well. But I think that’s an illustration how we think about the business. The Private Banking business, clearly higher return, higher growth; the Investment Banking business providing us the scale and the capabilities. And in periods like we saw now in the first half, also very good diversification as we saw. If you compare our results with some of the pure-play private banks here in Switzerland, clearly, you see the benefit of having an integrated model. As far as the IB reshuffle dis-synergies are concerned, I don’t really see any. I only see synergies.\\nDavid Mathers: Just a few detailed numbers, I mean. Just firstly, just in terms of completing the maths on the Corporate Center, we’ve not been asked about the Corporate Center, basically, but I think you will have noted the Corporate Center number was, I think, higher than consensus. So I think there’s two points to note in there. One, there was just short of CHF 90 million of provisions in respect of legacy litigation issues associated with the former SRU, which, as you know, is now booked as part of the ARU within the Corporate Center. And two, we’ve obviously seen some snapback in terms of the volatility we saw in the first quarter. So actually, net-net, if you actually strip out the CHF 85 million, US$90 million, plus about CHF 150 million of volatility, you’ll see the Corporate Center is actually running just under the CHF 250 million guidance for ex vol and ex litigation Corporate Center numbers. So just to give you some context there. So I just would perhaps helpfully guide you to the Corporate Center. It’s – I would still expect it to be in the range of CHF 225 million to CHF 250 million per quarter ex volatility and ex litigation. So that’s just one factor. But the other factor clearly is we’re obviously talking about return on tangible equity. We’re not talking about return on CET1, as I think you know. But there is that material difference. I mean the tangible equity is just under CHF 42 billion at the end of the second quarter whereas our CET1 is only about CHF 37.3 billion. So there’s about 11%, 12% of the tangible equity, which is not effective in terms of capital utilization. So if you’re comparing the two, basically, that’s the difference, as you said, between the return on regulatory capital and return on that. So the CC and that has been the two factors there. So hopefully, those numbers are of some use.\\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our last question and the question comes from the line of Adam Terelak, Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nAdam Terelak: I just wanted to follow up on the cost again. Does that mean that we could end up below CHF 16 billion in a more challenging environment? So clearly, the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion has a decent comp accrual in it. Take that out and then add the 2% to 3% savings and CHF 400 million, does that mean that the look-forward in a very more challenging environment could end up below that level? And then, secondly, I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the capital return policy. Are you saying distribute a little bit more than 50%? Previously, you’ve given us three buckets being capital return, some that regards regulation and then another chunk to be deployed into the businesses. I just want to know how you’re thinking about that and whether – what sort of growth opportunities do you see in terms of loan growth or other areas to deploy the balance sheet going forward.\\nDavid Mathers: Well, just on the cost progression, and again, I’ll try and be helpful, Adam, just in terms of some numbers, really. The first thing, and I did indicate this in my prepared comments, you have seen significant own credit-related volatility in the expenses between both the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter 2019, but more so between the first quarter and the second quarter. Remember, we had a gain in the Corporate Center as a consequence of the credit spread widening. And we’ve obviously seen that snapback basically in the second quarter. So if the first quarter costs, and we did disclose this at the time, was helped by own credit spreads, the second quarter clearly is harmed by it, so – just to be clear on that. And we talked about CHF 58 million on a 2Q year-on-year change number, but the number obviously between the second quarter and first quarter is actually substantially higher than that because we had an opposite credit in terms of that number. I think, quite clearly, in a very challenging market, our cost would be below CHF 16 billion, but it would be a very challenging market given we’re halfway through the year. But obviously, if we were to see a particularly bleak second half environment, the fact that we’ve taken a conservative approach in terms of our compensation accruals does position us better than the other way around would be as we look forward to the end of the year. But we’ll see where we go from there basically. Your second question was on capital return, I believe. Look, I think we’re standing by our existing guidance. I think at that point, that does mean we assume that FRTB comes in 2023 and we have some capital need in respect of that. I think at this point, that’s all I can really say. I think it’s quite possible that we will see the European Union potentially draw back on FRTB and some of the other Basel III reforms, possibly phasing and things like that. And generally, the Swiss approach has been to align to the European Union. But I think, again, speaking where we are now in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I think you should just say we’re assuming no change in terms of the mix as we stand today, but we’ll see how the situation develops over the course of the next six months to a year.\\nAdam Terelak: But are you still sticking by the comment on Swiss gold-plating on operational risk?\\nDavid Mathers: Which comment was that exactly, Adam?\\nAdam Terelak: Heading into the Basel III finalization, there was some confidence that there may be – that the Swiss would gold-plate already on operational risk and that you’d have some flexibility to maybe absorb the FRTB as an offset not with CMD.\\nDavid Mathers: Yes. Not a word I’d personally use, but it’s certainly true that Switzerland has taken a much more conservative approach to operational risk calibration than particularly the rest of the EU, which – where, generally, you will see that operational risk RWA as percentage of the total is a much lower part than it is for Switzerland. So Switzerland, I think, is probably more akin to the United States. And I think you have seen some rollback in the United States some of the operational risk assets. So definitely compared to EU, yes, I think you’re right and we’ll see how that develops. But I’ll be candid, I think the COVID-19 pandemic and everything else has put some of the regulatory debate around these issues somewhat on hold.\\nKinner Lakhani: Excellent. Well, thank you all for your time and your questions this morning. Thank you, Thomas and David. Of course, if you do have any further questions, feel free to contact IR. Thank you.\\nOperator: That concludes today’s conference call for analysts and investors. A recording of the presentation will be available about two hours after the event. The telephone replay function will be available for 10 days. Thank you for joining today’s call. You may all disconnect.\",\n","  'transcript_split': [{'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': 'Good morning. Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone. Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion, we refer you to the Credit Suisse second quarter 2020 financial report, other published materials and the accompanying financial statements for the period published this morning. I will now hand you over to Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run you through the numbers and strategic initiatives.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Kinner. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our second quarter 2020 results, my first full quarter since becoming Group CEO on the 14th of February. Before I start with the slide presentation, allow me to make a few remarks. Our first priority was and remains the safety and well-being of our employees, clients and communities in which we operate around the world. I want to thank all our roughly 48,000 employees for what they have achieved over the last few months in very difficult circumstances as evidenced by our second quarter 2020 figures today showing the highest second quarter net income attributable to shareholders in a decade and double-digit return on tangible equity. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Executive Board and on the Board of Directors for their partnership, which allowed us to deliver on our primary objective: providing solutions to our clients around the world and helping them navigate extremely volatile markets amid intense economic uncertainty. Let me now take you through the slide presentation. Today, I will take you through some of the highlights of the second quarter 2020 and then explain the strategic initiatives we announced earlier today to improve effectiveness and generate efficiencies for further investments in digitalization as well as to accelerate growth as a leading wealth manager with strong global investment banking capabilities. Let’s turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we generated CHF 1.6 billion in pretax income, up 19% year-on-year, and CHF 1.2 billion of net income attributable to shareholders, up 24% year-on-year and the highest second quarter result in a decade. Our second quarter growth was supported by 11% year-on-year growth in revenues with a strong contribution from our Global Markets, Investment Banking and APAC Market franchises and solid performances in our Private Banking businesses. The increase in net income for the group was achieved despite adding CHF 296 million in additional provision for credit losses last quarter for a total of CHF 864 million for the first half of the year. Our total allowance for credit losses on our balance sheet was CHF 2 billion as of the end of the second quarter, of which over 1/2 was non-specific reserves including CECL. As you know, the U.S. GAAP CECL approach to provisioning leads to earlier recognition of potential credit losses. It’s worth noting that 84% of our loan book is collateralized, and the Swiss Universal Bank accounts for almost 60% of our loans. Our home market, Switzerland, has a strong track record of historically low credit loss experience versus other regions. As our total operating expenses in the second quarter rose 2% year-on-year, we reported our 15th straight quarter of operating leverage. We are expecting CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion of adjusted total operating expenses for the full year 2020 depending on market and economic conditions. We delivered a strong RoTE of 11% in the second quarter, 12% over the first six months of 2020 and 10.4% in the last 12 months. Our balance sheet is the strongest it has been for many years. Our CET1 ratio increased from 12.1% in the first quarter to 12.5% in the second quarter, and our CET1 leverage ratio increased from 4.2% to 4.5%. We also maintained a strong liquidity position with one of the highest liquidity coverage ratios amongst international peers at an average LCR of 196% for the second quarter, up from 182% in the first quarter. We are building on the success of our strategy and intend to continue to allocate the majority of our capital into wealth management going forward. We are also optimizing our model, which is expected to capture new growth opportunities by creating one global investment bank, combining our risk and compliance functions and creating a new Executive Board-level function, Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions or SRI. I will provide details on each of these shortly. Finally, our Board of Directors intends to propose to the shareholders the second half of the 2019 dividend at an Extraordinary General Meeting on November 27, 2020. Subsequent to the EGM, the Board intends to review the share buyback program. Both the dividend and the buyback are subject to market and economic conditions. Slide 6, please. As I mentioned earlier, our results today are a testament to the hard work and resilience of our employees and commitment to our clients. At Credit Suisse, roughly 90% of our staff were enabled to work remotely at the height of the pandemic, and currently, around 80% are still working from home. Free antibody testing is being offered in our home market, Switzerland, where we first launched the offer, and a global rollout of the program is being prepared. Our roughly 48,000 employees have been successfully supporting our clients. We leveraged technology and digitalization to deliver solutions, and we ensured strong technology-driven private banking engagement and high-volume execution across fixed income and equities. As a global bank, operating in over 50 countries, we showed our commitment to our communities. In this context, I would like to commend the Swiss government and other domestic public authorities for a rapid and robust response to the pandemic. This has cushioned the economic effects, and thus far, allowed the public here in Switzerland to return to many aspects of their normal lives while maintaining heightened vigilance. Working with the government and other authorities, we were able to design a CHF 20 billion loan guarantee program to small-and medium-sized companies that got money into the hands of main street-type businesses within days of the national emergency being declared in March. We are proud at Credit Suisse to have played an early role in helping to establish this program, which played to many of the strengths of the Swiss economy. We stand ready to work with the public sector as needed in the coming months. Finally, our employees responded with significant charitable contributions, including to charities working to alleviate the impact of COVID-19, and support those segments of society that are most heavily affected by its economic effects, which were matched by the bank. Over a period of about two months, we raised CHF 25 million through this initiative, the most on record for a charity fundraising program at Credit Suisse. And this money was distributed globally. I will now go into our key results in greater detail, Slide 7. This page shows the financial highlights for the quarter. I covered the key group numbers on the left side of this page already in my introduction. Our divisional results, depicted on the right side of this page, highlight the breadth of our strong performance. Each of our divisions generated strong returns on regulatory capital between 17% and 24%. Next slide, please. Over the last five years, we have steadily grown our return on tangible equity, averaging 12% in the first half of the year amid a challenging market environment. This is the upper end of our medium-term ambition of delivering an RoTE of 10% to 12% in a normalized environment, subject to market conditions and economic conditions. For the first half of the year, we achieved CHF 2.5 billion in net income attributable to shareholders, as I said, the highest in a decade. As I stated before, Credit Suisse benefits from Switzerland – sorry, we are on Page 9 now. As I stated before, Credit Suisse benefits from Switzerland’s historically low credit losses compared to other regions. There are, of course, two sides to this coin: the stability of Switzerland’s economy and political system also makes the Swiss franc a safe haven currency that tends to strengthen in times of global turbulence, which affects us as a company that generates significant non-Swiss franc revenues. As you see from this slide, our reported Private Banking net revenues grew by a solid 4% year-on-year during the first half of 2020 despite the significant economic slowdown. On a normalized basis and excluding the FX impact and certain other items, global Private Banking revenues were actually up 7%. The effect was most pronounced in IWM, where we reported a 1% year-on-year revenue decline in the first half of the year. Excluding the negative FX impact, which resulted primarily from the Swiss franc strength against the U.S. dollar, the Brazilian real and the euro and certain other items, revenues would have grown 4%. This highlights the underlying strength of our Private Banking divisions benefiting from our integrated and regional approach. Slide 10, please. Our Investment Banking business has not only shown resilience, but also benefited from the market environment. Revenues were up 21% on a reported basis and would have been up 26% in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 excluding mark-to-market effects. The revenue growth was spread across products with particularly strong growth in fixed income sales and trading. Now turning to Slide 12 and the strategic initiatives that we have announced today. We reaffirm our strategy launched nearly five years ago to be a leading wealth manager with strong global investment banking capabilities. The core of our growth strategy remains to be the bank for entrepreneurs with a focus on ultra-high net worth individuals. We continue to see potential for significant growth and attractive returns in Wealth Management with a balanced approach between mature and emerging markets. We also continue to believe in our regional wealth management model with proximity to our clients and empowering regional decision-makers. Slide 13, please. As you can see from this slide, we have truly transformed our business since we began our restructuring in late 2015. Our success is reflected across our financial metrics. Firstly, we have significantly and successfully derisked our Global Markets business. We have significantly lowered our group cost base from over CHF 21 billion in 2015 to below CHF 17 billion for the last 12 months. At the same time, our look-through CET1 capital has increased by almost 30% to over CHF 37 billion. Secondly, our capital allocation has shifted significantly in favor of our historically high return, less volatile Wealth Management businesses where we allocate today roughly 2/3 of our capital. Thirdly, as you can see, excluding significant items, our Wealth Management businesses have demonstrated strong growth in assets under management, net revenues and pretax income during this time. Going forward, in a normalized environment, we plan to broadly maintain this capital allocation split of 2/3 in Wealth Management and 1/3 in Investment Banking and continue to target in the medium term an RoTE of 10% to 12% and a payout ratio of roughly 50%. Slide 14, please. In order to further optimize our business model, we now have taken steps to better align our organizational structure with secular trends such as digitalization, sustainability, growth in private markets and lower-for-longer interest rates. As I mentioned earlier, these trends have been accentuated by COVID-19. While we strongly believe in our regional approach to wealth management with proximity to clients, we are combining our Global Markets, Investment Banking and Capital Markets and APAC Markets operations into one single global Investment Bank. We will also combine our risk and compliance functions. Finally, we are launching a newly formed Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions unit, called SRI, at the Executive Board level, combining Impact Advisory and Finance; Investment Solutions & Products, which is currently housed in IWM; equity research, which is currently housed in Global Markets and in the APAC divisions; and finally, the Marketing and Branding operations. In doing so, we address a certain degree of fragmentation, improved effectiveness, and together with additional efficiency plans in SUB and other corporate function areas, expect to generate run rate savings of approximately CHF 400 million per annum from 2022 onwards. We expect to reinvest these savings, depending on market conditions, into our four divisions with a particular emphasis in APAC, but also in IWM and SUB as well as in our continued digitalization and sustainability efforts. These changes are intended to align our business and resources for growth. The combination of risk and compliance will enhance alignment in our control functions. The SRI will align sustainability with our thought leadership in investment solutions and in content. And the single Investment Bank will build alignment in what we deliver globally to corporate, institutional and entrepreneurial clients. Let me go into each of these aspects in greater detail, Slide 15, please. Firstly, our single Investment Bank will create a globally integrated client-centric platform built on sales and trading, underwriting and advisory to maximize global connectivity. It will be led by Brian Chin. Brian has successfully led Global Markets and strongly improved returns. We will integrate capital markets origination and execution. This function will be led by David Miller in addition to the capital-light advisory business, where we tend to make further investments. David has done an excellent job leading our Investment Banking unit and has been a main driver of this combination. I thank him for his contribution and look forward to continuing to work with him in a great partnership. Given the success of ITS, our International Trading Solutions, and which is our trading and sales collaboration between Global Markets, SUB and IWM, we are creating GTS, Global Trading solutions, by combining ITS with our successful APAC Solutions businesses. This should allow us to align our global technology, risk and execution efforts in this area. GTS will have close regional connectivity to Wealth Management and bring global products to local markets. In addition, we shall integrate the APAC Equities into – sorry, we shall integrate our APAC Equities business into our global Equities franchise, ensuring global solutions for large institutional clients without compromising client proximity across Asia. The new IB division should also enable a more dynamic allocation of capital, consolidate our support functions and optimize global risk, technology and execution platforms. This series of refinements should allow us to deliver our medium-term ambition for a return on regulatory capital in excess of 10% for the investment bank. Secondly, we shall be integrating our risk and compliance functions under the leadership of Lara Warner, who, as you know, has been our Chief Risk Officer for over a year now and has previously successfully led the compliance function. We expect to leverage scalability and technology and data platforms used by both units and strengthen our digital capabilities. This should reduce fragmentation and complexity, address a certain degree and duplication across non-financial risks and allow us to consistently execute and deliver our control framework across all risk types while increasing coordination and the speed of decision-making. Thirdly, we are excited to launch our new Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions unit to build on our strong research and CIO capabilities to deliver unique global insights and investment solutions with a single best-in-class House View. We expect a function to also drive a globally consistent sustainability strategy. It will be led by Lydie Hudson, who has been our Chief Compliance Officer,and who previously successfully led our change program within Global Markets. This decision should allow us to further develop differentiated investment and advisory solutions across wealth management, corporates and institutional clients. It is also intended to increase connectivity of research, fully integrate ESG principles into our research approach and drive unique and market-leading insights across both public and private companies in all relevant sectors. Page 16. These organizational refinements are aimed at accelerating growth across our four divisions with a medium-term ambition for return on regulatory capital of greater than 20% for our three Wealth Management businesses combined and greater than 10% for the Investment Bank. In APAC, we intend to broaden our successful coverage of ultra-high net worth and entrepreneur clients with investments in relationship managers and bankers by expanding our wealth-linked client solutions and deepening our onshore franchises to tap faster-growing markets particularly in Greater China. As part of this strategy, last month, we completed the transaction to become a majority shareholder in our China securities joint venture, Credit Suisse Founder Securities, in which we aim to take full ownership. In IWM, we aim to double the revenue growth contribution from ultra-high net worth strategic clients over the next three years. We will expand our systematic solution delivery through the newly established International Financing Group. We are also looking to build on the success of IBCM in APAC and Switzerland, which, by the way, will both stay in these two respective divisions and where we have number one positions by integrating our IBCM, EMEA mid-market capabilities into IWM to increase connectivity with entrepreneurial clients especially in M&A. Furthermore, we will optimize our regional Private Banking coverage and create a more systematic solution delivery model. For our SUB, we will continue to build on our high-touch strategy for ultra-high net worth, corporate and institutional clients by leveraging digital solutions for our high-tech, retail and smaller corporate clients in our Direct Banking business area that we launched last year. We are now aiming for a reduction in the cost/income ratio from the high to the mid-50s. This is intended to be achieved as we optimize and improve collaboration with subsidiaries and front-to-back efficiencies. At our Investment Bank, we expect to leverage our newly established globally integrated platform to capture growth opportunities, particularly in the asset-light areas of advisory, M&A, ESG and Private Markets. Slide 17, please. Now let me put a special emphasis on the topic of sustainability. With the establishment of the SRI unit, we are now seizing the opportunity to drive a cohesive approach to position Credit Suisse as a progressive sustainability leader meeting the evolving needs of our stakeholders and society in general. Whilst we have already made great progress in the last few years, as seen on the left side of the slide, we are announcing new steps to become a leader in sustainability across our Wealth Management and Investment Banking client franchises. Sustainability will be represented in the Executive Board, underlying the significant importance and opportunities we see in this area and Iris Bohnet will take the newly created role of Board of Directors Sustainability Leader to drive our sustainability agenda and support execution. That said and aligned with the establishment of SRI, we today announced a series of sustainability goals including to provide at least CHF 300 billion of sustainable financing over the next 10 years in areas such as renewables, lower carbon solutions, green bonds, transition bonds and other projects that contribute to the delivery of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and to financing our clients' transition to a sustainable future. Furthermore, we are further tightening our exclusion guidelines around coal mining, coal power, Arctic oil and gas and other fossil fuel industries to transition towards lower carbon solutions that contribute to the achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement. In particular, we will generally not provide lending or capital markets underwriting to any company deriving more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal extraction or from coal power, and we will not provide financing related to offshore and onshore oil and gas projects in the Arctic region. We are aligning our industry groups to better pursue opportunities in the energy transition space by combining our oil and gas and our power and renewables businesses in IB. We are also enacting energy transition plans for each of our high-carbon industries to ensure clients that we are working with in these industries have plans to address their footprint. Next page, please. Let me summarize our financial ambitions. We aim to achieve 10% to 12% RoTE over the medium term in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions; run a CET1 ratio of around 12% and a CET1 leverage ratio of around 4%. As mentioned, in terms of our capital distribution, we expect approval of our second half 2019 dividend at an EGM on November 27. After the EGM, the Board intends to review the share buyback program, subject to market conditions. Looking forward into 2021 and beyond, we expect to distribute at least 50% of net income through dividends and share buybacks in a normalized environment. We are currently accruing for a 2020 dividend consistent with this policy, namely, a dividend that we expect to grow by at least 5% per annum. And with that, I would like to hand over to David for the discussion of our second quarter financial results in more detail.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Thomas. Good morning, everybody. And I’d now like to take you through the numbers in some more detail, please. So as Thomas has already summarized, our businesses performed robustly in the second quarter, notwithstanding the ongoing economic stress and the market uncertainty resulting from the pandemic. But before I do get into details, I think I’d just emphasize that with a CET1 ratio of 12.5% and a total allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet of CHF 2 billion, we feel well prepared for the continued economic stress that we will see in the second half of this year as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Let’s turn to the financials. So overall net revenues in the second quarter of 2020 were CHF 6.2 billion, and that’s an increase of 11% year-on-year. Now if we look at the business lines on the slide, you can see that in the second quarter, our Investment Banking & Capital Markets division saw an increase in revenues of 61% compared to the second quarter of 2019. And our Markets revenues across both Global Markets and Asia reported an increase of 33%. Now whilst our Wealth Management-related revenues did fall overall by 2% compared to the same quarter in 2019, as Thomas has already mentioned, this was impacted by the strength of the Swiss franc in which we report by comparison to the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real. On a constant currency basis, our Wealth Management-related revenues would have increased by 1%. Now we continue to take an appropriate stance with regard to the provisioning for our credit exposures against the economic stresses resulting from the pandemic. With regard to CECL, our total debt exposures were roughly constant, although we did see some deterioration in the economic projections compared to the end of the first quarter. As I’ll discuss in some more detail, we did see an uptick in certain of our specific provisions but not as much as in the first quarter. Net-net, as I’ve already mentioned, we come into the third quarter with a total allowance for credit losses on our balance sheet of CHF 2 billion. Now total operating expenses in the second quarter were 2% higher than the same period last year at CHF 4.3 billion. That mainly reflects two factors: first, increased compensation accruals due in part to the substantial pickup in trading activity and transaction activity in the quarter; and second, a CHF 53 million increase in certain expenses, resulting from the mark-to-mark movements on deferred comp instruments relating to the narrowing of our credit spreads in the quarter. Overall, we generated pretax income of CHF 1.6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-on-year. Now our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. Now if you include the benefit of the tax reversals that I discussed three months ago, that takes our year-to-date tax rate to 10%. Now I’d reiterate and maintain the 20% to 25% guidance that I gave for the full year, although, clearly, given our performance in the second quarter, I would expect the rate for the full year to be very much at the lower end of this range for 2020. If we look to 2021, on the basis of our current plans, I’d expect our tax rate to be somewhere in the mid-20s for next year. But this will, of course, depend on any taxation changes in the countries in which we operate, and in particular, it’s clearly possible that there could be a change in U.S. tax rules following the elections this autumn. Our net income attributable to shareholders stood at CHF 1.2 billion, and that’s an increase of 24% year-on-year. That equates to a return on tangible equity of 11% for the second quarter, which takes the total for the first half to 12%, which is in line with our medium-term guidance of an RoTE of between 10% and 12%. Let’s look at the CET1 ratio. So the CET1 ratio for the quarter was 12.5%, and that compares to 12.1% at the end of the first quarter. I’m sure you’ll recall that in April I warned that our capital ratio could fall in the second quarter compared to the first, reflecting the concerns we had that we could see a further increase in lending in our corporate bank drawdowns in the period as well as the adverse impact of market and credit risk volatility on our RWA. Now if we look at the second quarter, we did see the risk-weighted asset inflation that we expected, both from the phase-in of the SA-CCR reforms here in Switzerland as well as the increase in RWAs from the volatility of March. We also did see some impact from ratings migration. But overall, our CET1 ratio at the end of the second quarter benefited from very strong levels of capital generation, a reversal and not an increase in our corporate bank drawdowns and from the reductions in our leverage finance exposure as we completed deals during the second quarter. I think we’re also more successful than I would have expected in mitigating some of the volatility-driven increase in RWAs. And the net effect is that RWAs fell from CHF 301 billion to CHF 299 billion over the period. Now if we look forward to the balance of the year that there is still considerable economic uncertainty, I think our capital position means that I’m confident to reinstate the previous guidance we gave at our Investor Day last December of a ratio for our CET1 of approximately 12% for the end of the year. In terms of capital distribution, we expect to maintain our long-standing dividend policy and to continue to accrue for a dividend as we did in the first quarter in anticipation of an increase of at least 5% in the 2020 total compared to 2019. With regard to the second installment of the 2019 dividend, please note that we have announced today that we’re planning to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting on the 27th of November. Following a final review by the Board, we would expect that shareholders will be asked to vote on the approval of the payment of the second half of the 2019 dividend at that meeting. Now as Thomas has already said, we remain committed in the medium term to a payout ratio of at least 50% following next year of a gradual increase in the dividend and share buybacks. And following the EGM that we planned for the end of November, the Board intends to review the resumption of the share buyback program. Let’s turn to leverage. During the second quarter, our CET1 leverage ratio increased by approximately 30 basis points to 4.5% and our Tier 1 leverage ratio by approximately 40 basis points to 6.2%. That was driven by the strong earnings generation I mentioned already and by a partial reduction of the elevated leverage exposure that we had at the end of the first quarter particularly in Global Markets, due to improved netting and reduced margin requirements and fails as well as lower leveraged finance exposure. Now given the economic stress, we have continued to take a conservative approach to our liquidity requirements, and you’ll note that our LCR ratio increased to 196% over the quarter, which I would expect to be amongst the highest of the major banks. Let’s turn to look at tangible book value per share, please. What we show here is the progression of tangible book per share for the first six months. This grew from CHF 15.88 to CHF 17.03 during the period, an increase of 7%. I’d like to make three key points about this: first, you can see the net income generation of CHF 1.0 per share; second, you’ll see that we have seen volatility in our tangible book value per share due to the moves in the value of our own credit with the widening in the first quarter followed by a narrowing in the second quarter, leading to a net addition of CHF 0.71 overall; and finally, the strength in the Swiss franc against other currencies has had an adverse impact of CHF 0.43 over the six months period. Let’s turn to cost now, Slide 24. We remain committed to our program of continuous improvements in productivity. And as Thomas has already summarized, we’re planning further measures to support this. So far, expenses have fallen from CHF 8.5 billion in the first half of 2019 to CHF 8.4 billion for the first six months of 2020. We saw some increase in expenses in the second quarter compared to the first as a consequence of the moves in the value of our own credit as well as revenue-related expenses, predominantly comp-linked, for which we have accrued to reflect the strong revenue performance this quarter. This has been partly offset by reduced travel and related expenses. Now our expectations for costs for the full year will clearly depend on the level of business activity, but I would expect our adjusted cost number in the year to be in the range of CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion. So next, I’d like to talk in some more detail about our loan book and our provisions for credit losses. I thought it’d be useful to give some detail on the disclosure, which we’ve included now in Page 71 of our financial report, and that relates to the composition of our loan book. Firstly, you can see the majority, 84%, are collateralized loans at amortized costs. I think the second point is something I’m sure you’re all familiar with, the largest component of our loans are made here in Switzerland with 59% of group gross loans residing in the Swiss Universal Bank. I’ve said before that one clear point of differentiation for us is that we do not have a significantly large exposure to U.S. consumer lending, and our credit exposure is instead biased towards our more resilient Swiss home market. The Swiss economy continues to benefit from low levels of unemployment, low levels of consumer indebtedness and to a low credit loss experience compared to other markets. But I think it’s also fair to say that the Swiss government has moved quickly to protect its citizens and its economy from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we would continue to expect the Swiss credit experience to be substantially better than the rest of the world in the coming months. Let’s turn now to look at the quarter-on-quarter move in credit provisions. What I’m showing here is an updated version of the slide that I presented three months ago. As I’m sure you remember, the first quarter marks the introduction of the current expected credit loss rules under U.S. GAAP, which came into effect on the 1st of January. It’s worth remembering that Credit Suisse is unusual in being a European-based bank reporting under U.S. GAAP rather than IFRS, and therefore, subject to the much more conservative CECL rules. As you know, CECL generally upfronts more of the impact of credit losses than IFRS. If you look at the summary, remember the rules that I’ve shown here for the first three months of the year, at the end of which our allowance for credit losses stood at CHF 1.7 billion. Now the level of the CECL provision depends overall both on the absolute level of our credit exposure that we have and the economic outlook for that credit exposure. What we’ve seen in the second quarter is that our exposure has been broadly stable and that the outlook that is clearly worse at the end of the second quarter than at the end of the first has not seen the pace of deterioration that we saw in the first quarter. After all, I think at the end of December 2019, no one had actually heard of COVID-19. So therefore, our additional provision for credit losses was substantially lower in the second quarter than in the first at CHF 296 million, of which CHF 130 million was related to CECL and CHF 166 million was related to specific provisions. And that takes our total to CHF 2 billion at the end of June. Now I just wanted to update the comparison that we gave at the end of the first quarter, which shows here the level of credit losses that we have against the loan books for our Global Markets and our IBCM businesses, and that should be broadly comparable to the loan exposures of those peer banks that have already reported and for which we have the necessary data. As at the end of the second quarter, this figure stood at 2.2%, which exceeds that of all those peers who’ve reported so far and have published comparable data. The increase compared to the first quarter reflects both the increased credit provisions we’ve taken, but also the reduced exposures for this calculation as we’ve seen corporates who’ve refinanced themselves in the debt capital markets and paid down corporate loans in the period. Now before I turn to the divisional summary, I did want to discuss the accounting implications of the restructuring measures that Thomas has already briefed you on. Just to recap, we’re amalgamating IBCM, Global Markets and APAC Markets into a single global investment bank. We’re combining and integrating our risk and compliance functions. We are creating a new function called Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions. And we’re accelerating our efficiency and digitalization initiatives here in Swiss Universal Bank. These measures will require a restatement of our earnings onto the new divisional basis, which we would expect to provide to you at the beginning of October. We will be taking some restructuring charges as a result of these measures expected to be approximately CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million. And these should generate approximately CHF 400 million of run rate savings. The program will run over the course of the next 12 months with a full run rate savings achieved from 2022 onwards. Let’s turn now to our divisional performance and start with the Swiss Universal Bank. Our Swiss Universal Bank generated pretax income of CHF 687 million, an increase of 5% compared to the same period last year. That includes a gain of CHF 134 million from the revaluation of our equity investment in the Pfandbriefbank in the second quarter of 2020. Revenues increased by 2% to CHF 1.5 billion driven by higher revenues from International Trading Solutions, or ITS, and increased revenues in our ultra-high net worth segment as well as by the revaluation gain. We’ve taken additional provision for credit losses of CHF 30 million compared to CHF 124 million that we took in the first quarter, and this increment was primarily driven by our consumer finance business in Switzerland. Operating expenses was 3% lower than the second quarter of 2019 at CHF 787 million, the result of ongoing cost discipline which helps our cost/income ratio to fall to 52%. If we turn to Private Clients, net revenues increased by 3% year-on-year driven by the strong performance of the ultra-high net worth segment where revenues rose by 12% and by the Pfandbriefbank gain. But this was partly offset by lower revenues from our investment in the Swisscard credit card issuing joint venture. In terms of net new assets, we saw further outflows of CHF 1.6 billion due to deleveraging by certain of our ultra-high net worth clients this quarter. But I would note that client business volume, which include net loans, assets under management and assets under custody, was up by 4% Q-on-Q. Corporate & Institutional Clients reported stable net revenues year-on-year with increased ITS and Swiss Investment Banking revenues as well as higher fees from lending activities, which offset reductions in FX transactions. C&IC saw net new assets of CHF 1.6 billion for the quarter, mainly reflecting continued momentum in our pension fund business. Now I’m not going to cover the next slide in detail, but you can see that notwithstanding the adverse economic environment and acknowledging the Pfandbriefbank gain, the return on regulatory capital was stable at 20% for the year – sorry, for the quarter, and we saw continued growth in pretax income and net margin. With that, let’s turn to the next slide to look at IWM. In terms of performance, the division has seen significant increase in underlying client activity this quarter. Comparisons with the same quarter last year are complicated by the fact that most of the businesses IWM transacts in is in U.S. dollars, the Brazilian real and the euro, all of which have fallen significantly against the Swiss franc, and this has had the effect of reducing revenues by CHF 71 million year-on-year. If we exclude for this and for the real estate gains from the same period last year, the division’s revenues was down about 1% compared to the 7% headline rate we report today. This underlying performance also reflects a fall in recurring revenues due to the delayed impact of the fall in markets in the first quarter together with pressure on net interest income due to the reductions in U.S. dollar interest rates. Overall, we saw a 22% decline in pretax income for the division, which fell from CHF 444 million to CHF 348 million year-on-year. Our Asset Management revenues fell by 7% with pretax income lower at CHF 80 million, although I would note that the comparative figure did include a very substantial sales gain from a private equity investment in the second quarter of 2019. We’ve seen good inflows in the quarter with contributions from emerging markets in Europe taking the NNA total to CHF 1.8 billion in Private Banking. In Asset Management, we saw net new assets of CHF 4.1 billion with strong institutional flows driven by Index Solutions and Credit. Let me turn now to Asia Pacific. Our Asia Pacific division reported a strong performance for the second quarter with pretax income improving by 26% year-on-year to CHF 298 million, the highest level since 2015, with net revenues up by 17% year-on-year at CHF 1.1 billion. With our costs broadly stable, the cost-to-income ratio fell by 10% year-on-year. Predominantly driven by strong markets and IBCM performances, which offset an increase in credit provisions, these numbers delivered a return on regulatory capital of 22% for the quarter. If we look at Wealth Management & Connected, our pretax income was CHF 123 million. That included a CHF 33 million recovery of the unrealized mark-to-market gains on our fair value lending portfolio in our financing business, but this was offset by hedging losses and costs of CHF 72 million. Within Private Banking, which like IWM was also adversely affected by the strength of the Swiss franc compared to the U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar-linked currencies, we saw lower NII and lower recurring commissions and fees due in part to the fall in average assets under management which offset increased transaction-based revenues. Our advisory, underwriting and financing revenues, which increased 9% year-on-year, reflect increased equity-linked activity. Net new assets for the quarter totaled CHF 4.5 billion, representing an annualized growth rate of 9% and taking NNA for the half year to CHF 7.5 billion. If we turn to APAC Markets, the positive market environment and higher client activity drove net revenues 60% higher year-on-year, fixed income revenues increased by 151% whilst equity sales and trading revenues increased by 23% driven by both cash equities and equity derivatives. Let’s turn to IBCM. Our Investment Banking & Capital Markets division also saw strong second quarter revenues, up by 61% year-on-year to US$732 million. With operating expenses broadly flat year-on-year, that translates into a pretax income of US$212 million. Additional provisions for credit losses totaled US$69 million, compared to US$161 million in the first quarter of 2020 and are driven primarily by CECL charges due to the deteriorating economic outlook in North America. In terms of specific provisions, we saw limited adverse effects with only US$7 million allocated to specific cases. Just to update you on our leveraged finance exposure, this has fallen sharply by a further US$4.3 billion since the end of the first quarter to US$3 billion outstanding at the end of June. We saw strong client activity across our advisory and underwriting businesses with clients taking advantage of positive debt and equity markets to secure additional financing and to refinance their balance sheets. Our equity underwriting revenues increased by 65% year-on-year, buoyed by strong follow-on and convertible issuance performances. And we were ranked number one in IPOs for both the second quarter and the first half of the year. Our M&A revenues also increased by 32% as we took market share on the back of completing previously announced transactions, although I would caution, as some of our peers have done, that the pipeline in terms of advisory work is less strong than it was a year ago due to the impediments that the COVID-19 pandemic makes on initiating new transactions. Our debt underwriting revenues improved by 83% in part due to strong investment-grade debt activity. I’d note though that contributing to this performance was IBCM’s share of the 73% recovery of the mark-to-market losses of US$147 million that we took in leveraged finance in the first quarter. This reflects reduced credit spreads as well as the completed – completion and syndication of a number of transactions. Let me conclude then with a few words on the performance of Global Markets. In our Global Markets business, we saw a continuation of the elevated level activity and volatility that we benefited from in the first quarter, combined with the increase in debt and equity issuance activity supported another robust performance by the division. Our pretax income was up by 71% at US$615 million on net revenues of just under $2 billion, an increase of 27% year-on-year. And that resulted in a return on regulatory capital of 17% for the quarter. As we’ve noted already, robust ITS revenues have contributed to this performance and are a testament to the collaboration between our Markets and Wealth Management businesses. Higher trading activity and market share gains delivered strong fixed income revenues, an increase of 42%. And like IBCM, GM benefits from the write-back of the 73% recovery of the unrealized mark-to-market losses of US$147 million and the leveraged finance underwriting book. In Equities, we did see share gains in cash trading and underwriting and that offset a reduced performance by equity derivatives in the second quarter. In terms of credit loss provisions, as with IBCM, the decrease in corporate exposure due to debt paydown partly offset the adverse impact on credit loan provisions due to deterioration of the U.S. economic outlook. Our additional provisions for credit losses totaled US$80 million, and that compares to US$156 million in the first quarter. And again, like IBCM, these were primarily related to the CECL scenarios with only US$7 million allocated to specific positions. Our expenses increased by 8% predominantly as a result of higher compensation accruals partly offset by certain efficiency measures. With regard to risk-weighted assets, I think you’ve seen that we’ve been successful in reversing a substantial component of the volatility-driven increase that we saw in the first quarter. That was driven by a reversal of the drawdown in corporate lending as well as other mitigating steps to reduce the adverse impact of the March volatility. And with that, I’d like to conclude my part of this presentation and hand back to Thomas. Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, David. I would now like to close the formal part of today’s call by summarizing our overall performance and priorities for 2020 and beyond. Please go to the next slide, Page 40. Thank you. As I stated earlier, our return on tangible equity over the last 6 months was 12% and over the last 12 months was 10.4%, exceeding our pre-COVID ambition of delivering approximately 10% for 2020. The strong results show that our operating model is working even in a challenging market environment and during a time when we built significant credit reserve. Furthermore, we have been able to grow our tangible book value per share, which was over CHF 17 at the end of the second quarter. With that being said and with the organizational changes we announced today, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value, invest in growth, serve our clients and navigate the challenging market environment while driving the sustainability agenda. Thank you all for your attention. I will now hand back to Kinner for the Q&A.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Thomas and David.

We know your top-down targets, the return on tangible, 10% to 12%. But could you give us a sense of two things competitively. How do you think about your kind of overall Private Banking business. And let’s take it kind of 3 years out, where would you like to take it? And where do you see that growth acceleration that you have described in the strategic document? What are you thinking about? Is it a combination of an AUM growth, better penetration, revenue growth, financing? You’ve also mentioned ultra-high net worth business. So there was a lot of moving parts. But could you kind of give us a sense holistically where you want that Private Bank of yours to be on a three-year view? And my second question is similar because, of course, we have seen the combination of the global kind of Investment Bank. And when you think about that 10% return on regulatory capital medium term, where is it mostly coming from? Do you see it on the revenue side from the perspective of the 10% line or on the cost side given how you combine the businesses from pretty much three to one?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Magdalena. So on Private Banking, as you saw on one of the slides, that we grew in the first half by 7% on an adjusted basis in an environment which was, frankly, quite hostile and it shows that the Private Banking business as a whole and that Credit Suisse is on a healthy growth trend even in a difficult environment. Now clearly, there are some headwinds, be it on U.S. dollar interest rates, be it in our strong Swiss franc. And clearly, in the current environment, it’s difficult to win new clients as clients are relatively, let’s say, conservative at the moment. But nevertheless, we continue to believe in the overall growth rate of the private banking industry as a whole. And we think that Credit Suisse is extremely well positioned in all three regions, be it Asia, be it EMEA region including Switzerland and be it in Latin America. And we have continued to invest in these businesses, be it through hiring of relationship managers; be it by improving our offering, working together with the Investment Bank; and to be the bank for entrepreneurs in all of these regions. So I have mentioned some of the initiatives like, for example, the establishment of the IFG, International Financing Group, here in Switzerland in IWM, which will incorporate all share-backed lending activities we do in this time zone, including also for institutional clients and for SUB clients. We want to improve also the collaboration of IWM with IBCM and especially for mid-market transactions for entrepreneurs in M&A but even also in the lending space for corporates where we see quite a lot of potential still to tap market share and increase market share. And from that perspective, we continue to target high single-digit revenue growth in our global Private Banking business. On the IB side, your question was how we’re going to integrate this and how we’re going to drive revenues and the 10% return on capital. I mean in order to get to 10% return on capital for the full year, we have to do CHF 1.6 billion PTI. We have now made CHF 1.1 billion in the first 6 months if you take the three areas together, Global Markets, IBCM and APAC Markets. So I’m very confident that we have a good, strong base to work from. I see further growth opportunities in each of the areas, be it in Equities, be it in fixed income, be it in the M&A and underwriting business. Clearly, there are headwinds in the current environment, but we continue to expect volatility, which should generally help our trading business. We continue to see the desire of corporates to refinance themselves in the capital markets, be it in equity capital markets, be it in debt capital markets. So I do think that there continues to be very decent volumes in capital markets. Clearly, M&A will be tough in the second half because announced M&A volumes in the first half is down over 50% globally. I’m talking about Street numbers. And there is a delay, as you know, for M&A revenues. So I think overall Street will have a tough time in the second half in terms of M&A revenues. But at the same time, we see our pipeline growing. We also saw recent announcements of M&A transactions. So from that perspective, I think momentum is building.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': 'Can I just follow up on the Investment Banking side because I – so I understand that this year has been kind of very strong in the first half. So the 10% return on tangible is not really a question for 2020. It was a question for kind of delivering that on a more sustainable level as we kind of look through medium term. And also, by the combination of the businesses, I’m sure that you’re likely to extract some cost savings. And so the question really is how do you think about maybe the operational leverage in that business particularly with that 10% return on tangible in mind more medium term.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Yes. There are definitely some cost synergies by putting the two together especially in the support areas. But the combination of IBCM, Global Markets and APAC Markets is less driven, frankly, by cost consideration, that’s a positive side effect, but it’s more driven by the increased revenue growth opportunities that we see. We, for example, to create a global Equities platform, will help us also with our large institutional clients; or for example, to put together the underwriting business, where we had a 50-50 joint venture, will simplify things. We want to invest in M&A with an asset-light business and we continue to see opportunities there to grow. So overall, we see various areas. We are actually top 6 in 84% of our revenues in Investment Banking, we are in the top six position. So we have concentrated on areas where we are globally competitive. And from that perspective, we are confident to build on the success. You saw we are number one in the first six months in IPOs globally, so strong leveraged finance, strong private equity franchises. So we have a very strong base to work from.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And your next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann, Autonomous.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Stefan Stalmann',\n","    'text': 'I have two, please. The first one, going back to the restructuring and the combination of the Investment Banking unit, will this also encompass the advisory, underwriting and financing activities that are currently in APAC Wealth Management, please? And is there any business in APAC Markets that will remain in the APAC division or will it be totally going to the Investment Bank – to the new Investment Banking division? And the second question relates to liquidity. You mentioned the increase of the LCR ratio during the quarter, but it’s really basically back to where it was late in 2019. So from your perspective, have you actually incurred excess cost of liquidity during the second quarter? And if so, is that excess cost still sitting in the Corporate Center or have you allocated it to the divisions?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Stefan. So I will take the first question, and David will take the second question. So if you look at our IB business in Asia, we basically have three areas. One is what we would call the IBCM business in Asia, so M&A and Capital Markets business, which is currently in the segment Wealth Management & Connected, and that will stay 100% part of APAC. And then within the Markets business, you have, on one side, Equities, cash and prime, which will be fully part of the global Equities business, and therefore, fully part of Global Markets but with local reporting lines, obviously. And then you have APAC Solutions, which is now being merged with ITS, which – and will be Global Trading Solution, GTS. Yves-Alain Sommerholder used to run both businesses, so he was spending 50% of his time out of Zurich running ITS and 50% out of his time in Hong Kong running ITS. He now runs both together. So this has been, if you want, already prepared and there will be local reporting lines. There is a revenue-sharing setup in the same way that we have a revenue-sharing arrangement today between Global Markets, SUB and IWM for ITS, and we’ll have the same thing in Asia. So from that perspective, hopefully, that answers your question on the Asia-based Investment Bank.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Stefan, just on the second point then, so just a few numbers then. So you’re correct, the LCR ratio of 196% is very similar to the LCR ratio of 198% that we had at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. However, due in part to the 1Q events, the net – NCOs are actually higher, CHF 83 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, increased to CHF 104 billion. So in terms of our HQLA position, the CHF 203 billion average actually compares to CHF 165 billion in the end of the fourth quarter of last year. So that just gives the sort of full picture in terms of the liquidity position. And I think we just regard this as a prudent thing to do. It gives us much greater reserves at the central parent entity as well as in our subsidiaries, and it prepares us for whatever stresses we may or may not see in the autumn. In terms of your question about the increased cost to that, there is an increased cost to that. That has predominantly been allocated to divisions, particularly Global Markets and IBCM. So the numbers you see for both of them are actually after the – that increase in costs. There are some costs also sitting in the Corporate Center, not dissimilar, I think, to the CHF 90 million that UBS talked about, and those will be allocated in due course as we actually move forward. But the majority has actually gone out to the markets-based operations already and it’s actually in our run rate number, Stefan.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Benjamin Goy',\n","    'text': 'Also two questions from my side, please. First, on strategy, when I read Slide 13 correctly on the capital allocation, it should stay broadly the same. But you talked in the midterm basically twice the return in Wealth Management versus the Investment Bank. So just wondering why not you are more ambitious saying three quarters, 1 quarter or even 80/20, really thinking out a couple of years down the line. And then the second question following up on net interest income. To some extent, in APAC and IWM, I guess, the U.S. dollar pressure is clearly visible on the U.S. interest rates. Just wondering whether you have seen most of it or is there more to come in Q3, Q4 in terms of pressure. Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Benjamin. I will take the first question again and David will take the second question. Yes. Look, the – our business model, as we said numerous times, is to be a global leader in Wealth Management with strong Investment Banking capabilities. And it’s very clear that based on these two fundamentals, we need to have the appropriate capital allocation. So to have a strong investment bank helps us directly and indirectly with our entrepreneur clients. And if you want to advise an entrepreneur around his private wealth, he usually wants to talk first about his company and how he can grow it and how he can make acquisition and how he can finance it and potentially make an IPO or whatever. So you need to have strong investment banking capabilities to holistically advise entrepreneurs, and that’s why it’s very important we maintain a minimum size in there. And a lot of the revenues that we’re actually making in Private Banking and profitability, we are making because we have a strong investment bank, global investment bank. And I think with the 10% target returns, which we see as a minimum for the Investment Banking business, we have a realistic number to support that business. It’s above our cost of capital in the long term. And from that perspective, we think that’s the right mix. There will also be, as you know, over the coming years, certain changes in Basel III RWA modeling around the FRTB, for example, and that will increase obviously the RWAs especially on the Investment Banking side and that’s why we have taken this approach. And obviously, you also have to look at it not only from an RWA perspective, but also from a leverage perspective where today we are above 1/3. And that’s why on a mid-to long-term approach, the 1/3, 2/3 is the right mix for us.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'So I think in terms of net interest income guidance, actually – I’ve not actually been asked this question since the Investor Day back in December, so I think you may recall at that point, we indicated that as a combination of the dollarization of our operational risk RWA plus the measures we were taking here in Switzerland, that we expected our net interest income to be higher by about CHF 250 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Now a lot’s happened in the last six months and particularly the move in U.S. dollar rates. But it’s – I would still expect our net interest income to be up by about CHF 100 million in 2020 compared to 2019. It’s a combination of those measures. And you know the exemption threshold at the SNB is also – was actually increased in the first quarter. But the benefit for that will be almost entirely in the Swiss Universal bank because you are obviously seeing the adverse impact of lower dollar rates on an NII basis in both IWM and in APAC. And I would caution that you would see further pressure on net interest income in 2021 if interest rates remain at this level as the various swaps and structures that we put in place with the dollarization begin to roll off towards the end of 2021. So that’s – I hope that’s helpful in terms of the guidance. Much more resilient here in Switzerland, less so elsewhere, although clearly the reported net interest income numbers will also depend on our loan activity over the course of the next year or so.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': 'Perhaps just a follow-up on some of the gross margins. Notably, actually Asia Pacific, the Private Banking gross margin within that dropped down to 79, part of that’s normalization and transaction activity. There’s a big drop in fee and recurring income. So if you could just elaborate a bit more on what’s driving that, please, as well. And then secondly, on the costs, you’re guiding to CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion for 2020. You’re then talking about this CHF 400 million of cost saves. Can I just check, is that CHF 400 million of cost saves relative to the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion target this year? And is that a net reduction target? Or is that prior to reinvestment spend?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Thank you very much. I mean I think looking at different components, clearly, if we’re talking about the APAC PB business, you have seen the similar pressure that we saw in IWM from the weakness of dollar and dollar-linked currencies against the Swiss franc. I mean just to remind you, we were actually trading at parity against the U.S. dollar a year ago and latest rate is, I think, somewhere between 0.93 and 0.94 today, which is quite a material move. And not relevant for APAC, but I mean, if you look to the Brazilian real, it’s down about 30% against the year. So there’s a lot of currency moves. And I would just remind you, we obviously report in Swiss francs, not in U.S. dollars. And that does have an impact on our APAC PB businesses across the line. In terms of the specific line items, the pressure you’re talking about in terms of recurring activity in APAC was actually linked to some of the insurance products that we actually sell in Asia Pacific and that’s what caused the slowdown in the second quarter. It wasn’t anything beyond that.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs', 'text': 'Okay. And on cost?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Sorry. On costs, your second question, well, I think we’ve probably summarized it already, which is we do remain committed to achieving our 2% to 3% productivity savings each year. The measures that we’ve announced today should generate about CHF 400 million of cost saves, which we will see during 2021 and realized in full by 2022. But I think the question is how much we actually let drop through to the bottom line for that will depend critically on the markets we actually see over the next six to 12 months. Clearly, if conditions remain difficult, if we see a further economic slowdown, then I think the pace of reinvestment is going to be extremely limited. If, on the other hand, we continue to see a gentle recovery in economic activity, then I would expect to allow a much higher level of reinvestment of that CHF 400 million number. So I mean that’s why I’ve given guidance for this year of a range of between CHF 16 billion and CHF 16.5 billion because I think there is considerable uncertainty over the next six months. And clearly, part of the rationale and the reasoning for taking these measures is to actually drive further efficiency measures and to give us greater flexibility either to reduce our costs or to free up resources for growth elsewhere. We need to be nimble in the face of this environment.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher, UBS.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Daniele Brupbacher',\n","    'text': 'Yes. Just two smaller numbers question and then again on costs. In CIC, the Swiss business, risk costs were basically close to 0, CHF 2 million, I believe. Can you just talk about what you’re seeing domestically with the corporates and how’s the quality outlook there and how we should think about that going forward? And then in IWM transaction-based revenues were again relatively soft at least versus my expectation in the second quarter. If you could just talk about what is happening there and what the outlook is. I remember there were some headwinds in the first quarter regarding unrealized losses, CHF 101 million, whether there was something similar in the second quarter. Sorry. And just on the cost saves, I mean that the targets overall, they look relatively similar to what you had previously, but you seem to require restructuring charges now to deliver these cost targets. So has the nature of the cost saves changed versus previously? Or why do you need now those cost restructuring charges to deliver those cost saves.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Yes. So let me start with maybe the Swiss business, which I still know very well from our previous side and then maybe we’ll talk about IWM and the overall cost targets. So on CIC, as you see on Page 44, in the first quarter, we actually provisioned CHF 112 million in the first quarter, CHF 86 million CECL related and CHF 26 million specific. And the second quarter, we had CHF 11 million specific, but we had a reversal of CHF 9 million in CECL based on an update we’ve done on our economic assumptions, which actually slightly improved for Switzerland. So overall, if you take it together, we have CHF 114 million provision in the first half. For our corporate business, it’s actually still a pretty big number. So – and anecdotally, when I speak to our Head of Corporate Banking, be it on the large risk corporate side, be it on the SME side, we feel that our clients are overall feeling extremely well with the crisis. Clearly, there is pressure points and there are certain areas where our corporate clients or certain sectors, especially in tourism and in other areas where they are challenged, but we feel relatively comfortable with where we are year-to-date on that side. And maybe, David, you want to take the IWM and cost target question?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Yes. I mean I think in terms of the transaction revenues for IWM, I think two points. Firstly, the point we’ve made already around the moves against these currencies. I mean 30% for the Brazilian real, and that’s an important part of the IWM business. I mean I think, let’s not overlook, that’s a big move. 6% in the U.S. dollar, these actually do depress our reported transaction revenues when you actually look at the numbers in Swiss francs. But I would also note, which might be helpful, that we did see about a CHF 21 million loss in respect of hedging of certain derivative positions in IWM, which we have noted in general terms in the MD&A. So that’s probably the other factor in there. So that might help you, Daniele, in terms of the models. And that basically just relates to the moves in credit spreads in the second quarter compared to previous periods. I think you asked a question around CHF 101 million, I think. That was actually in Asset Management, not in the PB side basically. So that was an AM issue, not the PB side. We have disclosed we’ve seen a write-back of about CHF 20 million of that CHF 100 million in the second quarter, but that’s clearly the other subdivision from IWM PB, if that helps. I think on the more general point around costs, I mean I think there’s a few points to make. Firstly, Credit Suisse does have, I think, a very good track record in terms of delivering cost saves. We delivered over CHF 4.2 billion through our committed program. And that program is very much ongoing in terms of what we’re actually doing today. Secondly, we’re not changing our targets for return on tangible equity. We’re not moving back from reported to adjusted or anything like that. The key metric for the bank remains the reported metrics. What we do have though is, as a consequence of the measures that Thomas has announced this morning, we will see a slight step-up in terms of those restructuring costs that ordinarily we just let flow through our P&L. And therefore, the reason why we’re disclosing it today is just so you know that is coming and to make clear that essentially we will be giving that disclosure going forward. But our numbers remain measured on a reported basis. But as we’re taking these bigger steps, essentially, in the interest of transparency, we wanted to let you know that there will be a slight step-up in these costs, which otherwise would actually flow through our P&L without requiring disclosure. So it’s more of a disclosure point in terms of this. We’re not going back to some kind of adjusted type metric in terms of how we actually judge ourselves. It’s clearly part of the ongoing measures we’re actually taking. And I think that’s the kind of key point. You should see it more as how we basically double down on our existing strengths across our business and give ourselves some more cost flexibility going forward.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim, Societe Generale. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Lim',\n","    'text': 'So I guess with regards to strategy, management has to balance out the benefits of having a local focus versus a centralized focus. So obviously, with IB, you’ve gone down the centralized route and merged a lot of the disparate geographic functions. But with Wealth Management, you still remained local, which is completely the opposite of a peer of yours. So I’m just wondering what your thoughts of that in terms of doing something with the consolidation of your global Wealth Management functions. And then, secondly, obviously, you benefited on the CET1 ratio with credit drawdowns being repaid back. Just wondering if that has any follow-through into the year, the third quarter or are we mostly done in there?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Okay. I’ll take the first one, Andrew, and the second one for David. So as I said in the presentation, we are convinced that a regional approach within our Wealth Management is the right approach. So we have empowered executives in Asia, in the SUB for Switzerland, in IWM and even within those divisions than we have on the N-2 levels, people in charge for various subregions or sub-businesses in Switzerland, for example, for premium clients and then for the non-premium clients business. So we very much believe in this regionalization empowering. And the Private Banking business is a local business, is a regional business and it’s quite different from the Investment Banking business, which is a global trading, underwriting and advisory business built on strong infrastructure, et cetera. So we very much believe that this is the right approach. And as I also mentioned earlier, at the time when Global Markets and IBCM were split, that was really to fix the Global Markets business. We had too much capital, too much risk-weighted assets in that area. We reduced the risk. And we want to protect the IBCM business. We did do that in the restructuring phase. And this is the right thing now to do to put the global Investment Bank back together. And from that perspective, it’s a natural step. But I definitely would never want to go to a global wealth management structure.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Okay. I think your second question then was more of a numbers question in terms of the reversal of the credit drawdowns that we saw in March. I think the answer to that is we’ve only seen a partial repayment of the credit facility drawdown that we saw in the first quarter. So I would assume that if conditions continue to normalize and given the continued levels of central bank intervention in debt markets, that we should see further payback of facilities as we actually go through the rest of this year. But no, it is not fair to say that we’ve seen the full extent of that reversal as yet. And I guess to that extent, therefore, it does remain a benefit in terms of our overall credit exposures to see.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee, Exane. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee',\n","    'text': 'Firstly, could I just pick up on that previous comment you made about capital movements looking out into 3Q and 4Q? So you said that you could get more repayment of drawdowns. Could you just walk us through any other sort of moving parts that you expect? I think there’s a little bit more RWA inflation still to come through. But if you could just sort of walk us through what you think the major moving parts are potentially on capital in 3Q and 4Q, and in particular, what the risk is of the ratio slipping back to the 12% or lower levels, that would be very helpful. And then, secondly, a sort of briefer question. You mentioned hoping to review share buybacks at the end of November. And I just wondered whether you have any indications from your regulators whether that’s going to be politically acceptable at that point, whether you have any indications of that or whether it’s just still wait and see.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Okay. Well, thanks very much, Jeremy. Let me take the first one. So in terms of RWA movements for the second half, I think the – there are probably three points I’d want to make. Firstly, we still do have the phase-in of the SA-CCR reform here in Switzerland. So that’s another CHF 3 billion in the third quarter and another CHF 3 billion in the fourth quarter, but I think you know about that. Second point, I think it is important to point this out, that the inflation of risk-weighted assets that resulted from the volatility in March is still largely in the system and in our numbers and it will probably take another year or so for that to be completely amortized out. It doesn’t just drop out in one quarter or two quarters. So we will see, though, if volatility remains at these sorts of levels, some reduction in RWA in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and then into 2021 from that, and that is likely to be the order of – similar sort of order of magnitude, say, CHF 3 billion to CHF 4 billion type magnitude. The third component then is ratings migrations. We did see some increase in RWA in the very low billions from rating migrations in the second quarter. And we may see some further rating migrations in the third quarter, although that clearly will depend on the credit environment which we actually operate. Now just to be clear, Jeremy, so if you add all that up, David is telling me that there is going to be some benefit because I would expect, honestly, at this point, the volatility gain to exceed the ratings migration plus you have the SA-CCR effect, why are we guiding to 12%. And I think the answer is that is intended as a conservative guidance and a reinstatement of what we actually said at the end of 2012. There’s nothing more you should read into that. I think we – I think the key message you should take away from this presentation is preparedness. We do not really know what level of infection we’re going to see in the second half, how governments will choose to respond to that in terms of either lockdowns or extension of state measures or anything else. And therefore, I think being conservative on our capital guidance is the right thing to do. But I think I’ve given you the numbers. There’s nothing else there to read into it in terms of that and that’s why we went back to the 12% number, but it is intended as, I think, a conservative guidance looking forward on our CET1 ratio. I think on the share buyback comment, I would merely say that we informed both the FINMA and all of the core college regulators of everything we’ve said today in advance. So I think our regulators are fully informed of this. I’m sure, basically, we’ll have further discussions with them as we actually go through the preparations for the EGM on the 27th of November and everything else we say there afterwards. But this has obviously been made in the full cognizance of FINMA and the core college.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Yes. I think the question was not only about share buyback and about dividends. And I think we have an excellent relationship with our regulator, and we were not forced to do the first half dividend split, but we – this was a result of constructive discussions and we agreed together with a couple of other banks to do it this way, to look at how second quarter and third quarter are developing. There are other banks in Switzerland that did pay the full dividend and this was the result of very constructive discussions. We have now a situation where we have not only confirmed first quarter, but actually improved on the first quarter in terms of pretax income and profitability. The overall situation is much more stable, so it’s a very constructive dialogue and we don’t have any indications that there are any issues with us paying that second half dividend. In any event, this is the decision by the shareholders.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': 'The first question is regarding the Global Market trading environment. I was wondering if you – I’ve seen your statement, but I was wondering if you could maybe share a little bit more color in terms of your credit business, in particular, how that’s doing in July, but also how you see the second half developing considering we have seen a superb environment clearly in the second quarter and how you’re thinking through the year, which would help us immensely. And in that context, your staff numbers have gone up in Global Markets 9% year-on-year. Just wondering if you could comment what that is related to. The second question is on your overall Wealth Management business especially Asia, if you could talk a little bit about cash balances, where we stand, how they have developed, and in that context, how the client behavior is and what you’re expecting in terms of transactions.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Kian. So generally, July numbers have started reasonably. As you would expect, there’s a certain seasonable slowdown anyway that you have every year. Clearly, the volumes are not at the level that we had, to a large part, in the second quarter, but we are actually satisfied with the start generally in Global Markets in the third quarter. And that is also true for the credit trading. Staff up in GM, I will have to refer to David, but I just want to make a general comment on staff. I mean staff is up globally over the last 12 months and that’s also a result of our disciplined approach of not having engaged on any structural initiatives in the first half of this year, and clearly, generally, in the industry, a lower turnover, if you want, of staff generally.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Yes. And I think, specifically, I think we referred to this, I think, a couple of quarters ago. We’ve actually done a significant amount of in-sourcing both in IT and in our HR functions. So what you’re seeing there is the allocated component of that flowing through to GM in respect to their use of corporate functions. I think I’d also point out, I mean, those costs – or those heads are almost entirely in our lower cost operations, particularly in India. They’re not an increase in staff in some of the higher cost locations. So that’s what’s actually driving that. I think your second question, Kian, was actually around cash balances, so I’ll just give you a few numbers. I mean it has something in common with other things we’ve seen, which is they’ve fallen but they’re still not back to where they were pre-COVID. So at this point, basically, in terms of PB AUM, it’s running at 30%, is actually wholly in money market liquidity. That compares to 32% at the end of the first quarter but basically also compares to 28% in the second half of 2019. So as you see, generally speaking, there has been some drop in cash balances but not back to the levels we saw before. I think you asked specifically about Asia. Asian cash balances are actually around 25%. But the same comment applies basically. It was 27% basically because they dropped back somewhat and that’s kind of true across our Wealth Management businesses. So reduced, but not by any means back to pre-COVID-19 levels.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': 'That’s super helpful.

It’s – of all the three regions, it’s the strongest start also the third quarter is in Asia.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Piers Brown, HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Piers Brown',\n","    'text': 'Yes. I’ve just got a couple left. The first one is just sort of on a different angle in terms of the earlier question on the regulatory dialogue. I wonder if you could just share some color on what sort of regulatory dialogue you may have had on the strategy change and whether there’s anything in there which might change any of the resolvability rebates in terms of the FINMA capital requirements. That’s the first question. And then the second question is a short one in terms of the timing for booking the CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million restructuring charges. Should we think about being more or less front-loaded into the next couple of quarters? Or what sort of timing should we be thinking about for modeling those charges?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Piers. I will take again the first question and David will take the second. So of course, we discussed with our regulator and not only here in Switzerland, but also with our U.S. and UK regulators the plan changes and they were very supportive. And those regulatory changes actually were totally independent on any capital discussions which we’re also having. But as you know, during the last two quarters, the Swiss approach was to actually get less forbearance than probably some of our European neighboring countries benefited. Quite the contrary, we continue to have, for example, the increase in SA-CCR CHF 3 billion per quarter during this year. So the discussions we are having with the regulator are very constructive and we’re very constructive and allowed us also to make this announcement today about those organizational changes.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Yes. I think in terms of two points really. One, did it make any impact on resolvability? No, there’s been no change in any of the resolvability assessments for Credit Suisse. So no comment, no point – no change in that. One point, which I think Thomas alluded to, which relates to regulatory capital relief, which I think has obviously been much more limited in Switzerland than it has been elsewhere, one point I should make, and this is coming back, I think, Jeremy, if you’re still on, to the question you had about capital ratios. We did decide not to take a CHF 3 billion procyclical relief at the end of the second quarter because the volatility had actually dropped so much in the second quarter. So I guess, Jeremy, there’s probably CHF 3 billion of RWA move there, which I should just complete on. But we took that out because, frankly, this isn’t the volatility in the market to actually justify it. So as Thomas said, there’s not a great deal of regulatory relief in terms of these numbers in terms of our RWA numbers, so just to be very clear on that point. I think your second question then was actually around the time and restructuring costs. I would expect them to be accrued relatively evenly over the course of the next four quarters with the cost savings to flow through pretty much on a three to six month lag as we actually complete those measures. I just would reiterate, the reason we’re giving you visibility on this restructuring cost issue is just so you have transparency. The metrics remain reported. But I think it’ll make it easier in subsequent quarters when we actually break that out in the MDA to know that this is what we’re actually telling you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jernej Omahen, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jernej Omahen',\n","    'text': 'I just have two questions left actually. The first one is on Page 15 when you talk about putting the various parts of the Investment Bank back together. And I think, Thomas, you outlined nicely why it was important to kind of ring-fence the various parts back in 2015. I just want to ask you one question. So you say here that reconstituting the Investment Bank is going to allow you to do a number of things, one of them is a more dynamic capital allocation. I was just wondering if you can actually contextualize this for us. What does that actually mean, right? Or a question put differently, what will Credit Suisse be able to do under the new structure that it’s not able to do today? And then the second question I have is on Page 18. So you lay out your new targets. But when we look at these targets, so you got a return on tangible of 10% to 12% and you’re at 12% today and 10% over the past 4 quarters; core Tier 1 of 12%, you’re above that; and core Tier 1 leverage of 4%, you’re above that. So I was just wondering, I mean, how should we think about the level of ambition that’s embedded in these targets? Or are you trying to tell us that the group is over-earning today and there’s going to be significant headwinds? I mean what makes this RoTE target of 10% to 12% ambitious or difficult to achieve?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Jernej, for these two questions. So the dynamic capital allocation was not always so easy between IBCM on one side, Global Markets on the other then APAC Markets as a third component. The way we manage RWA, we have year-end targets, but we also have quarterly updates. And the way we have to manage it depends also very much on the overall market environment. There are times when the primary business is very strong and we want to allocate more business – more RWA to the primary business and there are times where the primary business is not very strong and we want to allocate more to the trading business, and that type of flexibility was much more difficult when you have two separate divisions. And now we have it as one division, so that will allow us to be more nimble and more, frankly, able to take faster decisions along the markets. And the RoTE question and the target question, it’s very clear that in some areas, we are above those, but RoTE last 12 months is 10.4%. We said at the Investor Day last year, we want to be 10% for 2020, and then 2021, 2022, 11% to 12%. And that was obviously before COVID. We have now, in my perspective, in my humble opinion, proven that our model works actually very well also in a financial crisis. And the ambition clearly is to still go to the 11% to 12% range, as we said at the Investor Day, and we are now at 10.4% on a rolling four-quarter basis. So we want to continue to improve. And the CET1 ratio around 12%, we just want to give ourselves a certain cushion and a certain flexibility also because you do not really – you cannot really plan that well in a COVID-19 environment in the short term. And in the mid to long term, we have FRTB. But our view through the cycle is for a business like Crédit Suisse, a 12% CET1 ratio is about right; and CET1 leverage ratio of 4%, which basically tells you a roughly 33% risk density which is more or less where we will operate on, so I think that’s the reason why we have those targets.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Yes. I mean I think just to reinforce what Thomas has said, I think we are being cautious and we’re being conservative in this. We discussed the CET1 ratio. Thomas has gone through the RoTE ratios. And you can – obviously, we’re talking about how we basically accelerate some of the measures we talked overall in terms of cost savings, or for that matter, doubling down with the expansion of ITS to form GTS. I think that’s – but I think that’s appropriate in terms of where we are amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We have high levels of liquidity as well. Now I think, as I said, if we see a continued gentle recovery, then I think that will position Credit Suisse phenomenally well with this degree of preparedness to actually run off some of those excesses and to reinvest into the business. On the other hand, clearly, if we see a significant slowdown again for whatever reason in the autumn, then I think we’re very well prepared to withstand that as well. And I think that’s the appropriate place for us to be. And I think speaking where we are now halfway through the year, I think we need to be cautious and balanced in terms of what we’re saying. But there’s nothing that we’re seeing that you’re not seeing.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen, Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Anke Reingen',\n","    'text': 'I just had a follow-up question on the CHF 400 million of cost savings. Just to confirm, they are on top of your 2% to 3% annual efficiency gains you are planning. And would it be fair to conclude that considering the CHF 400 million, we should be looking at a flattish cost corridor versus the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion in 2020? And then relative to previous indications, you have given us the cost sensitivity and the RoTE. But is it fair to say if you’re closer to the 10% RoTE, more of the CHF 400 million cost savings would come through to the bottom line – to the net line; and the higher end, it’s probably going to be absorbed?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'I mean I think it’s fair enough in this sense we obviously are still very much committed to our 3% saves for 2020 compared to 2019, and that’s part of our book of work. This clearly gives us the ability to extend those saves into 2021 and into 2022 together with everything else we’re actually doing. And therefore, it gives us the ability to very much remain in that type of cost corridor. But I think we’ll probably be able to give you greater guidance towards the end of the year as we see how the environment actually shapes up because, quite clearly, I think we are going to see business opportunities at Crédit Suisse probably in Wealth Management as a consequence of the stressed environment we’re actually seeing and I think we need to be prepared to take advantage of that, and I don’t think we’d rule that out in terms of our steps going forward. But it’s about giving ourselves the flexibility to do that. Quite clearly, if things are difficult, then the cost measures give us that cushion. I don’t think I’d mechanically link it to 10% to 12% type thing. I think that’s a little bit too granular in terms of how we think. But clearly, directionally correct to the extent to which we see things more difficult, we allow the cost saves to drop to the bottom line. To the extent we see things lesser, then we’ll actually choose to make reinvestment decisions.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Yes. Or put it in other words, I very much believe in the concept of self-funding growth. And what we are doing here is allowing us to self-fund our growth initiatives that we have globally. And if you just think, for example, the build-out in China for our onshore banking, those will be significant investments; if you think about our digitalization efforts, about our sustainability efforts, about what Philipp Wehle wants to achieve in the various regions in IWM in terms of investments, et cetera. So this is really about – more about self-funding growth investments than just cost cutting.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Anke Reingen',\n","    'text': 'And just to confirm, the CHF 400 million comes on top of the 2% to 3% per year?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Well, just to be clear, what I said is we’re committed to 3% for 2020 compared to 2019. We also said the CHF 400 million comes through only in full in 2022. So it will be clearly part of our 2021 and 2022 plan. So yes, I’ll leave you to make your own model basically, but I think it gives us the momentum to continue what we’re doing right through into 2022 now.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Amit Goel from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Amit Goel',\n","    'text': 'So two questions. I mean maybe they are a little bit of a follow-up on what’s been said a bit before. But so just in terms of the overall profitability and the kind of 10% to 12%, so when I’m looking at the kind of the broader businesses and so with 2/3 of the group targeting the kind of 20% return on regulatory capital and then 1/3 at 10%, am I to assume then that either there’s obviously maybe some conservatism or Corporate Center and/or ongoing kind of non-core-type impact? Just trying to reconcile the two parts. Obviously, I appreciate there’s a difference between reg cap and seen out, but clearly, there’s still a bit of a differential there. And a second question, again, just on the cost savings and just the broader strategy you’ve kind of reached out for, in particular, on the IB. Just trying to understand, I mean, I guess, over the last three years since 2015 when the business was kind of split into the various parts, that kind of helped to drive better productivity and profitability and some of the cost reduction we’ve seen to date. Just curious in terms of going back to that combined structure, is there also some potential offsets or costs in terms of productivity, et cetera, that we should also be aware of?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. Yes, of course, if you take the 2/3 at 20% and 1/3 at 10% gives you more than 12%, but yes, there is the Corporate Center that you have to factor in as a reduction. And whether it’s conservative or not, we are above these numbers at the moment. That’s clear. You saw that if you look at the four divisions, but at the same time, these are realistic ambitions, in my view. And I will obviously push Brian and the team to be above, 10.01%, maybe more like 11%, 12% or 13% in that area. And I know he has that ambition. And there are certain areas within the three Private Banking divisions where 20% is probably at the low end, like IWM, but typically operates more at the mid-20s in terms of returns, whereas in Switzerland, high teens. But that there are some differentiations within that as well. But I think that’s an illustration how we think about the business. The Private Banking business, clearly higher return, higher growth; the Investment Banking business providing us the scale and the capabilities. And in periods like we saw now in the first half, also very good diversification as we saw. If you compare our results with some of the pure-play private banks here in Switzerland, clearly, you see the benefit of having an integrated model. As far as the IB reshuffle dis-synergies are concerned, I don’t really see any. I only see synergies.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Just a few detailed numbers, I mean. Just firstly, just in terms of completing the maths on the Corporate Center, we’ve not been asked about the Corporate Center, basically, but I think you will have noted the Corporate Center number was, I think, higher than consensus. So I think there’s two points to note in there. One, there was just short of CHF 90 million of provisions in respect of legacy litigation issues associated with the former SRU, which, as you know, is now booked as part of the ARU within the Corporate Center. And two, we’ve obviously seen some snapback in terms of the volatility we saw in the first quarter. So actually, net-net, if you actually strip out the CHF 85 million, US$90 million, plus about CHF 150 million of volatility, you’ll see the Corporate Center is actually running just under the CHF 250 million guidance for ex vol and ex litigation Corporate Center numbers. So just to give you some context there. So I just would perhaps helpfully guide you to the Corporate Center. It’s – I would still expect it to be in the range of CHF 225 million to CHF 250 million per quarter ex volatility and ex litigation. So that’s just one factor. But the other factor clearly is we’re obviously talking about return on tangible equity. We’re not talking about return on CET1, as I think you know. But there is that material difference. I mean the tangible equity is just under CHF 42 billion at the end of the second quarter whereas our CET1 is only about CHF 37.3 billion. So there’s about 11%, 12% of the tangible equity, which is not effective in terms of capital utilization. So if you’re comparing the two, basically, that’s the difference, as you said, between the return on regulatory capital and return on that. So the CC and that has been the two factors there. So hopefully, those numbers are of some use.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. We will now take our last question and the question comes from the line of Adam Terelak, Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Adam Terelak',\n","    'text': 'I just wanted to follow up on the cost again. Does that mean that we could end up below CHF 16 billion in a more challenging environment? So clearly, the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion has a decent comp accrual in it. Take that out and then add the 2% to 3% savings and CHF 400 million, does that mean that the look-forward in a very more challenging environment could end up below that level? And then, secondly, I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the capital return policy. Are you saying distribute a little bit more than 50%? Previously, you’ve given us three buckets being capital return, some that regards regulation and then another chunk to be deployed into the businesses. I just want to know how you’re thinking about that and whether – what sort of growth opportunities do you see in terms of loan growth or other areas to deploy the balance sheet going forward.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Well, just on the cost progression, and again, I’ll try and be helpful, Adam, just in terms of some numbers, really. The first thing, and I did indicate this in my prepared comments, you have seen significant own credit-related volatility in the expenses between both the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter 2019, but more so between the first quarter and the second quarter. Remember, we had a gain in the Corporate Center as a consequence of the credit spread widening. And we’ve obviously seen that snapback basically in the second quarter. So if the first quarter costs, and we did disclose this at the time, was helped by own credit spreads, the second quarter clearly is harmed by it, so – just to be clear on that. And we talked about CHF 58 million on a 2Q year-on-year change number, but the number obviously between the second quarter and first quarter is actually substantially higher than that because we had an opposite credit in terms of that number. I think, quite clearly, in a very challenging market, our cost would be below CHF 16 billion, but it would be a very challenging market given we’re halfway through the year. But obviously, if we were to see a particularly bleak second half environment, the fact that we’ve taken a conservative approach in terms of our compensation accruals does position us better than the other way around would be as we look forward to the end of the year. But we’ll see where we go from there basically. Your second question was on capital return, I believe. Look, I think we’re standing by our existing guidance. I think at that point, that does mean we assume that FRTB comes in 2023 and we have some capital need in respect of that. I think at this point, that’s all I can really say. I think it’s quite possible that we will see the European Union potentially draw back on FRTB and some of the other Basel III reforms, possibly phasing and things like that. And generally, the Swiss approach has been to align to the European Union. But I think, again, speaking where we are now in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I think you should just say we’re assuming no change in terms of the mix as we stand today, but we’ll see how the situation develops over the course of the next six months to a year.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Adam Terelak',\n","    'text': 'But are you still sticking by the comment on Swiss gold-plating on operational risk?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Which comment was that exactly, Adam?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Adam Terelak',\n","    'text': 'Heading into the Basel III finalization, there was some confidence that there may be – that the Swiss would gold-plate already on operational risk and that you’d have some flexibility to maybe absorb the FRTB as an offset not with CMD.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Yes. Not a word I’d personally use, but it’s certainly true that Switzerland has taken a much more conservative approach to operational risk calibration than particularly the rest of the EU, which – where, generally, you will see that operational risk RWA as percentage of the total is a much lower part than it is for Switzerland. So Switzerland, I think, is probably more akin to the United States. And I think you have seen some rollback in the United States some of the operational risk assets. So definitely compared to EU, yes, I think you’re right and we’ll see how that develops. But I’ll be candid, I think the COVID-19 pandemic and everything else has put some of the regulatory debate around these issues somewhat on hold.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': 'Excellent.

Welcome and thank you for joining the Credit Suisse Third Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call for Analyst and Investors. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over Kinner Lakhani, Head of Investor Relations and Group Strategy and Development, please go ahead Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion, we refer you to the Credit Suisse third quarter 2020 financial report, published this morning. I will now hand over to our Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run you through the numbers.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Kinner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our third quarter 2020 results. Before I start with the slide presentation, allow me to make a few remarks about the current environment. We are carefully monitoring with heightened vigilance, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases. Since the crisis began, our first priority has been the safety and well-being of our employees, clients and stakeholders. We stand ready to work with public authorities as we did earlier this year with Switzerland's successful bridge loan program to small and medium sized businesses. I particularly want to thank all of our employees for what they have achieved over the last months in very difficult circumstances, as evidenced by our nearly 10% return on tangible equity over the first nine months of the year, and our successful implementation to-date of the strategic initiatives we announced a couple of months ago, including the creation of a single global investment bank, the integration of our risk and compliance functions, the establishment of SRI, our sustainability research and investment solutions unit and the plant integration of Neue Aargauer Bank or NAB. These initiatives should allow us to invest in our Wealth Management-related businesses in order to build on the considerable progress we have already achieved, and to position ourselves even more strongly in 2021 and beyond as a leading wealth manager with strong global investment banking capabilities. With that, let's turn to the slides. Slide 4, please. As you see on the left side, we reported pre-tax income in the third quarter of CHF 803 million, and net income attributable to shareholders of CHF 546 million. Our Return on Tangible Equity in the third quarter was 5.4%. Let me now go into detail because there were a number of significant items that impacted third quarter figures. In the third quarter, we generated CHF 1.1 billion in adjusted pre-tax income excluding significant items, up 29% year-on-year and at constant FX rates, this growth would have been 41%. We delivered a strong RoTE of 9.8% in the first nine months of the year in a difficult environment and including the seasonally weaker third quarter. Our balance sheet strengthened further last quarter, putting us in an even better position to expand our lending volume and other businesses. Our CET 1 ratio increased from 12.5% in the second quarter to 13% in the third quarter, supporting the ongoing strong capital generation as well as measures we took to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on risk-weighted assets. We delivered net new assets of CHF 11.1 billion in the third quarter, a 6% annualized growth rate with a record NNA from IWA and Private Banking, highlighting solid momentum across our Wealth Management businesses. Our APAC regional revenues grew 29% year-on-year when you exclude the gain from InvestLab in third quarter 2019. The Asia-Pacific region contributes now roughly 20% of total group revenues, which is higher than most of our peers, thereby confirming our strategy to increase investments in Greater China and the broader APAC region. Our global Investment Bank saw an adjusted 14% return on regulatory capital in the first nine months of 2020 with strong revenue growth across all products. The initiatives we announced a couple of months ago, are expected to deliver approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million in gross cost savings from 2022 onwards. We are allowing for reinvestment in full subject to market and economic conditions. We intend to continue to allocate the vast majority of our capital to Wealth Management. Our Board of Directors recommends that shareholders approve the second half of 2019 dividends at an Extraordinary General Meeting on November 27th 2020. We continue to accrue the 2020 dividend in line with guidance of at least 5% growth per annum. We intend to restart share buybacks in January 2021 with a share buyback program of up to CHF 1.5 billion for next year, and an expected repurchase of at least CHF 1 billion subject to market and economic conditions. Next slide, please. Slide 5. As I mentioned, the health of our employees and the well-being of our clients is our top priority. We have taken strong measures, some of which are depicted on this slide to ensure the safety of our colleagues. We continue to deliver solutions for our private, corporate and institutional clients in a challenging environment, including the deployment of best-in-class technology and market making capabilities. We are also seeing increased financing needs, driving loan growth and capital markets, as well as increased demand for private markets and sustainable solutions. Let me say a few words about the macroenvironment. We are a global Swiss based bank, and thus feel that it's important to report in our domestic currency, the Swiss franc. In recent quarters, this also meant dealing with some of the headwinds arising from the strong Swiss franc. This effect was very pronounced in the third quarter compared to one year earlier, due in particular, to the Swiss franc's strength versus the U.S. dollar. In fact, in the third quarter, we suffered from the strongest FX headwinds in nine years. On the other side of the coin, we are also benefiting from the stability of the Swiss economy. Slide 6, please. We were excited to announce the launch of SRI to position Credit Suisse as a sustainability leader. We have made progress on implementing this strategy by providing our clients thought leadership to help them find opportunities in volatile markets. We launched more than 30 global sector teams to focus on thematic reports. We have executed 27 Green, Social and Sustainability Bonds transactions, totaling $15 billion through the first three quarters of 2020, a year-on-year increase of 176%. We also launched key sustainable products for our Wealth Management clients. Page 7, please. As you see on this slide, a number of significant items resulted in the divergence between our reported and underlying revenues in the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, excluding the CHF 327 million InvestLab gain in the third quarter 2019 and at constant FX rates, we grew our pre-tax income by 41% year-on-year during the third quarter. Slide 8, please. Our third quarter 2020 Wealth Management revenues were down 10% on a reported basis. However, if you exclude the impact on the InvestLab gain last year, our revenues were up 5% year-on-year on an adjusted basis at constant FX, led by a 27% rise in transaction revenues. Our APAC business saw a 15% year-on-year rise in underlying constant FX revenues during the third quarter. APAC was the first region to confront the effects of the COVOD-19 pandemic on their economies, and has also been the first to begin emerging from the ensuing downturn. At constant FX rates, underlying IWM PB and SUB PC private client's revenues were broadly flat. Slide 9, please. We have strong contributions across Wealth Management businesses and regions in our CHF 11.1 billion NNA during the third quarter. Although assets under management fell slightly year-on-year in Swiss franc terms, they grew 5% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms, again reflecting some of the headwinds from the strong Swiss currency. Slide 10, please. As you know, we created Global Trading Solutions by combining our successful International Trading Solutions and APAC Solutions businesses. GTS gives us close regional connectivity to Wealth Management, and brings institutional style solutions to Wealth Management clients across multiple time zones. On this slide, you see the success of this initiative with net revenues in GTS up 49% in the third quarter 2020 compared to those former businesses in the third quarter, two years ago in 2018. This slide, sorry, I'm now on Page 11. This slide shows our global investment banking revenues across the group. Revenues for our global investment banking activities increased 12% year-on-year during the third quarter 2022, sorry, 2020, I apologize. This increase was fairly broad based across equity sales and trading, fixed income sales and trading and advisory, with particular strengths in capital markets. Slide 12, please. Here you see the financial highlights over the first nine months of 2020. In a challenging macro environment, we had had strong growth in net revenues and pre-tax income on an adjusted basis and excluding significant items. We also had a strong 18% growth in net income attributable to shareholders. On the right-hand side, you see that on an adjusted basis and excluding significant items, we achieved an average of 18% return on regulatory capital for our three Wealth Management related divisions, and 14% in the Investment Bank, despite taking nearly CHF 1 billion in provision for credit losses across all four divisions. Slide 13, please. Over the last four years, we have steadily grown RoTE, delivering almost 10% in the first nine months of the year, amid a challenging market environment and again, despite taking almost CHF 1 billion of provision for credit losses. This means that we are on the right path towards our medium-term ambition of delivering an RoTE of 10% to 12% in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions, which we reaffirm. For the first nine months of the year, we achieved CHF 3 billion in net income attributable to shareholders. Slide 14, please. This slide goes into greater detail for our credit loan provisions. Our strong nine months results in 2020 came despite adding CHF 958 million in provision for credit losses. It is worth noting that the Swiss Universal Bank accounts for 60% of our loans, and 85% of our loan book held at amortized cost is collateralized. Page 15, please. We are a global bank, but we benefit enormously from our home market of Switzerland, with the SUB historically being an anchor of revenue and profit for us. We continue to build on our high touch strategy for ultra high net worth, corporate and institutional clients by leveraging digital solutions for our high-tech retail and smaller corporate clients, including the launch of our new digital client offering CSX on Monday this week. We achieved 16% return on regulatory capital in the first nine months of 2020. Based on adjusted results, and excluding significant items and our approximately CHF 100 million cost savings program is on track and is expected to be completed by mid-2021. We are successfully progressing our planned integration of NAB. We had a low ratio of credit loss expenses reflecting the quality of our Swiss loan book that I referenced earlier. We have strong growth momentum, including in private clients, where we reported CHF 2 billion of NNA. As they say in sports, you need to be able to win at home. And this is evidenced by our awards, which include Switzerland's Best Bank as well as Switzerland's Best Investment Bank from Euromoney, each for a third consecutive year. We are also retaining the year-to-date #1 ranking in Investment Banking in Switzerland from Dealogic. Page 16, please. We continue to transform our IWM business to meet our client's needs, building strong momentum in asset gathering in both Private Banking and Asset Management by scaling up sustainable investment and financing solutions. We have made strategic hires to drive our mid-market M&A advisory and investment banking origination capabilities, especially in the EMEA region. As you know, we felt that there are ample opportunities within IWM to build on the successful bank for entrepreneur model in APAC and SUB and further strengthened the collaboration between IWM and the IB division beyond GTS, namely, in M&A, capital markets and mid-market lending. We achieved a record NNA of CHF 6.9 billion last quarter in Private Banking, and had CHF 1.9 billion in new loan growth in Private Banking, reversing the deleveraging trend from previous quarters. Finally, we won several regional Wealth Management awards, as depicted at the bottom of this page. Page 17, please. In Asset Management, we are navigating the challenges through the COVID-19 crisis, which has driven underperformance in certain selected alternative strategies. We are restructuring some of these underperforming strategies, driving one-time costs and losses on investment capital. We are targeting gross savings of CHF 50 million in 2021. At the same time, we are seeing continued growth in equity thematics, fixed income and passive businesses. We also continue to see opportunities including significant growth, potential of alternatives and private markets by growing connectivity with our Private Banking businesses. As an example, in Q3 2020, we launched a strategic partnership with the Qatar Investment Authority to form a multi-billion dollar direct private credit platform. Page 18, please. Our APAC franchise continues to execute its wealth centric strategy by deepening our ultra high net worth and entrepreneur client relationship. We have accelerated our China onshore build out. These efforts have allowed us to achieve a divisional return on regulatory capital of 20% in the first nine months of 2020, based on adjusted results and excluding significant items. Looking at retail revenues from Asia Pacific, we have seen 29% year-on-year revenue growth in the third quarter excluding the InvestLab gain. In Swiss franc terms, this is closer to 40%. We also won Asia's Best Bank for Wealth Management for the third time in five years from Euromoney and Equity Derivatives House of the Year from Asia Risk Awards. Page 19. Please. As part of our initiatives announced on July 30, we created a global integrated client centric Investment Bank division built on sales and trading, underwriting and advisory, in order to maximize global connectivity. We have leading positions in our core franchises with more than 80% of the revenues from products, the top five or top six market positions. We have already implemented enhanced capital discipline in our corporate bank, and greater capital flexibility across our businesses. Net revenues for the Investment Bank increased 18% year-on-year during the first nine months of 2020 and our adjusted return on equity capital improved to 14%. With this, I would like to hand over to David for the detailed financials.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much, Thomas. Good morning, everybody. And I'm now going to take you through the financial results in some more detail. I'd like to make two points before we start. First, as you know, we've now moved to four divisions rather than five with a single Investment Bank. And together with the other changes that I summarized in the Restatement Call that we had early this month, we're now presenting those results to you under this new structure. And I've included in the Appendix a slide from our Restatement Presentation that gives you a reminder of these changes. Second, whilst our primary performance remains our reported pre-tax income, I will need to give more emphasis to the adjusted numbers for the next few quarters, particularly for the divisional slides, given the structural changes that I've just outlined. It means that we are incurring the planned restructuring charges we announced last July. You may recall that these amounted to a total of CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million, and we will take them to the end of June 2021. And as a consequence of these restructuring measures, we intend to deliver gross savings of approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million from 2022 onwards. Now, this is a reminder, the primary adjustments that we're making in connection with statutory update are for restructuring and for major litigation expenses. But I'll also continue to make the relevant adjustments for real estate items and business sales. So the definition is consistent with that which we used between 2015 and 2018. And as finally, given the effect of the strengthening of the Swiss franc against many of the currencies in which we conduct business, particularly the U.S. dollar, I will, where it's appropriate highlight and explain that impact throughout the presentation. I'm also going to call out three significant items, the InvestLab transfer, the SIX revaluation and the Pfandbriefbank revaluation, which happened early this year. In the divisional slides, the results presented will also exclude these certain items, and I will show the reconciliations for the divisional performance in the appendix. Let's turn to Slide 21, then. So as Thomas has already summarized, Credit Suisse's businesses were resilient in the third quarter despite the considerable challenges and the uncertainties faced in the world's economies. Our year-to-date performance has been strong with return on tangible equity of just under 10%. And that's not withstanding a cumulative charge from the provision for credit losses totaling CHF 958 million since the beginning of the year. Our CET 1 ratio has also improved by approximately 50 basis points since the end of June. Let me turn now to the financials. And as I said, I want to give you a clear picture both on reported and adjusted excluding certain items, terms. In reported terms, net revenues in the third quarter of 2020, was CHF 5.2 billion, and that's 2% lower year-on-year. This decline though, was driven by currency moves. And on FX constant basis, our revenues increased by 4%. Now if we adjust for InvestLab, the first phase of the InvestLab transfer which was taken in the third quarter of last year, our revenues actually improved by 7%. So therefore, if we put the two together, underlying FX constant revenues increased by 11% in 3Q20 compared to 3Q19. Just to give you a further illustration, in the Investment Bank, our revenues rose by 2% in Swiss franc terms, but that converts into an 11% increase in U.S. dollar terms. In the Wealth Management-related businesses, whilst the adjusted revenue figure excluding certain items fell by 3% on a constant currency basis, would have shown a 2% increase. Now if we look at our allowance for credit losses, as I indicated earlier in the year, the economic stresses have stabilized after sharp deterioration that started back in March. Additional provisions for credit losses for the third quarter totaled CHF 94 million that included CHF 149 million of specific provisions, offset by a CHF 55 million CECL related release. This release in CECL was mainly driven by exposure reductions in the Investment Bank, and in the Swiss Universal Bank, as well as by some improvements in the macroeconomic picture since the second quarter. This is clearly sharply down on the total revision of CHF 296 million that we took in the second quarter of the year. Now, I'd point out that operating expenses in the third quarter have clearly benefited from this FX moves. But they were adversely affected by restructuring costs, and by CHF 124 million year-on-year increase in major litigation provisions, most of which are taken in the corporate center. So our pre-tax income stood at CHF 803 million in the quarter, that's a decrease of 30% year-on-year, will be on an adjusted basis excluding the certain items I've listed before, we would have seen a pre-tax income of CHF 1.87 billion, that's a 29% increase. Now, just to complete the picture in terms of currency impact, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted pre-tax income would have been a further CHF 103 million if currency rates, particularly the U.S. dollar were at the same level in 3Q20 as they were in 3Q19. Just turning to tax, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32%. That means that including the benefit of the tax reversals that I discussed back in April, our tax rate for the first nine months of the year was 15%. My guidance for the full year is that I expect our tax rate to be close to 20%. And it should then stabilize around the mid-20s in 2021. And of course, I'd repeat my caveat that this depends on any taxation changes in the countries in which we operate not least in the United States, over the next couple of years. Overall net income attributable to shareholders stood at CHF 546 million, a decline of 38% year-on-year. We saw a return on tangible equity of 5% for the third quarter, taking the total for the nine months to just short of 10%. Now let me turn now to the CET 1 ratio on Slide 22. Our CET 1 ratio for the quarter was 13.0% and that compares to 12.5% at the end of the second quarter. That resulted from strong capital generation with pre-tax income, contributing around 30 basis points of the growth. I'd also note this was out at the level of the temporary IWA forbearances that have been granted by other regulators to some of our peers. As was the case in the second quarter, we saw reduction in risk weighted assets, partly due to a roll off in COVID related increase since March, but also due to our ongoing active optimization of corporate bank lending by the Investment Bank. Please note that we have absorbed just under CHF 3 billion of RWA inflation resulting from the SA-CCR phase-in during the quarter. Then in terms of capital distribution, as Thomas has already stated, we intend to recommend to shareholders that they approve the payment of the second half of the 2019 dividend. And that's equivalent to CHF 0.1388 per share at an Extraordinary General Meeting, which will be held on the 27th of November. Further, we've continued to accrue for 2020 dividend in line of our policy that is an increase of at least 5% per annum. And I can confirm that we have accrued and has already deducted from our capital CHF 574 million for the first nine months of this year. As Thomas has already mentioned, we intend to resume a share buyback program at the beginning of 2021. The Board has approved a program of up to CHF 1.5 billion for next year, with at least CHF 1 billion expected to be purchased in the year subject to market and economic conditions. Let me turn to leverage. During the third quarter, our CET 1 leverage ratio remained stable at 4.5% and our Tier 1 leverage ratio improved by approximately 10 basis points to 6.3%. Any improvement in our Tier 1 leverage ratio primarily resulted from an AT 1 issuance of $1.5 billion U.S. dollars in August. And just a brief note on net interest income. On a constant currency basis, I would expect the total net interest income for the year to be approximately flat for 2020, compared to 2019, with the lowest U.S. dollar interest rates eliminating the gains that we've made elsewhere. Now, if we look forward to 2021, I would expect loan growth to mitigate the adverse effects of low rates in our businesses. But you will recall that just under a year ago, we redenominated our operational risk RWA into U.S. dollars and as a consequence of which we've put on a substantial forward swap portfolio. I'd expect that the roll off of this portfolio could cost us up to about CHF 100 million of net interest income next year. And we may not be able to mitigate all of this through loan growth and other measures. Now, I've spoken previously about our conservative approach liquidity management, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. And I continue to believe that our liquidity coverage ratio of 190% is both appropriate and amongst the highest of the major banks. Let's turn to tangible book value per share, please. This slide illustrates the progression of our tangible book value per share for the first nine months of the year. This has grown from CHF 15.86 to CHF 16.89 during the year, and is broadly unchanged quarter-on-quarter compared to CHF 17.03 at the end of June. Now I think the picture is similar to that which I described three months ago, with net income equivalent to CHF 1.24 per share for the nine-month period. A further reversal in the third quarter of the widening in credit spreads that we saw earlier in 2020 resulted a net increase so far this year from own credit moves of CHF 0.48 per share. And finally, there is going to be an adverse FX impact of CHF 0.78 per share due to the strengthening the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar. Let me turn now to the restructuring program. What I show here is the expected trajectory of expenses relating to the restructuring measures that we announced in July. In the third quarter, we spent CHF 107 million, primarily across SUB, the Investment Bank and IWM and primarily driven by redundancy expenses relating to the measures we've taken. And I've included the exact amounts in the divisional slides and in the financial report. I'd expect that we will spend a similar amount in the fourth quarter of this year, with a total spend for the year still anticipated to be around CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million by the end of June. We intend to achieve, as we said before, gross savings of approximately CHF 250 million to CHF 300 million in 2021, and approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million annually from 2022. In terms of our overall cost guidance the full year, our adjusted operating expenses in the first nine months totaled CHF 12.3 billion. But I would though expect that the figure will be towards the upper end of the range of CHF 16.0 billion to CHF 16.5 billion for the full year, depending on the final variable compensation awards. Let's look at our allowance for credit losses, please. I think everyone knows that Credit Suisse is unusual and that we are a Swiss-based bank, and that we report under the U.S. GAAP rather than IFRS. And that means we're subject to the more conservative CECL rules. And as you know, CECL requires and estimate the loss over the lifetime of the loans, and therefore generally up fronts more of the impact of credit risk than IFRS 9 does. Now I think in broad terms, the CECL provisioning depends both on the absolute level of credit exposure we have and the economic outlook for that credit exposure. What you see in the third quarter, that we've taken CHF 149 million in additional specific provisions. But the CECL balance has been reduced by CHF 55 million, predominantly reflecting both the marginal improvements in macroeconomic factors that Thomas has already summarized, and a reduction in Investment Bank and Swiss Universal Bank exposures. Now if we take into account CHF 135 million of net write offs, and other factors including FX translation, our overall allowance for credit losses, stands at CHF 1.96 billion. Now as we've done before, I want to just give the comparison with those of our peers who've reported for the third quarter so far and given sufficient information to make this comparison. What we show here is the level of credit reserves that we have against loans within the Investment Bank, which should be comparable to the wholesale loan exposures of these peers. At the end of the third quarter, the figure stood at 2.0%, that's down slightly compared to three months ago. But it still exceeds that of all of those peers who have reported so far and have published the data to make this comparison. Now, let me turn now to the divisional performances and start with the Swiss Universal Bank on Slide 28. I'd remind you, we'll be showing adjusted numbers, excluding significant items throughout. Adjusted net revenues in the Swiss Universal Bank increased by 1% year-on-year to CHF 1.3 billion, driven by strong transaction-based activity but partly offset by low recurring revenues. Our adjusted operating expenses fell by 2% as we remain disciplined on cost, whilst we continue to invest in our digital offering, notably with the launch of CFX, our low-cost digital banking platform, early this week. The Swiss Universal Bank generated and adjusted pre-tax income, excluding significant items of CHF 471 million, flat compared to the same period last year. You'll see that this is after an additional provision for credit losses of CHF 52 million compared to CHF 28 million in the second quarter of this year. And the majority of this increase was driven by a single specific case in the corporate and institutional client's portfolio. As we said already, you'll note we've released CHF 36 million of CECR related provisions as our assessment of the Swiss macroeconomic outlook has improved since the second quarter. Turning to Private Clients, our adjusted net revenues excluding certain items increased by 1%, year-on-year, with heightened client activity for the quarter, partly offset by lower revenues from Swisscard. In terms of net new assets, we saw strong net inflows of CHF 2.0 billion during the quarter, reversing the outflows we've seen in prior quarters with contributions across the franchise. Adjusted net revenues for the C&IC were also 1% higher, driven by a strong performance in Investment Banking with this within this division, and by GTS, although this was in part offset by lower net interest income. And again, we saw our improve net new assets compared to the second quarter with CHF 3.5 of net inflows, and have primarily been driven by a stable performance from our pension fund business. Let's turn to Slide 30 for IWM. We saw a stable performance in our Private Banking business, albeit, this was adversely impacted by the translation effect of the weakness in the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc. Asset Management had a tougher quarter, with economic conditions adversely affecting our alternatives business, offsetting a strong performance from traditional fronts, which are much more closely integrated with our Private Banking business. The quarter saw a strong increase in net new assets totaling CHF 11.9 billion. Our adjusted pre-tax profit excluding certain items was CHF 268 million, a decline of 30% year-on-year with corresponding net revenues 12% lower. In terms of the FX impact, I spoke about before, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted net revenues excluding significant items would have been 6% lower with the corresponding pre-tax income, 23% lower primarily in Asset Management. If we turn to the subdivisions, Private Banking saw strong growth in net new assets totaling CHF 6.9 billion, with a good performance in brokerage and other transaction-based revenues including higher GTS revenues. That was offset by reduction in net interest income, predominantly due to lower U.S. dollar rates, and low recurring commissions and fees. Overall adjusted net revenues excluding significant items were 8% lower with pre-tax income on the same basis, 13% lower. On a constant currency basis, our revenues were flat, with the corresponding pre-tax income 2% lower. Now if I turn to Asset Management, we've continued to grow our traditional asset management business, helped by strong performances in our fixed income, thematic equities and index funds with net new assets of CHF 5 billion. However, the primary U.S. based alternatives business has had a much more difficult experience. It's continued to suffer from several factors. First, adverse performance in certain of the businesses and the strategies we're invested in. Second, from a delay in placement revenues and finally, I'd remind you that the third quarter of last year, including a significant realization in our transit business that benefited the third quarter results has not been repeated this quarter. We've continued to recover the unrealized credit investment related losses incurred in the first quarter. But this has been offset by a further deterioration in our investments in real estate funds of CHF 21 million, again in the U.S. alternatives business. We continue to review our alternative investment portfolio, and we'd expect to see further restructuring costs, as well as potential markdowns in our investments depending on performance. Across IWM, we intend to take full year restructuring costs of around CHF 75 million, creating gross savings around CHF 80 million by 2021, of which we'd expect more than half to be in Asset Management. Let me turn now to Slide 32, and Asia Pacific. Our Asia-Pacific division again reported a resilient performance with adjusted pre-tax income, excluding certain items improving by 4% to CHF 179 million, and net revenues on the same basis by 7% to CHF 728 million. This was in spite of the weakness in the U.S. dollar and dollar linked currencies. On a constant currency basis, adjusted pre-tax income would have been about CHF 21 million higher. But I'd also note, that our total Asian franchise revenues, that is the revenues we book in the APAC division to get those revenues booked elsewhere in the bank increased by 29% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to third quarter of 2019 and in constant currency terms increase by almost 40% year-on-year. Our net new assets totaled CHF 2.2 billion in the quarter, continuing the positive trend year-to-date. And we saw a 32% increase in transaction-based revenues with heightened client activity, a strong contribution from GTS, and increased ECM activity, partly offset by lower financing revenues. Our net interest income was about 12% lower with compressed margins on deposits and low lending volumes following the deleveraging that we saw in the first half of this year. Our operating expenses rose by 3%, notwithstanding the benefit from FX moves. This was primarily driven by higher accruals for variable compensation compared to a year ago. However, additional provisions for credit losses were slightly down compared to the second quarter of the year at CHF 45 million. Now let me conclude then with slide 34 and the Investment Bank. As I mentioned earlier, at the start of my presentation, the Investment Bank delivered a strong set of results with net revenues 11% higher at CHF 2.2 billion sorry, at $2.2 billion. And I would note that this is against a strong comparable in the third quarter of last year, when we had a particularly good performance in our securitized products business. Please recall as well, APAC business does not have the scale of exposure to rates that our peers do. Our business is more credit driven, as you know, and has been driven more by, I think a sustainable quest for yield than by the volatility we've seen in the interest rate market so far this year. We've seen high levels of activity, both in capital markets with share gains in ECM in particular, and in trading with higher cash and prime, a particular feature in the Asia part of the Investment Bank. We've also made good progress building out our capital markets pipeline, particularly in leveraged finance. As I said already regard to SUB, IWM and APAC, our GTS revenues contributed strongly, in this case across macro emerging products, in particular, providing further evidence of the collaboration we're increasingly seeing between the Investment Bank and our Wealth Management related businesses. The release of $37 million of CCL provisions due to the exposure reductions of the corporate bank contributed to a net release of provisions for credit losses of $16 million, compared to the overall provision of $148 million that we took in the second quarter of the year. Our adjusted operating expenses were about 6% higher than the third quarter of 2019, and again that was primarily due to higher variable compensation across this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2019, a net result is an adjusted pre-tax income of CHF $464 million, an increase of 49% year-on-year. Finally, well as leverage has increased compared to the end of the second quarter due to some increase in our COVID-related liquidity buffers, as well as higher period and cash inflows which we should reverse, I would point out that the Investment Bank's capital utilization remains at a third of the group's total, in line with the targets that Thomas announced in July. With that, I'd like to conclude and hand back to Thomas. Thomas?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, David. Let's move to page 37, please. Allow me to summarize, our return on tangible equity over the last 12 months through September was 9.5% in a difficult environment, and close to our pre-COVID ambition of delivering approximately 10% for 2020. Furthermore, we have been able to grow our tangible book value per share, which was nearly CHF 17 at the end of the third quarter. Page 38, please. Here you see our clear path to achieving a 10% to 12% RoTE over the medium term. This is based on an ambition of 20% to 25% return on regulatory capital for our Wealth Management-related businesses and a 10% to 50% RoRC in the Investment Bank. As our nine-month 2020 figures show, on an adjusted basis excluding significant items, we were at 14% RoRC in the Investment Bank, and 18% in our Wealth Management-related businesses, despite nearly CHF 1 billion in provision for credit losses across all four businesses. Slide 39. Let me summarize our financial ambitions. As just reconfirmed, we aim to achieve a 10% to 12% RoTE over the medium term in a normalized environment, maintain a CET 1 ratio of greater than 12% before the final impact of Basel III reforms and achieve a CET 1 leverage ratio of around 4% by the end of 2020 and beyond, all subject to market and economic conditions. In terms of our capital distribution, we expect approval of our second half 2019 dividend of CHF 0.2776 per share at an AGM on November 27. Looking forward into 2021, we expect to distribute at least 50% of net income attributable to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions. We are currently accruing for a 2020 dividend consistent with our policy to increase our dividend by at least 5% per annum. We intend to launch a share buyback program in early Q1 2021 of up to CHF 1.5 billion for the calendar year 2021 with at least CHF 1 billion, subject to market conditions. Slide 40. We expect a total capital distribution in 2020 of around CHF 1 billion, paid and payable to shareholders. For 2021, we expect a total of around CHF 1.8 billion to CHF 2.3 billion payable to shareholders through a dividend of at least CHF 765 million, and the share buyback of between CHF I billion and CHF 1.5 billion. Finally, before we take questions, Kinner has asked me to make one more announcement. Please mark Tuesday the 15th of December in your diaries for the 2020 Credit Suisse Investor Update, which will be held virtually. Our IR team will follow up shortly with more details. I will now hand back to Kinner for Q&A.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, Thomas and David. We will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. Operator, let's open the line.\\nQuestion-and:\\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Thank you, very much and good morning. My questions are around capital and of course, the announced share buybacks as well. So I'm going to refer to Page 22 of the presentation. So my first question is really about kind of risk weighted asset's trajectory going forward. You have kind of shown us the regulatory inflation from CA-CCR. You have also kind of shown us how the respective assets kind of grow from the perspective of underlying business. But of course, also, we have seen the reduction for the optimization of some of your Investment Banking balance sheet. So my question is kind of going forward, are we likely to see more of those? Are we likely to see kind of more efforts from a perspective of the actual optimization of the balance sheet? And if you could also kind of remind us if remainder of the regulatory impact, you're going to see that would be very useful too. And my last thing is, could you - could you summarize for us, kind of once again, and I know you've done it numerous times before, but why do you think 12% from now on, as the business spend is the right targets for you, particularly with those kind of very high kind of share buybacks announced today and I assume, being rolled forward, as well? Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Magdalena, good morning. Nice to speak to you.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Good morning.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much and just a few points, then really. So I think in terms of capital going forward, we - I think just in terms of the [reg], we actually took about CHF 2.8 billion of SA-CCR increases in the third quarter, I think, you know? And I would expect something of the same order in the fourth quarter, which completes the phase-in of the SA-CCR process. And that will be the bulk of the regulatory impact in the fourth quarter. And to give you some guidance, we do not expect to see particularly much in 2021, which may be helpful. And I think in terms of capital utilization for the fourth quarter, I think there's two trends. I think one, I think, yes, we will continue to optimize some of our COVID exposure, we will continue to optimize the corporate bank. But against that, I think, we have seen a pickup in loan demand, obviously notably in IWN this quarter, we've seen continued growth in SUB. And if you look at APAC after deleveraging that we suffered for several quarters that essentially came to an end in the third quarter. So I would expect us to see some increase in the amount of capital we have invested in our loan portfolio across the Wealth Management divisions over both the fourth quarter and into 2021. And what does that mean, in terms of the CET 1 ratio? I mean, I would be very surprised to see our CET 1 ratio to drop close to the 12% in the next quarter. I think it more likely will be somewhere in the sort of 12.5% to 13%. I think that gives us a very comfortable position, both to finance the loan growth in our Wealth Management businesses, and to basically finance both the dividend plans and the share buyback plans. Now, clearly, you know the dividends for second half of 2019 has already been deducted from our capitalization has been for this year. And obviously, we've also deducted three quarters of the dividend for 2020 at plus 5% from what we've accrued already. So you can see where we sit from a sort of capital point of view. And is 12% the right number? I think it feels right, to me at this point, given the macroeconomic uncertainties in which we actually operate in. I think, there clearly is obviously negative news around COVID-19 infections as we can all see. And it clearly does create further economic uncertainties, which may well mean that our clients have more demand for our services than perhaps we expected, or we may see more volatility elsewhere. But I think therefore, I think guarding to a 12% floor, pre-FRTB etc., etc., I think seems to be a prudent thing for our policy at this point. And when we look at what that means, in terms of our share buyback, we think that's very much financeable in the context of our existing guidance and clearly starting at 13% is a good place to start with. And does that answer your question, Magdalena?\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Yes, yes, it does. I kind of - it's I think that you know, there's a little bit of a discussion in the market from the perspective of what are the - what are the right kind of levels for the restructure of the business kind of now on, let's just say, three to five-year view before, of course, the last the last waves of Basel. But I have to say I was kind of very pleased to kind of seeing those and the commitment to share buyback. So and thank you for that.\\nDavid Mathers: So Magdalena, as I said, I think, - I think we said the 12% as being a floor. I wouldn't expect us to be close to it in the fourth quarter. So please don't assume that. But what we have therefore, I think is the potential to fund the Wealth Management business growth, to fund the GTS business growth and to fund the share buyback as well as our dividend commitments.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Perfect, thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee, Exane. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nJeremy Sigee: Good morning, thank you. And firstly could I just follow up on that previous discussion. So you talked about expectations for 4Q. And as you look into next year, and assuming you get permission to the buybacks, I just wondered at what level you would calibrate buybacks to? Again, it's the same debate about, would you calibrate it to 12% or 12.5 or do you feel comfortable closer to 13? So, it's the same question in a different way. Well would you that the comfortable capital ratio, particularly in relation to, calibrating buybacks as you go into next year? And then my second question is on Slide 38, your return on tangible equity targets, and getting up into the 10% to 12% range that you're very close to. And the slide indicates that this needs to come from the Wealth Management side. And I just wondered how confident you feel about that, at this point in time looking into next year, in terms of moving parts? I mean, I guess you've got some of the cost savings coming through but I just wondered if there any other obvious elements that you can see on a 12-month view that would get you into that RoTE range on the Wealth Management side?\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much, Jeremy, thank you very much. Perhaps if I take the first and then I'll hand over to Thomas in terms of our Wealth Management and business plans for next year. And I think, firstly, in terms of the share buyback, I already do have the approval from the Board of directors for the share buyback to resume in January 2021, at the target level of up to CHF 1.5 billion and a targeted minimum of CHF 1 billion. Both Thomas and I have clearly discussed that formerly with FINRA and we have received a statement of no objection from FINRA to this. So therefore, we are where we are in terms of the process. But and just to be clear on that particular point. And I think prudently, because I think we do have to recognize that we remain in an uncertain economic environment, that I think that's why I've said 12%. And as I said, to Magdalena, probably somewhere in the 12.5% to 13%. And I think from a Tier 1 capital point of view, I would attempt to run the bank something in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% compared to the current 18.3% Tier 1 ratio. Now, we can review that in the course of 2021. But I think there has to be a prudent balance between, I think first of all, paying our dividend commitments to shareholders, which is the most important thing. Secondly, providing the capital for the loan growth in the Wealth Management business and thirdly, finding a reasonable level of share buyback, which I do think the commitment of CHF 1.5 billion, minimum CHF 1 billion is about the right order of magnitude, as we said. And but that's what I'd say in terms of the share capital. I guess, Jeremy, we could run the CET 1 ratio lower. But I don't think that really seems prudent at this point, in terms of where we are in the cycle and with the uncertainties we actually have. And that's not implied, or required as part of our share buyback plan. On the second point, Thomas?\\nThomas Gottstein: Yeah, so if you look at Page 38, you see the RoRC for the three Private Banking led divisions, IWM, APAC, and SUB with 21%, 20% and 16%. And remember that this is with elevated PCLs, provision for credit losses, which are over CHF 500 million for these three divisions. We see substantial growth in Asia, we see a very strong momentum in IWM in terms of NNA and in terms of hiring. And traditionally, both of these divisions have been operating more in the mid-20s in terms of especially IWM the mid to high-20s, in terms of RoRC. And I think that the SUB has the ability to be in the high-teens in terms of RoRCs or between 16% and 19%. And therefore, I think on a normalized basis, this is an absolutely realistic target. And in fact, if you look at the absolute targets, as we are finalizing our budget for next year, the 20% to 25% range is a very solid ambition that I feel comfortable with. And from that perspective, if you look at IB, we are 14%, clearly benefited from elevated levels in terms of trading in capital markets, but also in certain areas where we are traditionally on a relative basis at least stronger, namely credit [lessen] we've had relatively seen less activity. So from that perspective, we feel are well positioned there. And we have been hiring also in M&A and are seeing positive momentum there as well. So from that perspective, we have a clear path towards the 10% plus, in '21 and beyond.\\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you, that's wonderful answer. Can I just come back to David's comments on the capital, so I agree with you about being more comfortable in the sort of 12.5% to 13% range? I wasn't trying to encourage you to get it right down to 12%. So I agree very much with what you're saying there. And then secondly, just to clarify, so you're saying that you're fully approved by the regulator to start share buybacks in January? Or is there a further step of approval that needs to be done?\\nDavid Mathers: No, and as I said, it's not that regulator approves or disapproves. We have submitted our proposal to FINRA. And they've formally said no objection to those proposals. The decision then is the subject for the Board, which as I said already has recommended the restart of the share buyback program, and obviously for management in terms of the execution of that.\\nJeremy Sigee: Okay and that's good to know. Thank you very much.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nAndrew Coombs: Yeah, I have just follow-up on the capital standpoint and then discussing some of the gross margins in Private Banking divisions. Previously, you always suggested a 50% payout, 20% of growth and then 30% of regulatory inflation. It now sounds like the buyback and dividend is being more pinned to a capital level. So, is that correct to you? Are you moving away from that 50% payout guidance and instead it's a function of excess capital? And the second question is on the gross margins, if I look at Slide 45, there has been a step down in IWM and APAC gross margins. Obviously, by looking at gross margin, that should ease out some of the FX adjustments. And within that your transaction, transaction remain fairly resilient. So perhaps you could just comment on the recurring side of the revenue stream. And you've already talked about NII that through the currency side both in IWM and APAC? Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks very much. I mean, I think just to be clear, on Slide 39, we said that we expect to distribute at least 50% of our net income in 2021. So our policy does remain unchanged in terms of that. But I think we felt it would be most important for our shareholders to (a) I think have clear disclosure on our dividend policy, both for the 2H19 dividend and for the '20 dividend and (b) an indicated indicative amount of how much we'd actually spend in terms of the share buyback program for next year. So I - we thought that would be most helpful. And I think there's more clarity to our investors, basically. I think on the second point, in terms of the gross margin, I mean, I think that the key points, so that was a balance sheet question really around preparing this transactional, this NII. I mean, I think clearly, I think you - I think you're more focused SUB, on IWM and APAC. Clearly, just on SUB, the weakness in the recurring margin is due to the drag from Swisscard, which unsurprisingly, given the obviously limited amount of travel people are doing at this point, we're obviously seeing a lot lower spending on Swisscard than we normally expect to see at this point. And that comes through in terms of the recurring line as it's a 50% joint venture with American Express. I think if we look at the other numbers then in terms of IWM and APAC, and I would suggest we go to the more detailed slides at the back. So if we could actually turn to slide 43, if could have that one, basically, then you can see recurring was down about 9% in the Private Banking business, that's almost exactly the currency fall. I mean, there's other factors going on but it's basically that is driven primarily by the currency fall. And if we then go to Asia Pacific, in terms of their numbers, which I think that is also primarily currency driven as well, please. Which was down in that point, but so I'm sorry, let me just get to the right slide. Yeah, I mean, the recurring was down 11%, so 9% of that would be currency and 2%, we did see some fall in banking services. So that's what I'd raise around recurring, I think. I think clearly the growth in net new assets we've seen, obviously most notably in IWM but I would point out that we saw positive net new assets in all three divisions. We'll be hopeful for future business flows including recurring income. But I think it's been a bit swamped by currency this quarter.\\nAndrew Coombs: Okay, I think in Slide 32, you are probably looking for on APAC, and it was I believe 50% payout and given the wording of at least and the 20% median mark for growth and 30% that you previously had marked the reg-inflation, is it fair to assume the 20% growth is still valid but the 30% reg-inflation could be a lot lower?\\nDavid Mathers: I think we'll see how it pans out, basically. I mean, that was always a long term, multi-year projection, and at this point, FRTB is still scheduled to be implemented in Switzerland in 2023. I think you know that there are some discussions in the EU around the postponement of FRTB, I think until 2025 and potentially no implementation at all of FRTB if the U.S. authorities do not implement FRTB of U.S. banks. I believe that is the proposal either rumored or leaked or announced from the European authorities. But I think we know, I think we'll have to see how the EU proposal develops. And then what the Swiss response to that actually is at that point, but there has generally been a policy of alignment to EU in terms of these things. But at the moment, we kind of have to assume FRTB in '23 but reg inflation, otherwise will be relatively limited in '21, as I said, already.\\nAndrew Coombs: Thank you very much.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nBenjamin Goy: Hi, good morning, and two questions for my side, please. First on Asset Management, you mentioned you're repositioning some of your alternative strategy. I'm just wondering so do you feel there's actually less autonomy needed or given the performance recently? Or is there also a potential to give to the segment or to actually create a segment and to give the business more autonomy and going forward, also, potentially, maybe think about M&A? And then secondly, with respect to wealth management, and I hear comments on loan demand. I was wondering whether you're also getting a bit more active in kind of pursuing loan growth going forward as a way to mitigate market pressure? Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yeah. Hi, Benjamin. So if we start with the Asset Management question, well we have a very strong performance 2016-2019. PGIs grew by 18%, assets under management in Swiss franc terms grew by 11% per annum, so these are compound annual growth rates per year, we have now two thirds in alternative for alternative [light and one third in more traditional and index products. I think we're well positioned. 2020 is a little bit of a transition year. We are now restructuring some of the operations and also restructuring some of the strategies. But overall, I think we are very well positioned. We have no intention to do any M&A at this stage in Asset Management, but we are - we have been addressing selected underperformance of certain alternative strategies, which in the short term has a little bit of a drag on our P&L. But overall, we feel we have the right strategy with being more alternative and alternative light focused. And that's how I would answer the Asset Management question. On Wealth Management, it is true that we had, if you take the first nine months, and especially the first half negative loan growth, actually it was a result of deleveraging, especially in IWM and in APAC, but this has started to reverse. And we are very much focused on loan growth. We see a lot of opportunities, a lot of demand by clients. And it's one of our main targets to grow our longer loan book in all three private banking led divisions in particular, IWM and APAC.\\nBenjamin Goy: Understood. Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nAnke Reingen: Yeah, thank you very much. Just a follow up question on the Asset Management operation, please. I mean, it's on every slide, there us some so-called accolades about the achievements, number one, number two in certain products, and the Asset Management division doesn't just show that performance. I was wondering, what what's the long term? Is there like a name to get to the #1 and in certain products #2 and if not, you might revisit it within your business mix? And then secondly, just the strong net new money across the different regions. Could you point to certain drivers of that strong momentum and do you think it's going to continue or is it just naturally generally just very volatile and hard to say? Thanks a lot.\\nThomas Gottstein: The question on asset management was about the performance of, sorry, could you clarify exactly what the question was on asset management?\\nAnke Reingen: Yeah, so I saw like going through your slides, every slide shows some so-called accolades.\\nThomas Gottstein: Slide 17.\\nAnke Reingen: Number one and then like at a division, you basically have #1 Private Bank in Asia or so. And the Asset Management seems to be a bit light on the points. So is there - is there a point where you say, or this Asset Management division has, what's the long-term strategy? I mean, I guess you said that it's strategic important. But do you have a - do you want that at certain point when it needs to improve on and performance needs to move up in ranking or you would visit it within your group mix? Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Well, actually, if you look at the margins, we are making in our Asset Management business, and as I mentioned, also, the growth momentum we had between 2016 and 2019, I think they are very strong, also in comparison to our peers, especially because two thirds of our portfolio is in alternatives or alternative flight. So from that perspective, we feel we have a highly attractive and profitable business. But there are some areas where we need to do some restructuring. And from that perspective, we are also satisfied with the performance in some of the funds. The two we're mentioning here are more in fixed income, and in some of the equity strategies, but also some of the alternatives like in CIT, where we are doing extremely well. So and we have now, for example, launched the partnership with the Qatar Investment Authority. This will be a private credit platform, direct private credit platform, and there are further projects we have in high yield and other areas where we're trying to ramp up our fund business. So that's on the Asset Management side. In Wealth Management, in M&A terms, I think in emerging markets, or let's call it more in the APAC and IWM side, we want to grow on an annualized basis between 3% and 5% per year. And in Switzerland, it's more between 2% and 4%. And that's really our goal. But the way I look at it is more on a client business volume. So it's not only NNA, which only relates to AuM but it's about credit volume, it's about AuM volume and it's about custody assets. And if you add them up, we've been growing steadily over the last few years. But I would like to see an increase in there, as we have some very clear strategies for each of the SUB businesses be it in Asia, for example, in China, in Korea, in Vietnam in other areas, as well as in the IWM area. Whether it's the Middle East, Latin America, Western Europe, and we had some very positive hiring momentum in some of these SUB regions. And in Switzerland, we have now launched CSX to also have more growth on the retail and affluent side, in addition to a continued positive momentum on the premium clients and upper high net worth side where we are working very closely also with the Corporate and Investment Banking colleagues, as part of our bank for entrepreneur strategy. So I think generally we are actually very well positioned to continue on this growth pattern.\\nAnke Reingen: Okay, thank you very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Terelak, Mediobanca. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nAdam Terelak: Yes, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I had one on NII and another one on expenses. You talked about the swap portfolio on the operational risk RWA. You've given on 2021, I was wondering kind of what duration that swap is and whether that should be a long term NII pressure to model through your numbers? And then also kind of, you're talking about loan growth to offset, whether there is enough loan growth to offset that on it on a multi-year basis, rather than just for next year? And then on expenses, clearly, FX translation is a topic for the quarter. You've given guidance for 2020 on expenses, the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion. I know it's a long way out and there's a lot of moving parts, but would that range potentially come down into next year because of the translation effect on the weaker dollar? Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks very much. Good questions. Thanks, Adam. I think it says the net interest income. I mean, I don't think I think I've generally given guidance before but often in Q&A, but I thought, just in case, nobody asked that and actually included in the script this morning. I think as I said, if we look at our net interest income for 2020, we clearly are seeing significant pressure from the falling U.S. dollar rates. And you see that across the businesses. And that's why basically I'm saying I'd expect our '20 net interest income to be roughly the same as it was in 2019. Because the measures that we took in 2019 including the dollar-ization of op risk, but also the other measures we took here in Switzerland, are being offset by that margin pressures. So there's clearly quite a bit going on in '20 as you'd expect, in terms of absorbing that. If I look at '21 and as I said, I think in terms of the residual margin pressure across that businesses, I would expect that to be offset by loan growth. That's - I think that's straightforward and what I can't commit to at this point, and we'll do our best to give more guidance as we continue, is well that loan growth will be sufficient to fully offset that CHF 100 million as that swap portfolio runs off. Remember, I think we announced this project back in the fourth quarter of last year. I think I said at that point, we termed out two years. So clearly, the bulk of this effect will be in 21 but it's not a cliff type thing, they're actually spread out. We actually see some in the short term, and then it phases through. I would have thought basically though but by '22, that essentially loan growth will be more than sufficient to offset the residual effects. But I think I just wanted to be clear, around '21 compared to '20 in terms of this. And I think on expenses, I think, the - as I said the - I guess the annualized run rate at this point is somewhere around CHF 16.4 billion of adjusted operating expenses if you take the first three quarters and multiply it up. So that would appear to be the top end of our range of CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion. You know, I think clear caveat on that in that, we have continued to accrue relatively conservatively for compensation. As I said, the 3Q20 comp across were up meaningfully compared to 3Q19. I feel the actual outturn will depend on just where compensation actually lands this year, which will depend pretty on performance and it will also depend on what we see across the peers. And I think also, the approach that we, as a bank, choose to take around the payment of variable compensation during the middle of a COVID crisis, which is an important factor for us. And I think looking towards 2021, I think we've been clear. There was a slide in terms of how much restructuring, which should yield benefits for next year. Although I would point out the bulk the benefits, the CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million only comes through in 2022. I think we'll have to make decisions as we go in through '21, which is how much of that we choose to reinvest and how much we release in terms of the expense number. And I'm not going to add more to that now. We are - we've announced obviously a Capital Markets Day on the 15th of December. And we'd obviously look to give more guidance at that point.\\nAdam Terelak: Okay. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks Adam.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim, Societe Generale. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nAndrew Lim: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So I was wondering if we could revisit the liquidity coverage ratio in debate again. We've obviously had a very volatile period these past few months, but your LCR stayed quite steady actually at around 109%. So, is there an opportunity to reduce this more towards peer group levels or is it the case that subsidiary liquidity requirements necessitate that the LCR has to be this high? And then the second question is revisiting the CET 1 ratio debate. So you said you're comfortable with 12.5% to 13%. If we take your capital return policy, consuming about 50% of net income, and then also organic growth, you know that organic growth, if it was management lending that tends to obviously be very light on the risk rate density. So it does seem to me that going forward, even with organic RWA growth, that you should be growing that 13%, rather than seen that fall into the 12.5% to 13% range. I just wanted to see how you think about that?\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks Andrew, thank you very much. I mean, I think on the LCR and I would merely say that, it's obviously been an uncertain year. We've had an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. We've seen a lot of, shall we say, central bank type responses to that. And I just personally think and I think it's a view shared by Thomas and by the Board, that maintaining a reasonable liquidity buffer at the parent and I think just seems that the prudent thing to do. And that's actually why I'm holding surplus equity at this point. I think as we get through '21 and we see how this situation actually develops, then we'll obviously review the size of liquidity buffer, I want to hold at the parent compared to that in the subsidiaries. But I think we have done some optimization, but definitely, at this point, I think having a central liquidity buffer, just seems the right place to be basically. I mean, I think and it's an uncertain world and I think it's a good - good thing to have at this point. It does clearly inflate our leverage. That's clearly the case. And it's noteworthy, you've not seen the improvement in the leverage ratio that you've seen in the CET 1 ratio and that's because we have elected to hold that liquidity buffer in the center. But I think - I think certainly for the next few months, maybe the next quarter or two, I think it seems the right place to be and I don't intend to revise it in the short term. As we go through '21, we can think about it. I think in terms of the CET 1 ratio, I don't disagree with your mathematics. I think it's all, I would say, I think we've given a pretty clear guidance about what we think the reg drain is going to be next year. But we also have to think around the FRTB impact in '23 and is it delayed at that point. But I think, - I think at this point, I think it's about the right balance for shareholders, you know, to sustain, to pay the second half of the '19 dividend to sustain our policy of increasing dividend by 5% per annum and then to relaunch the share buyback in January of 2021, I think it seems the right balance. We can review that as we actually go through the year but I think where we stand today, given the uncertainties, I think it's about right. But yes, I don't disagree with your conclusions. And obviously, it would depend on the level of Wealth Management growth we have. I mean, you know, quite clearly, if we do see opportunities to grow our Wealth Management business higher than targeted rates, then I think that's something we would definitely want to execute on. It's an extremely good business, we have an extremely high return on tangible equity, it would clearly drive RoTE more, the greater proportion we have, the faster growth we have. So if we can find opportunities to invest in that business, then I think that's something we should do.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yeah, I think the -\\nAndrew Lim: Great, thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: I think the potential to grow our loan book has never been great in the last few years, it is now, so we have really ample ammunition to do so.\\nAndrew Lim: Thank you very much.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann, Autonomous. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nStefan Stalmann: Yes, good morning gentlemen, thanks for taking my questions. The first question goes back to the cost guidance, CHF 16 billion to $16.5 billion on the upper end. I think that was not the case before, despite the fact that we have seen actually FX benefits to the cost base during the quarter. Could you maybe give us a hint about what may have changed to now put this towards the upper end? And in particular, are you from today's perspective, seeing anything that you may have to do on the Investment Bank's comp accrual in the fourth quarter? Also considering that your peer next door has actually relaxed its vesting criteria for deferred compensation? And the second question, and I guess it's also related to the real cost from your largest peer. UBS came up with the idea to accrue for share buybacks, which you didn't do. But you probably thought about it. Could you maybe talk about why you ended up not booking [indiscernible] accrual for buybacks, please? Thank you very much,\\nDavid Mathers: Stefan, good morning. And thank you for your questions. Look, I think in terms of the cost cutting numbers in terms of our cost guidance and I mean, I think we've been up front. There's obviously been a net FX cost in excess of CHF 100 million for PTI for the third quarter. But that comes through as an impact on revenues and a benefit to the OpEx number. And you're correct, essentially, and that's in there. And we've clearly seen more of that FX effect in the third quarter than we've seen in the first half of this year, when we gave the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion guidance. That said, I think and clearly what we are seeing is a stronger performance in the Investment Banking part of our bank, which has a higher payout ratio than in the Wealth Management. That's just the facts of the matter. And I think we do need to be competitive in our compensation to reflect that, basically. And as we noted, we have therefore accrued more in the third quarter of '20 than we did in the third quarter of '19. So, I think that's just is where it is. I mean, clearly, we will need to see how the fourth quarter shapes up. First, in terms of performance when I - and I think as I said, I think we do expect to see levels of trading and transaction activity remaining elevated in this environment because there is strong client demand for hedging transactions in this and we - I think, as we've said, already, we have significantly rebuilt, leveraged finance pipeline. So these are all positives. But I think we obviously also have to be cognizant that there's a compensation cost for that as well. And that reflects both our own performance and that of our peers. And we don't have any particular views at this point, around changing deferral rules or voluntary comp or all the measures that that UBS took. So I can't really comment on what they chose to do. But we certainly don't have any plans at this point to make any changes. I think your second question then was actually, Stefan, was actually on the share buyback. And I mean, I can't really comment on UBS's decision to deduct $1.5 billion, I think it was dollars from their capitalization. I've not seen that done before, it seems to be unusual, at least. But I mean, I would point out that for UBS, they're actually going through a significant change in their distribution policy. So to my recollection, but you would know the numbers better than me, I think the dividend was something north of $0.7, $0.73, something like that per share, and they've actually reduced that dividend and replaced it with a share buyback. Now, dividends, as you know are deducted from capital as they actually occur. So we've already deducted the capital cost of our '19 dividend and nine - three quarters of our 2020 where the share buybacks are normally charged as they're actually incurred. So I can't - you know, I can't really and I think you should ask UBS why they chose to what they choose to do. But they're obviously in a different situation, having gone through a dividend cut, replaced them with share buyback, as opposed to Credit Suisse. I mean, our dividend policy and share buyback policy now dates back several years, we kept the dividend low, we started CHF 0.25, we said we'd increase it by at least 5% per annum. And it is super important to us that you know our shareholders approved the second half of the '19 dividend and they receive that dividend and that we accrue the '20. And we've always said share buyback then provides, shall we say, a more volatile component above and beyond that in which basically we can manage our capital. And I think that's the good, that's a good basis in which to actually manage our capital position. But our position is different from UBS's and that's all I can really say.\\nThomas Gottstein: And also, we want to set the precedent for the future where you have to accrue in advance of the actual share buyback.\\nStefan Stalmann: Great, thank you very much.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Stefan.\\nStefan Stalmann: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from a line of Jernej Omahen, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nJernej Omahen: Yeah, good - good morning from my side as well. I just have two questions left. The first one is on the litigation charge, CHF 152 million of significant litigation, as you put it. It says that it relates to a legacy issue and I was just wondering if you could tell us what that is? And the second question I have is on - just on the outlook for credit costs. So I think that pretty much everybody including ourselves is forecasting that credit losses fall sharply in 2021. But I think as you rightly pointed out at the beginning, the situation is fluid, we seem to be going into another phase of a lockdown. And I was just thinking like, in your mind, can you even construct a scenario whereby the credit loss is next year, pretty much on par with the credit losses this year? What would need to happen in your mind for that to be the case? Thank you very much.\\nDavid Mathers: Two questions and thank you very much, Jernej. And first, in terms of the litigation charge and we know - we, as a matter of policy, we would not comment on specifically on any matter that's involved in litigation. I would say that the bulk of the charges in respect of one our cases, and those cases are all disclosed in our full year accounts and in the quarterly. But it's not just one. I mean, I think as you know, we look at all of the progression of our litigation book, and we make an appropriate provision at the end of each group, depending on where we are in terms of that process. And I think, my view, Thomas' view, remain as we - our general counsel was that it seemed prudent to increase that litigation reserve against those cases, basically, this quarter. So but I'm not going to comment on exactly which case it was, I'm afraid. And I think in terms of credit costs and I mean, I think clearly, central case is that CECL is a conservative accounting standard, more conservative than IFRS 9 because it does require lifetime loss accruals. And therefore, the standard has the impact of front-loading credit provisions to a greater impact than IFRS 9 does. And clearly, to a greater impact to, shall we say, traditional pre-CECL, PFS line in which you would see a pickup in specific provisions later in the cycle. And so I think our central case would be that and you see, at least the stabilization, potentially an improvement in the economic environment in 2021. And at that point, you would expect to see some of these CECL charges actually continue to reverse. But equally, you would expect to see some increase in specific provisions, as you see positions moving into RMI at that point. And I think that's the case, Jernej, you described. Now, clearly, if we were to see a reversal of the improvement in forecasts, it doesn't mean any reversal improvement in economies, because clearly, it's a forecast basis. I mean, clearly, we are still expecting for 2020 certain factors in terms of MS and if we see a reversal of that, then you could see that CECL charges actually increased again. And but I would point out that the increase that you saw in March was due to - the cut was due to a - really a radical change in the economic environment. If you go back to January and February, the end of last year, clearly people were not expecting a recession of this scale, they were expecting a relatively steady year with some concerns around, U.S. election, I think would be a consensus view. And we went from that to a significant reversal in the space of three months. So it was a huge shift in terms of the economic factors. And that was compounded by the fact you saw significant drawdown of facilities across, for us and for most of our peers, which increased the exposure. So you'd have to see a fairly radical change in the economic environment for 2021, to see a repetition of what you saw in the first half of this year. But you know Jernej, clearly at this point, it would not - it would not necessarily be prudent to assume that you're definitely going to get a CECR reduction in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year. I think there is clearly risk around that. But to achieve your scenario, or your question to me, you'd have to see something pretty radical, given the pace of change we saw in the first half of 2020.\\nJernej Omahen: Yeah, it makes sense. Thank you very much.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Piers Brown, HSBC. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nPiers Brown: Hi, good morning. I just got a couple of couple of remaining questions. And first of all, just on the IB, which we haven't really discussed at all on the call so far. I mean, your revenue comps, clearly a bit weaker than the peer group, this quarter also on a constant currency basis. I guess that's mostly mixed strictly in terms of the lessened bias within fixed income, but I wonder whether you could just talk to how you see your market share in fixed income and equity has developed through the course of the third quarter? And the second question was just actually on, on your foreign currency. So, I mean, we've got a lot of adjusted figures in the presentation now, giving the numbers in a constant currency dollar basis. I'm just wondering given that dollar is, is by far the biggest revenue pop for you. Why do you not use to dollar reporting, using that as your functional currency? What's the thinking behind remaining with Swiss franc when it's obviously such a distortive effect in quarters like this? Thanks very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: I can kick it off and actually start with the second question on the reporting currency. Look, I think this quarter was really exceptional. We had a swing that we haven't seen in, I think, several years, I think nine years. So it has been an exceptional year and that's why we have also provided the FX adjusted numbers. Switzerland is our home market and Switzerland; the Swiss currency is also strong because we benefit from the home market. It's something that we have looked at in the past, I think about three, four years ago, we decided to stick - to stick to the Swiss franc reporting currency. But from that perspective, it's not something we are now doing because just we had one very strong FX headwind quarter but it's certainly something that we remain open in the mid to long term. But there are no intentions to change reporting currency at this stage before I go to the IB question, anything you wanted to add, David?\\nDavid Mathers: No, I mean, I think as Thomas said, we did look at this very carefully. And I mean, in essence, it will be a - this volatility is a structural issue. If you look at Page 52 of the presentation, then you can see that whilst the U.S. dollar is our largest revenue base, it's also our largest expense base as well. And the Swiss franc basically is our second largest. So if you're - if you switch into U.S. dollars, you're then going to have volatility around your Swiss franc base at that point. Now, you might argue, as you said, well, the dollar is bigger, so let's do it. But I think it is important to remember, we are a Swiss bank. And I think there are many advantages to the Swiss franc. And it's certainly something that customers appreciate. Clearly, it does make for a more complex experience. I mean, ultimately, our shares are actually listed on the SIX and we trade in Swiss francs. And we have to earn Swiss franc earnings, and they buy back Swiss franc shares. And that's going to be the case, basically, regardless of whether we report in U.S. dollars or in Swiss francs, is all I'd add to that one.\\nThomas Gottstein: So on the Investment Banking revenues, if you if you look at Page 11, you can see that we also show 2018, third quarter, and you can see that we had, for example, fixed income, very strong quarter, we were up 55% from 2018 to 2019. So 2019 was actually a pretty strong quarter and the plus 10% is in comparison to a strong quarter there. And in equity, sales and trading, we also had a strong improvement last year, 13% from the level of 2018. And capital markets, I think we did plus 33%, we are - we're doing very well. And this includes the advisory part. So it's true that we are traditionally more a search for yield, credit heavy, fixed income organization, which, is at the moment not benefiting as much as others from the volatility we see in rates and FX. But as hopefully, we will move towards a more normalized world, this volatility could die down at some point and we could benefit from that. And on the capital market side, whilst we do have very strong positions in equity capital markets in IPOs, especially, but also in the more investment grade DCM business, our [international] sponsor business has not benefited as much as the other two capital markets, businesses from the market development in the last two, three quarters. So from that perspective, I think we are extremely well positioned and with the new setup of the - both from a product perspective, but also geographic perspective, including Asia. You know, we think we have very, very good momentum.\\nPiers Brown: Thanks very much.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Piers.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nicolas Payen from Kepler. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nNicolas Payen: Yes, good morning. Just one last question on my side on leverage finance. We have seen quite a pickup in your leverage finance exposure in multichannel? Why is that either pickup in appetite or client demand on that front? Thank you very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: So there have been a couple of transactions coming to the market in the latter half of the third quarter. And from that perspective, we are starting to benefit from an uptick in market activity.\\nDavid Mathers: I think it's worth remembering, you did have a period of about four or five months, in which there was very little new origination. And the book was basically run down to a very low level. It's not actually fully back to where it was basically, the end of last year for that matter. But it's definitely returned to more normal levels as we see increasing levels of banking activity.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Lee from Santander. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nPatrick Lee: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I just have a couple of follow up questions on the rate environment and the net interest income guidance. So on the point you made on offsetting margin of loan growth, if I look at your loan portfolio in the first quarter, the loan balance actually fell by around 2% or 3%. And on the group basis, and it's falling in most divisions. I guess part of this is driven by currency and would I be right to say that underlying loan process may be positive 2% or 3% because of that? And looking into 2021, when we talk about loan growth, do you think - where do you think this growth would come from? Would it just be a continuation of the loan growth in Private Banking? Or maybe the last question suggesting, would it be quite Investment Banking biased? I mean like just in terms of how the mix of dividend growth would look like? The second one is just a clarification regarding the structural swap positions of CHF 100 million negative for 2021? And is there any sensitivity to this with respect to the rate environment or and also whether there's a specific timing in terms of maturity of the swap position, in terms of whether it is a 2021 situation or 2022? If you can give us some color on that that will be helpful. Thanks.\\nThomas Gottstein: Maybe I start with the first one and then I hand over to David for the second one. So look, you're right, the loan growth was rather modest, even in the third quarter, but it had stabilized. We had our regular kind of 1%, 2% growth in SUB, but IWM, and APAC saw a reduction, due to deleveraging in the first half, which has been somewhat reversed in the third quarter. But we were probably slightly more cautious in the first nine months than some of our competitors, which puts us in a strong position now to really accelerate the loan growth from that perspective and we are in a good position to do so. And, David?\\nDavid Mathers: I think on the right environment, I mean the maths, so we clearly put the swap position on about a year ago as we actually did this change. And but it's not a cliff. It's not a book which essentially starts and then goes to zero, basically, after two years. What you see instead is a portfolio of some shorter swaps and some longer swaps. But the biggest rate of change will be in 2021 because we see some this year, the majority next year, and then a minority in 2022. So I mean, I think it's certainly possible that loan growth will be sufficient to offset that. But I think it's worth highlighting that that is definitely a risk for 2021. Given the lower rate of change in '22, I'd be much less worried about it in the following year.\\nPatrick Lee: Okay, thanks.\\nOperator: Thank you. I will now hand back for closing remarks.\\nKinner Lakhani: Great, I think we'll leave it here. Thanks, everybody for your time this morning. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the IR team in the usual way. Have a good day.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you very much.\\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call for analysts and investors.

Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our third quarter 2020 results. Before I start with the slide presentation, allow me to make a few remarks about the current environment. We are carefully monitoring with heightened vigilance, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases. Since the crisis began, our first priority has been the safety and well-being of our employees, clients and stakeholders. We stand ready to work with public authorities as we did earlier this year with Switzerland's successful bridge loan program to small and medium sized businesses. I particularly want to thank all of our employees for what they have achieved over the last months in very difficult circumstances, as evidenced by our nearly 10% return on tangible equity over the first nine months of the year, and our successful implementation to-date of the strategic initiatives we announced a couple of months ago, including the creation of a single global investment bank, the integration of our risk and compliance functions, the establishment of SRI, our sustainability research and investment solutions unit and the plant integration of Neue Aargauer Bank or NAB. These initiatives should allow us to invest in our Wealth Management-related businesses in order to build on the considerable progress we have already achieved, and to position ourselves even more strongly in 2021 and beyond as a leading wealth manager with strong global investment banking capabilities. With that, let's turn to the slides. Slide 4, please. As you see on the left side, we reported pre-tax income in the third quarter of CHF 803 million, and net income attributable to shareholders of CHF 546 million. Our Return on Tangible Equity in the third quarter was 5.4%. Let me now go into detail because there were a number of significant items that impacted third quarter figures. In the third quarter, we generated CHF 1.1 billion in adjusted pre-tax income excluding significant items, up 29% year-on-year and at constant FX rates, this growth would have been 41%. We delivered a strong RoTE of 9.8% in the first nine months of the year in a difficult environment and including the seasonally weaker third quarter. Our balance sheet strengthened further last quarter, putting us in an even better position to expand our lending volume and other businesses. Our CET 1 ratio increased from 12.5% in the second quarter to 13% in the third quarter, supporting the ongoing strong capital generation as well as measures we took to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on risk-weighted assets. We delivered net new assets of CHF 11.1 billion in the third quarter, a 6% annualized growth rate with a record NNA from IWA and Private Banking, highlighting solid momentum across our Wealth Management businesses. Our APAC regional revenues grew 29% year-on-year when you exclude the gain from InvestLab in third quarter 2019. The Asia-Pacific region contributes now roughly 20% of total group revenues, which is higher than most of our peers, thereby confirming our strategy to increase investments in Greater China and the broader APAC region. Our global Investment Bank saw an adjusted 14% return on regulatory capital in the first nine months of 2020 with strong revenue growth across all products. The initiatives we announced a couple of months ago, are expected to deliver approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million in gross cost savings from 2022 onwards. We are allowing for reinvestment in full subject to market and economic conditions. We intend to continue to allocate the vast majority of our capital to Wealth Management. Our Board of Directors recommends that shareholders approve the second half of 2019 dividends at an Extraordinary General Meeting on November 27th 2020. We continue to accrue the 2020 dividend in line with guidance of at least 5% growth per annum. We intend to restart share buybacks in January 2021 with a share buyback program of up to CHF 1.5 billion for next year, and an expected repurchase of at least CHF 1 billion subject to market and economic conditions. Next slide, please. Slide 5. As I mentioned, the health of our employees and the well-being of our clients is our top priority. We have taken strong measures, some of which are depicted on this slide to ensure the safety of our colleagues. We continue to deliver solutions for our private, corporate and institutional clients in a challenging environment, including the deployment of best-in-class technology and market making capabilities. We are also seeing increased financing needs, driving loan growth and capital markets, as well as increased demand for private markets and sustainable solutions. Let me say a few words about the macroenvironment. We are a global Swiss based bank, and thus feel that it's important to report in our domestic currency, the Swiss franc. In recent quarters, this also meant dealing with some of the headwinds arising from the strong Swiss franc. This effect was very pronounced in the third quarter compared to one year earlier, due in particular, to the Swiss franc's strength versus the U.S. dollar. In fact, in the third quarter, we suffered from the strongest FX headwinds in nine years. On the other side of the coin, we are also benefiting from the stability of the Swiss economy. Slide 6, please. We were excited to announce the launch of SRI to position Credit Suisse as a sustainability leader. We have made progress on implementing this strategy by providing our clients thought leadership to help them find opportunities in volatile markets. We launched more than 30 global sector teams to focus on thematic reports. We have executed 27 Green, Social and Sustainability Bonds transactions, totaling $15 billion through the first three quarters of 2020, a year-on-year increase of 176%. We also launched key sustainable products for our Wealth Management clients. Page 7, please. As you see on this slide, a number of significant items resulted in the divergence between our reported and underlying revenues in the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, excluding the CHF 327 million InvestLab gain in the third quarter 2019 and at constant FX rates, we grew our pre-tax income by 41% year-on-year during the third quarter. Slide 8, please. Our third quarter 2020 Wealth Management revenues were down 10% on a reported basis. However, if you exclude the impact on the InvestLab gain last year, our revenues were up 5% year-on-year on an adjusted basis at constant FX, led by a 27% rise in transaction revenues. Our APAC business saw a 15% year-on-year rise in underlying constant FX revenues during the third quarter. APAC was the first region to confront the effects of the COVOD-19 pandemic on their economies, and has also been the first to begin emerging from the ensuing downturn. At constant FX rates, underlying IWM PB and SUB PC private client's revenues were broadly flat. Slide 9, please. We have strong contributions across Wealth Management businesses and regions in our CHF 11.1 billion NNA during the third quarter. Although assets under management fell slightly year-on-year in Swiss franc terms, they grew 5% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms, again reflecting some of the headwinds from the strong Swiss currency. Slide 10, please. As you know, we created Global Trading Solutions by combining our successful International Trading Solutions and APAC Solutions businesses. GTS gives us close regional connectivity to Wealth Management, and brings institutional style solutions to Wealth Management clients across multiple time zones. On this slide, you see the success of this initiative with net revenues in GTS up 49% in the third quarter 2020 compared to those former businesses in the third quarter, two years ago in 2018. This slide, sorry, I'm now on Page 11. This slide shows our global investment banking revenues across the group. Revenues for our global investment banking activities increased 12% year-on-year during the third quarter 2022, sorry, 2020, I apologize. This increase was fairly broad based across equity sales and trading, fixed income sales and trading and advisory, with particular strengths in capital markets. Slide 12, please. Here you see the financial highlights over the first nine months of 2020. In a challenging macro environment, we had had strong growth in net revenues and pre-tax income on an adjusted basis and excluding significant items. We also had a strong 18% growth in net income attributable to shareholders. On the right-hand side, you see that on an adjusted basis and excluding significant items, we achieved an average of 18% return on regulatory capital for our three Wealth Management related divisions, and 14% in the Investment Bank, despite taking nearly CHF 1 billion in provision for credit losses across all four divisions. Slide 13, please. Over the last four years, we have steadily grown RoTE, delivering almost 10% in the first nine months of the year, amid a challenging market environment and again, despite taking almost CHF 1 billion of provision for credit losses. This means that we are on the right path towards our medium-term ambition of delivering an RoTE of 10% to 12% in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions, which we reaffirm. For the first nine months of the year, we achieved CHF 3 billion in net income attributable to shareholders. Slide 14, please. This slide goes into greater detail for our credit loan provisions. Our strong nine months results in 2020 came despite adding CHF 958 million in provision for credit losses. It is worth noting that the Swiss Universal Bank accounts for 60% of our loans, and 85% of our loan book held at amortized cost is collateralized. Page 15, please. We are a global bank, but we benefit enormously from our home market of Switzerland, with the SUB historically being an anchor of revenue and profit for us. We continue to build on our high touch strategy for ultra high net worth, corporate and institutional clients by leveraging digital solutions for our high-tech retail and smaller corporate clients, including the launch of our new digital client offering CSX on Monday this week. We achieved 16% return on regulatory capital in the first nine months of 2020. Based on adjusted results, and excluding significant items and our approximately CHF 100 million cost savings program is on track and is expected to be completed by mid-2021. We are successfully progressing our planned integration of NAB. We had a low ratio of credit loss expenses reflecting the quality of our Swiss loan book that I referenced earlier. We have strong growth momentum, including in private clients, where we reported CHF 2 billion of NNA. As they say in sports, you need to be able to win at home. And this is evidenced by our awards, which include Switzerland's Best Bank as well as Switzerland's Best Investment Bank from Euromoney, each for a third consecutive year. We are also retaining the year-to-date #1 ranking in Investment Banking in Switzerland from Dealogic. Page 16, please. We continue to transform our IWM business to meet our client's needs, building strong momentum in asset gathering in both Private Banking and Asset Management by scaling up sustainable investment and financing solutions. We have made strategic hires to drive our mid-market M&A advisory and investment banking origination capabilities, especially in the EMEA region. As you know, we felt that there are ample opportunities within IWM to build on the successful bank for entrepreneur model in APAC and SUB and further strengthened the collaboration between IWM and the IB division beyond GTS, namely, in M&A, capital markets and mid-market lending. We achieved a record NNA of CHF 6.9 billion last quarter in Private Banking, and had CHF 1.9 billion in new loan growth in Private Banking, reversing the deleveraging trend from previous quarters. Finally, we won several regional Wealth Management awards, as depicted at the bottom of this page. Page 17, please. In Asset Management, we are navigating the challenges through the COVID-19 crisis, which has driven underperformance in certain selected alternative strategies. We are restructuring some of these underperforming strategies, driving one-time costs and losses on investment capital. We are targeting gross savings of CHF 50 million in 2021. At the same time, we are seeing continued growth in equity thematics, fixed income and passive businesses. We also continue to see opportunities including significant growth, potential of alternatives and private markets by growing connectivity with our Private Banking businesses. As an example, in Q3 2020, we launched a strategic partnership with the Qatar Investment Authority to form a multi-billion dollar direct private credit platform. Page 18, please. Our APAC franchise continues to execute its wealth centric strategy by deepening our ultra high net worth and entrepreneur client relationship. We have accelerated our China onshore build out. These efforts have allowed us to achieve a divisional return on regulatory capital of 20% in the first nine months of 2020, based on adjusted results and excluding significant items. Looking at retail revenues from Asia Pacific, we have seen 29% year-on-year revenue growth in the third quarter excluding the InvestLab gain. In Swiss franc terms, this is closer to 40%. We also won Asia's Best Bank for Wealth Management for the third time in five years from Euromoney and Equity Derivatives House of the Year from Asia Risk Awards. Page 19. Please. As part of our initiatives announced on July 30, we created a global integrated client centric Investment Bank division built on sales and trading, underwriting and advisory, in order to maximize global connectivity. We have leading positions in our core franchises with more than 80% of the revenues from products, the top five or top six market positions. We have already implemented enhanced capital discipline in our corporate bank, and greater capital flexibility across our businesses. Net revenues for the Investment Bank increased 18% year-on-year during the first nine months of 2020 and our adjusted return on equity capital improved to 14%. With this, I would like to hand over to David for the detailed financials.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much, Thomas. Good morning, everybody. And I'm now going to take you through the financial results in some more detail. I'd like to make two points before we start. First, as you know, we've now moved to four divisions rather than five with a single Investment Bank. And together with the other changes that I summarized in the Restatement Call that we had early this month, we're now presenting those results to you under this new structure. And I've included in the Appendix a slide from our Restatement Presentation that gives you a reminder of these changes. Second, whilst our primary performance remains our reported pre-tax income, I will need to give more emphasis to the adjusted numbers for the next few quarters, particularly for the divisional slides, given the structural changes that I've just outlined. It means that we are incurring the planned restructuring charges we announced last July. You may recall that these amounted to a total of CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million, and we will take them to the end of June 2021. And as a consequence of these restructuring measures, we intend to deliver gross savings of approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million from 2022 onwards. Now, this is a reminder, the primary adjustments that we're making in connection with statutory update are for restructuring and for major litigation expenses. But I'll also continue to make the relevant adjustments for real estate items and business sales. So the definition is consistent with that which we used between 2015 and 2018. And as finally, given the effect of the strengthening of the Swiss franc against many of the currencies in which we conduct business, particularly the U.S. dollar, I will, where it's appropriate highlight and explain that impact throughout the presentation. I'm also going to call out three significant items, the InvestLab transfer, the SIX revaluation and the Pfandbriefbank revaluation, which happened early this year. In the divisional slides, the results presented will also exclude these certain items, and I will show the reconciliations for the divisional performance in the appendix. Let's turn to Slide 21, then. So as Thomas has already summarized, Credit Suisse's businesses were resilient in the third quarter despite the considerable challenges and the uncertainties faced in the world's economies. Our year-to-date performance has been strong with return on tangible equity of just under 10%. And that's not withstanding a cumulative charge from the provision for credit losses totaling CHF 958 million since the beginning of the year. Our CET 1 ratio has also improved by approximately 50 basis points since the end of June. Let me turn now to the financials. And as I said, I want to give you a clear picture both on reported and adjusted excluding certain items, terms. In reported terms, net revenues in the third quarter of 2020, was CHF 5.2 billion, and that's 2% lower year-on-year. This decline though, was driven by currency moves. And on FX constant basis, our revenues increased by 4%. Now if we adjust for InvestLab, the first phase of the InvestLab transfer which was taken in the third quarter of last year, our revenues actually improved by 7%. So therefore, if we put the two together, underlying FX constant revenues increased by 11% in 3Q20 compared to 3Q19. Just to give you a further illustration, in the Investment Bank, our revenues rose by 2% in Swiss franc terms, but that converts into an 11% increase in U.S. dollar terms. In the Wealth Management-related businesses, whilst the adjusted revenue figure excluding certain items fell by 3% on a constant currency basis, would have shown a 2% increase. Now if we look at our allowance for credit losses, as I indicated earlier in the year, the economic stresses have stabilized after sharp deterioration that started back in March. Additional provisions for credit losses for the third quarter totaled CHF 94 million that included CHF 149 million of specific provisions, offset by a CHF 55 million CECL related release. This release in CECL was mainly driven by exposure reductions in the Investment Bank, and in the Swiss Universal Bank, as well as by some improvements in the macroeconomic picture since the second quarter. This is clearly sharply down on the total revision of CHF 296 million that we took in the second quarter of the year. Now, I'd point out that operating expenses in the third quarter have clearly benefited from this FX moves. But they were adversely affected by restructuring costs, and by CHF 124 million year-on-year increase in major litigation provisions, most of which are taken in the corporate center. So our pre-tax income stood at CHF 803 million in the quarter, that's a decrease of 30% year-on-year, will be on an adjusted basis excluding the certain items I've listed before, we would have seen a pre-tax income of CHF 1.87 billion, that's a 29% increase. Now, just to complete the picture in terms of currency impact, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted pre-tax income would have been a further CHF 103 million if currency rates, particularly the U.S. dollar were at the same level in 3Q20 as they were in 3Q19. Just turning to tax, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32%. That means that including the benefit of the tax reversals that I discussed back in April, our tax rate for the first nine months of the year was 15%. My guidance for the full year is that I expect our tax rate to be close to 20%. And it should then stabilize around the mid-20s in 2021. And of course, I'd repeat my caveat that this depends on any taxation changes in the countries in which we operate not least in the United States, over the next couple of years. Overall net income attributable to shareholders stood at CHF 546 million, a decline of 38% year-on-year. We saw a return on tangible equity of 5% for the third quarter, taking the total for the nine months to just short of 10%. Now let me turn now to the CET 1 ratio on Slide 22. Our CET 1 ratio for the quarter was 13.0% and that compares to 12.5% at the end of the second quarter. That resulted from strong capital generation with pre-tax income, contributing around 30 basis points of the growth. I'd also note this was out at the level of the temporary IWA forbearances that have been granted by other regulators to some of our peers. As was the case in the second quarter, we saw reduction in risk weighted assets, partly due to a roll off in COVID related increase since March, but also due to our ongoing active optimization of corporate bank lending by the Investment Bank. Please note that we have absorbed just under CHF 3 billion of RWA inflation resulting from the SA-CCR phase-in during the quarter. Then in terms of capital distribution, as Thomas has already stated, we intend to recommend to shareholders that they approve the payment of the second half of the 2019 dividend. And that's equivalent to CHF 0.1388 per share at an Extraordinary General Meeting, which will be held on the 27th of November. Further, we've continued to accrue for 2020 dividend in line of our policy that is an increase of at least 5% per annum. And I can confirm that we have accrued and has already deducted from our capital CHF 574 million for the first nine months of this year. As Thomas has already mentioned, we intend to resume a share buyback program at the beginning of 2021. The Board has approved a program of up to CHF 1.5 billion for next year, with at least CHF 1 billion expected to be purchased in the year subject to market and economic conditions. Let me turn to leverage. During the third quarter, our CET 1 leverage ratio remained stable at 4.5% and our Tier 1 leverage ratio improved by approximately 10 basis points to 6.3%. Any improvement in our Tier 1 leverage ratio primarily resulted from an AT 1 issuance of $1.5 billion U.S. dollars in August. And just a brief note on net interest income. On a constant currency basis, I would expect the total net interest income for the year to be approximately flat for 2020, compared to 2019, with the lowest U.S. dollar interest rates eliminating the gains that we've made elsewhere. Now, if we look forward to 2021, I would expect loan growth to mitigate the adverse effects of low rates in our businesses. But you will recall that just under a year ago, we redenominated our operational risk RWA into U.S. dollars and as a consequence of which we've put on a substantial forward swap portfolio. I'd expect that the roll off of this portfolio could cost us up to about CHF 100 million of net interest income next year. And we may not be able to mitigate all of this through loan growth and other measures. Now, I've spoken previously about our conservative approach liquidity management, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. And I continue to believe that our liquidity coverage ratio of 190% is both appropriate and amongst the highest of the major banks. Let's turn to tangible book value per share, please. This slide illustrates the progression of our tangible book value per share for the first nine months of the year. This has grown from CHF 15.86 to CHF 16.89 during the year, and is broadly unchanged quarter-on-quarter compared to CHF 17.03 at the end of June. Now I think the picture is similar to that which I described three months ago, with net income equivalent to CHF 1.24 per share for the nine-month period. A further reversal in the third quarter of the widening in credit spreads that we saw earlier in 2020 resulted a net increase so far this year from own credit moves of CHF 0.48 per share. And finally, there is going to be an adverse FX impact of CHF 0.78 per share due to the strengthening the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar. Let me turn now to the restructuring program. What I show here is the expected trajectory of expenses relating to the restructuring measures that we announced in July. In the third quarter, we spent CHF 107 million, primarily across SUB, the Investment Bank and IWM and primarily driven by redundancy expenses relating to the measures we've taken. And I've included the exact amounts in the divisional slides and in the financial report. I'd expect that we will spend a similar amount in the fourth quarter of this year, with a total spend for the year still anticipated to be around CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million by the end of June. We intend to achieve, as we said before, gross savings of approximately CHF 250 million to CHF 300 million in 2021, and approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million annually from 2022. In terms of our overall cost guidance the full year, our adjusted operating expenses in the first nine months totaled CHF 12.3 billion. But I would though expect that the figure will be towards the upper end of the range of CHF 16.0 billion to CHF 16.5 billion for the full year, depending on the final variable compensation awards. Let's look at our allowance for credit losses, please. I think everyone knows that Credit Suisse is unusual and that we are a Swiss-based bank, and that we report under the U.S. GAAP rather than IFRS. And that means we're subject to the more conservative CECL rules. And as you know, CECL requires and estimate the loss over the lifetime of the loans, and therefore generally up fronts more of the impact of credit risk than IFRS 9 does. Now I think in broad terms, the CECL provisioning depends both on the absolute level of credit exposure we have and the economic outlook for that credit exposure. What you see in the third quarter, that we've taken CHF 149 million in additional specific provisions. But the CECL balance has been reduced by CHF 55 million, predominantly reflecting both the marginal improvements in macroeconomic factors that Thomas has already summarized, and a reduction in Investment Bank and Swiss Universal Bank exposures. Now if we take into account CHF 135 million of net write offs, and other factors including FX translation, our overall allowance for credit losses, stands at CHF 1.96 billion. Now as we've done before, I want to just give the comparison with those of our peers who've reported for the third quarter so far and given sufficient information to make this comparison. What we show here is the level of credit reserves that we have against loans within the Investment Bank, which should be comparable to the wholesale loan exposures of these peers. At the end of the third quarter, the figure stood at 2.0%, that's down slightly compared to three months ago. But it still exceeds that of all of those peers who have reported so far and have published the data to make this comparison. Now, let me turn now to the divisional performances and start with the Swiss Universal Bank on Slide 28. I'd remind you, we'll be showing adjusted numbers, excluding significant items throughout. Adjusted net revenues in the Swiss Universal Bank increased by 1% year-on-year to CHF 1.3 billion, driven by strong transaction-based activity but partly offset by low recurring revenues. Our adjusted operating expenses fell by 2% as we remain disciplined on cost, whilst we continue to invest in our digital offering, notably with the launch of CFX, our low-cost digital banking platform, early this week. The Swiss Universal Bank generated and adjusted pre-tax income, excluding significant items of CHF 471 million, flat compared to the same period last year. You'll see that this is after an additional provision for credit losses of CHF 52 million compared to CHF 28 million in the second quarter of this year. And the majority of this increase was driven by a single specific case in the corporate and institutional client's portfolio. As we said already, you'll note we've released CHF 36 million of CECR related provisions as our assessment of the Swiss macroeconomic outlook has improved since the second quarter. Turning to Private Clients, our adjusted net revenues excluding certain items increased by 1%, year-on-year, with heightened client activity for the quarter, partly offset by lower revenues from Swisscard. In terms of net new assets, we saw strong net inflows of CHF 2.0 billion during the quarter, reversing the outflows we've seen in prior quarters with contributions across the franchise. Adjusted net revenues for the C&IC were also 1% higher, driven by a strong performance in Investment Banking with this within this division, and by GTS, although this was in part offset by lower net interest income. And again, we saw our improve net new assets compared to the second quarter with CHF 3.5 of net inflows, and have primarily been driven by a stable performance from our pension fund business. Let's turn to Slide 30 for IWM. We saw a stable performance in our Private Banking business, albeit, this was adversely impacted by the translation effect of the weakness in the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc. Asset Management had a tougher quarter, with economic conditions adversely affecting our alternatives business, offsetting a strong performance from traditional fronts, which are much more closely integrated with our Private Banking business. The quarter saw a strong increase in net new assets totaling CHF 11.9 billion. Our adjusted pre-tax profit excluding certain items was CHF 268 million, a decline of 30% year-on-year with corresponding net revenues 12% lower. In terms of the FX impact, I spoke about before, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted net revenues excluding significant items would have been 6% lower with the corresponding pre-tax income, 23% lower primarily in Asset Management. If we turn to the subdivisions, Private Banking saw strong growth in net new assets totaling CHF 6.9 billion, with a good performance in brokerage and other transaction-based revenues including higher GTS revenues. That was offset by reduction in net interest income, predominantly due to lower U.S. dollar rates, and low recurring commissions and fees. Overall adjusted net revenues excluding significant items were 8% lower with pre-tax income on the same basis, 13% lower. On a constant currency basis, our revenues were flat, with the corresponding pre-tax income 2% lower. Now if I turn to Asset Management, we've continued to grow our traditional asset management business, helped by strong performances in our fixed income, thematic equities and index funds with net new assets of CHF 5 billion. However, the primary U.S. based alternatives business has had a much more difficult experience. It's continued to suffer from several factors. First, adverse performance in certain of the businesses and the strategies we're invested in. Second, from a delay in placement revenues and finally, I'd remind you that the third quarter of last year, including a significant realization in our transit business that benefited the third quarter results has not been repeated this quarter. We've continued to recover the unrealized credit investment related losses incurred in the first quarter. But this has been offset by a further deterioration in our investments in real estate funds of CHF 21 million, again in the U.S. alternatives business. We continue to review our alternative investment portfolio, and we'd expect to see further restructuring costs, as well as potential markdowns in our investments depending on performance. Across IWM, we intend to take full year restructuring costs of around CHF 75 million, creating gross savings around CHF 80 million by 2021, of which we'd expect more than half to be in Asset Management. Let me turn now to Slide 32, and Asia Pacific. Our Asia-Pacific division again reported a resilient performance with adjusted pre-tax income, excluding certain items improving by 4% to CHF 179 million, and net revenues on the same basis by 7% to CHF 728 million. This was in spite of the weakness in the U.S. dollar and dollar linked currencies. On a constant currency basis, adjusted pre-tax income would have been about CHF 21 million higher. But I'd also note, that our total Asian franchise revenues, that is the revenues we book in the APAC division to get those revenues booked elsewhere in the bank increased by 29% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to third quarter of 2019 and in constant currency terms increase by almost 40% year-on-year. Our net new assets totaled CHF 2.2 billion in the quarter, continuing the positive trend year-to-date. And we saw a 32% increase in transaction-based revenues with heightened client activity, a strong contribution from GTS, and increased ECM activity, partly offset by lower financing revenues. Our net interest income was about 12% lower with compressed margins on deposits and low lending volumes following the deleveraging that we saw in the first half of this year. Our operating expenses rose by 3%, notwithstanding the benefit from FX moves. This was primarily driven by higher accruals for variable compensation compared to a year ago. However, additional provisions for credit losses were slightly down compared to the second quarter of the year at CHF 45 million. Now let me conclude then with slide 34 and the Investment Bank. As I mentioned earlier, at the start of my presentation, the Investment Bank delivered a strong set of results with net revenues 11% higher at CHF 2.2 billion sorry, at $2.2 billion. And I would note that this is against a strong comparable in the third quarter of last year, when we had a particularly good performance in our securitized products business. Please recall as well, APAC business does not have the scale of exposure to rates that our peers do. Our business is more credit driven, as you know, and has been driven more by, I think a sustainable quest for yield than by the volatility we've seen in the interest rate market so far this year. We've seen high levels of activity, both in capital markets with share gains in ECM in particular, and in trading with higher cash and prime, a particular feature in the Asia part of the Investment Bank. We've also made good progress building out our capital markets pipeline, particularly in leveraged finance. As I said already regard to SUB, IWM and APAC, our GTS revenues contributed strongly, in this case across macro emerging products, in particular, providing further evidence of the collaboration we're increasingly seeing between the Investment Bank and our Wealth Management related businesses. The release of $37 million of CCL provisions due to the exposure reductions of the corporate bank contributed to a net release of provisions for credit losses of $16 million, compared to the overall provision of $148 million that we took in the second quarter of the year. Our adjusted operating expenses were about 6% higher than the third quarter of 2019, and again that was primarily due to higher variable compensation across this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2019, a net result is an adjusted pre-tax income of CHF $464 million, an increase of 49% year-on-year. Finally, well as leverage has increased compared to the end of the second quarter due to some increase in our COVID-related liquidity buffers, as well as higher period and cash inflows which we should reverse, I would point out that the Investment Bank's capital utilization remains at a third of the group's total, in line with the targets that Thomas announced in July. With that, I'd like to conclude and hand back to Thomas. Thomas?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, David. Let's move to page 37, please. Allow me to summarize, our return on tangible equity over the last 12 months through September was 9.5% in a difficult environment, and close to our pre-COVID ambition of delivering approximately 10% for 2020. Furthermore, we have been able to grow our tangible book value per share, which was nearly CHF 17 at the end of the third quarter. Page 38, please. Here you see our clear path to achieving a 10% to 12% RoTE over the medium term. This is based on an ambition of 20% to 25% return on regulatory capital for our Wealth Management-related businesses and a 10% to 50% RoRC in the Investment Bank. As our nine-month 2020 figures show, on an adjusted basis excluding significant items, we were at 14% RoRC in the Investment Bank, and 18% in our Wealth Management-related businesses, despite nearly CHF 1 billion in provision for credit losses across all four businesses. Slide 39. Let me summarize our financial ambitions. As just reconfirmed, we aim to achieve a 10% to 12% RoTE over the medium term in a normalized environment, maintain a CET 1 ratio of greater than 12% before the final impact of Basel III reforms and achieve a CET 1 leverage ratio of around 4% by the end of 2020 and beyond, all subject to market and economic conditions. In terms of our capital distribution, we expect approval of our second half 2019 dividend of CHF 0.2776 per share at an AGM on November 27. Looking forward into 2021, we expect to distribute at least 50% of net income attributable to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions. We are currently accruing for a 2020 dividend consistent with our policy to increase our dividend by at least 5% per annum. We intend to launch a share buyback program in early Q1 2021 of up to CHF 1.5 billion for the calendar year 2021 with at least CHF 1 billion, subject to market conditions. Slide 40. We expect a total capital distribution in 2020 of around CHF 1 billion, paid and payable to shareholders. For 2021, we expect a total of around CHF 1.8 billion to CHF 2.3 billion payable to shareholders through a dividend of at least CHF 765 million, and the share buyback of between CHF I billion and CHF 1.5 billion. Finally, before we take questions, Kinner has asked me to make one more announcement. Please mark Tuesday the 15th of December in your diaries for the 2020 Credit Suisse Investor Update, which will be held virtually. Our IR team will follow up shortly with more details. I will now hand back to Kinner for Q&A.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Thomas and David. We will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. Operator, let's open the line. Question-and:\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': \"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, very much and good morning. My questions are around capital and of course, the announced share buybacks as well. So I'm going to refer to Page 22 of the presentation. So my first question is really about kind of risk weighted asset's trajectory going forward. You have kind of shown us the regulatory inflation from CA-CCR. You have also kind of shown us how the respective assets kind of grow from the perspective of underlying business. But of course, also, we have seen the reduction for the optimization of some of your Investment Banking balance sheet. So my question is kind of going forward, are we likely to see more of those? Are we likely to see kind of more efforts from a perspective of the actual optimization of the balance sheet? And if you could also kind of remind us if remainder of the regulatory impact, you're going to see that would be very useful too. And my last thing is, could you - could you summarize for us, kind of once again, and I know you've done it numerous times before, but why do you think 12% from now on, as the business spend is the right targets for you, particularly with those kind of very high kind of share buybacks announced today and I assume, being rolled forward, as well? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Magdalena, good morning. Nice to speak to you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa', 'text': 'Good morning.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much and just a few points, then really. So I think in terms of capital going forward, we - I think just in terms of the [reg], we actually took about CHF 2.8 billion of SA-CCR increases in the third quarter, I think, you know? And I would expect something of the same order in the fourth quarter, which completes the phase-in of the SA-CCR process. And that will be the bulk of the regulatory impact in the fourth quarter. And to give you some guidance, we do not expect to see particularly much in 2021, which may be helpful. And I think in terms of capital utilization for the fourth quarter, I think there's two trends. I think one, I think, yes, we will continue to optimize some of our COVID exposure, we will continue to optimize the corporate bank. But against that, I think, we have seen a pickup in loan demand, obviously notably in IWN this quarter, we've seen continued growth in SUB. And if you look at APAC after deleveraging that we suffered for several quarters that essentially came to an end in the third quarter. So I would expect us to see some increase in the amount of capital we have invested in our loan portfolio across the Wealth Management divisions over both the fourth quarter and into 2021. And what does that mean, in terms of the CET 1 ratio? I mean, I would be very surprised to see our CET 1 ratio to drop close to the 12% in the next quarter. I think it more likely will be somewhere in the sort of 12.5% to 13%. I think that gives us a very comfortable position, both to finance the loan growth in our Wealth Management businesses, and to basically finance both the dividend plans and the share buyback plans. Now, clearly, you know the dividends for second half of 2019 has already been deducted from our capitalization has been for this year. And obviously, we've also deducted three quarters of the dividend for 2020 at plus 5% from what we've accrued already. So you can see where we sit from a sort of capital point of view. And is 12% the right number? I think it feels right, to me at this point, given the macroeconomic uncertainties in which we actually operate in. I think, there clearly is obviously negative news around COVID-19 infections as we can all see. And it clearly does create further economic uncertainties, which may well mean that our clients have more demand for our services than perhaps we expected, or we may see more volatility elsewhere. But I think therefore, I think guarding to a 12% floor, pre-FRTB etc., etc., I think seems to be a prudent thing for our policy at this point. And when we look at what that means, in terms of our share buyback, we think that's very much financeable in the context of our existing guidance and clearly starting at 13% is a good place to start with. And does that answer your question, Magdalena?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"Yes, yes, it does. I kind of - it's I think that you know, there's a little bit of a discussion in the market from the perspective of what are the - what are the right kind of levels for the restructure of the business kind of now on, let's just say, three to five-year view before, of course, the last the last waves of Basel.

So and thank you for that.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"So Magdalena, as I said, I think, - I think we said the 12% as being a floor.

And firstly could I just follow up on that previous discussion. So you talked about expectations for 4Q. And as you look into next year, and assuming you get permission to the buybacks, I just wondered at what level you would calibrate buybacks to? Again, it's the same debate about, would you calibrate it to 12% or 12.5 or do you feel comfortable closer to 13? So, it's the same question in a different way. Well would you that the comfortable capital ratio, particularly in relation to, calibrating buybacks as you go into next year? And then my second question is on Slide 38, your return on tangible equity targets, and getting up into the 10% to 12% range that you're very close to. And the slide indicates that this needs to come from the Wealth Management side. And I just wondered how confident you feel about that, at this point in time looking into next year, in terms of moving parts? I mean, I guess you've got some of the cost savings coming through but I just wondered if there any other obvious elements that you can see on a 12-month view that would get you into that RoTE range on the Wealth Management side?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much, Jeremy, thank you very much. Perhaps if I take the first and then I'll hand over to Thomas in terms of our Wealth Management and business plans for next year. And I think, firstly, in terms of the share buyback, I already do have the approval from the Board of directors for the share buyback to resume in January 2021, at the target level of up to CHF 1.5 billion and a targeted minimum of CHF 1 billion. Both Thomas and I have clearly discussed that formerly with FINRA and we have received a statement of no objection from FINRA to this. So therefore, we are where we are in terms of the process. But and just to be clear on that particular point. And I think prudently, because I think we do have to recognize that we remain in an uncertain economic environment, that I think that's why I've said 12%. And as I said, to Magdalena, probably somewhere in the 12.5% to 13%. And I think from a Tier 1 capital point of view, I would attempt to run the bank something in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% compared to the current 18.3% Tier 1 ratio. Now, we can review that in the course of 2021. But I think there has to be a prudent balance between, I think first of all, paying our dividend commitments to shareholders, which is the most important thing. Secondly, providing the capital for the loan growth in the Wealth Management business and thirdly, finding a reasonable level of share buyback, which I do think the commitment of CHF 1.5 billion, minimum CHF 1 billion is about the right order of magnitude, as we said. And but that's what I'd say in terms of the share capital. I guess, Jeremy, we could run the CET 1 ratio lower. But I don't think that really seems prudent at this point, in terms of where we are in the cycle and with the uncertainties we actually have. And that's not implied, or required as part of our share buyback plan. On the second point, Thomas?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Yeah, so if you look at Page 38, you see the RoRC for the three Private Banking led divisions, IWM, APAC, and SUB with 21%, 20% and 16%. And remember that this is with elevated PCLs, provision for credit losses, which are over CHF 500 million for these three divisions. We see substantial growth in Asia, we see a very strong momentum in IWM in terms of NNA and in terms of hiring. And traditionally, both of these divisions have been operating more in the mid-20s in terms of especially IWM the mid to high-20s, in terms of RoRC. And I think that the SUB has the ability to be in the high-teens in terms of RoRCs or between 16% and 19%. And therefore, I think on a normalized basis, this is an absolutely realistic target. And in fact, if you look at the absolute targets, as we are finalizing our budget for next year, the 20% to 25% range is a very solid ambition that I feel comfortable with. And from that perspective, if you look at IB, we are 14%, clearly benefited from elevated levels in terms of trading in capital markets, but also in certain areas where we are traditionally on a relative basis at least stronger, namely credit [lessen] we've had relatively seen less activity. So from that perspective, we feel are well positioned there. And we have been hiring also in M&A and are seeing positive momentum there as well. So from that perspective, we have a clear path towards the 10% plus, in '21 and beyond.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, that's wonderful answer. Can I just come back to David's comments on the capital, so I agree with you about being more comfortable in the sort of 12.5% to 13% range? I wasn't trying to encourage you to get it right down to 12%. So I agree very much with what you're saying there.

Please go ahead, your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': \"Yeah, I have just follow-up on the capital standpoint and then discussing some of the gross margins in Private Banking divisions. Previously, you always suggested a 50% payout, 20% of growth and then 30% of regulatory inflation. It now sounds like the buyback and dividend is being more pinned to a capital level. So, is that correct to you? Are you moving away from that 50% payout guidance and instead it's a function of excess capital? And the second question is on the gross margins, if I look at Slide 45, there has been a step down in IWM and APAC gross margins. Obviously, by looking at gross margin, that should ease out some of the FX adjustments. And within that your transaction, transaction remain fairly resilient. So perhaps you could just comment on the recurring side of the revenue stream. And you've already talked about NII that through the currency side both in IWM and APAC? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thanks very much. I mean, I think just to be clear, on Slide 39, we said that we expect to distribute at least 50% of our net income in 2021. So our policy does remain unchanged in terms of that. But I think we felt it would be most important for our shareholders to (a) I think have clear disclosure on our dividend policy, both for the 2H19 dividend and for the '20 dividend and (b) an indicated indicative amount of how much we'd actually spend in terms of the share buyback program for next year. So I - we thought that would be most helpful. And I think there's more clarity to our investors, basically. I think on the second point, in terms of the gross margin, I mean, I think that the key points, so that was a balance sheet question really around preparing this transactional, this NII. I mean, I think clearly, I think you - I think you're more focused SUB, on IWM and APAC. Clearly, just on SUB, the weakness in the recurring margin is due to the drag from Swisscard, which unsurprisingly, given the obviously limited amount of travel people are doing at this point, we're obviously seeing a lot lower spending on Swisscard than we normally expect to see at this point. And that comes through in terms of the recurring line as it's a 50% joint venture with American Express. I think if we look at the other numbers then in terms of IWM and APAC, and I would suggest we go to the more detailed slides at the back. So if we could actually turn to slide 43, if could have that one, basically, then you can see recurring was down about 9% in the Private Banking business, that's almost exactly the currency fall. I mean, there's other factors going on but it's basically that is driven primarily by the currency fall. And if we then go to Asia Pacific, in terms of their numbers, which I think that is also primarily currency driven as well, please. Which was down in that point, but so I'm sorry, let me just get to the right slide. Yeah, I mean, the recurring was down 11%, so 9% of that would be currency and 2%, we did see some fall in banking services. So that's what I'd raise around recurring, I think. I think clearly the growth in net new assets we've seen, obviously most notably in IWM but I would point out that we saw positive net new assets in all three divisions. We'll be hopeful for future business flows including recurring income. But I think it's been a bit swamped by currency this quarter.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': 'Okay, I think in Slide 32, you are probably looking for on APAC, and it was I believe 50% payout and given the wording of at least and the 20% median mark for growth and 30% that you previously had marked the reg-inflation, is it fair to assume the 20% growth is still valid but the 30% reg-inflation could be a lot lower?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"I think we'll see how it pans out, basically. I mean, that was always a long term, multi-year projection, and at this point, FRTB is still scheduled to be implemented in Switzerland in 2023. I think you know that there are some discussions in the EU around the postponement of FRTB, I think until 2025 and potentially no implementation at all of FRTB if the U.S. authorities do not implement FRTB of U.S. banks. I believe that is the proposal either rumored or leaked or announced from the European authorities. But I think we know, I think we'll have to see how the EU proposal develops. And then what the Swiss response to that actually is at that point, but there has generally been a policy of alignment to EU in terms of these things. But at the moment, we kind of have to assume FRTB in '23 but reg inflation, otherwise will be relatively limited in '21, as I said, already.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs', 'text': 'Thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you.

First on Asset Management, you mentioned you're repositioning some of your alternative strategy. I'm just wondering so do you feel there's actually less autonomy needed or given the performance recently? Or is there also a potential to give to the segment or to actually create a segment and to give the business more autonomy and going forward, also, potentially, maybe think about M&A? And then secondly, with respect to wealth management, and I hear comments on loan demand. I was wondering whether you're also getting a bit more active in kind of pursuing loan growth going forward as a way to mitigate market pressure? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Yeah. Hi, Benjamin. So if we start with the Asset Management question, well we have a very strong performance 2016-2019. PGIs grew by 18%, assets under management in Swiss franc terms grew by 11% per annum, so these are compound annual growth rates per year, we have now two thirds in alternative for alternative [light and one third in more traditional and index products. I think we're well positioned. 2020 is a little bit of a transition year. We are now restructuring some of the operations and also restructuring some of the strategies. But overall, I think we are very well positioned. We have no intention to do any M&A at this stage in Asset Management, but we are - we have been addressing selected underperformance of certain alternative strategies, which in the short term has a little bit of a drag on our P&L. But overall, we feel we have the right strategy with being more alternative and alternative light focused. And that's how I would answer the Asset Management question. On Wealth Management, it is true that we had, if you take the first nine months, and especially the first half negative loan growth, actually it was a result of deleveraging, especially in IWM and in APAC, but this has started to reverse. And we are very much focused on loan growth. We see a lot of opportunities, a lot of demand by clients. And it's one of our main targets to grow our longer loan book in all three private banking led divisions in particular, IWM and APAC.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Benjamin Goy', 'text': 'Understood.

Just a follow up question on the Asset Management operation, please. I mean, it's on every slide, there us some so-called accolades about the achievements, number one, number two in certain products, and the Asset Management division doesn't just show that performance. I was wondering, what what's the long term? Is there like a name to get to the #1 and in certain products #2 and if not, you might revisit it within your business mix? And then secondly, just the strong net new money across the different regions.

I mean, I guess you said that it's strategic important. But do you have a - do you want that at certain point when it needs to improve on and performance needs to move up in ranking or you would visit it within your group mix? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Well, actually, if you look at the margins, we are making in our Asset Management business, and as I mentioned, also, the growth momentum we had between 2016 and 2019, I think they are very strong, also in comparison to our peers, especially because two thirds of our portfolio is in alternatives or alternative flight. So from that perspective, we feel we have a highly attractive and profitable business. But there are some areas where we need to do some restructuring. And from that perspective, we are also satisfied with the performance in some of the funds. The two we're mentioning here are more in fixed income, and in some of the equity strategies, but also some of the alternatives like in CIT, where we are doing extremely well. So and we have now, for example, launched the partnership with the Qatar Investment Authority. This will be a private credit platform, direct private credit platform, and there are further projects we have in high yield and other areas where we're trying to ramp up our fund business. So that's on the Asset Management side. In Wealth Management, in M&A terms, I think in emerging markets, or let's call it more in the APAC and IWM side, we want to grow on an annualized basis between 3% and 5% per year. And in Switzerland, it's more between 2% and 4%. And that's really our goal. But the way I look at it is more on a client business volume. So it's not only NNA, which only relates to AuM but it's about credit volume, it's about AuM volume and it's about custody assets. And if you add them up, we've been growing steadily over the last few years. But I would like to see an increase in there, as we have some very clear strategies for each of the SUB businesses be it in Asia, for example, in China, in Korea, in Vietnam in other areas, as well as in the IWM area. Whether it's the Middle East, Latin America, Western Europe, and we had some very positive hiring momentum in some of these SUB regions. And in Switzerland, we have now launched CSX to also have more growth on the retail and affluent side, in addition to a continued positive momentum on the premium clients and upper high net worth side where we are working very closely also with the Corporate and Investment Banking colleagues, as part of our bank for entrepreneur strategy. So I think generally we are actually very well positioned to continue on this growth pattern.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Anke Reingen', 'text': 'Okay, thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein', 'text': 'Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you.

Thanks for the questions. I had one on NII and another one on expenses. You talked about the swap portfolio on the operational risk RWA. You've given on 2021, I was wondering kind of what duration that swap is and whether that should be a long term NII pressure to model through your numbers? And then also kind of, you're talking about loan growth to offset, whether there is enough loan growth to offset that on it on a multi-year basis, rather than just for next year? And then on expenses, clearly, FX translation is a topic for the quarter. You've given guidance for 2020 on expenses, the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion. I know it's a long way out and there's a lot of moving parts, but would that range potentially come down into next year because of the translation effect on the weaker dollar? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thanks very much. Good questions. Thanks, Adam. I think it says the net interest income. I mean, I don't think I think I've generally given guidance before but often in Q&A, but I thought, just in case, nobody asked that and actually included in the script this morning. I think as I said, if we look at our net interest income for 2020, we clearly are seeing significant pressure from the falling U.S. dollar rates. And you see that across the businesses. And that's why basically I'm saying I'd expect our '20 net interest income to be roughly the same as it was in 2019. Because the measures that we took in 2019 including the dollar-ization of op risk, but also the other measures we took here in Switzerland, are being offset by that margin pressures. So there's clearly quite a bit going on in '20 as you'd expect, in terms of absorbing that. If I look at '21 and as I said, I think in terms of the residual margin pressure across that businesses, I would expect that to be offset by loan growth. That's - I think that's straightforward and what I can't commit to at this point, and we'll do our best to give more guidance as we continue, is well that loan growth will be sufficient to fully offset that CHF 100 million as that swap portfolio runs off. Remember, I think we announced this project back in the fourth quarter of last year. I think I said at that point, we termed out two years. So clearly, the bulk of this effect will be in 21 but it's not a cliff type thing, they're actually spread out. We actually see some in the short term, and then it phases through. I would have thought basically though but by '22, that essentially loan growth will be more than sufficient to offset the residual effects. But I think I just wanted to be clear, around '21 compared to '20 in terms of this. And I think on expenses, I think, the - as I said the - I guess the annualized run rate at this point is somewhere around CHF 16.4 billion of adjusted operating expenses if you take the first three quarters and multiply it up. So that would appear to be the top end of our range of CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion. You know, I think clear caveat on that in that, we have continued to accrue relatively conservatively for compensation. As I said, the 3Q20 comp across were up meaningfully compared to 3Q19. I feel the actual outturn will depend on just where compensation actually lands this year, which will depend pretty on performance and it will also depend on what we see across the peers. And I think also, the approach that we, as a bank, choose to take around the payment of variable compensation during the middle of a COVID crisis, which is an important factor for us. And I think looking towards 2021, I think we've been clear. There was a slide in terms of how much restructuring, which should yield benefits for next year. Although I would point out the bulk the benefits, the CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million only comes through in 2022. I think we'll have to make decisions as we go in through '21, which is how much of that we choose to reinvest and how much we release in terms of the expense number. And I'm not going to add more to that now. We are - we've announced obviously a Capital Markets Day on the 15th of December. And we'd obviously look to give more guidance at that point.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Adam Terelak', 'text': 'Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim, Societe Generale. Please go ahead, your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Lim',\n","    'text': \"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So I was wondering if we could revisit the liquidity coverage ratio in debate again. We've obviously had a very volatile period these past few months, but your LCR stayed quite steady actually at around 109%. So, is there an opportunity to reduce this more towards peer group levels or is it the case that subsidiary liquidity requirements necessitate that the LCR has to be this high? And then the second question is revisiting the CET 1 ratio debate. So you said you're comfortable with 12.5% to 13%. If we take your capital return policy, consuming about 50% of net income, and then also organic growth, you know that organic growth, if it was management lending that tends to obviously be very light on the risk rate density. So it does seem to me that going forward, even with organic RWA growth, that you should be growing that 13%, rather than seen that fall into the 12.5% to 13% range. I just wanted to see how you think about that?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thanks Andrew, thank you very much. I mean, I think on the LCR and I would merely say that, it's obviously been an uncertain year. We've had an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. We've seen a lot of, shall we say, central bank type responses to that. And I just personally think and I think it's a view shared by Thomas and by the Board, that maintaining a reasonable liquidity buffer at the parent and I think just seems that the prudent thing to do. And that's actually why I'm holding surplus equity at this point. I think as we get through '21 and we see how this situation actually develops, then we'll obviously review the size of liquidity buffer, I want to hold at the parent compared to that in the subsidiaries. But I think we have done some optimization, but definitely, at this point, I think having a central liquidity buffer, just seems the right place to be basically. I mean, I think and it's an uncertain world and I think it's a good - good thing to have at this point. It does clearly inflate our leverage. That's clearly the case. And it's noteworthy, you've not seen the improvement in the leverage ratio that you've seen in the CET 1 ratio and that's because we have elected to hold that liquidity buffer in the center. But I think - I think certainly for the next few months, maybe the next quarter or two, I think it seems the right place to be and I don't intend to revise it in the short term. As we go through '21, we can think about it. I think in terms of the CET 1 ratio, I don't disagree with your mathematics. I think it's all, I would say, I think we've given a pretty clear guidance about what we think the reg drain is going to be next year. But we also have to think around the FRTB impact in '23 and is it delayed at that point. But I think, - I think at this point, I think it's about the right balance for shareholders, you know, to sustain, to pay the second half of the '19 dividend to sustain our policy of increasing dividend by 5% per annum and then to relaunch the share buyback in January of 2021, I think it seems the right balance. We can review that as we actually go through the year but I think where we stand today, given the uncertainties, I think it's about right. But yes, I don't disagree with your conclusions. And obviously, it would depend on the level of Wealth Management growth we have. I mean, you know, quite clearly, if we do see opportunities to grow our Wealth Management business higher than targeted rates, then I think that's something we would definitely want to execute on. It's an extremely good business, we have an extremely high return on tangible equity, it would clearly drive RoTE more, the greater proportion we have, the faster growth we have. So if we can find opportunities to invest in that business, then I think that's something we should do.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein', 'text': 'Yeah, I think the -'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Lim', 'text': 'Great, thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'I think the potential to grow our loan book has never been great in the last few years, it is now, so we have really ample ammunition to do so.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Lim', 'text': 'Thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you.

The first question goes back to the cost guidance, CHF 16 billion to $16.5 billion on the upper end. I think that was not the case before, despite the fact that we have seen actually FX benefits to the cost base during the quarter. Could you maybe give us a hint about what may have changed to now put this towards the upper end? And in particular, are you from today's perspective, seeing anything that you may have to do on the Investment Bank's comp accrual in the fourth quarter? Also considering that your peer next door has actually relaxed its vesting criteria for deferred compensation? And the second question, and I guess it's also related to the real cost from your largest peer. UBS came up with the idea to accrue for share buybacks, which you didn't do. But you probably thought about it. Could you maybe talk about why you ended up not booking [indiscernible] accrual for buybacks, please? Thank you very much,\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Stefan, good morning. And thank you for your questions. Look, I think in terms of the cost cutting numbers in terms of our cost guidance and I mean, I think we've been up front. There's obviously been a net FX cost in excess of CHF 100 million for PTI for the third quarter. But that comes through as an impact on revenues and a benefit to the OpEx number. And you're correct, essentially, and that's in there. And we've clearly seen more of that FX effect in the third quarter than we've seen in the first half of this year, when we gave the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion guidance. That said, I think and clearly what we are seeing is a stronger performance in the Investment Banking part of our bank, which has a higher payout ratio than in the Wealth Management. That's just the facts of the matter. And I think we do need to be competitive in our compensation to reflect that, basically. And as we noted, we have therefore accrued more in the third quarter of '20 than we did in the third quarter of '19. So, I think that's just is where it is. I mean, clearly, we will need to see how the fourth quarter shapes up. First, in terms of performance when I - and I think as I said, I think we do expect to see levels of trading and transaction activity remaining elevated in this environment because there is strong client demand for hedging transactions in this and we - I think, as we've said, already, we have significantly rebuilt, leveraged finance pipeline. So these are all positives. But I think we obviously also have to be cognizant that there's a compensation cost for that as well. And that reflects both our own performance and that of our peers. And we don't have any particular views at this point, around changing deferral rules or voluntary comp or all the measures that that UBS took. So I can't really comment on what they chose to do. But we certainly don't have any plans at this point to make any changes. I think your second question then was actually, Stefan, was actually on the share buyback. And I mean, I can't really comment on UBS's decision to deduct $1.5 billion, I think it was dollars from their capitalization. I've not seen that done before, it seems to be unusual, at least. But I mean, I would point out that for UBS, they're actually going through a significant change in their distribution policy. So to my recollection, but you would know the numbers better than me, I think the dividend was something north of $0.7, $0.73, something like that per share, and they've actually reduced that dividend and replaced it with a share buyback. Now, dividends, as you know are deducted from capital as they actually occur. So we've already deducted the capital cost of our '19 dividend and nine - three quarters of our 2020 where the share buybacks are normally charged as they're actually incurred. So I can't - you know, I can't really and I think you should ask UBS why they chose to what they choose to do. But they're obviously in a different situation, having gone through a dividend cut, replaced them with share buyback, as opposed to Credit Suisse. I mean, our dividend policy and share buyback policy now dates back several years, we kept the dividend low, we started CHF 0.25, we said we'd increase it by at least 5% per annum. And it is super important to us that you know our shareholders approved the second half of the '19 dividend and they receive that dividend and that we accrue the '20. And we've always said share buyback then provides, shall we say, a more volatile component above and beyond that in which basically we can manage our capital. And I think that's the good, that's a good basis in which to actually manage our capital position. But our position is different from UBS's and that's all I can really say.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'And also, we want to set the precedent for the future where you have to accrue in advance of the actual share buyback.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Stefan Stalmann', 'text': 'Great, thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers', 'text': 'Thank you, Stefan.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Stefan Stalmann', 'text': 'Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you.

The first one is on the litigation charge, CHF 152 million of significant litigation, as you put it. It says that it relates to a legacy issue and I was just wondering if you could tell us what that is? And the second question I have is on - just on the outlook for credit costs. So I think that pretty much everybody including ourselves is forecasting that credit losses fall sharply in 2021. But I think as you rightly pointed out at the beginning, the situation is fluid, we seem to be going into another phase of a lockdown. And I was just thinking like, in your mind, can you even construct a scenario whereby the credit loss is next year, pretty much on par with the credit losses this year? What would need to happen in your mind for that to be the case? Thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Two questions and thank you very much, Jernej. And first, in terms of the litigation charge and we know - we, as a matter of policy, we would not comment on specifically on any matter that's involved in litigation. I would say that the bulk of the charges in respect of one our cases, and those cases are all disclosed in our full year accounts and in the quarterly. But it's not just one. I mean, I think as you know, we look at all of the progression of our litigation book, and we make an appropriate provision at the end of each group, depending on where we are in terms of that process. And I think, my view, Thomas' view, remain as we - our general counsel was that it seemed prudent to increase that litigation reserve against those cases, basically, this quarter. So but I'm not going to comment on exactly which case it was, I'm afraid. And I think in terms of credit costs and I mean, I think clearly, central case is that CECL is a conservative accounting standard, more conservative than IFRS 9 because it does require lifetime loss accruals. And therefore, the standard has the impact of front-loading credit provisions to a greater impact than IFRS 9 does. And clearly, to a greater impact to, shall we say, traditional pre-CECL, PFS line in which you would see a pickup in specific provisions later in the cycle. And so I think our central case would be that and you see, at least the stabilization, potentially an improvement in the economic environment in 2021. And at that point, you would expect to see some of these CECL charges actually continue to reverse. But equally, you would expect to see some increase in specific provisions, as you see positions moving into RMI at that point. And I think that's the case, Jernej, you described. Now, clearly, if we were to see a reversal of the improvement in forecasts, it doesn't mean any reversal improvement in economies, because clearly, it's a forecast basis. I mean, clearly, we are still expecting for 2020 certain factors in terms of MS and if we see a reversal of that, then you could see that CECL charges actually increased again. And but I would point out that the increase that you saw in March was due to - the cut was due to a - really a radical change in the economic environment. If you go back to January and February, the end of last year, clearly people were not expecting a recession of this scale, they were expecting a relatively steady year with some concerns around, U.S. election, I think would be a consensus view. And we went from that to a significant reversal in the space of three months. So it was a huge shift in terms of the economic factors. And that was compounded by the fact you saw significant drawdown of facilities across, for us and for most of our peers, which increased the exposure. So you'd have to see a fairly radical change in the economic environment for 2021, to see a repetition of what you saw in the first half of this year. But you know Jernej, clearly at this point, it would not - it would not necessarily be prudent to assume that you're definitely going to get a CECR reduction in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year. I think there is clearly risk around that. But to achieve your scenario, or your question to me, you'd have to see something pretty radical, given the pace of change we saw in the first half of 2020.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jernej Omahen',\n","    'text': 'Yeah, it makes sense.

And first of all, just on the IB, which we haven't really discussed at all on the call so far. I mean, your revenue comps, clearly a bit weaker than the peer group, this quarter also on a constant currency basis. I guess that's mostly mixed strictly in terms of the lessened bias within fixed income, but I wonder whether you could just talk to how you see your market share in fixed income and equity has developed through the course of the third quarter? And the second question was just actually on, on your foreign currency. So, I mean, we've got a lot of adjusted figures in the presentation now, giving the numbers in a constant currency dollar basis. I'm just wondering given that dollar is, is by far the biggest revenue pop for you. Why do you not use to dollar reporting, using that as your functional currency? What's the thinking behind remaining with Swiss franc when it's obviously such a distortive effect in quarters like this? Thanks very much.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"I can kick it off and actually start with the second question on the reporting currency. Look, I think this quarter was really exceptional. We had a swing that we haven't seen in, I think, several years, I think nine years. So it has been an exceptional year and that's why we have also provided the FX adjusted numbers. Switzerland is our home market and Switzerland; the Swiss currency is also strong because we benefit from the home market. It's something that we have looked at in the past, I think about three, four years ago, we decided to stick - to stick to the Swiss franc reporting currency. But from that perspective, it's not something we are now doing because just we had one very strong FX headwind quarter but it's certainly something that we remain open in the mid to long term. But there are no intentions to change reporting currency at this stage before I go to the IB question, anything you wanted to add, David?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"No, I mean, I think as Thomas said, we did look at this very carefully. And I mean, in essence, it will be a - this volatility is a structural issue. If you look at Page 52 of the presentation, then you can see that whilst the U.S. dollar is our largest revenue base, it's also our largest expense base as well. And the Swiss franc basically is our second largest. So if you're - if you switch into U.S. dollars, you're then going to have volatility around your Swiss franc base at that point. Now, you might argue, as you said, well, the dollar is bigger, so let's do it. But I think it is important to remember, we are a Swiss bank. And I think there are many advantages to the Swiss franc. And it's certainly something that customers appreciate. Clearly, it does make for a more complex experience. I mean, ultimately, our shares are actually listed on the SIX and we trade in Swiss francs. And we have to earn Swiss franc earnings, and they buy back Swiss franc shares. And that's going to be the case, basically, regardless of whether we report in U.S. dollars or in Swiss francs, is all I'd add to that one.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"So on the Investment Banking revenues, if you if you look at Page 11, you can see that we also show 2018, third quarter, and you can see that we had, for example, fixed income, very strong quarter, we were up 55% from 2018 to 2019. So 2019 was actually a pretty strong quarter and the plus 10% is in comparison to a strong quarter there. And in equity, sales and trading, we also had a strong improvement last year, 13% from the level of 2018. And capital markets, I think we did plus 33%, we are - we're doing very well. And this includes the advisory part. So it's true that we are traditionally more a search for yield, credit heavy, fixed income organization, which, is at the moment not benefiting as much as others from the volatility we see in rates and FX. But as hopefully, we will move towards a more normalized world, this volatility could die down at some point and we could benefit from that. And on the capital market side, whilst we do have very strong positions in equity capital markets in IPOs, especially, but also in the more investment grade DCM business, our [international] sponsor business has not benefited as much as the other two capital markets, businesses from the market development in the last two, three quarters. So from that perspective, I think we are extremely well positioned and with the new setup of the - both from a product perspective, but also geographic perspective, including Asia.

And thanks for taking my questions. I just have a couple of follow up questions on the rate environment and the net interest income guidance. So on the point you made on offsetting margin of loan growth, if I look at your loan portfolio in the first quarter, the loan balance actually fell by around 2% or 3%. And on the group basis, and it's falling in most divisions. I guess part of this is driven by currency and would I be right to say that underlying loan process may be positive 2% or 3% because of that? And looking into 2021, when we talk about loan growth, do you think - where do you think this growth would come from? Would it just be a continuation of the loan growth in Private Banking? Or maybe the last question suggesting, would it be quite Investment Banking biased? I mean like just in terms of how the mix of dividend growth would look like? The second one is just a clarification regarding the structural swap positions of CHF 100 million negative for 2021? And is there any sensitivity to this with respect to the rate environment or and also whether there's a specific timing in terms of maturity of the swap position, in terms of whether it is a 2021 situation or 2022? If you can give us some color on that that will be helpful. Thanks.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Maybe I start with the first one and then I hand over to David for the second one. So look, you're right, the loan growth was rather modest, even in the third quarter, but it had stabilized. We had our regular kind of 1%, 2% growth in SUB, but IWM, and APAC saw a reduction, due to deleveraging in the first half, which has been somewhat reversed in the third quarter. But we were probably slightly more cautious in the first nine months than some of our competitors, which puts us in a strong position now to really accelerate the loan growth from that perspective and we are in a good position to do so. And, David?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"I think on the right environment, I mean the maths, so we clearly put the swap position on about a year ago as we actually did this change. And but it's not a cliff. It's not a book which essentially starts and then goes to zero, basically, after two years. What you see instead is a portfolio of some shorter swaps and some longer swaps. But the biggest rate of change will be in 2021 because we see some this year, the majority next year, and then a minority in 2022. So I mean, I think it's certainly possible that loan growth will be sufficient to offset that. But I think it's worth highlighting that that is definitely a risk for 2021.

Welcome and thank you for joining the Credit Suisse Group's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call for Analyst and Investors. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over Kinner Lakhani, Head of Investor Relations and Group Strategy and Development. Please go ahead Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, operator. Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion, we refer you to the Credit Suisse fourth quarter 2020 financial release published this morning. Let me remind you that our 2020 Annual Report and audited financial statements for the year will be published on around March 18 2021. I will now hand over to a group CEO Thomas Gottstein and our group CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Kinner. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Let me begin as I have since I became group CEO one year ago, with some comments on the current environment. We continue to monitor with full vigilance the elevated levels of COVID-19 cases in Switzerland, and all the countries around the globe where we operate. In my first year, I'm very proud of what Credit Suisse has delivered for clients, employees and shareholders. For clients, we took a leading role in establishing Switzerland's successful lending facility last year, and helped clients around the globe navigate turbulent economies and markets. For our employees, we created a safe and productive environment while moving to a mostly digital footprint in a short period of time. Our success is reflected in a survey last year that showed more than 90% of employees felt well supported and well informed by management. For shareholders, we paid the full dividend with respect to 2019 and reinitiated our 2021 share buyback program earlier this year in January. We stand ready to do our part for our communities and economies, be it here in Switzerland or elsewhere, through lending initiatives, donation programs, and other measures. In the challenging 2020 environment, we delivered solutions for our clients to help them seize opportunities and manage risks in turbulent times. We addressed historic issues and invested in our businesses. We launched sustainability research and investment solutions, SRI to put sustainability at the heart of our offering to private, corporate and institutional clients. We enter 2021 with strong momentum, as evidenced by our best January in a decade. Pretax income for the month was up year-on-year across all divisions. Investment Banking revenues are up substantially from the same period in 2020. Notwithstanding the fragility of the global economy due to the pandemic, the growth strategy that I will discuss with you today puts us in an excellent position to build on our progress and to achieve our midterm ambitions that we set out at our Investor Update in December, and which we reaffirm today. With that, let me turn to the Slides. Let me start with Slide 4. Our step-by-step growth strategy builds on the work completed in the last few quarters. This is supported by a strong balance sheet that allows us to invest while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital distribution. A few weeks ago, in early January, we announced that we would have to record a pretax loss in the fourth quarter. This is primarily the result of having addressed historic and other issues. These included major litigation provisions of CHF 757 million, largely related to RMBS cases, and impairment relating to York of CHF 414 million within our Asset Management business. As a result, we recorded a fourth quarter pretax loss of CHF 88 million, and the net loss attributable to shareholders of CHF 353 million. For the full year 2020, we reported pretax income of CHF 3.5 billion, and net income attributable to shareholders of CHF 2.7 billion. However, our adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was CHF 4.4 billion in 2020, up a healthy 6% from 2019. And we achieved this result despite CHF 1.1 billion of provision for credit losses and significant FX headwinds caused by the weaker U.S. dollar. Let me say a few words about some of our challenges at the end of last year. At our Investor Update two months ago, I spoke about my personal priorities and the importance of dealing with legacies and of accountability which is one of the pillars of our refreshed code of conduct that we unveiled last month. Some of the cases I mentioned date back many years. Nevertheless, these cases have affected our results in 2020. In light of the COVID-19 situation, and resulting economic environment, and together with our assessment of shareholder returns in 2020, we have decided, with the approval of the Board of Directors to lower our overall bonus pool by 7% for 2020 compared to the previous year. We are reducing short term incentive awards for the Executive Board to an even greater extent. This decision underscores to our employees, clients, shareholders and stakeholders, that accountability and transparency are of the highest priority for us at Credit Suisse. As you can see on the left side of the Slide, we executed four strategic initiatives to support our growth agenda. These refinements are expected to generate approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million in savings per annum from 2022 onwards. We are targeting growth investments of CHF 300 million to CHF 600 million in 2021 across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank. This is accompanied by investments in relationship and actual recruitment, ESG products and private markets. We intend to invest most of our marginal capital generated into Wealth Management to deploy into lending. In 2020, we made a total capital distribution of around CHF 1 billion through our 2019 dividend and 2020 share buyback. Our strong capital position, a CET1 ratio of 12.9% at year-end 2020 allows us to invest and capture growth opportunities, while providing attractive capital return through dividends and share buybacks. We recommend an increase of our dividend for 2020 of 5.4% above our 2019 dividend. We expect the total capital distribution of at least CHF 1.8 billion in 2021, subject to market and economic conditions. Our resilient results came amid a challenging macroeconomic and operating backdrop. Many developed economies have struggled to recoup output lost last spring, although the APAC region remains resilient. This led to a prolongation of the lower for longer interest rate environment, driving strength in the Swiss franc, our reporting currency. The low interest rate environment has been something that we have been dealing with in Switzerland for many years, but that all banks which are active in the U.S. dollar market, have now had to confront. Equity markets have recovered, aided by COVID-19 vaccines, strong fiscal and monetary stimulus and the expectations for an economic rebound. Next page, please. Economic and interest rate backdrop was challenging for banks. Credit losses were elevated in the U.S. and Europe by low interest rates weighed on net interest income. Meanwhile, restrictions on bank dividends and share buybacks weighed on bank share prices in many jurisdictions. Next page, please. Despite this challenging macroeconomic and operating environment, we have recorded a 22% growth in pre-provision profit in 2020 year-on-year on an adjusted basis, or 30% at constant FX rates. We enter our growth phase with a lot of momentum both in our Wealth Management businesses as well as in the Investment Bank. Whilst 2021 remains somewhat difficult to predict, this should allow us to achieve our medium-term ambition of 10% to 12% return on tangible equity in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions. Next slide, please. Developing and executing major strategic initiatives is difficult in the best of times. Doing so amid the worst economic and public health shock in decades, requires a monumental but necessary effort across our Bank. Notably, we created a single Investment Bank, which has provided scale and diversification. It has spurred both cost and revenue opportunities, as well as more flexibility with respect to capital allocation, the benefits of which are increasingly evident in the momentum of the franchise. We launched SRI combining research, investment solutions and products, impact advisory and finance as well as marketing and branding. We are integrating Neue Aargauer Bank into Swiss Universal Bank and launched our digital offering ESX to optimize our national branch network and drive digitalization, we combined our risk and compliance functions. These initiatives, along with other efficiency measures in IWM and the Corporate Center, are expected to generate gross savings of approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million per annum from 2022 onwards. We expect to invest the savings in growth opportunities across the Group. Next page, please. Let me now turn to our global Investment Banking business where our revenues saw a strong rebound last year in line with many of our peers. As you can see on the left of this slide, global revenues grew 19% in 2020, to USD 10.2 billion. As you know, although Global Trading Solutions is housed in the IB division, some revenues are booked in the other three divisions. If you were to include all of those GTS revenues, such growth would be even higher. Therefore, this was only modestly below industry revenue pool growth of 24%, despite our underweight position in macro, which contributed significantly to industry revenue growth last year. This demonstrates the underlying momentum in our franchise, which are either strongly connected to the Wealth Management business or our higher return businesses. Our revenue increase was broad based across products in all four main areas. We have leading positions across fixed income, equities and capital markets. As a former ECM banker, I'm particularly proud for being number one in global IPOs in 2020, one of the biggest years on record for global IPOs. Slide 10, please. Our capital markets and advisory franchise has gained momentum and outperformed Street. Based on the Dealogic data, we achieved 37% year-on-year growth in fees for these franchises in 2020 based on global revenues, a faster rate of growth than our leading peers. We grew market share from 3.7% in 2019 to 4.3% in 2020. We achieved especially strong growth in equity capital markets. Slide 11, please. Our diversified, balanced and integrated Investment Bank division is poised to continue delivering sustainable returns with reduced earnings volatility. We believe that our business mix is well positioned for the post COVID-19 environment with an expected recovery in M&A and Asset Finance. We believe that capital markets activity will be driven by IPOs and leverage finance with a more tailored offering in macro. We are growing connectivity between the Investment Bank and Wealth Management with GTS as a gateway between the two businesses. This delivers institutional-style solutions to Wealth Management clients. GTS saw 31% revenue growth year-on-year in 2020. As a result, we achieved a 70% growth in adjusted pretax income in the Investment Bank division last year, and grew our adjusted return on regulatory capital to 13%, well within our medium-term ambition of 10% to 15% RoRC for the Investment Bank. Next page. Our ambition is to be a leader in sustainability. One of the most significant decisions that I took in my first year as Group CEO was to create SRI at the Executive Board level along with setting an ambitious target to provide at least CHF 300 billion in sustainable financing over the next 10 years. We infused environmental, social and governance standards at the heart of Research, Advisory, Investment Bank, and Wealth Management. We announced additional initiatives at our Investor Update, including the development of science-based targets within the next 24 months, and repositioning our portfolio to support client transitions. Early this week, we have also announced the collaboration agreement with BlackRock to co-develop products in the private and alternative space with ESG integration. This allows us to leverage our thematic Supertrends capabilities as part of our House View. The collaboration continues our strong focus on providing differentiated alternatives, and private market solutions to our clients. We are not simply applying ESG to our client solutions. We are embedding them in our own operations as well. These include our focus on diversity and inclusion, a clear purpose statement, a refreshed code of conduct and Sustainability Advisory Committee at the Board of Directors level. We have received recognition for our engagement, including being upgraded to an A rating by MSCI putting us in the top 15% of our peer group. Next page please. A key initiative for our home market last year was a decision to integrate our 100% owned Neue Aargauer Bank subsidiary into Credit Suisse [Schweiz Aargau]. The legal merger was completed in November 2020. The operational integration is on track, which will result in unified coverage and enhanced client offering. We have successfully retained business in the face of fierce competition well above our base plan. The integration of NAB is part of a broader adaption of our retail and SME business model, and branch network to reflect change in client behavior around digitalization, with a halving of the number of branches since 2013. The implementation of cost synergies is on course, part of our roughly expected CHF 100 million in gross savings per annum in the Swiss Universal Bank from 2022 onwards. We are also positioning ourselves as a digital leader in affluent and retail business with our newly launched digital offering CSX. Next page, Page 14. The crisis confirms the effectiveness of our risk management practices. We navigated the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic last spring, in part because 87% of loans were collateralized. 60% of our loan book relates to the Swiss Universal Bank, and Switzerland has had historically low credit loss experience compared with other regions. Our strategy is to accelerate growth in a risk-controlled way across the cycle. We aim to keep our rigorous standards consistent with our performance over 2010 to 2020, which saw an average provision for credit loss ratio of under 10 basis points. Our compliance organization has seen significant investments in people, systems and technology over the last few years. After this upgrade of our compliance and non-financial risk functions, we are convinced that combining the risk and compliance functions into one organization will further drive efficiencies and effectiveness of control at the same time. It enables more consistent execution and delivery of our control framework across risk and compliance. Slide 15, please. As presented at our Investor Update in December, Wealth Management is our core business and continues to be one of the most attractive segments in financial services. Global wealth is expected to increase by USD 25 trillion by 2024 a faster rate of growth than global Gross Domestic Product. Emerging market wealth is expected to grow 11% per annum, driven by entrepreneurs, and ultra high net worth is the fastest growing wealth segment, both areas where we are especially well placed. We are particularly focused on capturing growth opportunities in Asia Pacific with 56% of the world's population Asia Pacific's growing middle class remains one of the biggest trends and drivers in the global economy. The ultra-high net worth segment is growing about 11% as well, faster than the rest of the world. APAC is absolutely core to Credit Suisse and today the region accounts for almost 20% of our total net revenues. And this includes the APAC portion of Investment Banking, which compares to only around 12% for many of our global peers. Page 16. Assets under Management across Credit Suisse Group increased from CHF 1.2 trillion in 2015 to CHF 1.5 trillion in 2020 at compound annual growth rate of 4%, including Wealth Management AuM growth of 5% annually. On a U.S. dollar basis, the growth would have been faster per annum, namely 7% with a total AuM of over USD 1.7 trillion, as per the end of 2020. This highlights the attractive underlying growth momentum of our franchises. Now, let me dig a little bit deeper into Assets under Management because the AuM is only part of the picture. On Page 17, I will go into more detail, what for me is the more important element which is the client business volume. Because when I look at our underlying private banking franchise from a quantitative perspective, I look at client business volume. Our Wealth Management opportunity comes from a combination of Assets under Management, net loan, as well as custody assets. These custody assets, which includes lower profitability, unlevered client assets such as single stock positions, gold or cash, without any advisory mandate around them, provide us with dry powder to convert into an AuM and loans as well as transactional revenues. The vast majority of client business volumes in International Wealth Management and notably APAC are denominated in U.S. dollars or in currencies that are pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is why we are showing the numbers on this page in Swiss francs for SUB and in U.S. dollars for IWM and APAC. We have generated substantial client business volume growth across our Wealth Management franchises, particularly in APAC, which achieved 14% compound annual growth rate in U.S. dollar terms between 2015 and 2020. We have also seen growth in IWM private banking client business volume, including and especially under the leadership of Philipp Wehle over the last two years. Our ambition is to maintain or accelerate these growth rates going forward with annual client business volume growth of mid-single digits for the Swiss Universal Bank, mid-to-high single digits for IWM and double-digit growth in APAC. Slide 18, please. Our central mission at Credit Suisse is to provide solutions to our clients that help them find opportunities and manage risk in turbulent times. Our House View added substantial value for our clients during the pandemic. As you can see from this slide, we made key calls at critical junctures. Most notably, our CIO and his team had the courage to go overweight on equities on March 25 close to the market lows. Our discretionary mandates, which are based on our House View, outperformed 67% of clients in a non-discretionary portfolio on a three-year view. Our decision last year to house Chief Investment Office within SRI allows us to better align ESG standards into our investment processes as well as into our suite of discretionary mandates. Next page, please. You may remember this slide from our December Capital Markets Day. It shows our specific growth metrics for Wealth Management. It is, other than revenues, which remains a key metric, how we measure ourselves, and it should also be the way you should measure us. We are committed to accelerating growth in Wealth Management, building on the core principles under our unique Bank for Entrepreneurs model, investing most of our marginal capital into Wealth Management. Our growth strategy includes further development of our ESG solutions, and our already successful collaboration with the Investment Bank and with Asset Management. You can see our specific numeric ambitions on the right hand of the page. Let me highlight our ambition to grow our overall client business volume, which includes again, Assets under Management, custody assets and net loans to the mid-to-high single digits over the medium term at the Group level at constant foreign exchange rates. This includes a medium-term ambition for double digit growth in APAC, as previously mentioned, Slide 20, please. At our Investor Day, we also announced our ambition to grow Wealth Management related pretax income, which on an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, was CHF 3.8 billion in 2022 to CHF 5 billion to CHF 5.5 billion in 2023. Today, we reaffirm our objective for an increase in our RoRC to 20% to 25%. And we plan to invest most of our marginal capital generated into Wealth Management to deploy into lending. We are deepening our onshore footprint in faster growing markets, notably China. We will also continue to drive GTS Investment Bank and Asset Management collaboration with the Wealth Management franchise and we expect to benefit from a normalization in both credit provisions and Asset Management profitability. Slide 21, we expect to increase our capital return in 2021 compared to 2020, demonstrating the strength of our capital position and business momentum. We achieved the total capital distribution in 2020 of around CHF 1 billion paid to shareholders. For this year, we expect a total of at least CHF 1.8 billion payable to shareholders through a 2020 dividend of around CHF 766 million, and a share buyback of between CHF 1 billion and CHF 1.5 billion. As I said at the beginning, our strong balance sheet allows us to both invest for growth and provide attractive shareholder returns. I will now hand over to David to go over our results in greater detail. And then I will make some concluding remarks before our Q&A. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Thomas. Good morning, everybody. And I'd now like to take you through our financial results in more detail. And before I start, I'd remind you that whilst our reported performance remains our primary metric, given the combination of the restructuring measures that we announced last summer, the charges that we took in the fourth quarter, and the movements that we've seen in some of our equity investments over the last two years, we will continue to give additional emphasis to our adjusted numbers. This quarter was particularly complex, given that in addition to our restructuring costs, we have also absorbed the impairment related to our investment in York capital and the increase in our existing RMBS provisions. And you will note that we reached a settlement with MBIA last week. I would highlight two items that we've not previously announced. First, the gain before tax of CHF 158 million on our equity investment in SIX Group and second, the gain before tax of CHF 127 million francs on our equity investment in Allfunds Group, both of which were taken in the fourth quarter. I'd also highlight again, the adverse effect of the strengthening of the Swiss franc against many other currencies in which we conduct our business. On a constant currency basis, this translated into a reduction to our adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items for the fourth quarter of CHF 108 million, compared to the same period last year. And for the full year, a reduction of CHF 287 million for 2020 compared to 2019. Let me turn to Slide 23. So as Thomas has already summarized, Credit Suisse delivered a resilient performance for the year. Reported net revenues are flat year-on-year at CHF 22.4 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, net revenues were 3% higher. In terms of business trends, we saw strong performance from the Investment Bank, with heightened transactional activity across the Group. Clearly, our Wealth Management businesses suffered from weakness in net interest income, primarily due to the fall in U.S. interest rates, and from the impact of the appreciation of the Swiss franc. However, as I'll discuss in more detail later on, recurring revenues have shown sequential quarter-on-quarter improvements in Swiss franc terms, and we believe that the adverse trends affecting our net interest income and are bottoming out at current exchange rates. Overall adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items increased by 6% for the full year from CHF 4.14 billion to CHF 4.3 8 billion year-on-year. As I've said before, our reported numbers for the quarter were adversely affected by significant charges, which resulted, as we previously guided in a pretax loss for the quarter, totaling CHF 88 million. This did, however, mask a resilient underlying performance. Adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items was 10% lower year-on-year, but on a constant currency basis, 1% higher. Our tax charge for 2020 was 23%. In the middle of the range that we'd set for the year, I would note, it was a little bit higher than I'd previously anticipated, primarily due to the charges that we took in the fourth quarter. With regard to 2021, I'd maintain our guidance for a level around the mid-20s. Although I'd warn that the rate for the first quarter may be higher than this. I'd once again caution that this assumes unchanged tax regimes in the countries in which we operate, with a particular caveat about whether the Biden administration will amend the U.S. federal tax rate later this year. Reported net income attributable to shareholders for the year stood at CHF 2.67 billion, 22% lower than in 2019. That equates to return on tangible equity of 6.6% for the year, compared to 8.7% for 2019. I would note that this drop was entirely due to the year-on-year swing in the contribution of adjustments and significant items, which are shown in more detail on the next slide. As you can see here, although our reported pretax income was 27% lower year-on-year on an adjusted basis excluding significant items, it was 6% higher, as the impact of the items that I've listed here swung from a net credit of CHF 577 million in 2019 to a net debit of CHF 908 million in 2020. I'd add that once you adjust further for FX movements, our adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items was 13% higher year-on-year. Let's just turn to the next slide please and just look at the CET1 ratio. We finished 2020 with a CET1 ratio of 12.9% approximately 20 basis points higher than at the end of the previous year. And I'd reiterate my previous guidance, which is that we intend to maintain a CET1 ratio of at least 12.5% for at least the first half of this year. I've mentioned the phase-in of certain Basel III reforms, primarily the SA-CCR change on a number of occasions over the last few years. These changes resulted in a cumulative impact of CHF 11 billion with RWA inflation for 2020, slightly better than the guidance we've given before. And clearly this has been fully accounted for in our end period capital ratios. In terms of capital distribution, we have as you know, paid the 2019 dividend CHF 0.2776 in full. With regard to 2020, we intend to recommend a single payment of CHF 0.2926 per share, which provided that it is approved by our shareholders at our Annual General Meeting in April, will be paid in May. You also know that last month, we initiated our 2021 share buyback program, and we'd repurchase shares to the value of CHF 112 million as of the 16th of February. Let's look at leverage please, on the next slide. Our exposure at the end of the fourth quarter stood at CHF 800 billion excluding central bank reserves, down from CHF 824 billion at the end of the third quarter. This decrease was mainly due to currency movements, particularly the depreciation of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc. Our CET1 leverage ratio at the yearend was 4.4%. And our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 6.4%, both stable compared to the end of the third quarter. I would remind you that the famous temporary exemption of cash held at central banks ended on the 1st of January this year. And if you look at these ratios, including central bank reserves, they would have stood at 3.9% and 5.6%, respectively, at the end of last year. I'd once again draw your attention to our Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which at 190% is similar to the level at the end of the third quarter. We continue to take a conservative approach to liquidity management, and this ratio remains amongst the highest of the major banks. Let me touch briefly on tangible book value per share. You'll see that our tangible book value per share was broadly unchanged at the end of 2020, compared to the end of 2019, standing at CHF 15.80 compared to CHF 15.88, 12 months earlier. Let me just run you through the changes. Net income attributable to shareholders of CHF 2.7 billion, contributed CHF 1.10 per share with the effects of our capital distribution program and share based compensation awards, resulting in a total for the year before own credit and FX movements of CHF 16.94 per share. As you know, tangible book value per share is influenced by movements in our own credits spreads and by FX changes, given that we retain a significant amount of our capital denominated in U.S. dollars. Now with regard to our own credit moves, spreads widened in the first quarter, and then subsequently narrowed, leaving a net impact of CHF 0.08 for the year. However, the negative impact from currency move was much more marked, totally CHF 1.27 for the year of which CHF 0.49 came in the final quarter. And next, I'll just like to update you on the progress of our restructuring program. As a reminder, we said in July, that we expected to spend approximately CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million on this program over the course of 12 months. And that we expect to generate around CHF 400 million in run rate savings, with the full benefit being realized from 2022 onwards. The key components of the restructuring were, bringing together our Investment Banking and Capital Markets and Global Markets businesses together into a single Investment Bank together with APAC markets, creating a new function, sustainability, research and investment solutions, bringing together the risk and compliance functions and integrating Neue Aargauer Bank into the Swiss Universal Bank. You recall that we reported at the end of the third quarter that we'd spent CHF 107 million on restructuring. And you can see that the total for the year was CHF 157 million. Primarily taking the International Wealth Management, the Investment Bank and in the Swiss Universal Bank, and primarily relating to redundancy expenses. At this point, I'd expect our restructuring costs to total something between CHF 300 million and CHF 350 million marginally lower than before. And I would still expect to complete this program by the end of the second quarter of this year. Now we continue to expect to achieve the gross savings that I mentioned in October that's CHF 250 million to CHF 300 million for 2021 and CHF 400 million, to CHF 450 million, from 2022. Let's just turn to the next slide, please. This looks at credit provisions. Including provisions for the CECL methodology, which as you know was implemented at the start of last year, we started 2020, with CHF 1.22 billion for allowances for credit losses. And of course in the first half of the year, we took an additional CHF 864 million in provisions, split approximately equally between CECL related and specific provisions. Net write-offs of CHF 84 million in other adjustments took us to a balance of CHF 2.0 billion at the end of June. And if we look at the second half of the year, our CECL balance was more stable, with a net release of CHF 23 million, reflecting a broadly unchanged set of predictions. We did, however, see an increase in specific allowances, and had net write-offs in the second half of CHF 241 million. Factoring the weakness in the U.S. dollar, the net provisions on the balance sheet of CHF 1.90 billion at the end of the year, was split approximately equally between specific and nonspecific provisions and were clearly, considerably higher than where we started 2020. Let's move to the next Slide, please. I think if we look forward to 2021. I just caution. I think it's too early really, to make forecasts for credit provisions for this year. Clearly 2020 was an exceptional year, especially as the pandemic coincided with the introduction of CECL, and provisions room was four times higher than our 11-year average of CHF 280 million per year. That equates to an average provision for credit losses ratio, that is the total taken relative to loans held at amortized cost outstanding of 9.0 basis points. For 2020, that ratio leapt to 30 basis points. Now, of course, I would expect to see our provisions return to levels, the more normal over the next few years, with the difference dropping through to the bottom line. But the pace of that normalization does remain difficult to gauge. Personally, I do not expect to see a comparable increase in CECL charges in 2021. Given that I believe we're unlikely to see a repeat of the precipitous decline in the economic operating environment that we witnessed about a year ago. However, against this, we do need to balance the risk of increasing corporate failures as we emerge from the pandemic, together with a corresponding requirement for heightened levels of specific provisions. Next slide. Now shown here, a version of this slide over the past few quarters, and just as a reminder, it charts our allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of gross loans for our wholesale business across last year, compared to three of our leading U.S. peers. As you can see, we remain at broadly similar or indeed marginally more conservative levels to the other banks. Next slide, please. And before we turn to the divisional overviews, I wanted to give you a summary of the revenue trends that we've seen in our Wealth Management businesses. Let me start with a net interest income on the left-hand side. And surprisingly, when looked at in Swiss francs, net interest income has dropped sharply since the start of the pandemic from CHF 1.35 billion in the first quarter of 2020 to CHF 1.20 billion in the fourth quarter. However, as Thomas has indicated, on a sequential basis, this downward trend has now stabilized and given the momentum that we're seeing in our lending programs, we would expect to see this trend begin to improve sequentially in 2021. In terms of recurring commissions and fees, after the low point in the second quarter, primarily the result of the impact on portfolios of the market sell-off in March and April and compounded by the weakness since of Swisscard, fees have increased steadily, notwithstanding the currency impact. Transaction activity, as I've mentioned before, has been strong throughout 2020, including into the fourth quarter and notwithstanding the normal seasonal trends. Our Global Trading Solutions offering, providing bespoke institutional style products to our ultra high net worth clients, was a key driver of this growth in transaction revenues with Wealth Management-related revenues in collaboration of GTS, 34% higher in the year compared 2019. And I would reiterate that this strength has been sustained so far in 2021. I'll now turn to the divisional slides. Now before doing so, though, I'd remind you that in the tables, we're showing adjusted key financials excluding significant items. Where appropriate, I will call out the points where FX moves have had a particular impact. And I've included in the appendix versions of the slide for IWM and APAC in U.S. dollars, as well as full reconciliations with the reported numbers. Let's start with the Swiss Universal Bank. On an adjusted basis and excluding significant items, the Swiss Universal Bank generated net revenues of CHF 5.31 billion in the year, slightly higher than in 2019. Operating expenses were slightly lower at CHF 3.15 billion, reflecting our strong ongoing cost discipline. However, the significant increase in provisions for credit losses CHF 270 million compared to CHF 109 million in 2019 means that adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items was 4% lower year-on-year at CHF 1.89 billion. It's worth noting that CHF 75 million of the provision for credit losses was part of our CECL calculation, which as you know, is based on an assessment of a range of macroeconomic factors and can be recovered if the outlook improves. Now if we look at the fourth quarter, as I said already, we have seen the pressure on net interest income stabilize compared to the third quarter helped by an increase in net loans, which rose to CHF 176 billion from CHF 174 billion. Recurring revenues, albeit stable sequentially, still reflect the substantially weaker performance of our investment in Swisscard. Transaction based revenues were 5% lower in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Though they increased by 8% for the full year, driven by higher brokerage fees and increased revenues, both from GTS and from our Swiss Investment Banking business, credit provisions were still elevated at CHF 66 million in the fourth quarter compared to CHF 43 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, although we didn't see any particular signs of stress in the period. Now before we move to the next division, you will notice in addition to showing a year-on-year comparison for some of the key divisional metrics the quarter, I've included the full year total for these metrics for the last five years. Let me now turn to IWM. Our International Wealth Management division delivered net revenues of CHF 4.92 billion for the year on an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, 10% lower year-on-year. Operating expenses were 2% lower than 2019 at CHF 3.62 billion, although provisions for credit losses of CHF 110 million compared to CHF 49 million in 2019, which meant that the adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was 30% lower year-on-year at CHF 1.19 billion. This total includes an adverse impact of CHF 104 million from FX movements. The reported loss of CHF 12 million for the quarter was primarily due to the York capital impairment of CHF 414 million. The charge for which was taken in Asset Management. Adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was CHF 321 million, 22% lower year-on-year, but up sequentially by 20% on the third quarter of the year. Within Private Banking, we saw a record year for net new assets of CHF 16.7 billion for the year, of which CHF 4.3 billion for the fourth quarter was also a record and it reflected strong inflows both in emerging markets and in Western Europe. Asset Management saw CHF 15.5 billion of net asset inflows for the year against a challenging backdrop, and improved inflows in the fourth quarter, compared to the third with net flow in new assets of CHF 6.3 billion. Let's turn now to Asia Pacific, please, on the next slide. The performance of our Asia Pacific division reflected stronger market and client activity. Full year adjusted net revenues excluding significant items were 5% higher year-on-year at CHF 3.09 billion, with operating costs on the same basis 2% higher at CHF 2.09 billion. Provisions for credit losses were CHF 236 million compared to CHF 55 million for '19, resulting in an adjusted pretax income, again excluding sniffing items of CHF 769 million, 7% lower than in the previous year. Now looking at the fourth quarter, adjusted net revenues and adjusted pretax income excluding significant items were stable year-on-year at CHF 746 million, and CHF 201 million, respectively. And that resulted in a return on regulatory capital of 23%. Transaction based revenues made the most significant contribution, they were 20% higher year-on-year at CHF 450 million, reflecting increased financing revenues, which included mark-to-market gains and higher origination fees for equity related activity and strong client activity. Net interest income fell by 27% year-on-year, mainly reflecting the low interest rate environment and low lending volumes due to the deleveraging that we saw in the first half of 2020. Our recurring commission and fees were 5% lower due to unfavorable FX movements. Total net new assets for the year was CHF 8.6 billion equivalent to an annualized growth rate of 4%. That included outflows of CHF 1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. We've continued to see a reversal of the deleveraging in the first half of the year, and a resumption of net loan growth on a constant currency basis. Let me now take this opportunity just to advise you that as of the first quarter of 2021, we will be presenting the results of our Asia Pacific division in U.S. dollars in order to provide greater transparency on the underlying performance, given that much of our business is conducted either in U.S. dollars, or in currencies that are pegged to the U.S. dollars. Let me turn now to the Investment Bank. The Investment Bank had another robust quarter to close out a year in which strong revenue momentum flow through to high profitability and improved returns. If you look at the fourth quarter, adjusted net revenues were 19% higher year-on-year at USD 2.34 billion. Adjusted operating expenses was 7% higher at USD 1.94 billion, primarily due to higher compensation costs. Provision for credit losses were $42 million, compared to $69 million in the same quarter last year. And that resulted in an adjusted pretax income of USD 357 million. Now if we look at each business line, the strongest area was Capital Markets, in which revenues were up by 90% year-on-year, reflecting higher debt issuance activity and a threefold increase in ECM revenues. Our fixed income sales and trading performance has been resilient, particularly as we're not materially exposed to the strongest and the most volatile sub-segments in macro, having restructured and downsized our rates business some years ago. Equity sales and trading revenues were 5% higher year-on-year, with strong contributions from cash equities and equity derivatives, partly offset by defensive risk positioning in the second half of the year. Now if we look at the full year performance, adjusted net revenues at USD 9.72 billion were 18% high year-on-year, including growth across all products and accelerating momentum in capital markets, particularly in the second half. Adjusted operating expenses were 5% higher at USD 7.35 billion, resulting in adjusted pretax income of USD 1.88 billion and that was 70% higher than in 2019. Now I'd just reiterate the guidance that Thomas has given. The positive trends that we've seen in the Investment Bank last year have continued so far in 2021 with a strong capital markets pipeline augmented by a resilient trading performance. And with that, I'd like to conclude my part of this morning's presentation, and hand back to Thomas. Thank you very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, David. So let me wrap up on Page 46. Our key growth agenda allows us to deliver attractive shareholder value. This includes our ambition to deliver pretax income in our Wealth Management related businesses of CHF 5.0 billion to CHF 5.50 billion in 2023. We expect to deploy most of our incremental capital into Wealth Management, and aim to drive positive operating leverage. We affirm our ambition to achieve an RoRC of 20% to 25% for Wealth Management related businesses, and of 10% to 15% for the Investment Bank, with sustainable investment solutions at the core of our offering to Wealth Management, corporate and institutional clients. These efforts should support our goal to achieve our medium-term ambition of 10% to 12% RoTE in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions. I will close my presentation with a few words about start to 2021. Investment Banking revenues, year-to-date, are up substantially year-on-year, driven by continued strong capital markets performance and trading activity. We have a healthy IB pipeline across products. We expect more normalized credit provisions in 2021 but with a wide range of possible outcomes. We also expect a more normal level of Asset Management profitability. As such, we saw our strongest January in a decade, with pretax income up year-on-year across all divisions with notable strength in APAC and the Investment Bank. However, this pandemic is not behind us. And we recognize that the broader economic recovery remains fragile and markets will remain somewhat unpredictable. Before I hand over to Kinner, allow me to thank you for your attention today and for your great engagement. I look forward to seeing as many of you as possible this year. In the meantime, I wish you all the best for you and your families and wish you a healthy and prosperous continuation of 2021. Thank you. And with this, I would like to hand over back to Kinner. And we will then go together with David's into the Q&A. Thank you.\\nKinner Lakhani: We will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. Operator, let's open the line, please.\\nQuestion-and:\\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from Exane. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you very much. Two questions, please. Firstly, on the bonus pool comment that you made, did you say that was in Swiss francs or in dollars, that you reduced the bonus pool by 7% year-on-year? And how do you see that move, is that a sort of one-off impact reflecting some of the one-off charges in the year or is that a sustained realignment of the profitability in that business in the direction that you need to go towards your targets? So that's my first question. The second question really was a slightly broader one of the Wealth Management side about flows where there was weakness in the Swiss business and in Asia in the quarter. But even just looking at the year as a whole, relatively modest flows I'd say so largely around sort of 2.5% net new money. And I just wondered how you saw prospects for flows in 2021, whether we can expect a little bit more growth than that in terms of inflows?\\nThomas Gottstein: Yeah, thanks, Jeremy. I hope you can hear me. Can you hear me?\\nJeremy Sigee: Yes, absolutely.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay, very good. Just wanted to make sure the technology works. So bonus pool, yeah, it's 7% down in Swiss franc, which in dollar terms is probably about flat. We clearly, we paid up in Investment Bank, we paid down in some of the divisions outside the Investment Bank or flat and Corporate Center somewhat down. So, overall, I think we have to pay for performance. And we had kind of a mixed 2020 in the sense that we had strong underlying performance, if you look at our PTI excluding significant items, we're up 6%, despite higher credit provisions and despite FX headwinds. But on the other hand, we had some one-offs and especially in the fourth quarter, legacies to address and that's why together with the Board, we came to view that the minus 7% is the right number. And we will continue to pay for performance going forward. So this is not a trend or anything, it's just the way we look at the bonus pool. In terms of Wealth Management flows. Look, I intentionally included a slide, Slide 17, which shows you more on the longer term, the client business volume, and that's the way I have always looked at the business, be it in my old role as Head of the SUB division, be it now in the Group role because this is really how you should look at the Private Banking franchise, namely Asset under Management, custody assets and net loans. And as you can see that we've been growing 4% in Switzerland over the years. And if you look at IWM and APAC, and these numbers here are in U.S. dollars, which reflect also the fact that 25% only and I think it's only 4% or 5% in APAC, are in Swiss francs. So in these two divisions, so it's much better look at U.S. dollar, we have been growing by 6% in IWM and by 14%. And that's why mid-single digit is the right target for SUB, mid-to-high single digit is the right target for IWM and double digit is the right target for APAC. You can also see some deleveraging going on in Switzerland, because if you see the loan in Switzerland, it went from CHF 160 billion to CHF 118 billion. But the custody assets went up from CHF 43 billion to CHF 54 billion. And for example, in Asia, we also had quite a lot of deleveraging USD 57 billion to USD 107 billion in terms of custody assets, but net loans went down USD 47 billion to USD 44 billion. So there was definitely some deleveraging going on. And that's for us an opportunity to grow and to increase our lending business in all three divisions actually. But this is the way I think one should look at Private Banking business. So you look at all three elements AuM, custody assets and net loans.\\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you, so helpful. Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you, we will take your next question. And the question was from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. I'd like to ask the same two questions actually I asked at Investor Day, just your updated thoughts. The best on Slide 32, under the transaction column, you flag two things. One is that you've got a very tough comp in first half '20, given the elevated transaction levels that we saw. On the flip side, you suggest you're seeing a 34% increase in WM-related revenues in collaboration with GTS. I'm interested to know or how you think those two things were into play going into 2021, as one is, obviously somewhat of a headwind versus the second being a tailwind. That will be the first question. The second one I just wanted to turn to the Investment Bank. I know when we talk about it on the Investor Day, you talked about focusing on profitability and returns rather than market share. You also made a point about your business mix, namely, in equity you're overweight cash and derivatives and underweight prime and in fixed income, you've been underweight macro. But when I looked at Q4, there was obviously some degree of normalization and a lot of those business mix shifts, rates particularly pulled back and credit was actually stronger and yet for the third consecutive quarter, you've underperformed the peers pretty much in every business line, fixed income equities and primary. And so just to about the momentum kind of stalled a little bit there, so perhaps you could just elaborate on your thoughts on Investment Banking, more broadly in 2021? Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you. And do you want to start with the transactional revenues and I will take the Investment Bank, David? Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: My pleasure. I mean, I think your question Andrew was around in terms of how we see the comparables, I think, and then obviously, the performance with GTS really because obviously, we saw strong growth during 2020. I guess your question, Andrew is, so what do we expect for '21, is it going to be up against that 2020 comparable, given the structural growth? Or how does it come together? Look, I think that was the point. But I, please correct me if I'm wrong, Andrew. But my answer to that would be, we clearly have seen a strong start to 2021 in terms of our GTS businesses. And that's what we're really reflecting, obviously, in terms of the comments we've made about the very strong January that we've had. Clearly, those comparables will get more tough as we actually move into the, as we now move into our one-year anniversary of COVID and you saw the market volatility picking up in March, April and May. So look, I think last year was very strong in terms of structural activity and it was strong in terms of volatility, and it will become more difficult to show that progression against that comparable, but it's certainly been a very good start to the year. And I think there is clearly a fundamental demand by clients in a market where it's difficult to earn net interest income, because interest rates are kind of zero or negative in most locations. And at that point that's leading to two trends. One, I think clients are looking to alternatives, they are looking investments to actually made to generate those returns. And clearly many of our corporate clients are also concerned around hedging risk, and how do they actually hedge some of the volatility, it's still a very uncertain market. And I think that does mean it's a favorable market for GTS. And it's a favorable market for transactions across the Wealth Management division. But I'm not sure I just want to get into a forward-looking view for how I see the next 10 months of the year against the comparables we saw for 2020. But it's certainly been a very good start for the year.\\nThomas Gottstein: As far as Investment Banking is concerned, if you look at one of the slides, I presented you, you can see that we were for the full year, up 19%. And I said also that if you actually include the GTS part, we were up more than that, close to the industry of 24%, I think is the industry. So I think overall, we have despite the fact that we have less exposure to macro, for the full year, actually performed more or less in line with the market. We outperformed the market in capital markets and in M&A, as you can see also in one of my slides, equities was somewhat slower, that's true, but we've also had probably less market share on the equity derivative side. We have had quite solid performance with plus 12% in equities. And especially on the on the cash side, I'm quite satisfied. But also in equities, you should probably look at it a bit more holistically. And if you include equity capital markets, and look at the whole equity business in the fourth quarter, for example, I think we were up 44%, 45%, very much in line with our U.S. peers. So and, from that perspective, I'm not worried at all. Quite the contrary, actually, if I look at January, we've had a very strong start. And as I said it was the strongest January, we had in the last 10 years.\\nAndrew Coombs: Thank you. I have a follow up on the latter point. There you said about looking at equities holistically, and ECM, obviously a lot of strength we've seen particularly in the back end of 2020 and also in January, it's back-related. But can you just comment on the sustainability there and how CS is positioned to benefit? Thanks.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yeah, we had a very strong year in 2020 in IPOs, and within that in specs, number one in both. I year-to-date, where this activity has been even stronger compared to last year, we think we are number four number five globally. So far, we continue to see big demand for specs, not only in the U.S., but increasingly, also in Asia, and to some extent, also in Europe. So, at least in the short term, we don't see this to slow down. It provides an alternative to private equity and traditional IPOs. And it's something that is certainly here to stay, whether it will - is here to stay at these levels in the mid-to-long term, we'll have to see. But I also think that if you look at the overall macroeconomic situation, there will be a lot of companies that will need to raise capital in the next two, three, four quarters. As we come through this crisis, and people see opportunities, some sectors have been harder hit than others. So maybe there will be a switch or shift somewhat from IPOs to more secondary offerings, capital market activities, but also, we see stronger leveraged finance market. And from that perspective, we've seen that trend already in the first six weeks of the year.\\nAndrew Coombs: Thanks so much.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks Andrew.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from a line of Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nBenjamin Goy: Yes. Hi, good morning. Two questions, please. First on the buyback and then secondly, on the recurring fees. On the buyback, as you mentioned, you're a bit above CHF 100 million. So just wondering on the pace of the buyback, should we think like you aim for the CHF 1 billion, and then when you have more clarity in the second half, it will depend or will then decide where you land within the CHF 1 billion to CHF 1.5 billion range? And then the second question, on the recurring fee margins, I think were good in IWM and also solid in APAC, SUB was down, so just wondering, for this Q3, all the numbers, just wondering how you see the outlook and the client risk appetite in terms of demand for products? Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thanks very much, Benjamin.\\nDavid Mathers: So just first, on the buyback? Yeah, we obviously started the buyback in January. I think what you said is exactly on the money. You know, as Thomas has already remarked, I mean it's an uncertain 2021, COVID-19 we're still in the pandemic, we don't really know yet, what's going to be the extent of government support and stimuli. I think it's early to make forward looking projections around credit provisions, although I do accept that we're lower in '21 than '20. I think it seems prudent therefore, to aim for around about the CHF 250 million a quarter for the first quarter. And then we'll see basically, once we've actually got the first quarter behind us, and we say how the second quarter shaping up, at what level do we actually want to pace it. But I think that's certainly our strategy for the first quarter in terms of how we see it developing. And clearly, the first quarter start has been very promising, shall we say and let that continue, is all I'd really point there. I think in terms of recurring, I'd go back to my Slide 32, if you wouldn't mind, actually, Benjamin. You know, the point I wanted to make there is, if I look at recurring, there's obviously you saw the first as you might say, post COVID quarter 2Q20, we saw the drop, unsurprisingly, because you saw the sell-off in portfolios in March of 2020. That flows through to recurring margins on a recurring fees on a month plus one basis. So unsurprisingly, 2Q was the low point. And then you've seen a steady increase since then, notwithstanding, clearly the strengthening of the Swiss franc against some of the currencies, we earned these revenues in, particularly APAC and IWM. So I think it's been pretty good to see that actually heading up. The other factor in there, we've been explicit about for is clearly the Swisscard investment, which is booked towards recurring revenues in the SUB. You know, I think given the importance of foreign exchange fees to the Swisscard joint venture, I think it's unsurprising that that remains depressed right through 2020 and today basically. So that's clearly a fact, which is very dependent on COVID-19. The balance is beyond that, so, but I'm pleased about the trend in recurring commissions and fees, you can see why it stepped up and if it hadn't increased, then I would be worried. So I think a good trend there in terms of at what we're seeing. And clearly on net interest income, I think whilst you can see the bottom in recurring was 2Q20. I think we would hope that the bottom in net interest income was 4Q20, you could see the pace of decline is dropping. That's obviously been driven by both dollar interest rate move but also around the Swiss franc appreciation. I would certainly expect to see that stable to up. Stable probably in 1Q, up later in the year as we expand our lending initiatives on the basis that the Swiss franc remains around current levels, i.e. we don't see a further precipitous sell off in the dollar or anything else. That's just a slight caveat in terms of that but that's probably a fuller answer. I think your question was more on recurring Benjamin.\\nBenjamin Goy: No but that was very holistic, thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Thank you very much. Can you actually hear me well? Okay, okay, great. And so I've got two questions. One is on your lending franchise, and another one is on the kind of pace and direction of investment. So on lending, and I think I'm going to refer to I think, your Slide 17. And so in 2020, the actual growth or the actual kind of lending growth was pretty kind of lackluster, in quite a few places and not growing at all. But of course, when you talk about the holistic business volumes, when you talk about the defense of NII from let's just say mid-year this year, of course, the loan growth is a big part of that narrative. So could you kind of let us know, where do you see the opportunity, I suppose both geographically and on the product level and also whether you have to make any changes. Thomas, I suppose it's a question to you whether you had to make any changes from the perspective of the organization of the kind of lending franchise across Credit Suisse to kind of prepare for that medium term plans of kind of single digit growth in lending across the Wealth, in particular? And my second question is on your investment budget, kind of but more holistically. Could you tell us kind of where over the next two years, your investment budget is likely to get spent? And I'm not only talking about the gross savings, which you will invest, but in general, when you think about where in the business, you will still continue investing? Because of course, in like 2019, 2020, we from that next step outside, saw the kind of big changes to the Swiss business overall. And of course, with the launch of CSX as well, so yes, so where's the investment? Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Magdalena. So on lending, what we saw was, especially in the first two quarters, significantly leveraging. We started to turn the corner in the middle of the year. But I still think that we have substantial upside in terms of our lending growth, into 2021 actually, in all three divisions, and in particular, in Asia, where you can see we have reduced our lending volume almost by 10%. So and it's really across the board. So whether it's traditional kind of mortgages here in Switzerland, whether it's single stock loans, whether it's traditional lombard loans, whether it's corporate loans in Switzerland, or also in IWM, and APAC, where we have invested in our corporate franchise, and obviously also in the U.S. and in our Investment Bank. So it's partially also M&A related, it's partially more traditional lending. So the opportunities are across the board. We have clear plans for every division, how to go off these opportunities. And from that perspective, I'm optimistic that we can increase our lending growth, which we have been a bit more cautious about, let's call it this way, in 2020. On the investment budget side, again, we have clear plans in every division, starting with our Group efforts around digitalization, IT, online banking, digital offerings, in every of the three divisions on the Wealth Management side, but also on technology and risk systems in the Investment Bank. And then obviously it's about certain products, whether its ESG products, whether it's Private Markets, whether it's in mandates. And then finally, expansion of footprints in certain regions, in particular, in Asia and the Middle East, where we see significant opportunities, but also Brazil, for example, and in other areas where we have hired teams and relationship managers, and where we will continue to invest.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: And Thomas, just to be, just to be sure that I understood correctly, the expansion of footprint is broad. Is it a Wealth Management trend for you?\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes, it's in particular the footprint in Asia, but also in the Middle East. Just to give you an example, we opened a branch in Riyadh, in Saudi Arabia, we have 45 people there, which I visited recently. We went up from 20 to 45 and we continue to invest in the region, whether it's in Doha, whether it's in Dubai, whether it's in other areas. So and obviously the China rollout for onshore Private Banking, but also our securities joint venture in Asia, Credit Suisse Founders went 51%, we will go to 100%, we announced that already last year. So the investments are not only pure play Private Banking, but it's also Wealth Management related and also in Asset Management, where we continue to invest.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Great, thank you very much.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nKian Abouhossein: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. First of all, very quick one, can you just confirm the cost ambition for 2021 of CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion, couldn't see it in the presentation. Just wanted to see, is that still intact? The second question very briefly, U.S. dollar, my model report in dollars now that you are saying, you're talking about Asia going to be reported in dollars, I'm just a bit confused how this will all work. And in that context, if you don't want to report in dollars, why not start hedging some of your earnings. And lastly, in terms of Slide 7, if I look at your phases, so clearly now, as you say in the growth phase, but you still produce adjusted profits. And clearly, the slide is on adjusted profits. And really what we want to move to post 2007, 2008, 2009 subprime crisis really to a level of stable profit clearly, as that drives the book value. And I was wondering, when we see Credit Suisse focusing on stated book value as of 2021? And if not, why not?\\nDavid Mathers: Okay, thank you very much Kian. I'll take those three.\\nKian Abouhossein: Stated profit [as] or book value?\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Kian. Let me take those different points. So firstly, in terms of cost ambition. You know, we obviously ended 2020 at CHF 16.6 billion, which was slightly above my guidance, primarily, because I think, as Thomas has said already, given the generally strong trading performance we'd seen, I think it seemed relevant to keep the investments going. These are important for us to deliver our numbers in '22 and beyond. And in terms of the '21 numbers, I think we said at the Capital Markets Day, the range of between CHF 16.2 billion and CHF 16.5 billion, depending on how much of the CHF 600 million of investments we actually choose to make. And that roadmap remains intact. And although clearly, I think if we do see a continuation of the strong start to 2021, then I would expect to spend the bulk of that given what we want to do in the Wealth Management businesses. But that the guidance is intact. And those are the factors actually driving this. And I think in terms of FX and currency reporting, I think you know this is as well as you can, we have reported the Investment Bank in dollars since 2015 because the bulk of its revenues and its costs are actually U.S. dollar related. So, it's always been clear to do that and we've said that, that way in our slides. I think of the other three divisions, I think it makes - would make no sense to report SUB, in dollars. It's a Swiss franc business, has Swiss franc cost. It's based here in our home market. Whereas APAC does generate just over two thirds of its revenues, actually in dollar and dollar linked currencies and also has the bulk of its expenses in the same expenses. So I think it's probably easier to make the comparisons to show those numbers in dollars for everybody, because I think then you can compare the peers more easily. I thought a lot about IBM. But we have to remember, you know, the bulk of IBM's costs are here in Switzerland as well, even though essentially it does have a much broader exposure to dollar and non-Swiss franc currencies than some of our other businesses. And therefore is most exposed to the economic challenges that come from a strengthening Swiss franc and a weakening dollar or weakening euro for that matter. And that's why we're going to keep carrying forward that in Swiss franc. So that's how we're doing the divisions, I think so it's more transparent, and you can make the comparisons to the peers. That then breaks a broader question, which is, should we look again at moving our reporting from Swiss franc to U.S. dollars? Look, I think we looked at it with the board back in '19. We decided not to move from that, Switzerland is our home market, we operate in Swiss francs. And that was something that, we did discuss with central bank and other people basically, and I think it was a decision that was very much supported. It is, I'm not sure it's a bad thing to report in one of the world's strongest currencies. It's a bastion of safety and it's something that's important to us to our clients. And I would just remind you, the reporting currency doesn't affect the economics. It's just how you choose to present things. And at the end of the day, we're listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange, and we buyback our shares in Swiss francs. So we have to generate Swiss francs to actually deliver this. That then gets to your next question, which is okay, what about the economics? I think, generally speaking, as a bank, we're quite well balanced. The only open exposure we have really is actually to sterling, because we do have a sterling cost base, but there's not these days a great deal of sterling revenues in the world markets, essentially. So we generally do have a short sterling position, which has been obviously favorable post '16, marginally less favorable in the last year or so. And we'll see what happens next. We have looked at hedging that occasionally. But I mean, in reality, it's the economic base of the business and hedging basically only smoothes the FX effects rather than anything else. And I don't think it really makes a great deal of sense to do it. But it wouldn't make any sense for us to hedge the Swiss franc dollar, given our liabilities are ultimately in Swiss francs in terms of how we actually operate. So I have given it some thought. You know, it clearly, as I said, I think that the division is most exposed to this economically is IWM. It's a challenge in terms of the currencies and how they actually choose to work. And your next question, then I think was around adjusted was reported. Look, a few points. Firstly, our primary metric remains reported PTI. If you look at the LTI metrics for the [Exp], it's reported, is the reported RoTE that we actually report that sits out there and that's how it actually works. The secondary measure, which is the tangible value of share is adjusted only for FX and own credit volatility. Because I think otherwise, you'd be creating incentive for Credit Suisse to have a lower credit rating, which would be not the right thing to do. So that does remain our primary metrics. When we announced the restructuring measures last July, we said for the period of this time, it made more sense to focus on the adjusted numbers because otherwise, you'd see the reported trends disrupted by the restructuring costs. Clearly, the restructuring program comes to an end at the end of the second quarter. And there afterwards I think it will be our intention to move back towards reported numbers. But we did say for this period, what we're doing it, we'd actually look at the adjusted numbers. And as I said, clearly, as I said in terms of your final point about adjusted tangible value per share, the adjustments are purely for FX and for own credit, there's no adjustment for restructuring costs. There's no adjustment for litigation or anything like that, in terms of how we see it.\\nKian Abouhossein: Very clear. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks Kian.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Amit Goel from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nAmit Goel: Hi, thank you. And a couple of question on the Wealth Management margin progression. So and I guess just with, I guess, so far, a large part of the AuM growth is driven by the market performance. Just wanted to understand a bit better, what that means for the margin going forward and in terms of the assets that you have, which don't really generate the kind of reoccurring fee margin, how that's going relative to AuM that does generate reoccurring fees? And what we should expect clearly in Q4 for APAC and IWM the margin was stable but just curious what your thoughts are on that? Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Well, look, just a few points Amit. I think we've made this point before but the banks do not have the same AuM definition. We went through a number of changes back in 2012, 2013, which I think you know as well as we did. And we went for a very tight, narrow definition in terms of what actually qualifies for AuM, you know, we limit the amount we give for lending, we have restricted in terms of the amount of single stock positions, and we have a firm criteria around guidance and advice. That's one reason why AuM is a smaller subset of our total client business volume than it might be for some of our peers. I think that's right, because essentially, that means that, we're actually looking at assets where we're actually actively earning fees. So you're not going to see the dilution of gross margin, from actually recognizing more AuC in terms of this. So that's just a sort of point in terms of comparison, and myself or any of the IR team be happy to talk through this. This is something I review regularly with the Audit Committee. It's an important control metric for us. I think then for turning into Page 32, really, I think, rather than giving you a margin guidance, because I think it comes down to the different trends, the businesses, I'd just summarize what we think, which is, I do think that we are at the bottom. So long as exchange rates don't move further downwards against the Swiss franc or the Swiss franc doesn't appreciate further in terms of our net interest income, particularly as we'll see lending growth. And I'm just making that comment sequentially clearly, not year-on-year, because, you had a completely different FX rate in the first quarter of 2020. But I think we are sequentially we've seen the bottom in terms of that. Recurring, I think the fees we're talking about are linked to the value of portfolios. So that will come through on a, as you said, a month plus one basis, so typically flows through into the next quarter. And transaction, we've said what we said, I think our comments around the strong start to January should not be interpreted as just relating to the Investment Bank. It's certainly true, the Investment Banks had a good start. It's certainly true, though, that our APAC business and we are generally seeing transactions being strong across the bank. So I think that's what but certainly, I'm not trying to guide you to lower net or gross margins.\\nAmit Goel: Okay, thank you. Thanks.\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks, Amit.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nJernej Omahen: Good morning from my side as well. Actually, I have only two questions left. It's always tempting to look at operating performance and excluding all the one-offs, I guess, but then it becomes problematic when these one-offs become recurring, to an extent. And I just went back and I looked at consensus estimates for the litigation charge at Credit Suisse, at the start of January of last year. And it was CHF 58 million. And it ended up being CHF 988 million. The consensus for this year is CHF 68 million. And for '22, it's CHF 36 million. And I was just wondering, so just two questions. And I think to an extent they go back to Kian's questions as well on stated versus underlying. To what extent do you think consensus is accurately capturing what you expect for litigation and non-operating charges more broadly, for this year and next? And then Thomas, a question to you. To what extent were you surprised in your new role as CEO by the extent of non-operating charges that keep popping up at Credit Suisse? And then the second question is just very basic. So on Page 5, you quote, low bond yields as one of the factors affecting or pressuring this year's results. I think we can see from your chart very nicely. How this trend is reverting? And I was wondering if you see that as a potential tailwind to your results this year. Thank you very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay, I'll take the first one and then maybe, David you can take the second one. Look, it did only partially come as a surprise. I think we said on various previous sessions with you, for example, that we are looking at some of the positions in Asset Management and clearly the situation about York was something that we had discussed previously and was something we wanted to address, I wanted to address in my first year. And the legal expenses or the legal provisions around our RMBS docket was something that we knew at some point will materialize. These legal cases sometimes have their own timeline and their own dynamics. I'm very happy that we managed to address the MBIA case. And I think it's also appropriate what we have done for the balance. I'm not going to comment on whether the consensus is right or wrong. But I do definitely think that what happened in the fourth quarter was necessary, was the right thing to do in my first year, to address some of these historic situations. And from that perspective, it didn't come as a surprise. But it was also actually it was interesting that both when we announced the York situation as well as the MBIA, the share price went up. So I think actually, investors are appreciating that we follow through on our promise that we want to address legacies and work through them. So from that perspective, I think it was the right thing to do, it gives us a much better and clear platform now for '21. And we have solid momentum in the first six weeks in all four divisions. We are focused on growth in all four divisions. And from that perspective, we can really now focus not only, thanks to the addressing the legacies I mentioned, but also on the back of what we announced in the summer, namely putting the two Investment Banks together, putting risk and compliance together, creating SRI on the group level, addressing the Neue Aargauer Bank here in Switzerland and launching digital offering here in Switzerland, the new one together with reducing the branch network. These were all measures that were done in the middle of COVID-19 in the summer, which I feel very good about because now we can focus on growing the business on all dimensions. So that's how I would answer your question on operating performance versus one-off and whether this was a surprise.\\nDavid Mathers: Perhaps I could just make a few supplementary points Jernej on this one, I think, firstly, the reasonably possible loss disclosure at the end of the third quarter was CHF 1.2 billion. So and I think there's been very full disclosure around the RMBS docket and other litigation risks in all of our reporting. I think the second point, the MBIA case obviously went to trial last year. And we obviously received an adverse judgment on the end of 31st November, and we made an appropriate ad hoc statement there afterwards around it. I think that judgment was probably worse than we expected. And therefore, it was not something we wanted. But I think we reacted appropriately, both in terms of the provision we took in respect of the MBIA case, and the broader read across for the rest of the year. The book we actually took as a back of that and I think it's good though, actually I mean, if you go back to what we said in the 1st December, we talked about a risk of $680 million in respect to the MBIA, you can, so we actually closed it out at $600 million. I think it's an interesting question, which we could discuss, has it been right to actually fight these RMBS cases since they go back to 2005 to 2007? I think the answer is yes. I think if you look at the settlements that are reached in some of these cases by other banks, in the 2011, 2012 period, they were clearly a great deal higher than this. So I think it has been the right thing to do. But I just would just caution, there's not been - no lack of disclosure around these positions in this risk in terms of that. And I think we have, as Thomas said, made the appropriate read across to the rest of the book in terms of our fourth quarter provisions. Secondly, I'd also point out that the significant items do include some positives. And obviously, you've had the two tranches, the gains on Allfunds. And that does remain, I think, conservatively marked, compared to some of the speculation we've seen around this asset. And secondly, I think, obviously SIX continues to be a very well-run bank utility, and I think has generated gains for us. And that's come through as well. So there are positives as well as negatives. So I think the issue for '20 is in 2019 you had a net credit from such write-downs whereas in 2020, you had a net debit in terms of that, just to make a couple of points. So then the next point, really just in terms of long bond yields. And I think we've probably said as much as you want to say of net interest income, which is, I think we have, we are at the bottom and I think we should start to see it improve as we build lending sequentially. Clearly given the FX moves. I think that'll be much more challenging on a year-on-year basis. But if FX rates do remain at current levels, given the lending initiatives, I don't, I think we'll probably won't see too much of a shortfall, maybe something in the CHF 50 million to CHF 60 million on a constant currency basis for 2021 compared to 2020. So I think we're coming through the inflection point around net interest income trends.\\nJernej Omahen: Thanks very much.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nAnke Reingen: Thank you very much for taking my questions and two please, two follow up questions. And the first is on the litigation on disclosure. And were just called it the CHF 1.2 billion at the end of Q3, which went down to CHF 0.9 billion at the end of Q4, and given the large charge expected in, taken in Q4, I guess it could have gone down more. I just wondered, is there too many moving parts of the number just to see rhetoric and any sort of like more clarity on this point? And then on the costs, I mean, should we see the fact that you no longer quote the CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion, and the fact that you come in CHF 16.6 billion versus 16.5 billion but not really explain it as much as a as a sign that you sort of are like moving away from the absolute cost guidance or de-emphasize it given it wasn't necessarily reiterated. Thank you very much.\\nDavid Mathers: Well, the two points, really. I think we obviously did reduce the RPL by CHF 300 million, which as you say, it's not as much as the CHF 800 million increase in the RMBS provision. And the reason for that is, as I commented before, there were certain items in the judge's order of the 31st November, which, I think were adverse to us. And we looked both in terms of the MBIA case and in terms of the read across to the rest of the RMBS docket, and we wanted to reflect that fully. It is what it is, it's a matter of fact, is clearly a number of other cases and other appeals going on around that. But that's why you see that balance, basically. And I think the second point in terms of the expenses, I think I was asked a question earlier on basically, by one of your colleagues. And I think it was Kian. And just to reiterate, our guidance does remain CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion, dependent on the level of the CHF 600 million investments we identified in the capital markets that we choose to invest. At this point, given the strong start this year, I think it would seem prudent to be making those investments to support the longer-term growth of our Wealth Management businesses in '22 and '23, particularly in fast growing markets. But clearly that's a decision which is constantly under review. And we'll see how 2021 develops. It is an uncertain year, we are not through COVID-19 yet, but it has been a good start.\\nAnke Reingen: Okay, thank you very much.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Terelak from Mediobanca. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nAdam Terelak: Hi, morning, thanks for the questions. I want to just come back to costs. Look, I think the print this year is kind of hiding some big movements in different directions. So the good side of CHF 16.9 billion, the FX neutral cost base is CHF 17.4 billion. Now, when we talked about expenses of 2020, the prior CMD, the upper end of the range was CHF 16.9 billion in a good year. So I'm just trying to work out where this additional spend come from. I know you're talking about investment budgets going forward. But can you sort think about that in a backward-looking sense? How much a business is investment in growth? And how much is this is rectifying some control issues or anything like that? And then, what should the J curve on this spend look like? When will the revenues come through? Are there any this year with any because clearly the bonus pool is down so it's not paying for performance? So I'm just trying to get an idea of that and how that looks going forward? And then, just quickly, a clarification on the January trends, is that in Swiss franc or in U.S. dollar? Clearly, you're flagging strong transactional and trading revenues but clearly the year-over-year FX headwind is fairly sizable. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Adam. There is a number of points there. So I might come back to you just to clarify, in case I've missed anything. Firstly, in terms of the cost guidance, yes, it is complex because you will see in 2021 current exchange rate, a further drop in expenses due to the FX moves, obviously subject to how rates actually pan out. But I think in terms of things that we chose to spend on, I think, firstly, and we have talked before about the growth in China. Thomas has talked about it, that is critical for us. But I think Secondly, there is obviously everything else we actually want do in APAC because it is our fastest growing region. I think that's where a lot of the opportunities lie. I think but in terms of other things, yes, I think it's very important to maintain appropriate in terms of your control infrastructure. There's plenty of risks out there. And I think we're spending appropriately in terms of that. So that's what I'd say at this point. I think the expense what we gave at the Capital Markets Day, I think does very much remain intact. The interest, FX have moved a bit since then. But you know, I think that's all I'd really say in terms of the costs, really.\\nAdam Terelak: I mean, in terms of the delta is on 2020 it's CHF 600 million versus the top end of the prior range. I mean, it's a big, big number. I'm just wondering whether that's bringing forward investment or when the revenues attached to that can come through?\\nDavid Mathers: I probably would defer to Thomas. I mean, obviously, you stepped in as Chief Executive. And I think you, I think, allow me to say, I would say rightly have prioritize the growth in our Wealth Management businesses. And I think the things we're spending money on are exactly the right things for future, Thomas. But -\\nThomas Gottstein: Yeah, look, I think that it's important to address obvious cost reduction, structural opportunities, like we had with integration of Neue Aargauer Bank here in Switzerland, closing down the branches, and investing in CSX, our new mobile device or putting together IBCM in global markets, which allowed us to take structural costs out or combining risk and compliance, which allowed us to take costs out. We also addressed some structural opportunities in IWM and in other areas of the Corporate Center. Real estate is another area where we see some opportunities. But generally, I also think it's important to really manage, especially in the three private banking divisions, the cost base dynamically and in a cost income ratio basis and not absolute. We are investing, we are rolling out in China, we are investing in the Middle East, we are investing in Thailand and in Korea. So as we want to grow, we see huge growth opportunities in private banking, we made that clear in the mid-December Capital Markets Day. This is a market that grows 7% globally, and we want to grow, at least with the market. And if you open branches, like we opened in Riyadh, or we do a rollout of relationship analysis for onshore private banking in China, that costs money. But we are financing a lot of these investments with some structural moves, like we did in 2020 in the summer, that I feel very good about. We didn't see the benefit yet of those, but it allows us to actually invest in growth and self-finance a large portion of that.\\nDavid Mathers: Adam, I think your second question was, is that guidance given in dollars or in Swiss francs? That guidance is given in Swiss francs.\\nAdam Terelak: Okay, great. Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim from Societe Generale. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nAndrew Lim: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So you've talked about, in places how the impacts of lower interest rates has affected interest income in CIC, for example, and overall for Wealth Management net interest income. But could you elaborate more specifically about your - to the short end versus the long end of the U.S. curve? And obviously, there's quite a few just in the U.S. terms?\\nThomas Gottstein: Can you repeat question, please? Sorry, it was difficult to hear you acoustically.\\nDavid Mathers: Andrew, I think you cut out for a bit, I'm afraid, sorry.\\nAndrew Lim: Oh, sure. I'll repeat again, asking about the sensitivity of your net interest income to the short end versus the long end of the U.S. curve. Could you elaborate more on your sensitivity there and how we should expect NII to develop given moves in the past two quarters?\\nThomas Gottstein: I think I mean, that's -\\nAndrew Lim: That's my first.\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks, sorry, Andrew. Do you have a second question? Sorry.\\nAndrew Lim: And yes, my second question really is on is on dynamics on recurring fees. In Swiss franc terms, your AuM is at record high levels. But if we turn to Slide 32, your recurring fees are edging down, and maybe you can allude there to translation effects as well. But are there other dynamics happening there, which offset the record high AuM?\\nDavid Mathers: Okay. I think in terms, I take the first point, Thomas. But I think in terms of the dollar interest rate exposure, we do run a swaps book. And therefore, we will benefit from the steeping of the dollar curve in due course, but we'd normally seek to price out over the sort of two to three years in terms of this. So we, it tends to be a sort of medium-term type swap book to reduce interest rate volatility. So we don't have the up or the down volatility that you see for some of the U.S. banks relative to the curve. And as I said before, I think I did give a general guidance a few minutes ago, which is, if I look at the interest rate effect for this year, and net of the FX move, I expect to be down about CHF 50 million for full year 2021 compared to full year '20. I'm clear that would obviously change if we see another shift in FX and that's across the entire bank.\\nThomas Gottstein: On the recurring if you exclude certain, I would say abnormal things fees like Swisscard in Switzerland, which is our credit card business, which is an equity consolidate, that business joint venture with American Express, which all the revenues are in recurring. And clearly credit card business was very difficult in 2020. But if you exclude that, there is a very clear correlation between Asset under Management and recurring revenues, which we have seen some degree of margin erosion. But at the same time, we are very much focused to increase our mandate penetration. That's our clear strategy in all three private banking divisions. I think with our performance we've had in our CIO office, but also with our efforts around ESG. And new mandates, be it for high net worth, but also ultra high net worth, which would include also private equity investments. So Platinum Mandate, as we call them, we are offering new opportunities for our clients to have tailor-made mandates depending on their risk appetite. And this is how we are planning to further increase our recurring revenues. And as you can see on Page 32, whilst year-on-year we are down and there is also some translation element in there. We like the trajectory and we definitely see an improvement in our overall recurring fees, even in Swiss francs.\\nAndrew Lim: Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks, Andrew.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of [Daniel Regle] from Octavia. Please go ahead, your line is open.\\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, the first question is on net new money in Asia. And can you maybe elaborate a bit more, what lead to the outflows in Asia, particularly since obviously, your larger peers have reported quite strong new money numbers in Asia? And then secondly, maybe sorry, to come back again to this litigation thing and obviously, I think there is a moral hazard because litigation tends to come with a huge time delays are normally not the managers who actually do the wrong things are paying for the wrong things which has been done in the past. What do you do to prevent this moral hazard? Thanks.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay, so on net new money, I mean, if you look at our Page 39, you see that for the whole year 2020, we had CHF 8.6 billion, we have in 2019 CHF 8.7 billion. If you were to translate that into dollars, we're actually up about 10%. So I think overall, we have a good trajectory, very healthy M&A in the business, if you took and analyze. I agree with you, the fourth quarter was a bit weak, but I don't look at M&A on a quarterly basis. This is more like an annual basis and it kind of shows some of the trends. But again, I can just come back to my earlier observation that the way you should really look at the banking franchise Private Banking franchise is client business volume. That really gives you the best sense of how the franchise is growing. But the CHF 8.6 billion in Swiss francs is actually higher on the like-for-like basis than the CHF 8.7 billion we had in 2019. Look and then with respect to the moral hazard, this is somewhat theoretical question, we had the legal strategy at the time in 2009, 2010. You can argue whether it was the right strategy or not, but, as David said, we chose that way and overall it probably was not the wrong strategy. But I can also say that unlike others, we have settled, for example, the RMBS case with the DoJ. That was done in 2016 and from that perspective, some good efforts were made by my predecessors. And some of these litigations have their own, as I said, their own tactical considerations with respect to when do you settle and when do you actually go to court. And each bank has to do that, as they see fit, depending on the case. So that's all I can say to that.\\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, let's leave it like that. Thanks.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thanks, Daniel.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Lee from Santander. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\nPatrick Lee: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of questions on the Wealth Management and related businesses, mainly referring to your disclosure on Page 17, where you said that the client business for them is an aggregate of AuM custody assets. And I know that is something that you commented on before. The two questions on this, firstly, on the especially strong growth in Custody A asset in APAC, and also to a lesser extent in SUB compared to the steady performance in IWM for custody assets. Is this primarily a reflection of the transaction nature of the businesses in APAC or whether we should expect custody assets to fluctuate around the transaction volatility? Or can I look at it another way whether it could be a temporary parking space for the money, there's some expectation of this converting into a more profitable AuM elevator stage? A second question relating to this is that if I look - looking ahead, is it fair to say that you're steering us to focus on from AuM to this broader client business volume as a better reflection of your Wealth Management performance? And I guess, then, in terms of gross margin, would it give us a better forecast or estimate, if you think about it separately, like NII margin on loans, recurring fees on AuM and transaction on the asset would it gives us a better feel for it? Thanks.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks for your two excellent questions. So custody assets in Asia grew for mainly two reasons. One, that we saw some deleveraging, as I said earlier, but also, there are quite a few of them which are single stock positions with performance, strong equity markets in Asia, obviously. So we saw both trends. In Switzerland a bit similar but with less I think the equity exposure, single stock exposure in custody assets is probably proportionally smaller. There's also a lot of cash in there, there's some gold in there, etc. So these are single asset class positions where we have low or no revenues, which we define as custody assets. To your second question, you could definitely make the argument that you should look actually at your margins in percentage of the overall client business volume. Obviously then, we would deviate a bit from the industry standard, which is to relocate a percentage of the AuM. We are currently not planning to change that but we are planning to be disclosing client business volume going forward because, as I said before, I think it's the right way to look at the franchise.\\nDavid Mathers: Clearer indication of the number of assets which the bank has relationship or associations with. So I think what was done very well in SUB over the years, essentially was to migrate some of these custody businesses into AuM as you build on the initial relationship with the clients. So I think you know, I think it's a very good leading indicator and very much worth looking at.\\nPatrick Lee: Okay, thank you very much.\\nOperator: Thank you.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Let me begin as I have since I became group CEO one year ago, with some comments on the current environment. We continue to monitor with full vigilance the elevated levels of COVID-19 cases in Switzerland, and all the countries around the globe where we operate. In my first year, I'm very proud of what Credit Suisse has delivered for clients, employees and shareholders. For clients, we took a leading role in establishing Switzerland's successful lending facility last year, and helped clients around the globe navigate turbulent economies and markets. For our employees, we created a safe and productive environment while moving to a mostly digital footprint in a short period of time. Our success is reflected in a survey last year that showed more than 90% of employees felt well supported and well informed by management. For shareholders, we paid the full dividend with respect to 2019 and reinitiated our 2021 share buyback program earlier this year in January. We stand ready to do our part for our communities and economies, be it here in Switzerland or elsewhere, through lending initiatives, donation programs, and other measures. In the challenging 2020 environment, we delivered solutions for our clients to help them seize opportunities and manage risks in turbulent times. We addressed historic issues and invested in our businesses. We launched sustainability research and investment solutions, SRI to put sustainability at the heart of our offering to private, corporate and institutional clients. We enter 2021 with strong momentum, as evidenced by our best January in a decade. Pretax income for the month was up year-on-year across all divisions. Investment Banking revenues are up substantially from the same period in 2020. Notwithstanding the fragility of the global economy due to the pandemic, the growth strategy that I will discuss with you today puts us in an excellent position to build on our progress and to achieve our midterm ambitions that we set out at our Investor Update in December, and which we reaffirm today. With that, let me turn to the Slides. Let me start with Slide 4. Our step-by-step growth strategy builds on the work completed in the last few quarters. This is supported by a strong balance sheet that allows us to invest while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital distribution. A few weeks ago, in early January, we announced that we would have to record a pretax loss in the fourth quarter. This is primarily the result of having addressed historic and other issues. These included major litigation provisions of CHF 757 million, largely related to RMBS cases, and impairment relating to York of CHF 414 million within our Asset Management business. As a result, we recorded a fourth quarter pretax loss of CHF 88 million, and the net loss attributable to shareholders of CHF 353 million. For the full year 2020, we reported pretax income of CHF 3.5 billion, and net income attributable to shareholders of CHF 2.7 billion. However, our adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was CHF 4.4 billion in 2020, up a healthy 6% from 2019. And we achieved this result despite CHF 1.1 billion of provision for credit losses and significant FX headwinds caused by the weaker U.S. dollar. Let me say a few words about some of our challenges at the end of last year. At our Investor Update two months ago, I spoke about my personal priorities and the importance of dealing with legacies and of accountability which is one of the pillars of our refreshed code of conduct that we unveiled last month. Some of the cases I mentioned date back many years. Nevertheless, these cases have affected our results in 2020. In light of the COVID-19 situation, and resulting economic environment, and together with our assessment of shareholder returns in 2020, we have decided, with the approval of the Board of Directors to lower our overall bonus pool by 7% for 2020 compared to the previous year. We are reducing short term incentive awards for the Executive Board to an even greater extent. This decision underscores to our employees, clients, shareholders and stakeholders, that accountability and transparency are of the highest priority for us at Credit Suisse. As you can see on the left side of the Slide, we executed four strategic initiatives to support our growth agenda. These refinements are expected to generate approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million in savings per annum from 2022 onwards. We are targeting growth investments of CHF 300 million to CHF 600 million in 2021 across Wealth Management and the Investment Bank. This is accompanied by investments in relationship and actual recruitment, ESG products and private markets. We intend to invest most of our marginal capital generated into Wealth Management to deploy into lending. In 2020, we made a total capital distribution of around CHF 1 billion through our 2019 dividend and 2020 share buyback. Our strong capital position, a CET1 ratio of 12.9% at year-end 2020 allows us to invest and capture growth opportunities, while providing attractive capital return through dividends and share buybacks. We recommend an increase of our dividend for 2020 of 5.4% above our 2019 dividend. We expect the total capital distribution of at least CHF 1.8 billion in 2021, subject to market and economic conditions. Our resilient results came amid a challenging macroeconomic and operating backdrop. Many developed economies have struggled to recoup output lost last spring, although the APAC region remains resilient. This led to a prolongation of the lower for longer interest rate environment, driving strength in the Swiss franc, our reporting currency. The low interest rate environment has been something that we have been dealing with in Switzerland for many years, but that all banks which are active in the U.S. dollar market, have now had to confront. Equity markets have recovered, aided by COVID-19 vaccines, strong fiscal and monetary stimulus and the expectations for an economic rebound. Next page, please. Economic and interest rate backdrop was challenging for banks. Credit losses were elevated in the U.S. and Europe by low interest rates weighed on net interest income. Meanwhile, restrictions on bank dividends and share buybacks weighed on bank share prices in many jurisdictions. Next page, please. Despite this challenging macroeconomic and operating environment, we have recorded a 22% growth in pre-provision profit in 2020 year-on-year on an adjusted basis, or 30% at constant FX rates. We enter our growth phase with a lot of momentum both in our Wealth Management businesses as well as in the Investment Bank. Whilst 2021 remains somewhat difficult to predict, this should allow us to achieve our medium-term ambition of 10% to 12% return on tangible equity in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions. Next slide, please. Developing and executing major strategic initiatives is difficult in the best of times. Doing so amid the worst economic and public health shock in decades, requires a monumental but necessary effort across our Bank. Notably, we created a single Investment Bank, which has provided scale and diversification. It has spurred both cost and revenue opportunities, as well as more flexibility with respect to capital allocation, the benefits of which are increasingly evident in the momentum of the franchise. We launched SRI combining research, investment solutions and products, impact advisory and finance as well as marketing and branding. We are integrating Neue Aargauer Bank into Swiss Universal Bank and launched our digital offering ESX to optimize our national branch network and drive digitalization, we combined our risk and compliance functions. These initiatives, along with other efficiency measures in IWM and the Corporate Center, are expected to generate gross savings of approximately CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million per annum from 2022 onwards. We expect to invest the savings in growth opportunities across the Group. Next page, please. Let me now turn to our global Investment Banking business where our revenues saw a strong rebound last year in line with many of our peers. As you can see on the left of this slide, global revenues grew 19% in 2020, to USD 10.2 billion. As you know, although Global Trading Solutions is housed in the IB division, some revenues are booked in the other three divisions. If you were to include all of those GTS revenues, such growth would be even higher. Therefore, this was only modestly below industry revenue pool growth of 24%, despite our underweight position in macro, which contributed significantly to industry revenue growth last year. This demonstrates the underlying momentum in our franchise, which are either strongly connected to the Wealth Management business or our higher return businesses. Our revenue increase was broad based across products in all four main areas. We have leading positions across fixed income, equities and capital markets. As a former ECM banker, I'm particularly proud for being number one in global IPOs in 2020, one of the biggest years on record for global IPOs. Slide 10, please. Our capital markets and advisory franchise has gained momentum and outperformed Street. Based on the Dealogic data, we achieved 37% year-on-year growth in fees for these franchises in 2020 based on global revenues, a faster rate of growth than our leading peers. We grew market share from 3.7% in 2019 to 4.3% in 2020. We achieved especially strong growth in equity capital markets. Slide 11, please. Our diversified, balanced and integrated Investment Bank division is poised to continue delivering sustainable returns with reduced earnings volatility. We believe that our business mix is well positioned for the post COVID-19 environment with an expected recovery in M&A and Asset Finance. We believe that capital markets activity will be driven by IPOs and leverage finance with a more tailored offering in macro. We are growing connectivity between the Investment Bank and Wealth Management with GTS as a gateway between the two businesses. This delivers institutional-style solutions to Wealth Management clients. GTS saw 31% revenue growth year-on-year in 2020. As a result, we achieved a 70% growth in adjusted pretax income in the Investment Bank division last year, and grew our adjusted return on regulatory capital to 13%, well within our medium-term ambition of 10% to 15% RoRC for the Investment Bank. Next page. Our ambition is to be a leader in sustainability. One of the most significant decisions that I took in my first year as Group CEO was to create SRI at the Executive Board level along with setting an ambitious target to provide at least CHF 300 billion in sustainable financing over the next 10 years. We infused environmental, social and governance standards at the heart of Research, Advisory, Investment Bank, and Wealth Management. We announced additional initiatives at our Investor Update, including the development of science-based targets within the next 24 months, and repositioning our portfolio to support client transitions. Early this week, we have also announced the collaboration agreement with BlackRock to co-develop products in the private and alternative space with ESG integration. This allows us to leverage our thematic Supertrends capabilities as part of our House View. The collaboration continues our strong focus on providing differentiated alternatives, and private market solutions to our clients. We are not simply applying ESG to our client solutions. We are embedding them in our own operations as well. These include our focus on diversity and inclusion, a clear purpose statement, a refreshed code of conduct and Sustainability Advisory Committee at the Board of Directors level. We have received recognition for our engagement, including being upgraded to an A rating by MSCI putting us in the top 15% of our peer group. Next page please. A key initiative for our home market last year was a decision to integrate our 100% owned Neue Aargauer Bank subsidiary into Credit Suisse [Schweiz Aargau]. The legal merger was completed in November 2020. The operational integration is on track, which will result in unified coverage and enhanced client offering. We have successfully retained business in the face of fierce competition well above our base plan. The integration of NAB is part of a broader adaption of our retail and SME business model, and branch network to reflect change in client behavior around digitalization, with a halving of the number of branches since 2013. The implementation of cost synergies is on course, part of our roughly expected CHF 100 million in gross savings per annum in the Swiss Universal Bank from 2022 onwards. We are also positioning ourselves as a digital leader in affluent and retail business with our newly launched digital offering CSX. Next page, Page 14. The crisis confirms the effectiveness of our risk management practices. We navigated the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic last spring, in part because 87% of loans were collateralized. 60% of our loan book relates to the Swiss Universal Bank, and Switzerland has had historically low credit loss experience compared with other regions. Our strategy is to accelerate growth in a risk-controlled way across the cycle. We aim to keep our rigorous standards consistent with our performance over 2010 to 2020, which saw an average provision for credit loss ratio of under 10 basis points. Our compliance organization has seen significant investments in people, systems and technology over the last few years. After this upgrade of our compliance and non-financial risk functions, we are convinced that combining the risk and compliance functions into one organization will further drive efficiencies and effectiveness of control at the same time. It enables more consistent execution and delivery of our control framework across risk and compliance. Slide 15, please. As presented at our Investor Update in December, Wealth Management is our core business and continues to be one of the most attractive segments in financial services. Global wealth is expected to increase by USD 25 trillion by 2024 a faster rate of growth than global Gross Domestic Product. Emerging market wealth is expected to grow 11% per annum, driven by entrepreneurs, and ultra high net worth is the fastest growing wealth segment, both areas where we are especially well placed. We are particularly focused on capturing growth opportunities in Asia Pacific with 56% of the world's population Asia Pacific's growing middle class remains one of the biggest trends and drivers in the global economy. The ultra-high net worth segment is growing about 11% as well, faster than the rest of the world. APAC is absolutely core to Credit Suisse and today the region accounts for almost 20% of our total net revenues. And this includes the APAC portion of Investment Banking, which compares to only around 12% for many of our global peers. Page 16. Assets under Management across Credit Suisse Group increased from CHF 1.2 trillion in 2015 to CHF 1.5 trillion in 2020 at compound annual growth rate of 4%, including Wealth Management AuM growth of 5% annually. On a U.S. dollar basis, the growth would have been faster per annum, namely 7% with a total AuM of over USD 1.7 trillion, as per the end of 2020. This highlights the attractive underlying growth momentum of our franchises. Now, let me dig a little bit deeper into Assets under Management because the AuM is only part of the picture. On Page 17, I will go into more detail, what for me is the more important element which is the client business volume. Because when I look at our underlying private banking franchise from a quantitative perspective, I look at client business volume. Our Wealth Management opportunity comes from a combination of Assets under Management, net loan, as well as custody assets. These custody assets, which includes lower profitability, unlevered client assets such as single stock positions, gold or cash, without any advisory mandate around them, provide us with dry powder to convert into an AuM and loans as well as transactional revenues. The vast majority of client business volumes in International Wealth Management and notably APAC are denominated in U.S. dollars or in currencies that are pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is why we are showing the numbers on this page in Swiss francs for SUB and in U.S. dollars for IWM and APAC. We have generated substantial client business volume growth across our Wealth Management franchises, particularly in APAC, which achieved 14% compound annual growth rate in U.S. dollar terms between 2015 and 2020. We have also seen growth in IWM private banking client business volume, including and especially under the leadership of Philipp Wehle over the last two years. Our ambition is to maintain or accelerate these growth rates going forward with annual client business volume growth of mid-single digits for the Swiss Universal Bank, mid-to-high single digits for IWM and double-digit growth in APAC. Slide 18, please. Our central mission at Credit Suisse is to provide solutions to our clients that help them find opportunities and manage risk in turbulent times. Our House View added substantial value for our clients during the pandemic. As you can see from this slide, we made key calls at critical junctures. Most notably, our CIO and his team had the courage to go overweight on equities on March 25 close to the market lows. Our discretionary mandates, which are based on our House View, outperformed 67% of clients in a non-discretionary portfolio on a three-year view. Our decision last year to house Chief Investment Office within SRI allows us to better align ESG standards into our investment processes as well as into our suite of discretionary mandates. Next page, please. You may remember this slide from our December Capital Markets Day. It shows our specific growth metrics for Wealth Management. It is, other than revenues, which remains a key metric, how we measure ourselves, and it should also be the way you should measure us. We are committed to accelerating growth in Wealth Management, building on the core principles under our unique Bank for Entrepreneurs model, investing most of our marginal capital into Wealth Management. Our growth strategy includes further development of our ESG solutions, and our already successful collaboration with the Investment Bank and with Asset Management. You can see our specific numeric ambitions on the right hand of the page. Let me highlight our ambition to grow our overall client business volume, which includes again, Assets under Management, custody assets and net loans to the mid-to-high single digits over the medium term at the Group level at constant foreign exchange rates. This includes a medium-term ambition for double digit growth in APAC, as previously mentioned, Slide 20, please. At our Investor Day, we also announced our ambition to grow Wealth Management related pretax income, which on an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, was CHF 3.8 billion in 2022 to CHF 5 billion to CHF 5.5 billion in 2023. Today, we reaffirm our objective for an increase in our RoRC to 20% to 25%. And we plan to invest most of our marginal capital generated into Wealth Management to deploy into lending. We are deepening our onshore footprint in faster growing markets, notably China. We will also continue to drive GTS Investment Bank and Asset Management collaboration with the Wealth Management franchise and we expect to benefit from a normalization in both credit provisions and Asset Management profitability. Slide 21, we expect to increase our capital return in 2021 compared to 2020, demonstrating the strength of our capital position and business momentum. We achieved the total capital distribution in 2020 of around CHF 1 billion paid to shareholders. For this year, we expect a total of at least CHF 1.8 billion payable to shareholders through a 2020 dividend of around CHF 766 million, and a share buyback of between CHF 1 billion and CHF 1.5 billion. As I said at the beginning, our strong balance sheet allows us to both invest for growth and provide attractive shareholder returns. I will now hand over to David to go over our results in greater detail. And then I will make some concluding remarks before our Q&A. Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Thomas. Good morning, everybody. And I'd now like to take you through our financial results in more detail. And before I start, I'd remind you that whilst our reported performance remains our primary metric, given the combination of the restructuring measures that we announced last summer, the charges that we took in the fourth quarter, and the movements that we've seen in some of our equity investments over the last two years, we will continue to give additional emphasis to our adjusted numbers. This quarter was particularly complex, given that in addition to our restructuring costs, we have also absorbed the impairment related to our investment in York capital and the increase in our existing RMBS provisions. And you will note that we reached a settlement with MBIA last week. I would highlight two items that we've not previously announced. First, the gain before tax of CHF 158 million on our equity investment in SIX Group and second, the gain before tax of CHF 127 million francs on our equity investment in Allfunds Group, both of which were taken in the fourth quarter. I'd also highlight again, the adverse effect of the strengthening of the Swiss franc against many other currencies in which we conduct our business. On a constant currency basis, this translated into a reduction to our adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items for the fourth quarter of CHF 108 million, compared to the same period last year. And for the full year, a reduction of CHF 287 million for 2020 compared to 2019. Let me turn to Slide 23. So as Thomas has already summarized, Credit Suisse delivered a resilient performance for the year. Reported net revenues are flat year-on-year at CHF 22.4 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, net revenues were 3% higher. In terms of business trends, we saw strong performance from the Investment Bank, with heightened transactional activity across the Group. Clearly, our Wealth Management businesses suffered from weakness in net interest income, primarily due to the fall in U.S. interest rates, and from the impact of the appreciation of the Swiss franc. However, as I'll discuss in more detail later on, recurring revenues have shown sequential quarter-on-quarter improvements in Swiss franc terms, and we believe that the adverse trends affecting our net interest income and are bottoming out at current exchange rates. Overall adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items increased by 6% for the full year from CHF 4.14 billion to CHF 4.3 8 billion year-on-year. As I've said before, our reported numbers for the quarter were adversely affected by significant charges, which resulted, as we previously guided in a pretax loss for the quarter, totaling CHF 88 million. This did, however, mask a resilient underlying performance. Adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items was 10% lower year-on-year, but on a constant currency basis, 1% higher. Our tax charge for 2020 was 23%. In the middle of the range that we'd set for the year, I would note, it was a little bit higher than I'd previously anticipated, primarily due to the charges that we took in the fourth quarter. With regard to 2021, I'd maintain our guidance for a level around the mid-20s. Although I'd warn that the rate for the first quarter may be higher than this. I'd once again caution that this assumes unchanged tax regimes in the countries in which we operate, with a particular caveat about whether the Biden administration will amend the U.S. federal tax rate later this year. Reported net income attributable to shareholders for the year stood at CHF 2.67 billion, 22% lower than in 2019. That equates to return on tangible equity of 6.6% for the year, compared to 8.7% for 2019. I would note that this drop was entirely due to the year-on-year swing in the contribution of adjustments and significant items, which are shown in more detail on the next slide. As you can see here, although our reported pretax income was 27% lower year-on-year on an adjusted basis excluding significant items, it was 6% higher, as the impact of the items that I've listed here swung from a net credit of CHF 577 million in 2019 to a net debit of CHF 908 million in 2020. I'd add that once you adjust further for FX movements, our adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items was 13% higher year-on-year. Let's just turn to the next slide please and just look at the CET1 ratio. We finished 2020 with a CET1 ratio of 12.9% approximately 20 basis points higher than at the end of the previous year. And I'd reiterate my previous guidance, which is that we intend to maintain a CET1 ratio of at least 12.5% for at least the first half of this year. I've mentioned the phase-in of certain Basel III reforms, primarily the SA-CCR change on a number of occasions over the last few years. These changes resulted in a cumulative impact of CHF 11 billion with RWA inflation for 2020, slightly better than the guidance we've given before. And clearly this has been fully accounted for in our end period capital ratios. In terms of capital distribution, we have as you know, paid the 2019 dividend CHF 0.2776 in full. With regard to 2020, we intend to recommend a single payment of CHF 0.2926 per share, which provided that it is approved by our shareholders at our Annual General Meeting in April, will be paid in May. You also know that last month, we initiated our 2021 share buyback program, and we'd repurchase shares to the value of CHF 112 million as of the 16th of February. Let's look at leverage please, on the next slide. Our exposure at the end of the fourth quarter stood at CHF 800 billion excluding central bank reserves, down from CHF 824 billion at the end of the third quarter. This decrease was mainly due to currency movements, particularly the depreciation of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc. Our CET1 leverage ratio at the yearend was 4.4%. And our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 6.4%, both stable compared to the end of the third quarter. I would remind you that the famous temporary exemption of cash held at central banks ended on the 1st of January this year. And if you look at these ratios, including central bank reserves, they would have stood at 3.9% and 5.6%, respectively, at the end of last year. I'd once again draw your attention to our Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which at 190% is similar to the level at the end of the third quarter. We continue to take a conservative approach to liquidity management, and this ratio remains amongst the highest of the major banks. Let me touch briefly on tangible book value per share. You'll see that our tangible book value per share was broadly unchanged at the end of 2020, compared to the end of 2019, standing at CHF 15.80 compared to CHF 15.88, 12 months earlier. Let me just run you through the changes. Net income attributable to shareholders of CHF 2.7 billion, contributed CHF 1.10 per share with the effects of our capital distribution program and share based compensation awards, resulting in a total for the year before own credit and FX movements of CHF 16.94 per share. As you know, tangible book value per share is influenced by movements in our own credits spreads and by FX changes, given that we retain a significant amount of our capital denominated in U.S. dollars. Now with regard to our own credit moves, spreads widened in the first quarter, and then subsequently narrowed, leaving a net impact of CHF 0.08 for the year. However, the negative impact from currency move was much more marked, totally CHF 1.27 for the year of which CHF 0.49 came in the final quarter. And next, I'll just like to update you on the progress of our restructuring program. As a reminder, we said in July, that we expected to spend approximately CHF 300 million to CHF 400 million on this program over the course of 12 months. And that we expect to generate around CHF 400 million in run rate savings, with the full benefit being realized from 2022 onwards. The key components of the restructuring were, bringing together our Investment Banking and Capital Markets and Global Markets businesses together into a single Investment Bank together with APAC markets, creating a new function, sustainability, research and investment solutions, bringing together the risk and compliance functions and integrating Neue Aargauer Bank into the Swiss Universal Bank. You recall that we reported at the end of the third quarter that we'd spent CHF 107 million on restructuring. And you can see that the total for the year was CHF 157 million. Primarily taking the International Wealth Management, the Investment Bank and in the Swiss Universal Bank, and primarily relating to redundancy expenses. At this point, I'd expect our restructuring costs to total something between CHF 300 million and CHF 350 million marginally lower than before. And I would still expect to complete this program by the end of the second quarter of this year. Now we continue to expect to achieve the gross savings that I mentioned in October that's CHF 250 million to CHF 300 million for 2021 and CHF 400 million, to CHF 450 million, from 2022. Let's just turn to the next slide, please. This looks at credit provisions. Including provisions for the CECL methodology, which as you know was implemented at the start of last year, we started 2020, with CHF 1.22 billion for allowances for credit losses. And of course in the first half of the year, we took an additional CHF 864 million in provisions, split approximately equally between CECL related and specific provisions. Net write-offs of CHF 84 million in other adjustments took us to a balance of CHF 2.0 billion at the end of June. And if we look at the second half of the year, our CECL balance was more stable, with a net release of CHF 23 million, reflecting a broadly unchanged set of predictions. We did, however, see an increase in specific allowances, and had net write-offs in the second half of CHF 241 million. Factoring the weakness in the U.S. dollar, the net provisions on the balance sheet of CHF 1.90 billion at the end of the year, was split approximately equally between specific and nonspecific provisions and were clearly, considerably higher than where we started 2020. Let's move to the next Slide, please. I think if we look forward to 2021. I just caution. I think it's too early really, to make forecasts for credit provisions for this year. Clearly 2020 was an exceptional year, especially as the pandemic coincided with the introduction of CECL, and provisions room was four times higher than our 11-year average of CHF 280 million per year. That equates to an average provision for credit losses ratio, that is the total taken relative to loans held at amortized cost outstanding of 9.0 basis points. For 2020, that ratio leapt to 30 basis points. Now, of course, I would expect to see our provisions return to levels, the more normal over the next few years, with the difference dropping through to the bottom line. But the pace of that normalization does remain difficult to gauge. Personally, I do not expect to see a comparable increase in CECL charges in 2021. Given that I believe we're unlikely to see a repeat of the precipitous decline in the economic operating environment that we witnessed about a year ago. However, against this, we do need to balance the risk of increasing corporate failures as we emerge from the pandemic, together with a corresponding requirement for heightened levels of specific provisions. Next slide. Now shown here, a version of this slide over the past few quarters, and just as a reminder, it charts our allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of gross loans for our wholesale business across last year, compared to three of our leading U.S. peers. As you can see, we remain at broadly similar or indeed marginally more conservative levels to the other banks. Next slide, please. And before we turn to the divisional overviews, I wanted to give you a summary of the revenue trends that we've seen in our Wealth Management businesses. Let me start with a net interest income on the left-hand side. And surprisingly, when looked at in Swiss francs, net interest income has dropped sharply since the start of the pandemic from CHF 1.35 billion in the first quarter of 2020 to CHF 1.20 billion in the fourth quarter. However, as Thomas has indicated, on a sequential basis, this downward trend has now stabilized and given the momentum that we're seeing in our lending programs, we would expect to see this trend begin to improve sequentially in 2021. In terms of recurring commissions and fees, after the low point in the second quarter, primarily the result of the impact on portfolios of the market sell-off in March and April and compounded by the weakness since of Swisscard, fees have increased steadily, notwithstanding the currency impact. Transaction activity, as I've mentioned before, has been strong throughout 2020, including into the fourth quarter and notwithstanding the normal seasonal trends. Our Global Trading Solutions offering, providing bespoke institutional style products to our ultra high net worth clients, was a key driver of this growth in transaction revenues with Wealth Management-related revenues in collaboration of GTS, 34% higher in the year compared 2019. And I would reiterate that this strength has been sustained so far in 2021. I'll now turn to the divisional slides. Now before doing so, though, I'd remind you that in the tables, we're showing adjusted key financials excluding significant items. Where appropriate, I will call out the points where FX moves have had a particular impact. And I've included in the appendix versions of the slide for IWM and APAC in U.S. dollars, as well as full reconciliations with the reported numbers. Let's start with the Swiss Universal Bank. On an adjusted basis and excluding significant items, the Swiss Universal Bank generated net revenues of CHF 5.31 billion in the year, slightly higher than in 2019. Operating expenses were slightly lower at CHF 3.15 billion, reflecting our strong ongoing cost discipline. However, the significant increase in provisions for credit losses CHF 270 million compared to CHF 109 million in 2019 means that adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items was 4% lower year-on-year at CHF 1.89 billion. It's worth noting that CHF 75 million of the provision for credit losses was part of our CECL calculation, which as you know, is based on an assessment of a range of macroeconomic factors and can be recovered if the outlook improves. Now if we look at the fourth quarter, as I said already, we have seen the pressure on net interest income stabilize compared to the third quarter helped by an increase in net loans, which rose to CHF 176 billion from CHF 174 billion. Recurring revenues, albeit stable sequentially, still reflect the substantially weaker performance of our investment in Swisscard. Transaction based revenues were 5% lower in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Though they increased by 8% for the full year, driven by higher brokerage fees and increased revenues, both from GTS and from our Swiss Investment Banking business, credit provisions were still elevated at CHF 66 million in the fourth quarter compared to CHF 43 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, although we didn't see any particular signs of stress in the period. Now before we move to the next division, you will notice in addition to showing a year-on-year comparison for some of the key divisional metrics the quarter, I've included the full year total for these metrics for the last five years. Let me now turn to IWM. Our International Wealth Management division delivered net revenues of CHF 4.92 billion for the year on an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, 10% lower year-on-year. Operating expenses were 2% lower than 2019 at CHF 3.62 billion, although provisions for credit losses of CHF 110 million compared to CHF 49 million in 2019, which meant that the adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was 30% lower year-on-year at CHF 1.19 billion. This total includes an adverse impact of CHF 104 million from FX movements. The reported loss of CHF 12 million for the quarter was primarily due to the York capital impairment of CHF 414 million. The charge for which was taken in Asset Management. Adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was CHF 321 million, 22% lower year-on-year, but up sequentially by 20% on the third quarter of the year. Within Private Banking, we saw a record year for net new assets of CHF 16.7 billion for the year, of which CHF 4.3 billion for the fourth quarter was also a record and it reflected strong inflows both in emerging markets and in Western Europe. Asset Management saw CHF 15.5 billion of net asset inflows for the year against a challenging backdrop, and improved inflows in the fourth quarter, compared to the third with net flow in new assets of CHF 6.3 billion. Let's turn now to Asia Pacific, please, on the next slide. The performance of our Asia Pacific division reflected stronger market and client activity. Full year adjusted net revenues excluding significant items were 5% higher year-on-year at CHF 3.09 billion, with operating costs on the same basis 2% higher at CHF 2.09 billion. Provisions for credit losses were CHF 236 million compared to CHF 55 million for '19, resulting in an adjusted pretax income, again excluding sniffing items of CHF 769 million, 7% lower than in the previous year. Now looking at the fourth quarter, adjusted net revenues and adjusted pretax income excluding significant items were stable year-on-year at CHF 746 million, and CHF 201 million, respectively. And that resulted in a return on regulatory capital of 23%. Transaction based revenues made the most significant contribution, they were 20% higher year-on-year at CHF 450 million, reflecting increased financing revenues, which included mark-to-market gains and higher origination fees for equity related activity and strong client activity. Net interest income fell by 27% year-on-year, mainly reflecting the low interest rate environment and low lending volumes due to the deleveraging that we saw in the first half of 2020. Our recurring commission and fees were 5% lower due to unfavorable FX movements. Total net new assets for the year was CHF 8.6 billion equivalent to an annualized growth rate of 4%. That included outflows of CHF 1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. We've continued to see a reversal of the deleveraging in the first half of the year, and a resumption of net loan growth on a constant currency basis. Let me now take this opportunity just to advise you that as of the first quarter of 2021, we will be presenting the results of our Asia Pacific division in U.S. dollars in order to provide greater transparency on the underlying performance, given that much of our business is conducted either in U.S. dollars, or in currencies that are pegged to the U.S. dollars. Let me turn now to the Investment Bank. The Investment Bank had another robust quarter to close out a year in which strong revenue momentum flow through to high profitability and improved returns. If you look at the fourth quarter, adjusted net revenues were 19% higher year-on-year at USD 2.34 billion. Adjusted operating expenses was 7% higher at USD 1.94 billion, primarily due to higher compensation costs. Provision for credit losses were $42 million, compared to $69 million in the same quarter last year. And that resulted in an adjusted pretax income of USD 357 million. Now if we look at each business line, the strongest area was Capital Markets, in which revenues were up by 90% year-on-year, reflecting higher debt issuance activity and a threefold increase in ECM revenues. Our fixed income sales and trading performance has been resilient, particularly as we're not materially exposed to the strongest and the most volatile sub-segments in macro, having restructured and downsized our rates business some years ago. Equity sales and trading revenues were 5% higher year-on-year, with strong contributions from cash equities and equity derivatives, partly offset by defensive risk positioning in the second half of the year. Now if we look at the full year performance, adjusted net revenues at USD 9.72 billion were 18% high year-on-year, including growth across all products and accelerating momentum in capital markets, particularly in the second half. Adjusted operating expenses were 5% higher at USD 7.35 billion, resulting in adjusted pretax income of USD 1.88 billion and that was 70% higher than in 2019. Now I'd just reiterate the guidance that Thomas has given. The positive trends that we've seen in the Investment Bank last year have continued so far in 2021 with a strong capital markets pipeline augmented by a resilient trading performance. And with that, I'd like to conclude my part of this morning's presentation, and hand back to Thomas. Thank you very much.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, David. So let me wrap up on Page 46. Our key growth agenda allows us to deliver attractive shareholder value. This includes our ambition to deliver pretax income in our Wealth Management related businesses of CHF 5.0 billion to CHF 5.50 billion in 2023. We expect to deploy most of our incremental capital into Wealth Management, and aim to drive positive operating leverage. We affirm our ambition to achieve an RoRC of 20% to 25% for Wealth Management related businesses, and of 10% to 15% for the Investment Bank, with sustainable investment solutions at the core of our offering to Wealth Management, corporate and institutional clients. These efforts should support our goal to achieve our medium-term ambition of 10% to 12% RoTE in a normalized environment, subject to market and economic conditions. I will close my presentation with a few words about start to 2021. Investment Banking revenues, year-to-date, are up substantially year-on-year, driven by continued strong capital markets performance and trading activity. We have a healthy IB pipeline across products. We expect more normalized credit provisions in 2021 but with a wide range of possible outcomes. We also expect a more normal level of Asset Management profitability. As such, we saw our strongest January in a decade, with pretax income up year-on-year across all divisions with notable strength in APAC and the Investment Bank. However, this pandemic is not behind us. And we recognize that the broader economic recovery remains fragile and markets will remain somewhat unpredictable. Before I hand over to Kinner, allow me to thank you for your attention today and for your great engagement. I look forward to seeing as many of you as possible this year. In the meantime, I wish you all the best for you and your families and wish you a healthy and prosperous continuation of 2021. Thank you. And with this, I would like to hand over back to Kinner. And we will then go together with David's into the Q&A. Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': \"We will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. Operator, let's open the line, please. Question-and:\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from Exane. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much. Two questions, please. Firstly, on the bonus pool comment that you made, did you say that was in Swiss francs or in dollars, that you reduced the bonus pool by 7% year-on-year? And how do you see that move, is that a sort of one-off impact reflecting some of the one-off charges in the year or is that a sustained realignment of the profitability in that business in the direction that you need to go towards your targets? So that's my first question. The second question really was a slightly broader one of the Wealth Management side about flows where there was weakness in the Swiss business and in Asia in the quarter. But even just looking at the year as a whole, relatively modest flows I'd say so largely around sort of 2.5% net new money. And I just wondered how you saw prospects for flows in 2021, whether we can expect a little bit more growth than that in terms of inflows?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Yeah, thanks, Jeremy. I hope you can hear me. Can you hear me?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee', 'text': 'Yes, absolutely.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Okay, very good. Just wanted to make sure the technology works. So bonus pool, yeah, it's 7% down in Swiss franc, which in dollar terms is probably about flat. We clearly, we paid up in Investment Bank, we paid down in some of the divisions outside the Investment Bank or flat and Corporate Center somewhat down. So, overall, I think we have to pay for performance. And we had kind of a mixed 2020 in the sense that we had strong underlying performance, if you look at our PTI excluding significant items, we're up 6%, despite higher credit provisions and despite FX headwinds. But on the other hand, we had some one-offs and especially in the fourth quarter, legacies to address and that's why together with the Board, we came to view that the minus 7% is the right number. And we will continue to pay for performance going forward. So this is not a trend or anything, it's just the way we look at the bonus pool. In terms of Wealth Management flows. Look, I intentionally included a slide, Slide 17, which shows you more on the longer term, the client business volume, and that's the way I have always looked at the business, be it in my old role as Head of the SUB division, be it now in the Group role because this is really how you should look at the Private Banking franchise, namely Asset under Management, custody assets and net loans. And as you can see that we've been growing 4% in Switzerland over the years. And if you look at IWM and APAC, and these numbers here are in U.S. dollars, which reflect also the fact that 25% only and I think it's only 4% or 5% in APAC, are in Swiss francs. So in these two divisions, so it's much better look at U.S. dollar, we have been growing by 6% in IWM and by 14%. And that's why mid-single digit is the right target for SUB, mid-to-high single digit is the right target for IWM and double digit is the right target for APAC. You can also see some deleveraging going on in Switzerland, because if you see the loan in Switzerland, it went from CHF 160 billion to CHF 118 billion. But the custody assets went up from CHF 43 billion to CHF 54 billion. And for example, in Asia, we also had quite a lot of deleveraging USD 57 billion to USD 107 billion in terms of custody assets, but net loans went down USD 47 billion to USD 44 billion. So there was definitely some deleveraging going on. And that's for us an opportunity to grow and to increase our lending business in all three divisions actually. But this is the way I think one should look at Private Banking business. So you look at all three elements AuM, custody assets and net loans.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee', 'text': 'Thank you, so helpful. Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein', 'text': 'Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, we will take your next question. And the question was from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': \"Good morning. I'd like to ask the same two questions actually I asked at Investor Day, just your updated thoughts. The best on Slide 32, under the transaction column, you flag two things. One is that you've got a very tough comp in first half '20, given the elevated transaction levels that we saw. On the flip side, you suggest you're seeing a 34% increase in WM-related revenues in collaboration with GTS. I'm interested to know or how you think those two things were into play going into 2021, as one is, obviously somewhat of a headwind versus the second being a tailwind. That will be the first question. The second one I just wanted to turn to the Investment Bank. I know when we talk about it on the Investor Day, you talked about focusing on profitability and returns rather than market share. You also made a point about your business mix, namely, in equity you're overweight cash and derivatives and underweight prime and in fixed income, you've been underweight macro. But when I looked at Q4, there was obviously some degree of normalization and a lot of those business mix shifts, rates particularly pulled back and credit was actually stronger and yet for the third consecutive quarter, you've underperformed the peers pretty much in every business line, fixed income equities and primary. And so just to about the momentum kind of stalled a little bit there, so perhaps you could just elaborate on your thoughts on Investment Banking, more broadly in 2021? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. And do you want to start with the transactional revenues and I will take the Investment Bank, David? Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"My pleasure. I mean, I think your question Andrew was around in terms of how we see the comparables, I think, and then obviously, the performance with GTS really because obviously, we saw strong growth during 2020. I guess your question, Andrew is, so what do we expect for '21, is it going to be up against that 2020 comparable, given the structural growth? Or how does it come together? Look, I think that was the point. But I, please correct me if I'm wrong, Andrew. But my answer to that would be, we clearly have seen a strong start to 2021 in terms of our GTS businesses. And that's what we're really reflecting, obviously, in terms of the comments we've made about the very strong January that we've had. Clearly, those comparables will get more tough as we actually move into the, as we now move into our one-year anniversary of COVID and you saw the market volatility picking up in March, April and May. So look, I think last year was very strong in terms of structural activity and it was strong in terms of volatility, and it will become more difficult to show that progression against that comparable, but it's certainly been a very good start to the year. And I think there is clearly a fundamental demand by clients in a market where it's difficult to earn net interest income, because interest rates are kind of zero or negative in most locations. And at that point that's leading to two trends. One, I think clients are looking to alternatives, they are looking investments to actually made to generate those returns. And clearly many of our corporate clients are also concerned around hedging risk, and how do they actually hedge some of the volatility, it's still a very uncertain market. And I think that does mean it's a favorable market for GTS. And it's a favorable market for transactions across the Wealth Management division. But I'm not sure I just want to get into a forward-looking view for how I see the next 10 months of the year against the comparables we saw for 2020. But it's certainly been a very good start for the year.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"As far as Investment Banking is concerned, if you look at one of the slides, I presented you, you can see that we were for the full year, up 19%. And I said also that if you actually include the GTS part, we were up more than that, close to the industry of 24%, I think is the industry. So I think overall, we have despite the fact that we have less exposure to macro, for the full year, actually performed more or less in line with the market. We outperformed the market in capital markets and in M&A, as you can see also in one of my slides, equities was somewhat slower, that's true, but we've also had probably less market share on the equity derivative side. We have had quite solid performance with plus 12% in equities. And especially on the on the cash side, I'm quite satisfied. But also in equities, you should probably look at it a bit more holistically. And if you include equity capital markets, and look at the whole equity business in the fourth quarter, for example, I think we were up 44%, 45%, very much in line with our U.S. peers. So and, from that perspective, I'm not worried at all. Quite the contrary, actually, if I look at January, we've had a very strong start. And as I said it was the strongest January, we had in the last 10 years.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': \"Thank you. I have a follow up on the latter point. There you said about looking at equities holistically, and ECM, obviously a lot of strength we've seen particularly in the back end of 2020 and also in January, it's back-related. But can you just comment on the sustainability there and how CS is positioned to benefit? Thanks.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Yeah, we had a very strong year in 2020 in IPOs, and within that in specs, number one in both. I year-to-date, where this activity has been even stronger compared to last year, we think we are number four number five globally. So far, we continue to see big demand for specs, not only in the U.S., but increasingly, also in Asia, and to some extent, also in Europe. So, at least in the short term, we don't see this to slow down. It provides an alternative to private equity and traditional IPOs. And it's something that is certainly here to stay, whether it will - is here to stay at these levels in the mid-to-long term, we'll have to see. But I also think that if you look at the overall macroeconomic situation, there will be a lot of companies that will need to raise capital in the next two, three, four quarters. As we come through this crisis, and people see opportunities, some sectors have been harder hit than others. So maybe there will be a switch or shift somewhat from IPOs to more secondary offerings, capital market activities, but also, we see stronger leveraged finance market. And from that perspective, we've seen that trend already in the first six weeks of the year.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs', 'text': 'Thanks so much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein', 'text': 'Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers', 'text': 'Thanks Andrew.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you.

Two questions, please. First on the buyback and then secondly, on the recurring fees. On the buyback, as you mentioned, you're a bit above CHF 100 million. So just wondering on the pace of the buyback, should we think like you aim for the CHF 1 billion, and then when you have more clarity in the second half, it will depend or will then decide where you land within the CHF 1 billion to CHF 1.5 billion range? And then the second question, on the recurring fee margins, I think were good in IWM and also solid in APAC, SUB was down, so just wondering, for this Q3, all the numbers, just wondering how you see the outlook and the client risk appetite in terms of demand for products? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein', 'text': 'Thanks very much, Benjamin.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"So just first, on the buyback? Yeah, we obviously started the buyback in January. I think what you said is exactly on the money. You know, as Thomas has already remarked, I mean it's an uncertain 2021, COVID-19 we're still in the pandemic, we don't really know yet, what's going to be the extent of government support and stimuli. I think it's early to make forward looking projections around credit provisions, although I do accept that we're lower in '21 than '20. I think it seems prudent therefore, to aim for around about the CHF 250 million a quarter for the first quarter. And then we'll see basically, once we've actually got the first quarter behind us, and we say how the second quarter shaping up, at what level do we actually want to pace it. But I think that's certainly our strategy for the first quarter in terms of how we see it developing. And clearly, the first quarter start has been very promising, shall we say and let that continue, is all I'd really point there. I think in terms of recurring, I'd go back to my Slide 32, if you wouldn't mind, actually, Benjamin. You know, the point I wanted to make there is, if I look at recurring, there's obviously you saw the first as you might say, post COVID quarter 2Q20, we saw the drop, unsurprisingly, because you saw the sell-off in portfolios in March of 2020. That flows through to recurring margins on a recurring fees on a month plus one basis. So unsurprisingly, 2Q was the low point. And then you've seen a steady increase since then, notwithstanding, clearly the strengthening of the Swiss franc against some of the currencies, we earned these revenues in, particularly APAC and IWM. So I think it's been pretty good to see that actually heading up. The other factor in there, we've been explicit about for is clearly the Swisscard investment, which is booked towards recurring revenues in the SUB. You know, I think given the importance of foreign exchange fees to the Swisscard joint venture, I think it's unsurprising that that remains depressed right through 2020 and today basically. So that's clearly a fact, which is very dependent on COVID-19. The balance is beyond that, so, but I'm pleased about the trend in recurring commissions and fees, you can see why it stepped up and if it hadn't increased, then I would be worried. So I think a good trend there in terms of at what we're seeing. And clearly on net interest income, I think whilst you can see the bottom in recurring was 2Q20. I think we would hope that the bottom in net interest income was 4Q20, you could see the pace of decline is dropping. That's obviously been driven by both dollar interest rate move but also around the Swiss franc appreciation. I would certainly expect to see that stable to up. Stable probably in 1Q, up later in the year as we expand our lending initiatives on the basis that the Swiss franc remains around current levels, i.e. we don't see a further precipitous sell off in the dollar or anything else. That's just a slight caveat in terms of that but that's probably a fuller answer. I think your question was more on recurring Benjamin.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Benjamin Goy',\n","    'text': 'No but that was very holistic, thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much. Can you actually hear me well? Okay, okay, great. And so I've got two questions. One is on your lending franchise, and another one is on the kind of pace and direction of investment. So on lending, and I think I'm going to refer to I think, your Slide 17. And so in 2020, the actual growth or the actual kind of lending growth was pretty kind of lackluster, in quite a few places and not growing at all. But of course, when you talk about the holistic business volumes, when you talk about the defense of NII from let's just say mid-year this year, of course, the loan growth is a big part of that narrative. So could you kind of let us know, where do you see the opportunity, I suppose both geographically and on the product level and also whether you have to make any changes. Thomas, I suppose it's a question to you whether you had to make any changes from the perspective of the organization of the kind of lending franchise across Credit Suisse to kind of prepare for that medium term plans of kind of single digit growth in lending across the Wealth, in particular? And my second question is on your investment budget, kind of but more holistically. Could you tell us kind of where over the next two years, your investment budget is likely to get spent? And I'm not only talking about the gross savings, which you will invest, but in general, when you think about where in the business, you will still continue investing? Because of course, in like 2019, 2020, we from that next step outside, saw the kind of big changes to the Swiss business overall. And of course, with the launch of CSX as well, so yes, so where's the investment? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Magdalena. So on lending, what we saw was, especially in the first two quarters, significantly leveraging. We started to turn the corner in the middle of the year. But I still think that we have substantial upside in terms of our lending growth, into 2021 actually, in all three divisions, and in particular, in Asia, where you can see we have reduced our lending volume almost by 10%. So and it's really across the board. So whether it's traditional kind of mortgages here in Switzerland, whether it's single stock loans, whether it's traditional lombard loans, whether it's corporate loans in Switzerland, or also in IWM, and APAC, where we have invested in our corporate franchise, and obviously also in the U.S. and in our Investment Bank. So it's partially also M&A related, it's partially more traditional lending. So the opportunities are across the board. We have clear plans for every division, how to go off these opportunities. And from that perspective, I'm optimistic that we can increase our lending growth, which we have been a bit more cautious about, let's call it this way, in 2020. On the investment budget side, again, we have clear plans in every division, starting with our Group efforts around digitalization, IT, online banking, digital offerings, in every of the three divisions on the Wealth Management side, but also on technology and risk systems in the Investment Bank. And then obviously it's about certain products, whether its ESG products, whether it's Private Markets, whether it's in mandates. And then finally, expansion of footprints in certain regions, in particular, in Asia and the Middle East, where we see significant opportunities, but also Brazil, for example, and in other areas where we have hired teams and relationship managers, and where we will continue to invest.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': 'And Thomas, just to be, just to be sure that I understood correctly, the expansion of footprint is broad. Is it a Wealth Management trend for you?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Yes, it's in particular the footprint in Asia, but also in the Middle East. Just to give you an example, we opened a branch in Riyadh, in Saudi Arabia, we have 45 people there, which I visited recently. We went up from 20 to 45 and we continue to invest in the region, whether it's in Doha, whether it's in Dubai, whether it's in other areas. So and obviously the China rollout for onshore Private Banking, but also our securities joint venture in Asia, Credit Suisse Founders went 51%, we will go to 100%, we announced that already last year. So the investments are not only pure play Private Banking, but it's also Wealth Management related and also in Asset Management, where we continue to invest.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa', 'text': 'Great, thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you.

First of all, very quick one, can you just confirm the cost ambition for 2021 of CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion, couldn't see it in the presentation. Just wanted to see, is that still intact? The second question very briefly, U.S. dollar, my model report in dollars now that you are saying, you're talking about Asia going to be reported in dollars, I'm just a bit confused how this will all work. And in that context, if you don't want to report in dollars, why not start hedging some of your earnings. And lastly, in terms of Slide 7, if I look at your phases, so clearly now, as you say in the growth phase, but you still produce adjusted profits. And clearly, the slide is on adjusted profits. And really what we want to move to post 2007, 2008, 2009 subprime crisis really to a level of stable profit clearly, as that drives the book value. And I was wondering, when we see Credit Suisse focusing on stated book value as of 2021? And if not, why not?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Okay, thank you very much Kian. I'll take those three.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': 'Stated profit [as] or book value?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Kian. Let me take those different points. So firstly, in terms of cost ambition. You know, we obviously ended 2020 at CHF 16.6 billion, which was slightly above my guidance, primarily, because I think, as Thomas has said already, given the generally strong trading performance we'd seen, I think it seemed relevant to keep the investments going. These are important for us to deliver our numbers in '22 and beyond. And in terms of the '21 numbers, I think we said at the Capital Markets Day, the range of between CHF 16.2 billion and CHF 16.5 billion, depending on how much of the CHF 600 million of investments we actually choose to make. And that roadmap remains intact. And although clearly, I think if we do see a continuation of the strong start to 2021, then I would expect to spend the bulk of that given what we want to do in the Wealth Management businesses. But that the guidance is intact. And those are the factors actually driving this. And I think in terms of FX and currency reporting, I think you know this is as well as you can, we have reported the Investment Bank in dollars since 2015 because the bulk of its revenues and its costs are actually U.S. dollar related. So, it's always been clear to do that and we've said that, that way in our slides. I think of the other three divisions, I think it makes - would make no sense to report SUB, in dollars. It's a Swiss franc business, has Swiss franc cost. It's based here in our home market. Whereas APAC does generate just over two thirds of its revenues, actually in dollar and dollar linked currencies and also has the bulk of its expenses in the same expenses. So I think it's probably easier to make the comparisons to show those numbers in dollars for everybody, because I think then you can compare the peers more easily. I thought a lot about IBM. But we have to remember, you know, the bulk of IBM's costs are here in Switzerland as well, even though essentially it does have a much broader exposure to dollar and non-Swiss franc currencies than some of our other businesses. And therefore is most exposed to the economic challenges that come from a strengthening Swiss franc and a weakening dollar or weakening euro for that matter. And that's why we're going to keep carrying forward that in Swiss franc. So that's how we're doing the divisions, I think so it's more transparent, and you can make the comparisons to the peers. That then breaks a broader question, which is, should we look again at moving our reporting from Swiss franc to U.S. dollars? Look, I think we looked at it with the board back in '19. We decided not to move from that, Switzerland is our home market, we operate in Swiss francs. And that was something that, we did discuss with central bank and other people basically, and I think it was a decision that was very much supported. It is, I'm not sure it's a bad thing to report in one of the world's strongest currencies. It's a bastion of safety and it's something that's important to us to our clients. And I would just remind you, the reporting currency doesn't affect the economics. It's just how you choose to present things. And at the end of the day, we're listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange, and we buyback our shares in Swiss francs. So we have to generate Swiss francs to actually deliver this. That then gets to your next question, which is okay, what about the economics? I think, generally speaking, as a bank, we're quite well balanced. The only open exposure we have really is actually to sterling, because we do have a sterling cost base, but there's not these days a great deal of sterling revenues in the world markets, essentially. So we generally do have a short sterling position, which has been obviously favorable post '16, marginally less favorable in the last year or so. And we'll see what happens next. We have looked at hedging that occasionally. But I mean, in reality, it's the economic base of the business and hedging basically only smoothes the FX effects rather than anything else. And I don't think it really makes a great deal of sense to do it. But it wouldn't make any sense for us to hedge the Swiss franc dollar, given our liabilities are ultimately in Swiss francs in terms of how we actually operate. So I have given it some thought. You know, it clearly, as I said, I think that the division is most exposed to this economically is IWM. It's a challenge in terms of the currencies and how they actually choose to work. And your next question, then I think was around adjusted was reported. Look, a few points. Firstly, our primary metric remains reported PTI. If you look at the LTI metrics for the [Exp], it's reported, is the reported RoTE that we actually report that sits out there and that's how it actually works. The secondary measure, which is the tangible value of share is adjusted only for FX and own credit volatility. Because I think otherwise, you'd be creating incentive for Credit Suisse to have a lower credit rating, which would be not the right thing to do. So that does remain our primary metrics. When we announced the restructuring measures last July, we said for the period of this time, it made more sense to focus on the adjusted numbers because otherwise, you'd see the reported trends disrupted by the restructuring costs. Clearly, the restructuring program comes to an end at the end of the second quarter. And there afterwards I think it will be our intention to move back towards reported numbers. But we did say for this period, what we're doing it, we'd actually look at the adjusted numbers. And as I said, clearly, as I said in terms of your final point about adjusted tangible value per share, the adjustments are purely for FX and for own credit, there's no adjustment for restructuring costs. There's no adjustment for litigation or anything like that, in terms of how we see it.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein', 'text': 'Very clear.

And a couple of question on the Wealth Management margin progression. So and I guess just with, I guess, so far, a large part of the AuM growth is driven by the market performance. Just wanted to understand a bit better, what that means for the margin going forward and in terms of the assets that you have, which don't really generate the kind of reoccurring fee margin, how that's going relative to AuM that does generate reoccurring fees? And what we should expect clearly in Q4 for APAC and IWM the margin was stable but just curious what your thoughts are on that? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Well, look, just a few points Amit. I think we've made this point before but the banks do not have the same AuM definition. We went through a number of changes back in 2012, 2013, which I think you know as well as we did. And we went for a very tight, narrow definition in terms of what actually qualifies for AuM, you know, we limit the amount we give for lending, we have restricted in terms of the amount of single stock positions, and we have a firm criteria around guidance and advice. That's one reason why AuM is a smaller subset of our total client business volume than it might be for some of our peers. I think that's right, because essentially, that means that, we're actually looking at assets where we're actually actively earning fees. So you're not going to see the dilution of gross margin, from actually recognizing more AuC in terms of this. So that's just a sort of point in terms of comparison, and myself or any of the IR team be happy to talk through this. This is something I review regularly with the Audit Committee. It's an important control metric for us. I think then for turning into Page 32, really, I think, rather than giving you a margin guidance, because I think it comes down to the different trends, the businesses, I'd just summarize what we think, which is, I do think that we are at the bottom. So long as exchange rates don't move further downwards against the Swiss franc or the Swiss franc doesn't appreciate further in terms of our net interest income, particularly as we'll see lending growth. And I'm just making that comment sequentially clearly, not year-on-year, because, you had a completely different FX rate in the first quarter of 2020. But I think we are sequentially we've seen the bottom in terms of that. Recurring, I think the fees we're talking about are linked to the value of portfolios. So that will come through on a, as you said, a month plus one basis, so typically flows through into the next quarter. And transaction, we've said what we said, I think our comments around the strong start to January should not be interpreted as just relating to the Investment Bank. It's certainly true, the Investment Banks had a good start. It's certainly true, though, that our APAC business and we are generally seeing transactions being strong across the bank. So I think that's what but certainly, I'm not trying to guide you to lower net or gross margins.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Amit Goel', 'text': 'Okay, thank you.

It's always tempting to look at operating performance and excluding all the one-offs, I guess, but then it becomes problematic when these one-offs become recurring, to an extent. And I just went back and I looked at consensus estimates for the litigation charge at Credit Suisse, at the start of January of last year. And it was CHF 58 million. And it ended up being CHF 988 million. The consensus for this year is CHF 68 million. And for '22, it's CHF 36 million. And I was just wondering, so just two questions. And I think to an extent they go back to Kian's questions as well on stated versus underlying. To what extent do you think consensus is accurately capturing what you expect for litigation and non-operating charges more broadly, for this year and next? And then Thomas, a question to you. To what extent were you surprised in your new role as CEO by the extent of non-operating charges that keep popping up at Credit Suisse? And then the second question is just very basic. So on Page 5, you quote, low bond yields as one of the factors affecting or pressuring this year's results. I think we can see from your chart very nicely. How this trend is reverting? And I was wondering if you see that as a potential tailwind to your results this year. Thank you very much.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Okay, I'll take the first one and then maybe, David you can take the second one. Look, it did only partially come as a surprise. I think we said on various previous sessions with you, for example, that we are looking at some of the positions in Asset Management and clearly the situation about York was something that we had discussed previously and was something we wanted to address, I wanted to address in my first year. And the legal expenses or the legal provisions around our RMBS docket was something that we knew at some point will materialize. These legal cases sometimes have their own timeline and their own dynamics. I'm very happy that we managed to address the MBIA case. And I think it's also appropriate what we have done for the balance. I'm not going to comment on whether the consensus is right or wrong. But I do definitely think that what happened in the fourth quarter was necessary, was the right thing to do in my first year, to address some of these historic situations. And from that perspective, it didn't come as a surprise. But it was also actually it was interesting that both when we announced the York situation as well as the MBIA, the share price went up. So I think actually, investors are appreciating that we follow through on our promise that we want to address legacies and work through them. So from that perspective, I think it was the right thing to do, it gives us a much better and clear platform now for '21. And we have solid momentum in the first six weeks in all four divisions. We are focused on growth in all four divisions. And from that perspective, we can really now focus not only, thanks to the addressing the legacies I mentioned, but also on the back of what we announced in the summer, namely putting the two Investment Banks together, putting risk and compliance together, creating SRI on the group level, addressing the Neue Aargauer Bank here in Switzerland and launching digital offering here in Switzerland, the new one together with reducing the branch network. These were all measures that were done in the middle of COVID-19 in the summer, which I feel very good about because now we can focus on growing the business on all dimensions. So that's how I would answer your question on operating performance versus one-off and whether this was a surprise.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Perhaps I could just make a few supplementary points Jernej on this one, I think, firstly, the reasonably possible loss disclosure at the end of the third quarter was CHF 1.2 billion. So and I think there's been very full disclosure around the RMBS docket and other litigation risks in all of our reporting. I think the second point, the MBIA case obviously went to trial last year. And we obviously received an adverse judgment on the end of 31st November, and we made an appropriate ad hoc statement there afterwards around it. I think that judgment was probably worse than we expected. And therefore, it was not something we wanted. But I think we reacted appropriately, both in terms of the provision we took in respect of the MBIA case, and the broader read across for the rest of the year. The book we actually took as a back of that and I think it's good though, actually I mean, if you go back to what we said in the 1st December, we talked about a risk of $680 million in respect to the MBIA, you can, so we actually closed it out at $600 million. I think it's an interesting question, which we could discuss, has it been right to actually fight these RMBS cases since they go back to 2005 to 2007? I think the answer is yes. I think if you look at the settlements that are reached in some of these cases by other banks, in the 2011, 2012 period, they were clearly a great deal higher than this. So I think it has been the right thing to do. But I just would just caution, there's not been - no lack of disclosure around these positions in this risk in terms of that. And I think we have, as Thomas said, made the appropriate read across to the rest of the book in terms of our fourth quarter provisions. Secondly, I'd also point out that the significant items do include some positives. And obviously, you've had the two tranches, the gains on Allfunds. And that does remain, I think, conservatively marked, compared to some of the speculation we've seen around this asset. And secondly, I think, obviously SIX continues to be a very well-run bank utility, and I think has generated gains for us. And that's come through as well. So there are positives as well as negatives. So I think the issue for '20 is in 2019 you had a net credit from such write-downs whereas in 2020, you had a net debit in terms of that, just to make a couple of points. So then the next point, really just in terms of long bond yields. And I think we've probably said as much as you want to say of net interest income, which is, I think we have, we are at the bottom and I think we should start to see it improve as we build lending sequentially. Clearly given the FX moves. I think that'll be much more challenging on a year-on-year basis. But if FX rates do remain at current levels, given the lending initiatives, I don't, I think we'll probably won't see too much of a shortfall, maybe something in the CHF 50 million to CHF 60 million on a constant currency basis for 2021 compared to 2020. So I think we're coming through the inflection point around net interest income trends.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jernej Omahen', 'text': 'Thanks very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Thank you.

I just wondered, is there too many moving parts of the number just to see rhetoric and any sort of like more clarity on this point? And then on the costs, I mean, should we see the fact that you no longer quote the CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion, and the fact that you come in CHF 16.6 billion versus 16.5 billion but not really explain it as much as a as a sign that you sort of are like moving away from the absolute cost guidance or de-emphasize it given it wasn't necessarily reiterated.

I think we obviously did reduce the RPL by CHF 300 million, which as you say, it's not as much as the CHF 800 million increase in the RMBS provision. And the reason for that is, as I commented before, there were certain items in the judge's order of the 31st November, which, I think were adverse to us. And we looked both in terms of the MBIA case and in terms of the read across to the rest of the RMBS docket, and we wanted to reflect that fully. It is what it is, it's a matter of fact, is clearly a number of other cases and other appeals going on around that. But that's why you see that balance, basically. And I think the second point in terms of the expenses, I think I was asked a question earlier on basically, by one of your colleagues. And I think it was Kian. And just to reiterate, our guidance does remain CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion, dependent on the level of the CHF 600 million investments we identified in the capital markets that we choose to invest. At this point, given the strong start this year, I think it would seem prudent to be making those investments to support the longer-term growth of our Wealth Management businesses in '22 and '23, particularly in fast growing markets. But clearly that's a decision which is constantly under review. And we'll see how 2021 develops.

Look, I think the print this year is kind of hiding some big movements in different directions. So the good side of CHF 16.9 billion, the FX neutral cost base is CHF 17.4 billion. Now, when we talked about expenses of 2020, the prior CMD, the upper end of the range was CHF 16.9 billion in a good year. So I'm just trying to work out where this additional spend come from. I know you're talking about investment budgets going forward. But can you sort think about that in a backward-looking sense? How much a business is investment in growth? And how much is this is rectifying some control issues or anything like that? And then, what should the J curve on this spend look like? When will the revenues come through? Are there any this year with any because clearly the bonus pool is down so it's not paying for performance? So I'm just trying to get an idea of that and how that looks going forward?

Firstly, in terms of the cost guidance, yes, it is complex because you will see in 2021 current exchange rate, a further drop in expenses due to the FX moves, obviously subject to how rates actually pan out. But I think in terms of things that we chose to spend on, I think, firstly, and we have talked before about the growth in China. Thomas has talked about it, that is critical for us. But I think Secondly, there is obviously everything else we actually want do in APAC because it is our fastest growing region. I think that's where a lot of the opportunities lie. I think but in terms of other things, yes, I think it's very important to maintain appropriate in terms of your control infrastructure. There's plenty of risks out there. And I think we're spending appropriately in terms of that. So that's what I'd say at this point. I think the expense what we gave at the Capital Markets Day, I think does very much remain intact.

We also addressed some structural opportunities in IWM and in other areas of the Corporate Center. Real estate is another area where we see some opportunities. But generally, I also think it's important to really manage, especially in the three private banking divisions, the cost base dynamically and in a cost income ratio basis and not absolute. We are investing, we are rolling out in China, we are investing in the Middle East, we are investing in Thailand and in Korea. So as we want to grow, we see huge growth opportunities in private banking, we made that clear in the mid-December Capital Markets Day. This is a market that grows 7% globally, and we want to grow, at least with the market. And if you open branches, like we opened in Riyadh, or we do a rollout of relationship analysis for onshore private banking in China, that costs money. But we are financing a lot of these investments with some structural moves, like we did in 2020 in the summer, that I feel very good about. We didn't see the benefit yet of those, but it allows us to actually invest in growth and self-finance a large portion of that.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'Adam, I think your second question was, is that guidance given in dollars or in Swiss francs?

So we, it tends to be a sort of medium-term type swap book to reduce interest rate volatility. So we don't have the up or the down volatility that you see for some of the U.S. banks relative to the curve. And as I said before, I think I did give a general guidance a few minutes ago, which is, if I look at the interest rate effect for this year, and net of the FX move, I expect to be down about CHF 50 million for full year 2021 compared to full year '20.

But if you exclude that, there is a very clear correlation between Asset under Management and recurring revenues, which we have seen some degree of margin erosion. But at the same time, we are very much focused to increase our mandate penetration. That's our clear strategy in all three private banking divisions. I think with our performance we've had in our CIO office, but also with our efforts around ESG. And new mandates, be it for high net worth, but also ultra high net worth, which would include also private equity investments. So Platinum Mandate, as we call them, we are offering new opportunities for our clients to have tailor-made mandates depending on their risk appetite. And this is how we are planning to further increase our recurring revenues. And as you can see on Page 32, whilst year-on-year we are down and there is also some translation element in there.

If you were to translate that into dollars, we're actually up about 10%. So I think overall, we have a good trajectory, very healthy M&A in the business, if you took and analyze. I agree with you, the fourth quarter was a bit weak, but I don't look at M&A on a quarterly basis. This is more like an annual basis and it kind of shows some of the trends. But again, I can just come back to my earlier observation that the way you should really look at the banking franchise Private Banking franchise is client business volume. That really gives you the best sense of how the franchise is growing. But the CHF 8.6 billion in Swiss francs is actually higher on the like-for-like basis than the CHF 8.7 billion we had in 2019. Look and then with respect to the moral hazard, this is somewhat theoretical question, we had the legal strategy at the time in 2009, 2010. You can argue whether it was the right strategy or not, but, as David said, we chose that way and overall it probably was not the wrong strategy. But I can also say that unlike others, we have settled, for example, the RMBS case with the DoJ. That was done in 2016 and from that perspective, some good efforts were made by my predecessors. And some of these litigations have their own, as I said, their own tactical considerations with respect to when do you settle and when do you actually go to court. And each bank has to do that, as they see fit, depending on the case. So that's all I can say to that.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Unidentified Analyst',\n","    'text': \"Okay, let's leave it like that.

Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of questions on the Wealth Management and related businesses, mainly referring to your disclosure on Page 17, where you said that the client business for them is an aggregate of AuM custody assets. And I know that is something that you commented on before. The two questions on this, firstly, on the especially strong growth in Custody A asset in APAC, and also to a lesser extent in SUB compared to the steady performance in IWM for custody assets. Is this primarily a reflection of the transaction nature of the businesses in APAC or whether we should expect custody assets to fluctuate around the transaction volatility? Or can I look at it another way whether it could be a temporary parking space for the money, there's some expectation of this converting into a more profitable AuM elevator stage? A second question relating to this is that if I look - looking ahead, is it fair to say that you're steering us to focus on from AuM to this broader client business volume as a better reflection of your Wealth Management performance? And I guess, then, in terms of gross margin, would it give us a better forecast or estimate, if you think about it separately, like NII margin on loans, recurring fees on AuM and transaction on the asset would it gives us a better feel for it? Thanks.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks for your two excellent questions. So custody assets in Asia grew for mainly two reasons. One, that we saw some deleveraging, as I said earlier, but also, there are quite a few of them which are single stock positions with performance, strong equity markets in Asia, obviously. So we saw both trends. In Switzerland a bit similar but with less I think the equity exposure, single stock exposure in custody assets is probably proportionally smaller. There's also a lot of cash in there, there's some gold in there, etc. So these are single asset class positions where we have low or no revenues, which we define as custody assets. To your second question, you could definitely make the argument that you should look actually at your margins in percentage of the overall client business volume. Obviously then, we would deviate a bit from the industry standard, which is to relocate a percentage of the AuM. We are currently not planning to change that but we are planning to be disclosing client business volume going forward because, as I said before, I think it's the right way to look at the franchise.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Clearer indication of the number of assets which the bank has relationship or associations with. So I think what was done very well in SUB over the years, essentially was to migrate some of these custody businesses into AuM as you build on the initial relationship with the clients.

Welcome, and thank you for joining Credit Suisse Group's First Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call for analysts and investors. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Kinner Lakhani, Head of Investor Relations and Group Strategy and Development. Please go ahead, Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion, we refer you to the Credit Suisse first quarter 2021 earnings release published this morning. Let me remind you that our first quarter 2021 financial report and accompanying financial statements for the period will be published on or around May 6. I'll now hand over to our Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Kinner. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our first quarter 2021 results. Let me begin with some comments about recent events. The significant loss in our prime services business relating to the failure of a U.S.-based hedge fund is unacceptable. In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders. Accountability is one of the core pillars of our corporate values. Together with the Board of Directors, we are addressing these situations through a series of decisive actions in the business and through 2 independent and thorough investigations, which are already underway. The investigations will not only focus on the direct issues but also broader consequences and lessons learned across the bank. We will work to ensure Credit Suisse emerges stronger. Today, we successfully placed a mandatory convertible notes offering, and I will go into greater detail shortly. This will enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and support the momentum in our core franchises. Credit Suisse remains a formidable institution with a rich history. We have thrived for more than 160 years through external crisis and our own challenges. I'm confident for the future. At the heart of this confidence is the earnings power of Credit Suisse and the resilience and dedication of our roughly 49,000 employees around the world. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees globally for their unwavering commitment to Credit Suisse and to our clients, which they have been demonstrating not only over the past few years, but particularly during the last few weeks, which were very challenging. They make me proud every day. In testament to their perseverance and adaptability, our underlying first quarter financial performance across all divisions was not only resilient but also strong. It was supported by solid results in Switzerland and very strong growth in APAC, strong growth in Investment Banking as well as Asset Management. Net new assets for the group increased strongly in the first quarter, and group assets under management grew to CHF1.6 trillion at the end of the first quarter. With that, let me turn to the slides. Page 4, please. We reported a pretax loss of CHF757 million for the first quarter and a net loss attributable to shareholders of CHF252 million. This includes a pretax charge of CHF4.4 billion relating to the U.S. hedge fund matter. As David will highlight in his slides, excluding that charge, adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was CHF3.6 billion, reflecting the underlying strength of our business. Our Wealth Management-related businesses achieved 59% year-on-year growth in pretax income on an adjusted basis, excluding significant items in the first quarter and a return on regulatory capital of 29%. This was led by strong growth in Asia Pacific, where we achieved adjusted pretax income growth in U.S. dollars, excluding significant items, of 164% year-on-year. This underscores the region's key role in our growth strategy. Revenues grew over 30%. On the same basis, return on regulatory capital in APAC was 52% in the first quarter. Net revenues in our Investment Bank grew 80% in U.S. dollar year-on-year in the first quarter. It recorded a pretax loss of USD 2.6 billion, including the U.S. hedge fund charge of $4.7 billion. Our CET1 ratio was 12.2% at the end of the first quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.5%, and CET1 leverage ratio was 3.8%. As I mentioned, today, we successfully placed an offering of 2 series of mandatory convertible bonds convertible into 203 million shares, leading to an estimated uplift of around 55 to 60 basis points to the CET1 ratio. We intend to restore capital to achieve an approximately 13% CET1 ratio and a minimum of 4% CET1 leverage ratio. We reduced the proposed ordinary dividend for 2020 to CHF0.10 per registered share. Following the completion of share buybacks in the first quarter of 2021, we have suspended the share buyback program. Subject to 2021 financial performance, the Board of Directors would intend to restore the dividend in 2021 before any resumption of share buybacks. Slide 5, please. As we have previously disclosed, on March 25, a U.S. hedge fund failed to meet its margin requirements, leading us to issue a default note. In the first quarter 2021, we recorded a charge of CHF4.4 billion in respect of this matter. We expect to take an additional charge in the second quarter of approximately $600 million or rounded also CHF600 million roughly. We have exited 97% of our position relating to the hedge fund. As you can see on the right side, we have reviewed exposures across the entire prime services business. Related risk and control governance is already being strengthened and will be further enhanced following first and second line risk management assessments. Our Prime Brokerage and Prime Financing businesses will be resized and derisked with the primary focus on our most important franchise clients. By the end of 2021, we plan to reduce the Investment Bank leverage exposure by at least USD 35 billion and to align the IB risk-weighted assets to no more than the end of 2020 levels. Slide 6, please. Regarding the supply chain finance fund matter, Credit Suisse Asset Management's priority remains the recovery of funds for investors in the 4 supply chain finance funds. To date, total cash collected in the funds amounts to USD 5.4 billion, more than half of the total AUM at the time that the funds were suspended, of which USD 4.8 billion have been returned to fund investors in 2 cash distributions. We intend to provide progress updates over the coming months. CSAM is in active dialogue with the administrators of Greensill and other parties to identify options to facilitate further recovery. We have noted that it is reasonably possible that Credit Suisse will incur a loss in respect of these matters, though it is not yet possible to estimate the size of such a reasonably possible loss. We established Asset Management as a separate division April 1, 2021, emphasizing the strategic importance of the business for the bank and its clients. I also want to be clear that there are no plans to sell the Asset Management business at this point in time.  Page 7. The Executive Board, together with the Board of Directors, has taken decisive actions in the wake of these events, as you can see from the next 2 slides. For one, We implemented management changes in response to the recent events. We welcome Ulrich Körner, who has been CEO of Asset Management, a member of the ExB since 1st of April 2021. Christian Meissner has been appointed CEO of the Investment Bank and member of the ExB effective 1st of May. Jo Oechslin has been appointed Interim Chief Risk Officer and member of the ExB on an interim basis effective April 6. Thomas Grotzer has been appointed Interim Global Head of Compliance effective April 6. The management team is fully focused on strengthening prime services and asset management risk controls, including forensic analysis of the 2 incidents and lessons learned. We are conducting an overall review of risk systems, processes and culture across the bank in close collaboration with the Board of Directors and external advisers. The Board of Directors has launched 2 investigations carried out by external parties. These investigations will be supervised by a special committee of the Board of Directors and will not only focus on the direct issues arising from those matters, but also reflect on the broader consequences and lessons learned. In each instance, we'll work closely with the relevant regulators, including FINMA, which has opened enforcement proceedings in both cases. Page 8, please. We have also strengthened our capital by issuing 2 series of mandatory convertible notes, convertible into a total of 203 million Credit Suisse Group AG shares. These are expected to provide net proceeds to Credit Suisse Group of approximately CHF1.7 billion. You can see the details on this slide. But let me highlight, as I mentioned earlier, that this is expected to lead to an estimated uplift of around 55 to 60 basis points to the CET1 ratio. Slide 9, please. Let me now turn to our underlying performance. We delivered strong revenue growth across our Wealth Management franchise and the Investment Bank. Wealth Management-related revenues adjusted, excluding significant items, grew 7% year-on-year in the first quarter. Growth was particularly robust in transaction and performance-based revenues, which grew 18% from 1 year earlier. As you see on the right side of the slide, Investment Bank revenues grew 80% year-on-year during the first quarter to USD 3.9 billion. The gain occurred across fixed income sales and trading, equity sales and trading and particularly capital markets and advisory. Next slide, please. Despite recent events, we still grew our assets under management and achieved a solid increase in net new assets. Our AUM at the group level increased by 16% year-on-year to CHF1.6 trillion, and grew by 6% since the beginning of the year. NNA growth for the last 12 months was 5%, and we posted an annualized NNA growth rate of 7% in the quarter. Slide 11. We have generated substantial client business volume growth across our Wealth Management businesses, particularly in APAC, which achieved 41% year-on-year growth in U.S. dollar terms during the first quarter. We have also seen strong client business volume growth in IWM Private Banking and in the Swiss Universal Bank Private Clients businesses. Likewise, we also saw very strong net new assets across these divisions. As you know, our ambition is to grow annual client business volume by mid-single digits for the sub mid- to high single digits for IWM and double-digit growth in APAC, all of which we have comfortably exceeded in the first quarter. Next page, please. During the first quarter, our Wealth Management-related adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, grew 59% year-on-year to CHF1.6 billion. On the same basis, RoRC in our Wealth Management-related businesses grew from 18% in the first quarter of 2020 to 29% in the first quarter of 2021. We grew total client business volume across all 3 divisions by 22% year-on-year. We drove client activation resulting in mandate penetration of 29%. We also experienced continued strong performance in our ultra-high net worth business across all 3 divisions, with NNA of CHF8.3 billion. Page 13. Let me cover in more detail our Asset Management business, which is a strategic part of our overall value proposition. Asset Management revenues, excluding significant items, increased 60% year-on-year against what was a difficult first quarter 2020 with notable improvement in both adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items and NNA. The rebound in quarterly performance stretched across the businesses despite the supply chain finance fund situation. Our strong NNA of CHF10.3 billion during the first quarter was driven by inflows in traditional investments, investment in partnership and alternatives at above-average gross margins. Next page, please. Let me turn to our capital markets and advisory franchise, which outperformed most of our peers. Based on Dealogic data, our capital markets and advisory fees grew -- growth was 118% year-on-year during the first quarter. And it grew to USD 1.7 billion. Our share of wallet on the same basis increased across M&A, ECM and DCM. Next page, please. We recognize that a strong focus on sustainability is not only the right thing to do, it is good business and an important part of our growth strategy. With this in mind, last summer, we created SRI, Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions, to infuse environmental, social and governance standards at the heart of research, advisory, Investment Banking and Wealth Management. Almost 9 months after its launch, SRI has made excellent progress executing its strategy and delivering value to clients and stakeholders. We are doing this by enabling client transitions, driving our own transition and taking a leadership role in standard setting among other things. On the right side of this slide, you see just a few highlights. These include CHF118 billion in assets managed according to sustainability criteria at the end of the first quarter. And we priced 25 deals, including sustainable bonds globally, totaling USD 17.3 billion. Before I hand things over to David, let me briefly touch on the outlook. Overall, we would expect market volumes to return to lower and more normal levels in the coming quarters. We expect a residual impact of approximately CHF600 million from the U.S.-based hedge fund matter in the second quarter as we have now exited over 97% of the related positions. In Wealth Management, we anticipate broadly stable net interest and improving recurring commissions and fees, benefiting from higher levels of AUM. For the Investment Bank, we would expect the second quarter to reflect the slowdown in market activity as well as an impact from the resizing of our prime services business. Signs of recovery in the global economy could allow us to progressively release part of our allowance for credit losses under the CECL accounting methodology that was built in the early months of the COVID-19 crisis last year. Additionally, we expect the effective tax rate to remain significantly elevated for the remainder of the year. We intend to achieve a CET1 ratio of approximately 13% and the minimum 4% CET1 leverage ratio. With this, I would like to hand over to David.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much, Thomas, and I'd like to wish everybody good morning. What I'd now like to do is to just go through the financial results in more detail. As we announced in our trading updates that we published in March and in April, the bank's underlying performance was strong in the first quarter. We've increased contributions from each of our business divisions. However, this performance was more than negated though by the pretax charge of CHF4.43 billion, resulting from the U.S.-based hedge fund matter. First, I'd just like to reiterate the points that Thomas made earlier about our capital position. Notwithstanding the reported loss, our capital position was resilient with a CET1 ratio for the quarter of 12.2%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.5% and a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.8%. And I'd just note that those are all above the guidance that we gave on April 6. Now in terms of our financial priorities of the bank, as I'll discuss in more detail shortly, with the completed placement of our CHF1.7 billion mandatory convertible notes, we are at an implied CET1 ratio of approximately 13% and a CET1 leverage ratio of approximately 4%. These are the ratios at which we intend to operate for the balance of 2021. Now just in terms of the dividend. Whilst the Board will look to restore the 2020 reduction in the current year, this will clearly depend on our financial performance in the balance of 2021. With regard to the share buyback, we would expect this to remain suspended for the balance of 2021. And I would say that recommencing the program should take second priority to the restoration of the dividend.  Let's turn to the next slide, please. So reported net revenues for the quarter were 31% higher than in 2020 at CHF7.57 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, net revenues were 35% higher. And the driver of this strong performance was the Investment Bank, whose net revenues increased by 80% year-on-year to USD 3.89 billion. But I would note that we've also seen a continuation of the sequential improvements in Wealth Management-related revenues that I've discussed back in February. On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, Wealth Management-related net revenues increased by 7% year-on-year. I think you'll note that we also saw strong net new asset inflows across all of our Wealth Management businesses. Now in terms of expenses, our total operating expenses were 2% lower for the quarter at CHF3.94 billion. And that was mainly due to lower compensation accruals. We have seen modest gains from reduction in our CECL provisions, reflecting the improved economic environment with a net release of CHF59 million in the quarter. However, despite these positive trends, the pretax charge of CHF4.43 billion relating to the U.S. matter means that we reported a pretax loss of CHF757 million for the first quarter. Now on an adjusted basis, if you exclude significant items and the U.S.-based hedge fund charge, pretax income was CHF3.6 billion for the quarter compared to CHF946 million in the first quarter of last year. You'll note that we see an elevated effective tax rate of 69% in the first quarter. That is primarily driven by the U.S.-based hedge fund charge, for which I've only accrued a partial tax recovery in the current year. I would also note that the partial recovery will result in the effective tax rate remaining significantly elevated for the rest of 2021, potentially as high as the level in the first quarter, although this will depend on our tax calculations around future recoverability and the level of underlying profitability in the balance of the year. Just to be clear, I would anticipate a return to a more normal tax rate in 2022. Now the reported net loss attributable to shareholders for the quarter stood at CHF252 million, and that compares to a net income of positive CHF1.31 billion for the same period last year which meant we had a negative return on tangible equity in the first quarter of 2.6%. Next slide, please. Okay, I just wanted to give a bit more detail on the underlying performance of the bank in the first quarter and just pull out some of the significant items. You can see here that there was a gain in the first quarter of CHF144 million related to our investment in Allfunds. But you'll note this was actually less than the corresponding figure of CHF268 million in the first quarter of 2020. We also took restructuring charges of CHF63 million in the first quarter of this year, and that compared to a net credit of CHF5 million in the same period last year. As I touched on already, our CECL provisions swung from a charge at the start of the COVID crisis of CHF305 million a year ago to a credit of CHF59 million this quarter. But I'd also note here, you can see that our compensation benefits line was lower year-on-year at CHF2.207 billion compared to CHF2.316 billion, a reduction of CHF109 million, and that was primarily driven by reduced variable compensation accruals. But net-net, I think it should be clear that regardless of how you wish to view it, our underlying pretax income comfortably exceeded CHF3 billion for the quarter. Next slide, please. Now this should be familiar from the last 4 quarters. What we show here is the evolution of our provisions for credit losses, both specific and CECL related over the course of 2020 and into the current year. You may recall that we ended last year with just under CHF2 billion with specific and nonspecific allowances for credit losses. Since then, we've taken CHF4.45 billion in non-CECL specific provisions, of which clearly CHF4.43 billion relates to the U.S. hedge fund. Now we mentioned that we reduced our CECL provisions by CHF59 million in the first quarter. With write-offs of CHF36 million and a move of CHF79 million due to -- primarily due to FX, total loans to credit losses stood at CHF6.34 billion at the end of the first quarter. Just one point I would like to note, please, with respect to the USD 140 million collateralized bridge loan that was made to Greensill Capital in the fourth quarter of last year. As you may be aware, some $50 million of that has already been repaid by Greensill Capital's administrators, which reduced the notional value of the loan to USD 90 million. Now at the end of the first quarter, We have reduced the fair value of this loan to USD 60 million, having taken a charge of USD 30 million in the first quarter. Next slide, please. So we continued to take a disciplined approach to expenses. I've mentioned before, the 2% decline in our reported operating expenses for the quarter. And what I show here are the adjusted numbers which was CHF3.99 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2020, and that falls to CHF3.87 billion at the end of the first quarter of '21. And this is primarily due to a CHF109 million reduction in the comps and benefit line, primarily as I've said already, driven by a reduction in variable compensation accruals. Now just in terms of transparency, I would note that currency moves had a positive impact, i.e., they reduced their expenses by CHF113 million. Without which, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating expenses would have been about flat year-on-year. Next slide, please. Now what we show here are the increases in both risk-weighted assets and leverage since the end of the fourth quarter of last year. RWAs have increased from CHF275 billion to CHF303 billion, and leverage now stands at CHF968 billion compared to CHF911 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Now I think what we show here should be clear. The growth has been primarily driven by foreign exchange moves. And that's predominantly since the end of last year, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc and to a lesser extent by higher net business usage both in the Investment Bank and across the Wealth Management-related businesses. You should note there's a further CHF6 billion of RWA in respect of a temporary FINMA add-on for the U.S.-based hedge fund positions at the end of March. This add-on is directly linked to the size of the residual positions. It will fall proportionately in respect to the disposals that we've now completed. And therefore, we would expect this add-on to shrink to 0 during the course of the second quarter. Let's look in the capital ratios, please, on the next slide in some more detail. So as we've said, we ended the first quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.8% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.5%.  Let's just move from left to right. First, as we've said already, we expect to suffer additional losses of approximately CHF0.6 billion in respect of the U.S.-based hedge fund in the second quarter. We've now eliminated just over 97% of the related positions. So this should represent the bulk of the loss that we've suffered in this matter. And that's equivalent in capital terms to approximately another 20 basis point reduction in the ratio from the level at the end of the first quarter. But in capital terms, this loss should be more than offset by the proportionate reduction in the FINMA add-on which as we've eliminated the positions, boosts our capital ratio by about 25 basis points. Furthermore, I think everyone should be aware that the Allfunds IPO is actually due to price today. And the reduction of our holding in this business will boost our CET1 by about 25 basis points. Now Thomas -- as Thomas has said already, we have successfully placed an offering of 2 series of mandatory convertible notes, convertible into 203 million new shares, which should lead to an estimated uplift of approximately 55 to 60 basis points to the implied CET1 ratio, subject to the FINMA improving this as common equity prior to conversion or following conversion in 6 months' time. It's a 6-month mandatory convertible. And the exact value of the capital benefit from the MCNs will depend on the VWAP today and tomorrow. It's priced on today's price and tomorrow's price. But if you just include the second quarter loss on the U.S.-based hedge fund, the offsetting buffer reduction, the Allfunds credit and the placement of the MCNs, that implies a CET1 ratio of approximately 13%, which, as I said already, is our target for the rest of this year. Now just in terms of actions over the coming months. As we said already, we intend to reduce Investment Bank leverage by at least USD 35 billion, primarily from a resizing of the Prime Brokerage and Prime Financing businesses and realign RWA in the Investment Bank to no more than the levels that prevailed at the end of 2020. Combined with the impact of other asset sales, these should provide a further 40 to 50 basis points of uplift to the CET1 ratio during the course of the year. But as we noted before, in the second quarter, I would expect an increase in operational risk RWA due to the RMBS provisions that we took in the fourth quarter of last year as well as other methodology changes with a likely negative impact of 30 to 35 basis points. You should also note that capital generation in the balance this year will be constrained by the high level of the effective tax rate. And we should expect to see some capital consumption from the planned growth in our Wealth Management businesses. Now in terms of dividend, let me be clear. We have made first quarter dividend accrual in line with the level of the reduced 2020 dividend. As we said already, subject to the financial performance of the bank and the balance this year, we would hope to restore the 2020 reduction in the dividend this year, but that will clearly be a matter for the Board to review in due course. As I've said already, this should take priority over the share buyback, which I would expect to remain suspended for the balance of 2021. But just to reiterate, we're looking to maintain a capital ratio of about 13% for the balance of 2021. Now just turning to the CET1 leverage ratio, and I show the same walk below, I won't go through all the same points on the slide. But given, again, Allfunds, the capital raise and the reduction in Investment Bank leverage exposure relating to the resizing of the prime business, our leverage ratio should exceed 4% for the balance of the year. Next slide, please. Now let me just turn to tangible book value per share. That's increased from CHF15.8 to CHF16.8 since the end of last year. Net income attributable to shareholders excluding the charge from the U.S. hedge fund contributed CHF1.50 per share, with the effects of our capital distribution program and share-based comp awards adding a further CHF0.14 per share. We saw a widening of credit spreads, which actually results in a positive impact to tangible book value per share, as did the move in FX, particularly the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Swiss franc since the end of 2020. And these contributed CHF0.23 and CHF0.84 per share, respectively. Now prior to the charge relating to the U.S.-based hedge fund, tangible book value per share would have been CHF18.40 per share. However, this charge then had a negative impact of CHF1.6, taking the net figure to CHF16.8 per share. Let me turn then to the next slide. You'll recognize a previous version of this slide from our fourth quarter results, during which I explained that we were seeing sequential quarter-on-quarter improvements in our Wealth Management revenues in Swiss franc terms and that the adverse trends affecting our net interest income following on from the cut interest rates a year ago and the consequent move in the U.S. dollar were bottoming out on a sequential basis. So I'm very pleased that the evidence in the first quarter continues to support this view. Moving from left to right, whilst net interest income remained stable compared to the previous 2 quarters at CHF949 million, recurring commissions and fees have shown their third successive quarterly improvement, 3% higher than the fourth quarter of last year at CHF594 million. I think as you know, we've seen a significant increase in transaction-based revenues led by APAC. An overall total of CHF1.15 billion represents a quarter-on-quarter increase of 48% and a year-on-year increase of 22%. So let me just turn to the divisional overviews, where unless I state otherwise, I will be talking about adjusted numbers excluding significant items, particularly given the credit from Allfunds both last year and this year. And I'll start as usual with the Swiss Universal Bank. So net revenues were CHF1.41 billion. That's 2% lower year-on-year due to lower deposit income. But this was partly offset by improved recurring revenues, which increased by 8%. The improving macroeconomic environment means that we've continued to see a reduction in provisions for credit losses. For the first quarter, the Swiss Universal Bank took a further CHF26 million in provisions, of which CHF6 million were CECL related. For comparisons, provisions were CHF124 million in the first quarter of last year and CHF66 million in the fourth quarter. Ongoing cost discipline meant that our operating expenses actually totaled CHF749 million, 6% lower year-on-year, resulting in a cost-to-income ratio for the quarter of 53%. I think we're very pleased by the positive net new asset inflows we saw both in Private Clients and in Corporate & Institutional Clients, which totaled CHF6.1 billion in the quarter, an annualized net new asset growth rate of 4%. I'd also mention that one of the restructuring projects that we initiated last summer, that is the integration of Neue Aargauer Bank into Credit Suisse Schweiz AG and therefore into Private Clients and Corporate & Institutional Clients has now been completed successfully. We're also seeing strong take-up of CSX, the digital banking offering that we launched last September. Let's move to the next slide, please. Now you know that on March 18, we announced that we will be separating Asset Management from International Wealth Management and operating this as a separate division under the leadership of Ulrich Körner. I've therefore separated the 2 here for reference purposes, ahead of their formal move into separate reporting, which will start with our second quarter results. Just let's look at Private Banking first, please. Net revenues were 9% lower year-on-year at CHF929 million. We've reduced year-on-year net interest income due to the U.S. rates environment and the depreciation connected to that of the U.S. dollar and that offset positive impacts from deposit and loan growth. We have though continued to see quarter-on-quarter stability in recurring commissions and fees, and transaction-based revenues were 34% higher quarter-on-quarter, albeit 8% lower year-on-year. Net new assets were strong, CHF7.2 billion in the quarter, with strong contributions both in Western Europe and in our emerging market businesses, and equivalent to a growth rate on an annualized basis of 8%. I'd note that we have reclassified CHF2.4 billion of supply chain finance funds as assets under custody, and this is treated as a structural effect in our reporting. We also saw growth in outstanding loan balances of 10% to CHF56 billion. We had no material provisions for credit losses, and we reduced our CECL provisions by CHF5 million in the IWM PB business. And together with the improvement in operating expenses, which were 10% lower year-on-year at CHF585 million, driven by lower variable compensation, our adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was 5% higher year-on-year at CHF344 million. Let me turn now to asset management, please. Just saying a few words really just with regard to the supply chain finance funds. It remains Credit Suisse Asset Management and, for that matter, Credit Suisse's priority to maximize the recovery of cash for investors in these funds. Just to date, total cash collected in these funds has increased to CHF5.4 billion -- sorry, USD 5.4 billion, my fault, of which USD 4.8 billion has been returned to fund investors in the 2 cash distributions that we've made so far, and we'll provide further progress updates in the coming months. In terms of the overall division, we saw strong net new assets in the quarter of CHF10.3 billion, taking AUM to CHF458 billion. That's 4% higher quarter-on-quarter. AUM growth underpinned net year-on-year net revenue growth of 60% with higher management and higher performance fees contributing to a total for the quarter of CHF386 million. Operating expenses, again driven by lower variable compensation as well as reduced professional fees were down by 4% at CHF269 million. On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, the division delivered a pretax income of CHF117 million compared to the loss of CHF39 million in the same period last year. Let's turn to APAC, please. So as we've already announced, our Asia Pacific businesses had a strong start to 2021 with net revenues 33% higher year-on-year at USD 1.12 billion. Transaction-based revenues were particularly strong, 74% higher year-on-year at USD 725 million. But you should note that there was no repeat in this number of the USD 181 million net mark-to-market losses that we took in this business last year. We saw higher fees from M&A and ECM activity, strong private client transactional activity and increased revenues from GTS as well as an 11% increase in recurring commissions and fees, which offset a 12% year-on-year decline in net interest income due to lower deposit and lower margins. Even with a 4% increase in operating expenses, which totaled USD 558 million, the cost-to-income ratio for the division improved from 64% to 50% due to the higher net revenues. And overall, the adjusted pretax income, again, excluding significant items, was USD 531 million. Let me just conclude then please with a few words on the Investment Bank. Let's just start with the adjusted financials excluding the U.S. hedge fund charge. On this basis, pretax income was USD 2.2 billion, reflecting strong revenue contributions from all of our business lines and operating expenses of USD 1.78 billion. Net revenues increased by 80% to USD 3.89 billion. And I would note that we saw market share gains in ECM, a strong performance in leveraged finance and higher M&A deal completions. Within the credit franchise, we saw particularly strong performance in securitized products and further strength in asset finance. I think GTS' performance was also good, against what were very strong comparisons last year, and that reflected continued collaboration across the bank. Now in terms of credit provisions. Now just excluding again the charge relating to the U.S.-based hedge fund matter, we wrote back USD 89 million provisions, of which $73 million was related to the CECL release. However, clearly, this strong performance by our Investment Bank was more than negated by the loss in respect of the U.S. hedge fund. And that resulted in the division overall reporting a pretax loss of USD 2.56 billion. As already said, we're going to be focused on reducing and shrinking the size of our Prime Servicing and our Prime Financing businesses. We intend to reduce leverage in the investment by at least $35 billion in the coming months.  And with that, I'd like to conclude my part of the presentation. And I believe we're now going to pass back to Kinner to open for questions, please. But thank you for your time this morning.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, David. So we will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. Operator, can we open the line, please?\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Amit Goel from Barclays.\\nAmit Goel: So I guess my first question is a bit more broad. But I mean, I guess, Thomas and David, both of you have been at the group for over 20 years now. And I'm just trying to understand essentially how -- in your view, how the group has got to a position where in 2021, we're having a debate where the group is looking to cut back on risk within the prime business. And there are questions about the future of the Asset Management business. So just trying to understand from your perspective how we've arrived at this point. And then secondly, on a go-forward basis, how do you think about the road map in terms of rebuilding investor and other stakeholder confidence and trust in the group? So just to get your sense on how you see that path in the coming periods.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Amit. Look, Generally, the prime services business in the past didn't have any losses. Clearly, this loss came as a big surprise to us. And we are taking measures that this will not reoccur. We are reducing our exposure in that business, and we are doing an investigation how it exactly happened and make sure it will not happen again. Asset Management, we had, again, the situation around Greensill. But the overall Asset Management business, as we saw also today, is actually doing very well from operational perspective. The same is true for the Investment Bank. So clearly, the 2 incidents are unacceptable. But at the same time, we have to move forward. We have to look forward. And the fact is that we can build on a very strong operational performance in Q1. We have taken the measure with the mandatory convertible to strengthen our balance sheet. We want to take any discussion on capital off the table. On a pro forma basis, we are back at 13%, higher than we were at the end of the year last year. And this was really the basis now for us to look forward and to move forward and to be back in business. So that was really the key. And in terms of overall road map, as I just said, we have to look forward now. Clearly, we have an incoming Chairman who will come in on the 1st of May. Together with the Board of Directors and the entire ExB management team, we will sit down, we will review everything. We have to do that after what happened in the first quarter. But at the same time, I'm a fundamental believer that the overall strategy of Credit Suisse is sound. And again, as we could prove in the first quarter with outperformance in almost every business. So this is the moment now to look forward.\\nAmit Goel: Okay. And just if I can have just one follow-up. And just also it would be good to get an understanding in terms of the FINMA enforcement proceedings and just basically wondering what the potential consequences are from that. And also what are the kind of regulatory and legal risks that could be related to the recent issues?\\nThomas Gottstein: Well, clearly, after the two incidents were reported by us was -- we were -- already before that. But from that moment in very close contact with the regulators generally and with FINMA. And it was very clear from the outset that there will be two enforcement necessary with external auditors involved on behalf of FINMA. And we're looking forward now to working through them through both situations and take the right conclusions. So this is going to be a collaborative work with FINMA together also with the internal investigation, which has been put in place by our Board of Directors.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.\\nBenjamin Goy: One question on the Investment Bank. Should we think the capital commitment has a hard cap now? So effectively, passive shrinking in group context until a further review under the new Chairman, as you suggested, potentially? And then secondly, on Asset Management, you say it's strategic. I think in December, you mentioned the cross-selling in particular works with traditional products, but not so far with alternatives. Maybe you can give an update on the opportunities to see or potential reluctance by relationship managers given reputational issues here?\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. On the IB side, as David mentioned, we are planning to reduce our leverage exposure by $35 billion. Most, if not all of that, will come from the prime services side. And we will also reduce our RWAs to the level we were at, at the end of last year. And we will further calibrate and refine these over the next few weeks and months, together with Christian Meissner and the management team. There are certainly areas where we continue to want to be very proactive and have strong market positions, such as leverage finance, where we've had a very strong first quarter. But at the same time, we want to be very disciplined and want to really now manage that business accordingly. On the Asset Management, together with Ulrich Körner, we are also reviewing the areas where we want to have to emphasize going forward. Clearly, we are now still very much focused on maximizing the cash returns on the supply chain finance fund situation. But at the same time, we have some very strong businesses in Asset Management, as you could also see with the net new asset inflows we had in the first quarter. And together with Uli and the rest of the team, we are reviewing all of those opportunities.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citigroup.\\nAndrew Coombs: Three questions for me, please. Firstly, just to clarify on capital and FINMA enforcement actions. They talk about capital surcharges in their press release today. Can you confirm, does that just the 25 basis points that you referred to on Slide 22? Or do you expect further capital surcharges to come? And attached to that, I see that you mentioned 30 to 35 basis points on operational risk models. But the footnote suggests that's just for mortgage-related matters in the fourth quarter. So any thoughts on operational risk inflation going forward? That's the first question. Second question on the prime services review and the $35 billion leverage exposure reduction. Could you provide us an idea of both the direct revenue attrition attached to that but also the indirect revenue attrition? As one would assume, that shrinking in prime will also weigh in directly on cash and derivatives as well in your equities franchise. And then thirdly, on a more positive note, you've obviously had a very strong quarter on SPAC issuance. I'm conscious that a lot of the fees there already recognized on the de-SPAC event. So could you provide us an idea that if, for example, 100% of those SPACs were to de-SPAC successfully over the remainder of the year, what would the pipeline of these look like?\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. Before I hand over to David, who should take lead on most of these questions, I just want to make clear on the capital that the decision to issue the mandatory convertible notes was purely taken by ourselves. There was no kind of request by FINMA. It was really David and I who came to a view we want to do this. We want to take this whole discussion off the table. We made the recommendation to the Board. The Board supported us. And then we went ahead with that placement. So there was no request by FINMA in any shape or form. But with this, I would like to hand over to David to go through your 3 questions.\\nDavid Mathers: No. I'd just second what Thomas said. I think we previously guided to a minimum of 12.5%. I think we really wanted to take the capital question off the table. So I think getting to an implied number of 13% with -- including the Allfunds credit, I think it was a very important thing. It also boosts our leverage ratio to 4% too. And as Thomas said, that was very much our decision. We discussed it with the Board, and we executed against that. And we're obviously very grateful for the support of both our existing and new shareholders in this. Just in terms of your detailed questions then. So there were 2 FINMA-related capital add-ons, one which I actually mentioned in our annual report, which is a Pillar 2 add-on of CHF2 billion. And that basically increases the minimum requirement from 10% to, I guess, 10.6%. That is in respect of the Greensill supply chains funds matter. The second is the one we actually show on the capital walk slide, which is the add-on, which is proportionate to the size of the residual positions that we hold in respect of -- on behalf of the U.S. hedge fund. And as those now declined towards 0, we've shifted obviously -- just over 97% of them. That buffer actually reduces proportionate to that. I think in terms of operational risk, You're correct. The op risk charge that I'm alluding to in the capital walk is in respect primarily the RMBS matters when we took -- the charge we took in the fourth quarter of last year. That's going through the process at this point. The number is not yet final, but I wanted just to remind you that we will have that impact in the second quarter. Yes, I clearly can't preclude any other add-ons. I think it would be wrong for me to do so. This is, though, a credit risk event regarding U.S. hedge fund, not an unauthorized trading issue. So it's not strictly speaking op risk point. But at this point, that's all I would want to say at this time. So I think those were your 2 questions in terms of capital. By the way, I just should note and you may have seen it in the press release that we have announced the settlement of the single largest RMBS case today. That's the so-called Euphrates Case for USD 500 million. That's exactly in line with the provision that we took in the fourth quarter. So there's no incremental charge in respect of either the first quarter or the second quarter of that. I think we're pleased to have resolved a matter which I guess must be now about 15 years old. Now moving on to your second question, which was around prime. I think I'm helpful and unhelpful, I think, if I'm being honest. Just to give you some idea, that $35 billion leverage reduction is about 1/3 of the total leverage we have deployed in prime. And I would expect clearly our prime revenues to fall as a consequence of that. But I think in terms of the actual revenue impact, quite clearly, we will be focusing our prime business around clients that have multiple connectivity to Credit Suisse, i.e., important across our businesses and obviously defocusing on clients that have much less connection across the banks. So one would clearly expect we'll be, at that point, reducing the lowest ROA businesses, but it does move prime to being more of a utility to actually support the overall bank as opposed to a stand-alone business model, which I think is the right way to go. But yes, we will see some revenue reduction. It's going to be difficult to estimate it given those 2 constraining factors. And that will obviously come through as a reduction in our equity sales and trading revenues going forward. In terms of SPAC number, I might have to ask Kinner to help me in terms of outstanding balance. But I think just to put the numbers in context, there was about CHF280 million of SPAC revenues out of the CHF1.4 billion of Investment Banking, capital markets and advisory numbers. Actually, I don't think we've given the de-SPAC before, so I'm not going to give it now basically. But as you rightly say, Andrew, we recognized just under half of SPAC revenues on issuance and the other half is dependent on the successful conversion or de-SPAC-ing of the entity normally within the 2 years following issuance. But yes, I'm not going to give the actual pipeline now. But what is clear is that more than half of the issuance revenues are still waiting there, subject to the appropriate due diligence and completion of the de-SPAC-ing, which may not always occur in the case of all of the SPACs, just to be clear.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from Exane.\\nJeremy Sigee: Apologies for focusing on the painful bits, but I still think there's more clarification that we need. I wanted to just ask 2 things. One is on Greensill. Can you -- you've got about $5 billion cash but also about $5 billion remaining exposure in those funds. And I just wondered if you could put a number on how much of that $5 billion remaining exposure is to doubtful borrowers, including obviously, Gupta, but also some of the other doubtful borrowers who seem reluctant to pay? So that's my first question. And my second question is on the other painful episode, I'm afraid, on the Archegos situation. Could you walk us through the mechanics of how that loss came about in terms of what the outstanding gross exposure was at the moment of problem? How much margin you had? And the sequence of events in terms of where you slowed to sell down? Or how do you assess what happened? Those are my 2 questions, please.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. So I will take the lead on Greensill. So the CHF5.4 billion you mentioned, and we have very good visibility, I would say, on up to CHF7.5 billion. And then the rest, as we announced a couple of days ago, roughly CHF2.3 billion relates to 3 distinct situations where we have very strong legal positions. We also have discussions with insurance coverage around these situations. And these will take several weeks, if not months and quarters to resolve. But this is something that we are working through. This is our asset management team that is working with advisers, with the advisers also to Greensill and to the underlying companies. We have constructive discussions there. And it's simply premature now to make any estimates what the ultimate outcome will be, but we have very constructive discussions. And this is the -- under the lead of Credit Suisse Asset Management.  On Archegos, look, as you know, that this was a very special situation around the family office that was covered not only by us, but also 5, 6 other brokers out of Prime Services with a lack of disclosure, which I think also regulators now are looking into that had explosive growth over the last 12 months. And we are not commenting on detailed exposures, but we clearly had issues there that we are now looking into as part of our investigation around the absolute limits around the margining, around Delta One and the situation around the underlying concentration risks. So this is something we're all looking into and ensure that this cannot and must not ever be repeated. But it's too premature now to go into more details.  I'm very satisfied that we have essentially gone out of the exposures now. We have, as we said, reduced the exposures by over 97% to a very moderate number now, which we are managing through for the coming weeks with the clear intention that we'll get as quickly as possible to a 0 level.  Anything you wanted to add, David?\\nDavid Mathers: No. I think I'll just make a couple of points really. I mean, firstly, I think I would just refute the suggestion that we were slow to sell down. We reduced our position in a lawful and orderly manner, I think with respect to the challenges we actually faced. And I think as far as I can tell, in terms of looking at the prices we achieved compared to the other prime brokers, the exit prices were broadly similar over the period of time. That's the point I'd make first.  I think the second point I'd make is, it is an exceptional event. I think the last time the industry has seen anything like this was LTCM in terms of its size and consequence, it's an industry-wide issue. But that said, I think, as Thomas has summarized, we've obviously conducted an immediate read across to anything similar, any other immediate lessons learned to ensure that, that is not the case within the rest of our prime portfolio. And we're obviously very focused on the investigation review that the Board of Directors is leading in terms of the longer-term lessons to be learned around this particular position.  But as Thomas said, clearly, this is likely to be a broader industry issue as well, given the number of other prime brokers involved and some of the disclosure requirements relating to these types of funds.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: I've got two questions. I'm going to have to return to the Archegos kind of issue as well, but more top-down. Because, of course, you have described what you've done so far, you've described today, the Board investigation. But kind of when you look back and that's particularly at the risk framework, the decision-making, the communication between executives, are there any kind of early learnings that -- or any kind of additional color that you can share with us to kind of to make the understanding of the situation, and is more helpful not only for yourself, but of course, as you said, on an industry level as well?  And my second question within that is that, how do you see this particular credit event? Is it isolated? We've talked about kind of your review of Prime Brokerage. But within the broader risk management at the IB level, are there any other businesses that you would be reviewing as well as a part of a kind of broader potential rethink of the business? So that's question #1.  And question #2 really is about IWM and the revenue trajectory there. Because, of course, we have seen very, very strong kind of net new money numbers. But of course, when we look at the kind of underlying revenues, we're of course seeing kind of weakness in NII, but also on the kind of transactional and recurring fees are kind of broadly flat. How should we -- and I know that there's a question about mix, there's a question about effects within the numbers, too. But going forward, how should we kind of think about that revenue trajectory within that part of your wealth business?\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. I will take the first one and then maybe, David, you can take the second one. So on Archegos early learnings, clearly, one of the early learnings is that the disclosure has to be improved around especially family offices in that business. Secondly, I think we have to look at absolute limits much more carefully, about margin limits, about how we look at Delta One and correlation between short and long positions and we have to look at concentration risk management. So these are all elements that we are extremely focused and on which basis we have done the first analysis of the entire book. But there will certainly be more learnings to come through as we go through the next few weeks in terms of the review that we are doing internally, but also that will be done as part of our excellent review with our regulators.  Is it an isolated case? Look, I definitely hope it is, and I think it is. But we are obviously reviewing the entire bank now just to make sure that our risk processes and systems are where they should be. And clearly, the -- historically, the prime business has not been subject to major losses, and that is now our prime focus. But we are, together with Christian Meissner, the first line of defense, but also the second line of defense, our Risk -- new Chief Risk Officer and the Head of Risk for the Investment Bank, doing a special effort now to review the entire division.  David, would you like to cover the IWM revenues?\\nDavid Mathers: Sure, of course. Magdalena, I think a few points to make really. I mean, firstly, as you know, the primary currency in terms of which IWM operates the largest single one is actually -- in revenue terms is actually the U.S. dollar. And if you look back to the first quarter of last year, beginning of the COVID crisis, you saw the dollar trading substantially stronger against the Swiss franc, which we report in compared to where it actually is now basically.  So what you're seeing is twofold. Firstly, the adverse impact on translation of those dollar revenues into Swiss francs. And then secondly, because of the importance of the dollar to IWM, you've obviously seen a very sharp reduction in U.S. dollar interest rates, which were at a peak a year ago. So that translates through into lower net interest income.  Now the point we've made before, though is sequentially, that is stabilizing. And even before the slight appreciation we see in the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc in the last 4 months, and some pickup, but limited in terms of longer-term U.S. dollar interest rates. So that's the point I made to start off with.  And clearly, in terms of recurring revenues, you see the same trends. Now generally speaking, transaction revenues across the whole Wealth Management business were substantially up compared to last year. They're down in IWM partly for the currency effect, but also because the first quarter of last year was extremely strong for IWM. And I think I'd just refer you, Magdalena, to Pages 38 and 39 within the presentation. What you see there basically is the gross margin trends within IWM PB. You can see it was a high of 114 basis points in the first quarter of last year, a low of 95, 96 and 97 in the second half of last year, now ticking up to 99. And in net terms with some of the cost measures, obviously, it was 37, down to 23, back up to 37 in terms of that.  I think the second point I'd actually make is actually on the following slide, Slide 39. And you can see that the growth in client business volume, which I think shows the expansion, both in terms of assets under management, but also in terms of net lending activity in IWM, which I think does support what we're seeing in terms of the sequential improvements in terms of that business. But transactions in IWM were particularly high in the first quarter a year ago, Magdalena.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher from UBS.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: I have a follow-on question on Slide 22 and then one on the FINMA press release from this morning. I mean in that press release, they talk about a reduction or suspension of variable remuneration. Now how should we think about this? Is this a temporary thing, probably just for a few quarters? And is there a potential for a catch-up later in the year? How do you look at this statement and what's your optionality there?  And then just on Slide 22, again, sorry, probably in connection with Page 11 of the earnings release. I mean in the earnings release, you talk about potential additional capital and related actions, including an add-on to RWA and OpRisk Pillar 2 add-on, et cetera. So would that be potentially on top of the CHF6 billion and CHF1.9 billion you mentioned? And would this be included in the waterfall chart on Slide 22?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Daniele. So I'll take the first one and then David can take the second one. So on variable compensation, yes, we have been in constant dialogue with FINMA. We, that is obviously the Board but also myself on this topic. And we have taken some decisions, both on the Executive Board level, but also on the overall comp pool as we have done for the first quarter. And that dialogue will continue over the next few weeks. So this has been a very constructive discussion with FINMA. And there's not really more I can say at this stage. Clearly, they have taken a positive note, not only from the mandatory convertible, but also the operating performance. And we will -- even in the absence of FINMA, obviously, take all compensation-related decisions in relation to the future performance of the various businesses. On RWA, I hand over to you, David.\\nDavid Mathers: Sure. Yes. I think just to summarize, basically, if you look at page -- as you say, Page 11 of the earnings release and then the capital walk on Slide 22. So in essence, as I said already, there was a USD 2 billion Pillar 2 add-on in respect to Greensill operational risk basically which was imposed by FINMA in March. And I think we -- and as I said, we disclosed it in our annual report. There's then this add-on in respect of the U.S. hedge fund positions which is a proportion of that, which I've actually included on Slide 22. And then as you say, basically, I've made it clear that the operational risk number, which I've included towards the right-hand side, that is primarily in respect of the RMBS matter. It's not in respect of anything else at this point. There are certain other methodology changes I put in there as a sort of precautionary matter in terms of that. But I've not included an operational risk charge in respect of either.  But I think in terms of -- I think it's difficult to truly speculate on this because this is clearly sort of a developing matter, and we'll see how this changes over time. But I mean, quite clearly, because Credit Suisse itself has not suffered a loss, operational or otherwise, in respect of Greensill apart from the CHF30 million impairment of the fair value loan, so there's no basis for an operational risk charge to Pillar 1 pending such a loss.  I think in terms of the U.S.-based matter, as I said, this is a credit charge. It's not an operational risk failure. But I think quite rightly on Page 11, it's a risk factor. I can't preclude that as the -- both the Board investigation and as the FINMA investigation projections, we don't have some kind of add-on in future. But I'm not aware of such an add-on at this point, and it's impossible to estimate what that would be basically. So -- but I think it is appropriate we disclose it, Daniele, in the risk factors.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: No, that's super helpful. Is it fair to conclude that this is probably why you want to have a 13% CET1 ratio target to which you should capture some of these uncertainties as well?\\nDavid Mathers: Actually, not really, actually. I mean I think there were 3 reasons why we wanted to have a 13% ratio and to actually reach it quickly with the issuance of the mandatory. I think, first, I think there's been obviously an extensive amount of media coverage about Credit Suisse. People have raised questions around the capital ratio, particularly before we put out the release at the beginning of April. And I think that's unhelpful. I've been here before. And I think, particularly unhelpful to our Wealth Management business. And I think taking it off the table is exactly the right thing to do in terms of the sort of capital security of the bank.  And I think that's true both for the CET1 ratio, but also the CET1 leverage ratio because, as you know, Switzerland has a relatively high floor in terms of the leverage ratio requirements.  I think the second point basically is, I think that whilst we are reducing capital in the investment bank, I think given the momentum we've seen in the Wealth Management businesses, I think allowing that growth to continue in a prudent and disciplined fashion I think is the right thing to do. And I think if we hadn't raised the mandatory and had a 13% goal, then I think that could have imposed undue restraints in terms of that.  And thirdly, and I just would caution this is more of a sort of personal view, I think there's a lot of volatility in these markets. And I'd rather basically operate with the bank at a 13% ratio, and that was a discussion we had at ExB and recommended to the Board, and the Board supported that. And I think that's the prudent thing to do in respect of 2021. Clearly, to your point, yes, I guess it does provide a buffer against that type of circumstance, too, but that wasn't our primary reason.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\\nKian Abouhossein: Thomas, thank you very much for your openness and humility in this respect to the matters that clearly are of concern to shareholders. I have 3 questions. The first one is strategy. You say the strategy is sound. And if I look at your investment bank, over 5, 10, 20 years, 30 years, you do not make cost of equity returns, even taking out what we could call specific issues such as we see now with Archegos. So really shouldn't there be a discussion around, do we really need an investment bank of this size rather than cutting at the edges of the PB business which makes you even more subscale than you are already against the top 3 competitors in PB? The second question is related to, if I can come back to risk. Where are you on reviewing the total risk book of the firm of the group? And in that context, when are we going to expect a new Head of Compliance and Risk Officer, I assume there will be two separate positions, if you can confirm that, and will that be coming from the outside?  And the last question is on net new money flows in the second quarter. Can you give us some subjective impressions how that is going, both on Wealth Management, IWM clearly as well and Asset Management?\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay, Kian. Well, you said yourself that if you exclude Archegos, then we are not earning our cost of capital in the IB. I mean, if I look since we have put the IB together in the second half last year and in the first quarter, I would disagree. But clearly, we cannot...\\nKian Abouhossein: Thomas, sorry, apologies to interrupt. But I said over 5, 10, 20 years. Clearly, everybody is making a killing in credit, so are you. But if I just look longer term, just to clarify my question, longer term, you don't make cost of equity. I mean you had a good few quarters, I admit.\\nThomas Gottstein: Well, we did a comprehensive risk reduction in the years '15, '16, '17, where we reduced significantly our leverage and RWA exposures, exited a large part of macro and really reduced our footprint in the investment bank to make it more profitable, which is what we did. And that clearly addressed some of the issues, the structural issues we had.  Now look, the IB overall size as well as look is now clearly addressed in a second step now, primarily now with focus on Prime Services. And it's something that after an event like this, it's understandable that you asked that question. But we have some tremendous franchises in capital markets, in M&A, in SP, just to name a few. And as you can see also in some of the charts that I showed, we've had significant market gain -- market share gains in various areas.  So -- but this is clearly also something we are now going to discuss with Christian, with Antonio when he's on Board, and we'll have a further review. So this is certainly something that will continue to be discussed also internally. But we have definitely made a lot of progress in the business.  And as the first quarter numbers have shown, we were really on the right track. With 80% revenue growth, I think we have pretty much outperformed everybody else in the first quarter. So to say that everything is broken on the IB, which I kind of imply from your question, is a bit unfair, I think, against this background.  With respect to risk and compliance search, we have started that search. We have obviously very strong hands on the table now with Jo Oechslin and Thomas Grotzer. Jo Oechslin very clearly said, this is something he's prepared to do, but only on an interim basis, and he's very experienced, and he has already had very positive impact on the business. But we will now move forward with that search. We have not decided yet whether risk and compliance should be 1 or 2 functions. This will be also part of the outcome of the search. As you -- if you look at the top -- the largest 10 banks, maybe the largest 6 banks in the U.S. and the 4 -- largest 4 banks in Europe away from us, you can see that about 50% have risk and compliance together, and the other 50% have it separate.  We discussed it at the time with the regulator, with the Board. We have clearly some very good reasons to keep it together, including technology and other areas, anything that has to do with nonfinancial risk. So -- but there are also -- clearly now there was a need given the short-term nature of the need to have a comprehensive review across our group on all the risk positions that we wanted to keep it separate for the time being as far as the leadership is concerned with Jo and Thomas. But we kept certain areas together like technology for the 2 functions, that continues to be one team, and they're supporting both sides. And we will take a decision on that together with the Board of Directors over the coming weeks and months as we go through the search.  In terms of NNA, look, it's early days in the first quarter, but there have not been major flows in either direction. So it's too early to comment on NNA at this stage.\\nKian Abouhossein: And may I just ask -- sorry, just one more on the risk. Are you doing a review of all divisions, all exposures? Or is it specific to the areas where we have had issues? Or is it also other areas like lombard lending, et cetera?\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. We are doing a comprehensive review. Obviously, that's something that we owe to ourselves and to our stakeholders that we -- after such a shock loss that we had, we have to review that in detail.\\nKian Abouhossein: Thank you, Thomas, for your openness.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alastair Ryan, Bank of America.\\nAlastair Ryan: Just cost in, please. So you had about CHF2.5 billion year-over-year revenue improvement in Q1. Historically, you've had a marginal cost-to-income ratio in good times of 50-ish . So there's probably CHF1.2 billion of costs that didn't get accrued for the reasons we discussed. Could you just discuss whether there's any potential overhang in the rest of the year, i.e., CIB does perform well. There needs to be a catch-up in costs because presumably there's quite a relevant differential between what you're accruing for some of your high performers and what competitors may be doing. So there's a strain for later in the year as a result of the discipline you've shown in Q1, I guess, is the question, please.\\nDavid Mathers: Alastair, I'll take the question. So firstly, I think, as I said in my presentation, you can see in the compensation and benefits line, it was about CHF109 million lower this year than it was actually last year. And that was primarily almost entirely due to reductions in variable compensation. So that gives you one measure. Now if we're stepping back and saying, given the improvement in revenues that we actually saw in the first quarter ex the U.S. hedge fund issue, would comp and benefits have been higher than last year, the answer is, yes, they would. But they wouldn't be higher anything like the amount you've actually said.  I think I step back and we have obviously CHF3.6 billion of 1Q PTI, excluding the U.S. hedge fund loss. I think you could basically say there was CHF109 million contribution of variable compensation in that. You might want to add a bit more in terms of how much I might have accrued. But I have to say every which way I actually looked at the first quarter number, it comfortably exceeded CHF3 billion excluding that. And I think the number that was reported in one newspaper, I think, around a much bigger comp reduction was erroneous in terms of that.  I mean the brutal truth, Alastair, which you know better than I do, is that banking is a fixed cost business. And when you have a very strong level of revenue growth like that, you do not see that degree of marginal cost increase coming through. It's really just the variable cost line plus some BCE type costs, basically, Alastair. And so that's, I guess, point one in terms of the point there, but I would certainly strongly dissuade you from thinking about there was some number like CHF1.5 billion or whichever in terms of marginal cost that didn't flow through. That's not the case.  I think in terms of the balance this year, I think we'll obviously be conscious of the need to retain and motivate staff. I think, conscious of the need to continue to execute well in the balance of this year and to sustain this momentum. But I think it is also appropriate that if you have an issue like this, then there needs to be a prudent approach in terms of variable compensation, and that's a line that we're trying to walk between those 2 things. And that's -- I think that's all I can really say at this point, Alastair.\\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Piers Brown, HSBC.\\nPiers Brown: I've got two follow-up questions, please. First of all, on the IB deleveraging number, the CHF35 billion of LRD deleveraging. I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color on what the thought process was around that number? How you arrived at CHF35 billion? And which particular aspects of the prime business was I think you felt needed to be addressed in terms of derisking?  And the second question was just on the loan growth you've reported in the wealth business, which has obviously been extremely strong and whether that may be impacted by the risk review that you're currently undergoing?\\nDavid Mathers: Well, I think if we take the first one, I think I don't want to prejudge the work that Christian needs to looking at prime nor the work that we'll be doing together with our new Chairman in the second quarter. But I think we did want to set an initial target based on the overall book in terms of the leverage reduction, and that's what we're getting now, basically. I think that you should see that as a minimum, not a maximum basically. I think it does, as I've indicated, indicate a significant refocusing of prime away from being more of a stand-alone P&L center, albeit with a lot of connectivity elsewhere to be seen instead as a utility to actually support the rest of the businesses, which I think does mean we'll focus on clients that have the maximum connectivity to the rest of the bank as opposed to any sort of stand-alone type customers. And I think that's the right thing to do.  So I can certainly commit to at least that CHF35 billion reduction, but it may end up being more than that, Piers, as we actually look forward. I would just remind everybody that prime is a relatively low ROA business. And I think that we can actually deploy that leverage at higher returns elsewhere in the bank, and I think that's what we're going to do as well as boosting our ratio to above 4%.  And I think in terms of sort of immediate actions, I'll be candid, it's what Thomas has said already. The immediate action is to look at any time, some immediate lessons learned from the U.S. hedge fund matter and make sure that those are addressed as a priority. That may include the Delta One business, which does not come through in terms of leverage as opposed to this being primarily a leverage goal. It's a risk-reduction exercise as well as being a leverage goal. So just to be clear on that particular point.  I think the second point in terms of Wealth Management loan growth. I think we've been clear that we did see some reduction in our lending growth last year, which I think hitherto had been, I think, a steady and accretive growth for the bank over a period of about 5 or 6 years. Thomas was heavily involved in looking at that exercise with the Wealth Management business. We do have a very broad range of collateral across the Wealth Management businesses, some of which has absolutely no lending against whatsoever basically. There is client demand for that. And I think, therefore, in a disciplined and risk-controlled fashion, I think it's important to continue that lending expansion. And obviously, I think we've been generally pleased with the risk/return reward from that.  I think, yes, there'll be some pause in the growth here or some slowdown in the growth there because we are obviously looking very carefully, obviously, primarily at these -- the U.S. hedge fund and the Greensill matter. But obviously, the investigation, we will look beyond that. But I think one reason which we wanted to raise the mandatory, I think, was to ensure that we had sufficient capital to actually facilitate that in a steady, orderly and progressive fashion.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous Research.\\nStefan Stalmann: I have two questions, please. The first one, going back to Archegos. Do you think it's possible and maybe this is a bit too early to ask, but do you think it's possible that this could produce a very fundamental reset in how your IRB credit risk models work? I mean you have only CHF20 billion to CHF25 billion of counterparty credit risk-weighted assets on literally hundreds of billions of equity swaps and repos, et cetera. That's question #1.  Question number two goes back to the tax treatment of the Archegos-related loss. I'm not quite sure I understand what's happening here. It looks to me as if you have taken a tax credit of at least 30% against the loss in the first quarter. But there has been no increase in your deferred tax assets. So it seems that you're really assuming that you can fully offset this against taxable income during the rest of the year. Do you expect there to be an uptick or an increase in deferred tax assets later during the year? And is that what is reflected in your capital waterfall on Slide 22? Or is there no such issue?  And I was also wondering as an add-on, in which legal entity did you actually incur this loss, please?\\nDavid Mathers: Stefan, well, look, I think in terms of the U.S. hedge fund and counterparty credit risk exposure, I'm sure that we'll obviously be looking carefully at the capital model in respect of how we look at these types of hedge funds. But quite clearly, I think you're going to see a very substantial reduction in such Delta One type positions. And so it may become a slightly moot point, I think, Stefan, in terms of that.  I'm not sure I expect to see a broader read across in terms of this, but I'll defer that to the work that we'll do in the balance of this particular year.  I think in terms of tax treatment, it is complex. In essence, I mean just to be clear, the -- to answer your third point, the Credit Suisse International, which is the U.K. entity phased off to the U.S. hedge fund and therefore, had the credit exposure. But the risk was actually booked in a U.S. entity called BD Light in terms of the acquisition. But the client relationship was actually owned by CSI because the U.S. hedge fund dealt in both U.S. and non-U.S.-based derivatives.  Now that's relevant then to the second question really, which is in terms of the entities, you can actually offset the tax against. It clearly cannot be offset against CSAG or against Credit Suisse Schweiz or some of the other legal entities, the bank or the Hong Kong branch or anything like that. Therefore, it has to be offset against the entities that this actually relates to. And that obviously limits the tax asset that I can actually include in my balance sheet to the level I can expect to recover that over the foreseeable future, not just this year but over the longer-term future. And I don't have an expectation at this point that I'd have sufficient profitability to fully offset the tax loss that actually results from the U.S. hedge fund matter basically.  So what we're actually reflecting is the component which I actually expect to recover, not the amount. I mean to be helpful, well, sort of helpful basically, we're basically reflecting about CHF650 million of a tax credit against that sort of CHF4.4 billion. So essentially, in practical terms, it relates to just over half is something we're actually reflecting in terms of a deferred tax asset and half we're not recognizing.  So in the context of the total loss, you've got just under CHF2.5 billion of a pretax loss, which there's no tax credit. And therefore, that pushes up the effective tax rate for the year and for the first quarter. Is that helpful, Stefan? Sorry, it's not a trivial matter.\\nStefan Stalmann: Yes, I think it does help. Just for clarification, so there has been no increase in deferred tax assets related to this during the first quarter, right?\\nDavid Mathers: I think that's a tricky question because there's also FX moves in this. I'd have to come back to in terms of that one, Stefan.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen from Royal Bank of Canada.\\nAnke Reingen: My two more like follow-up questions. Firstly is just on the strategy again. Obviously, at the very detailed presentation in December last year and probably you were talking about the 10% to 12% and the investing for growth. Should we assume -- I mean, BARDA's facts the strategy stands that 10% to 12% [indiscernible] Or should we expect, as you indicated post the Investment Banking review and the new Chairman arriving that we will get a new strategic update?  And then secondly, just a follow-up question to Kian's point. I didn't quite hear your answer on the net new money, were you saying it's too early to comment? I just thought it was quite interesting, given that you said, yes, raising the convertible was also related to avoiding a negative impact on your Wealth Management business.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. Look, the midterm 10% to 12% target has to be and continues to be our goal to achieve return on equity above our cost of equity, and that has to be our goal. So we will obviously calibrate this in more detail over the coming weeks and months and also we'll have strategic discussions with no, as we say in German, sacred cows. But this has to be our goal to maximize return on equity and continue to achieve a double-digit return on capital in the midterm.  On NNA, so first of all, too early to say, but there have not been major flows in either direction in the first few weeks in the second quarter.  And your question relating to capital. Again, as I think David said, there were really 3 reasons why we wanted to do this. First of all, we really want to take the whole capital debate off the table and really ensure that this is not a topic anymore, either internally or external clients or with clients or regulators. Secondly, we want to make sure that if there is a market downturn, that we have enough capital from a more defensive perspective. And the third is also to have enough capital to grow, especially in Switzerland, in IWM and in Asia. And those are the reasons why we did this.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim, Societe Generale.\\nAndrew Lim: And [indiscernible] on being proactive or [indiscernible] on the capital front. I guess one element that arguably is missing from the capital waterfall you've outlined is potential losses from Greensill. I know ultimately, we don't know what these could be. But at the same time, there's rumors doing the rounds about whether you will or will not compensate investors for losses. So I just wanted to see if you could set the record straight as to your strategy here, whether you will compensate investors or whether as institutional investors, they should wear all of these losses?  And then the other question I had was regarding your statement on Credit Suisse Asset Management. I guess maybe it's a bit surprising, you're saying perhaps quite early on that you don't consider a sale of the business here despite [indiscernible] out. I was wondering why you're so keen to say such a statement there and whether you would, in any case, consider a merger of any sort or consider a reduction in your controlling stake there?\\nThomas Gottstein: So again on Greensill, we are focused on getting the cash back to our investors. That's our only focus right now, and we know this will take months and several quarters to go through, especially with respect to the 3 distinct situations. We've had a very good progress so far in terms of getting the cash back for all the others and have good visibility for a meaningful part. But through -- the 3 distinct situations that we have mentioned before are clearly going to take several months and quarters before we have clarity there. And therefore, there is absolutely no possibility at this stage to make any more comments on that.  Secondly, on CSAM, as I also said before, I always felt this should be its own division. And the issue around Greensill has accelerated that move and we created its own division and the leadership now of Ulrich Körner, as you could see from the first quarter, this business is actually doing very well with high returns. This is an important business for us. I believe very strongly that a global wealth manager needs to have strong asset management capabilities. So this is strategically important.  Having said that, we also had a very convoluted -- or still have legal entity structure around this, which is why we started the project already last fall to have a more streamlined legal entity structure around asset management. But structure follows strategy. And therefore, this is something that will take also a couple of quarters until we have that legal entity structure properly lined up.  As with other topics, be it IB, be it other areas of the bank, we will always have annual reviews, and this will -- strategic reviews, I mean, on the group level. And as soon as Antonio is on Board and we have the full Board of Directors and management team coming together, we will also look at the Asset Management business like we look at all the other businesses.\\nAndrew Lim: And just on that point, do you have a date in mind of when Antonio joins when you'll come back to the market with a strategic view?\\nThomas Gottstein: I'm not giving any -- I'm not going to give any dates on this. No.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Terelak from Mediobanca.\\nAdam Terelak: I have two, please. First is on the strategic review. Obviously, you haven't got into that yet. But will that be in discussion with the regulator and will they have an input into the future shape of the business and whether they might be able to regulate you out of certain areas that you clearly had difficulties in the past?  And then secondly is a technical one on the cap of RWA for the investment bank. Clearly, that's a step down from where you finished the quarter. I presume the CHF6 billion of RWA on Archegos is stacked in there, so we need to strip that out. But will the RMBS OpRisk inflation be in the IB? And is there any risk that you see further regulatory pressure there that actually means that cap means quite a bit of deleveraging on an RWA basis going forward?\\nThomas Gottstein: The strategy is the responsibility of the Board on the Swiss law and the management and not of the regulator. So that's the answer to the first question.  Maybe, David, do you want to take the second question?\\nDavid Mathers: Sure. Just in terms of the RWA targets, So to be clear, when I talk about reducing RWA for the Investment Bank, that is in addition to the runoff of the U.S. hedge fund buffer of CHF6.25 billion, basically. So it's -- because the FINMA Pillar 1 buffer in respect of positions obviously naturally expires as the size of the positions actually reduce. So I'm referring about a number in addition to that.  I think in terms of the OpRisk add-on, we normally split it between the IB and the Corporate Center. I've not basically really considered yet how that will be finalized basically itself in the second quarter. So I'm really thinking underlying in terms of that. So net back to where it was at the end of last year, plus the runoff of the U.S. hedge fund position basically. If that's helpful, Andrew -- Adam.\\nAdam Terelak: So are there any OpRisk charges even if it's for IB specific will be shared across the bank?\\nDavid Mathers: No, no, no. We normally split them between the division and the corporate center, but we've not yet finalized the OpRisk add-on in terms of RMBS. So it's difficult to be precise at this point. But I'm really talking about an underlying business reduction in the IB in addition to the OpRisk issue and separate to the runoff of the U.S. hedge fund numbers. So a sort of like-for-like reduction back to the level at the end of last year.\\nAdam Terelak: Okay. So a moving point on anything that we don't know yet, which you can't bring up?\\nDavid Mathers: Correct, yes. I'm not planning -- I'm not intending -- you shouldn't assume that the runoff of the Pillar 1 add-on in respect to [indiscernible] meets that demand. No, it's in addition to that.\\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jernej Omahen, Goldman Sachs.\\nJernej Omahen: Can you hear me well?\\nThomas Gottstein: Just about, yes.\\nJernej Omahen: Yes, you can?\\nDavid Mathers: That's much better, Jernej, actually. I think you're closer to the mic.\\nJernej Omahen: Okay. Correct. Let's make sure. Thanks for this comprehensive call. I have a couple of questions left, but they're all reasonably brief. On Archegos, I don't think I was surprised by anything that you've said so far, apart from one thing. And I just want to make sure I got that right.  David, you received the question before, about the pace of the liquidation of collateral or positions. And I wrote down the response here saying that Credit Suisse achieved broadly the same prices as other prime brokers. And I wanted to make sure that, a, I got that right. And a, that the underlying implication of that is that the entirety of the CHF5 billion loss is due to poor collateral or poor margin management basically. And I think -- so a, is that accurate? b, is it true to say that the loss is entirely down to having held less margin than your peers?  And then the second question I want to ask you here. On the pace of the exit, on the one hand, you say that the pace of the exit isn't that different from everybody else. On the other hand, you say we still have 3% of our notional exposure that's outstanding. And I was wondering what is that 3%? I mean it's a month after the event. I guess, the reasonable expectation would be that at this point, you'd exited everything.  And the second question I have is on Greensill. And I'm just trying to understand this from the perspective, not of Credit Suisse, but of a client who invested in this product. So if I get this correctly, so if I'm a client and I bought 100 of Greensill, at this point, I've got 0.48 on the dollar back in cash. And I've got 0.52 on the dollar left in the residual exposure. Thomas, if I understood you correctly, Credit Suisse does not plan to step in and compensate clients at this point. I was just wondering, I mean, is there any other outcome here than to say, well, there's going to be extensive litigation, and we're going to be analyzing this for the next 2, 3 years as it runs through the court process?  And then two very brief numbers questions. Number one, David, on RWAs for the IB. If there is incremental RWA inflation from here due to regulatory intervention, does the point of RWAs will not exceed 4Q '20 levels still stand or could it be adjusted upwards?  And the second question, again, just a numbers question. On the capital issuance, what determined the size of the issue? Is it fair to say that you've maxed out on what was preapproved at the AGM and that any incremental issue from here would require AGM approval?\\nDavid Mathers: Well perhaps come as precise, I start basically on the first point around the U.S. hedge fund loss. Let me just sort of summarize what I said before, which is in the analysis of the position sales that Credit Suisse has completed on behalf of this U.S. hedge fund, if we look at the prices that we've achieved over the course of the last month as we've exited them, if we had executed those trades as certain prime brokers did in the first couple of days of this transaction, then I think the loss would have only been marginally higher than what we're incurring here basically. And that assumes basically that if Credit Suisse had acted in the -- to the volume we had in those first two days that any of the prime brokers would have been able to get out of those prices basically. So that's what I'm saying.  But you can't go from that only to your point, you're making around margining. Because although it's clear -- it would seem to be clear that the U.S. hedge fund had a number of concentrated similar positions across -- it would seem to be maybe as many as 8 prime brokers. It doesn't necessarily mean that they have the same proportions of that. So our loss could also reflect a different waiting a number in terms of position sizes to that owned by other houses. So there's more than 1 factor to actually complete that mathematic, so you can't make that direct link. Although clearly, the level of margining and collateral will be very much in scope for the review that the Board is conducting into the U.S. hedge fund matter, and it's clearly a risk factor in terms of this, but it's not a direct deduction from what you said. So that's the -- that would be my first point in terms of the U.S. hedge fund point.  Should I keep going on the other RWA points basically?\\nThomas Gottstein: And then I'll take Greensill, yes?\\nDavid Mathers: Yes. That sounds fine. I think your next -- well, I think question 4 was really around RWA for the Investment Bank. Look, I think we are announcing today both a constraint in terms of the IB RWA back to the end of last year as a minimum and an absolute $35 billion reduction in the amount of leverage doing. I think that's appropriate. It fits into our plans to downsize the prime and prime financing businesses. And I think that's the right thing to do and something that I'm very supportive of. I think in terms of any longer-term caps for the investment bank, I think that prejudges the review that the management will be doing. So Christian, Thomas, I, and also the work that we'll be doing with our new Chairman and the Board over the coming months, and we'll get back to you at that point. But I don't think it's really appropriate that I should bind or prejudge the Board in that decision until we've actually completed that work basically. So we'll get back to you in due course, Jernej, I think, so that's fine. Your fifth question, I think, was around the capital increase. I think to be clear, I think getting to 13%, including the mandatory on a converted basis and including the capital gain that we'll realize from the IPO today of all funds, I think, is the right level of capital for the bank to actually operate it. And I think to have a leverage ratio at least 4%, I think, is also a good thing given the calibration in Switzerland of the regime here.  I don't think necessarily that we like issuing capital at this price, and I think it needs to be done in a prudent and conservative manner. And that was something we did discuss with major shareholders going into this particular exercise. And I would say there was excess demand for this. But I'm not sure, personally, I say we would want to have issued more. But in any event, as you know, Jernej, that also matched where we were in terms of our authorized capital and in terms of our mandatory. But there was another motion to the AGM which we've now withdrawn, which would have allowed for more basically. So there was always options there. I think bottom line, I think it was the right thing to do in roughly the right size. And I think it was important it was executed quickly to take this question off the table as we've said already.\\nThomas Gottstein: And on Greensill, as I said, we are now at 54% cash. We are working through the remainder of the book. And we have very good visibility to about 3/4 of the book. And then the other 23% is related to the 3 distinct cases where we have very strong legal positions, and there is substance behind it. There is discussions on -- through our Credit Suisse Asset Management with the various parties. And that is just going to be a long process. But we are moving in the right direction there. So we are talking to our clients if they have any liquidity issues, we will help them. But they understand that this is a long process. And at the end of the day, I'm actually convinced that we will get back much more than many people think. So -- but it will take a long time. And that's something we are discussing with our clients, and they are very constructive in that sense.\\nKinner Lakhani: We are out of time, actually. So if I may, thank you all for all your questions. And of course, if you do have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to call the IR team. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you.\\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call for analysts and investors. A recording of the presentation will be available about 2 hours after the event.

Please go ahead, Kinner.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': \"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion, we refer you to the Credit Suisse first quarter 2021 earnings release published this morning. Let me remind you that our first quarter 2021 financial report and accompanying financial statements for the period will be published on or around May 6. I'll now hand over to our Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Kinner. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss our first quarter 2021 results. Let me begin with some comments about recent events. The significant loss in our prime services business relating to the failure of a U.S.-based hedge fund is unacceptable. In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders. Accountability is one of the core pillars of our corporate values. Together with the Board of Directors, we are addressing these situations through a series of decisive actions in the business and through 2 independent and thorough investigations, which are already underway. The investigations will not only focus on the direct issues but also broader consequences and lessons learned across the bank. We will work to ensure Credit Suisse emerges stronger. Today, we successfully placed a mandatory convertible notes offering, and I will go into greater detail shortly. This will enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and support the momentum in our core franchises. Credit Suisse remains a formidable institution with a rich history. We have thrived for more than 160 years through external crisis and our own challenges. I'm confident for the future. At the heart of this confidence is the earnings power of Credit Suisse and the resilience and dedication of our roughly 49,000 employees around the world. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees globally for their unwavering commitment to Credit Suisse and to our clients, which they have been demonstrating not only over the past few years, but particularly during the last few weeks, which were very challenging. They make me proud every day. In testament to their perseverance and adaptability, our underlying first quarter financial performance across all divisions was not only resilient but also strong. It was supported by solid results in Switzerland and very strong growth in APAC, strong growth in Investment Banking as well as Asset Management. Net new assets for the group increased strongly in the first quarter, and group assets under management grew to CHF1.6 trillion at the end of the first quarter. With that, let me turn to the slides. Page 4, please. We reported a pretax loss of CHF757 million for the first quarter and a net loss attributable to shareholders of CHF252 million. This includes a pretax charge of CHF4.4 billion relating to the U.S. hedge fund matter. As David will highlight in his slides, excluding that charge, adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was CHF3.6 billion, reflecting the underlying strength of our business. Our Wealth Management-related businesses achieved 59% year-on-year growth in pretax income on an adjusted basis, excluding significant items in the first quarter and a return on regulatory capital of 29%. This was led by strong growth in Asia Pacific, where we achieved adjusted pretax income growth in U.S. dollars, excluding significant items, of 164% year-on-year. This underscores the region's key role in our growth strategy. Revenues grew over 30%. On the same basis, return on regulatory capital in APAC was 52% in the first quarter. Net revenues in our Investment Bank grew 80% in U.S. dollar year-on-year in the first quarter. It recorded a pretax loss of USD 2.6 billion, including the U.S. hedge fund charge of $4.7 billion. Our CET1 ratio was 12.2% at the end of the first quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.5%, and CET1 leverage ratio was 3.8%. As I mentioned, today, we successfully placed an offering of 2 series of mandatory convertible bonds convertible into 203 million shares, leading to an estimated uplift of around 55 to 60 basis points to the CET1 ratio. We intend to restore capital to achieve an approximately 13% CET1 ratio and a minimum of 4% CET1 leverage ratio. We reduced the proposed ordinary dividend for 2020 to CHF0.10 per registered share. Following the completion of share buybacks in the first quarter of 2021, we have suspended the share buyback program. Subject to 2021 financial performance, the Board of Directors would intend to restore the dividend in 2021 before any resumption of share buybacks. Slide 5, please. As we have previously disclosed, on March 25, a U.S. hedge fund failed to meet its margin requirements, leading us to issue a default note. In the first quarter 2021, we recorded a charge of CHF4.4 billion in respect of this matter. We expect to take an additional charge in the second quarter of approximately $600 million or rounded also CHF600 million roughly. We have exited 97% of our position relating to the hedge fund. As you can see on the right side, we have reviewed exposures across the entire prime services business. Related risk and control governance is already being strengthened and will be further enhanced following first and second line risk management assessments. Our Prime Brokerage and Prime Financing businesses will be resized and derisked with the primary focus on our most important franchise clients. By the end of 2021, we plan to reduce the Investment Bank leverage exposure by at least USD 35 billion and to align the IB risk-weighted assets to no more than the end of 2020 levels. Slide 6, please. Regarding the supply chain finance fund matter, Credit Suisse Asset Management's priority remains the recovery of funds for investors in the 4 supply chain finance funds. To date, total cash collected in the funds amounts to USD 5.4 billion, more than half of the total AUM at the time that the funds were suspended, of which USD 4.8 billion have been returned to fund investors in 2 cash distributions. We intend to provide progress updates over the coming months. CSAM is in active dialogue with the administrators of Greensill and other parties to identify options to facilitate further recovery. We have noted that it is reasonably possible that Credit Suisse will incur a loss in respect of these matters, though it is not yet possible to estimate the size of such a reasonably possible loss. We established Asset Management as a separate division April 1, 2021, emphasizing the strategic importance of the business for the bank and its clients. I also want to be clear that there are no plans to sell the Asset Management business at this point in time.  Page 7. The Executive Board, together with the Board of Directors, has taken decisive actions in the wake of these events, as you can see from the next 2 slides. For one, We implemented management changes in response to the recent events. We welcome Ulrich Körner, who has been CEO of Asset Management, a member of the ExB since 1st of April 2021. Christian Meissner has been appointed CEO of the Investment Bank and member of the ExB effective 1st of May. Jo Oechslin has been appointed Interim Chief Risk Officer and member of the ExB on an interim basis effective April 6. Thomas Grotzer has been appointed Interim Global Head of Compliance effective April 6. The management team is fully focused on strengthening prime services and asset management risk controls, including forensic analysis of the 2 incidents and lessons learned. We are conducting an overall review of risk systems, processes and culture across the bank in close collaboration with the Board of Directors and external advisers. The Board of Directors has launched 2 investigations carried out by external parties. These investigations will be supervised by a special committee of the Board of Directors and will not only focus on the direct issues arising from those matters, but also reflect on the broader consequences and lessons learned. In each instance, we'll work closely with the relevant regulators, including FINMA, which has opened enforcement proceedings in both cases. Page 8, please. We have also strengthened our capital by issuing 2 series of mandatory convertible notes, convertible into a total of 203 million Credit Suisse Group AG shares. These are expected to provide net proceeds to Credit Suisse Group of approximately CHF1.7 billion. You can see the details on this slide. But let me highlight, as I mentioned earlier, that this is expected to lead to an estimated uplift of around 55 to 60 basis points to the CET1 ratio. Slide 9, please. Let me now turn to our underlying performance. We delivered strong revenue growth across our Wealth Management franchise and the Investment Bank. Wealth Management-related revenues adjusted, excluding significant items, grew 7% year-on-year in the first quarter. Growth was particularly robust in transaction and performance-based revenues, which grew 18% from 1 year earlier. As you see on the right side of the slide, Investment Bank revenues grew 80% year-on-year during the first quarter to USD 3.9 billion. The gain occurred across fixed income sales and trading, equity sales and trading and particularly capital markets and advisory. Next slide, please. Despite recent events, we still grew our assets under management and achieved a solid increase in net new assets. Our AUM at the group level increased by 16% year-on-year to CHF1.6 trillion, and grew by 6% since the beginning of the year. NNA growth for the last 12 months was 5%, and we posted an annualized NNA growth rate of 7% in the quarter. Slide 11. We have generated substantial client business volume growth across our Wealth Management businesses, particularly in APAC, which achieved 41% year-on-year growth in U.S. dollar terms during the first quarter. We have also seen strong client business volume growth in IWM Private Banking and in the Swiss Universal Bank Private Clients businesses. Likewise, we also saw very strong net new assets across these divisions. As you know, our ambition is to grow annual client business volume by mid-single digits for the sub mid- to high single digits for IWM and double-digit growth in APAC, all of which we have comfortably exceeded in the first quarter. Next page, please. During the first quarter, our Wealth Management-related adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, grew 59% year-on-year to CHF1.6 billion. On the same basis, RoRC in our Wealth Management-related businesses grew from 18% in the first quarter of 2020 to 29% in the first quarter of 2021. We grew total client business volume across all 3 divisions by 22% year-on-year. We drove client activation resulting in mandate penetration of 29%. We also experienced continued strong performance in our ultra-high net worth business across all 3 divisions, with NNA of CHF8.3 billion. Page 13. Let me cover in more detail our Asset Management business, which is a strategic part of our overall value proposition. Asset Management revenues, excluding significant items, increased 60% year-on-year against what was a difficult first quarter 2020 with notable improvement in both adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items and NNA. The rebound in quarterly performance stretched across the businesses despite the supply chain finance fund situation. Our strong NNA of CHF10.3 billion during the first quarter was driven by inflows in traditional investments, investment in partnership and alternatives at above-average gross margins. Next page, please. Let me turn to our capital markets and advisory franchise, which outperformed most of our peers. Based on Dealogic data, our capital markets and advisory fees grew -- growth was 118% year-on-year during the first quarter. And it grew to USD 1.7 billion. Our share of wallet on the same basis increased across M&A, ECM and DCM. Next page, please. We recognize that a strong focus on sustainability is not only the right thing to do, it is good business and an important part of our growth strategy. With this in mind, last summer, we created SRI, Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions, to infuse environmental, social and governance standards at the heart of research, advisory, Investment Banking and Wealth Management. Almost 9 months after its launch, SRI has made excellent progress executing its strategy and delivering value to clients and stakeholders. We are doing this by enabling client transitions, driving our own transition and taking a leadership role in standard setting among other things. On the right side of this slide, you see just a few highlights. These include CHF118 billion in assets managed according to sustainability criteria at the end of the first quarter. And we priced 25 deals, including sustainable bonds globally, totaling USD 17.3 billion. Before I hand things over to David, let me briefly touch on the outlook. Overall, we would expect market volumes to return to lower and more normal levels in the coming quarters. We expect a residual impact of approximately CHF600 million from the U.S.-based hedge fund matter in the second quarter as we have now exited over 97% of the related positions. In Wealth Management, we anticipate broadly stable net interest and improving recurring commissions and fees, benefiting from higher levels of AUM. For the Investment Bank, we would expect the second quarter to reflect the slowdown in market activity as well as an impact from the resizing of our prime services business. Signs of recovery in the global economy could allow us to progressively release part of our allowance for credit losses under the CECL accounting methodology that was built in the early months of the COVID-19 crisis last year. Additionally, we expect the effective tax rate to remain significantly elevated for the remainder of the year. We intend to achieve a CET1 ratio of approximately 13% and the minimum 4% CET1 leverage ratio. With this, I would like to hand over to David.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much, Thomas, and I'd like to wish everybody good morning. What I'd now like to do is to just go through the financial results in more detail. As we announced in our trading updates that we published in March and in April, the bank's underlying performance was strong in the first quarter. We've increased contributions from each of our business divisions. However, this performance was more than negated though by the pretax charge of CHF4.43 billion, resulting from the U.S.-based hedge fund matter. First, I'd just like to reiterate the points that Thomas made earlier about our capital position. Notwithstanding the reported loss, our capital position was resilient with a CET1 ratio for the quarter of 12.2%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.5% and a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.8%. And I'd just note that those are all above the guidance that we gave on April 6. Now in terms of our financial priorities of the bank, as I'll discuss in more detail shortly, with the completed placement of our CHF1.7 billion mandatory convertible notes, we are at an implied CET1 ratio of approximately 13% and a CET1 leverage ratio of approximately 4%. These are the ratios at which we intend to operate for the balance of 2021. Now just in terms of the dividend. Whilst the Board will look to restore the 2020 reduction in the current year, this will clearly depend on our financial performance in the balance of 2021. With regard to the share buyback, we would expect this to remain suspended for the balance of 2021. And I would say that recommencing the program should take second priority to the restoration of the dividend.  Let's turn to the next slide, please. So reported net revenues for the quarter were 31% higher than in 2020 at CHF7.57 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, net revenues were 35% higher. And the driver of this strong performance was the Investment Bank, whose net revenues increased by 80% year-on-year to USD 3.89 billion. But I would note that we've also seen a continuation of the sequential improvements in Wealth Management-related revenues that I've discussed back in February. On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, Wealth Management-related net revenues increased by 7% year-on-year. I think you'll note that we also saw strong net new asset inflows across all of our Wealth Management businesses. Now in terms of expenses, our total operating expenses were 2% lower for the quarter at CHF3.94 billion. And that was mainly due to lower compensation accruals. We have seen modest gains from reduction in our CECL provisions, reflecting the improved economic environment with a net release of CHF59 million in the quarter. However, despite these positive trends, the pretax charge of CHF4.43 billion relating to the U.S. matter means that we reported a pretax loss of CHF757 million for the first quarter. Now on an adjusted basis, if you exclude significant items and the U.S.-based hedge fund charge, pretax income was CHF3.6 billion for the quarter compared to CHF946 million in the first quarter of last year. You'll note that we see an elevated effective tax rate of 69% in the first quarter. That is primarily driven by the U.S.-based hedge fund charge, for which I've only accrued a partial tax recovery in the current year. I would also note that the partial recovery will result in the effective tax rate remaining significantly elevated for the rest of 2021, potentially as high as the level in the first quarter, although this will depend on our tax calculations around future recoverability and the level of underlying profitability in the balance of the year. Just to be clear, I would anticipate a return to a more normal tax rate in 2022. Now the reported net loss attributable to shareholders for the quarter stood at CHF252 million, and that compares to a net income of positive CHF1.31 billion for the same period last year which meant we had a negative return on tangible equity in the first quarter of 2.6%. Next slide, please. Okay, I just wanted to give a bit more detail on the underlying performance of the bank in the first quarter and just pull out some of the significant items. You can see here that there was a gain in the first quarter of CHF144 million related to our investment in Allfunds. But you'll note this was actually less than the corresponding figure of CHF268 million in the first quarter of 2020. We also took restructuring charges of CHF63 million in the first quarter of this year, and that compared to a net credit of CHF5 million in the same period last year. As I touched on already, our CECL provisions swung from a charge at the start of the COVID crisis of CHF305 million a year ago to a credit of CHF59 million this quarter. But I'd also note here, you can see that our compensation benefits line was lower year-on-year at CHF2.207 billion compared to CHF2.316 billion, a reduction of CHF109 million, and that was primarily driven by reduced variable compensation accruals. But net-net, I think it should be clear that regardless of how you wish to view it, our underlying pretax income comfortably exceeded CHF3 billion for the quarter. Next slide, please. Now this should be familiar from the last 4 quarters. What we show here is the evolution of our provisions for credit losses, both specific and CECL related over the course of 2020 and into the current year. You may recall that we ended last year with just under CHF2 billion with specific and nonspecific allowances for credit losses. Since then, we've taken CHF4.45 billion in non-CECL specific provisions, of which clearly CHF4.43 billion relates to the U.S. hedge fund. Now we mentioned that we reduced our CECL provisions by CHF59 million in the first quarter. With write-offs of CHF36 million and a move of CHF79 million due to -- primarily due to FX, total loans to credit losses stood at CHF6.34 billion at the end of the first quarter. Just one point I would like to note, please, with respect to the USD 140 million collateralized bridge loan that was made to Greensill Capital in the fourth quarter of last year. As you may be aware, some $50 million of that has already been repaid by Greensill Capital's administrators, which reduced the notional value of the loan to USD 90 million. Now at the end of the first quarter, We have reduced the fair value of this loan to USD 60 million, having taken a charge of USD 30 million in the first quarter. Next slide, please. So we continued to take a disciplined approach to expenses. I've mentioned before, the 2% decline in our reported operating expenses for the quarter. And what I show here are the adjusted numbers which was CHF3.99 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2020, and that falls to CHF3.87 billion at the end of the first quarter of '21. And this is primarily due to a CHF109 million reduction in the comps and benefit line, primarily as I've said already, driven by a reduction in variable compensation accruals. Now just in terms of transparency, I would note that currency moves had a positive impact, i.e., they reduced their expenses by CHF113 million. Without which, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating expenses would have been about flat year-on-year. Next slide, please. Now what we show here are the increases in both risk-weighted assets and leverage since the end of the fourth quarter of last year. RWAs have increased from CHF275 billion to CHF303 billion, and leverage now stands at CHF968 billion compared to CHF911 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Now I think what we show here should be clear. The growth has been primarily driven by foreign exchange moves. And that's predominantly since the end of last year, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc and to a lesser extent by higher net business usage both in the Investment Bank and across the Wealth Management-related businesses. You should note there's a further CHF6 billion of RWA in respect of a temporary FINMA add-on for the U.S.-based hedge fund positions at the end of March. This add-on is directly linked to the size of the residual positions. It will fall proportionately in respect to the disposals that we've now completed. And therefore, we would expect this add-on to shrink to 0 during the course of the second quarter. Let's look in the capital ratios, please, on the next slide in some more detail. So as we've said, we ended the first quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.8% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.5%.  Let's just move from left to right. First, as we've said already, we expect to suffer additional losses of approximately CHF0.6 billion in respect of the U.S.-based hedge fund in the second quarter. We've now eliminated just over 97% of the related positions. So this should represent the bulk of the loss that we've suffered in this matter. And that's equivalent in capital terms to approximately another 20 basis point reduction in the ratio from the level at the end of the first quarter. But in capital terms, this loss should be more than offset by the proportionate reduction in the FINMA add-on which as we've eliminated the positions, boosts our capital ratio by about 25 basis points. Furthermore, I think everyone should be aware that the Allfunds IPO is actually due to price today. And the reduction of our holding in this business will boost our CET1 by about 25 basis points. Now Thomas -- as Thomas has said already, we have successfully placed an offering of 2 series of mandatory convertible notes, convertible into 203 million new shares, which should lead to an estimated uplift of approximately 55 to 60 basis points to the implied CET1 ratio, subject to the FINMA improving this as common equity prior to conversion or following conversion in 6 months' time. It's a 6-month mandatory convertible. And the exact value of the capital benefit from the MCNs will depend on the VWAP today and tomorrow. It's priced on today's price and tomorrow's price. But if you just include the second quarter loss on the U.S.-based hedge fund, the offsetting buffer reduction, the Allfunds credit and the placement of the MCNs, that implies a CET1 ratio of approximately 13%, which, as I said already, is our target for the rest of this year. Now just in terms of actions over the coming months. As we said already, we intend to reduce Investment Bank leverage by at least USD 35 billion, primarily from a resizing of the Prime Brokerage and Prime Financing businesses and realign RWA in the Investment Bank to no more than the levels that prevailed at the end of 2020. Combined with the impact of other asset sales, these should provide a further 40 to 50 basis points of uplift to the CET1 ratio during the course of the year. But as we noted before, in the second quarter, I would expect an increase in operational risk RWA due to the RMBS provisions that we took in the fourth quarter of last year as well as other methodology changes with a likely negative impact of 30 to 35 basis points. You should also note that capital generation in the balance this year will be constrained by the high level of the effective tax rate. And we should expect to see some capital consumption from the planned growth in our Wealth Management businesses. Now in terms of dividend, let me be clear. We have made first quarter dividend accrual in line with the level of the reduced 2020 dividend. As we said already, subject to the financial performance of the bank and the balance this year, we would hope to restore the 2020 reduction in the dividend this year, but that will clearly be a matter for the Board to review in due course. As I've said already, this should take priority over the share buyback, which I would expect to remain suspended for the balance of 2021. But just to reiterate, we're looking to maintain a capital ratio of about 13% for the balance of 2021. Now just turning to the CET1 leverage ratio, and I show the same walk below, I won't go through all the same points on the slide. But given, again, Allfunds, the capital raise and the reduction in Investment Bank leverage exposure relating to the resizing of the prime business, our leverage ratio should exceed 4% for the balance of the year. Next slide, please. Now let me just turn to tangible book value per share. That's increased from CHF15.8 to CHF16.8 since the end of last year. Net income attributable to shareholders excluding the charge from the U.S. hedge fund contributed CHF1.50 per share, with the effects of our capital distribution program and share-based comp awards adding a further CHF0.14 per share. We saw a widening of credit spreads, which actually results in a positive impact to tangible book value per share, as did the move in FX, particularly the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Swiss franc since the end of 2020. And these contributed CHF0.23 and CHF0.84 per share, respectively. Now prior to the charge relating to the U.S.-based hedge fund, tangible book value per share would have been CHF18.40 per share. However, this charge then had a negative impact of CHF1.6, taking the net figure to CHF16.8 per share. Let me turn then to the next slide. You'll recognize a previous version of this slide from our fourth quarter results, during which I explained that we were seeing sequential quarter-on-quarter improvements in our Wealth Management revenues in Swiss franc terms and that the adverse trends affecting our net interest income following on from the cut interest rates a year ago and the consequent move in the U.S. dollar were bottoming out on a sequential basis. So I'm very pleased that the evidence in the first quarter continues to support this view. Moving from left to right, whilst net interest income remained stable compared to the previous 2 quarters at CHF949 million, recurring commissions and fees have shown their third successive quarterly improvement, 3% higher than the fourth quarter of last year at CHF594 million. I think as you know, we've seen a significant increase in transaction-based revenues led by APAC. An overall total of CHF1.15 billion represents a quarter-on-quarter increase of 48% and a year-on-year increase of 22%. So let me just turn to the divisional overviews, where unless I state otherwise, I will be talking about adjusted numbers excluding significant items, particularly given the credit from Allfunds both last year and this year. And I'll start as usual with the Swiss Universal Bank. So net revenues were CHF1.41 billion. That's 2% lower year-on-year due to lower deposit income. But this was partly offset by improved recurring revenues, which increased by 8%. The improving macroeconomic environment means that we've continued to see a reduction in provisions for credit losses. For the first quarter, the Swiss Universal Bank took a further CHF26 million in provisions, of which CHF6 million were CECL related. For comparisons, provisions were CHF124 million in the first quarter of last year and CHF66 million in the fourth quarter. Ongoing cost discipline meant that our operating expenses actually totaled CHF749 million, 6% lower year-on-year, resulting in a cost-to-income ratio for the quarter of 53%. I think we're very pleased by the positive net new asset inflows we saw both in Private Clients and in Corporate & Institutional Clients, which totaled CHF6.1 billion in the quarter, an annualized net new asset growth rate of 4%. I'd also mention that one of the restructuring projects that we initiated last summer, that is the integration of Neue Aargauer Bank into Credit Suisse Schweiz AG and therefore into Private Clients and Corporate & Institutional Clients has now been completed successfully. We're also seeing strong take-up of CSX, the digital banking offering that we launched last September. Let's move to the next slide, please. Now you know that on March 18, we announced that we will be separating Asset Management from International Wealth Management and operating this as a separate division under the leadership of Ulrich Körner. I've therefore separated the 2 here for reference purposes, ahead of their formal move into separate reporting, which will start with our second quarter results. Just let's look at Private Banking first, please. Net revenues were 9% lower year-on-year at CHF929 million. We've reduced year-on-year net interest income due to the U.S. rates environment and the depreciation connected to that of the U.S. dollar and that offset positive impacts from deposit and loan growth. We have though continued to see quarter-on-quarter stability in recurring commissions and fees, and transaction-based revenues were 34% higher quarter-on-quarter, albeit 8% lower year-on-year. Net new assets were strong, CHF7.2 billion in the quarter, with strong contributions both in Western Europe and in our emerging market businesses, and equivalent to a growth rate on an annualized basis of 8%. I'd note that we have reclassified CHF2.4 billion of supply chain finance funds as assets under custody, and this is treated as a structural effect in our reporting. We also saw growth in outstanding loan balances of 10% to CHF56 billion. We had no material provisions for credit losses, and we reduced our CECL provisions by CHF5 million in the IWM PB business. And together with the improvement in operating expenses, which were 10% lower year-on-year at CHF585 million, driven by lower variable compensation, our adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was 5% higher year-on-year at CHF344 million. Let me turn now to asset management, please. Just saying a few words really just with regard to the supply chain finance funds. It remains Credit Suisse Asset Management and, for that matter, Credit Suisse's priority to maximize the recovery of cash for investors in these funds. Just to date, total cash collected in these funds has increased to CHF5.4 billion -- sorry, USD 5.4 billion, my fault, of which USD 4.8 billion has been returned to fund investors in the 2 cash distributions that we've made so far, and we'll provide further progress updates in the coming months. In terms of the overall division, we saw strong net new assets in the quarter of CHF10.3 billion, taking AUM to CHF458 billion. That's 4% higher quarter-on-quarter. AUM growth underpinned net year-on-year net revenue growth of 60% with higher management and higher performance fees contributing to a total for the quarter of CHF386 million. Operating expenses, again driven by lower variable compensation as well as reduced professional fees were down by 4% at CHF269 million. On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items, the division delivered a pretax income of CHF117 million compared to the loss of CHF39 million in the same period last year. Let's turn to APAC, please. So as we've already announced, our Asia Pacific businesses had a strong start to 2021 with net revenues 33% higher year-on-year at USD 1.12 billion. Transaction-based revenues were particularly strong, 74% higher year-on-year at USD 725 million. But you should note that there was no repeat in this number of the USD 181 million net mark-to-market losses that we took in this business last year. We saw higher fees from M&A and ECM activity, strong private client transactional activity and increased revenues from GTS as well as an 11% increase in recurring commissions and fees, which offset a 12% year-on-year decline in net interest income due to lower deposit and lower margins. Even with a 4% increase in operating expenses, which totaled USD 558 million, the cost-to-income ratio for the division improved from 64% to 50% due to the higher net revenues. And overall, the adjusted pretax income, again, excluding significant items, was USD 531 million. Let me just conclude then please with a few words on the Investment Bank. Let's just start with the adjusted financials excluding the U.S. hedge fund charge. On this basis, pretax income was USD 2.2 billion, reflecting strong revenue contributions from all of our business lines and operating expenses of USD 1.78 billion. Net revenues increased by 80% to USD 3.89 billion. And I would note that we saw market share gains in ECM, a strong performance in leveraged finance and higher M&A deal completions. Within the credit franchise, we saw particularly strong performance in securitized products and further strength in asset finance. I think GTS' performance was also good, against what were very strong comparisons last year, and that reflected continued collaboration across the bank. Now in terms of credit provisions. Now just excluding again the charge relating to the U.S.-based hedge fund matter, we wrote back USD 89 million provisions, of which $73 million was related to the CECL release. However, clearly, this strong performance by our Investment Bank was more than negated by the loss in respect of the U.S. hedge fund. And that resulted in the division overall reporting a pretax loss of USD 2.56 billion. As already said, we're going to be focused on reducing and shrinking the size of our Prime Servicing and our Prime Financing businesses. We intend to reduce leverage in the investment by at least $35 billion in the coming months.  And with that, I'd like to conclude my part of the presentation. And I believe we're now going to pass back to Kinner to open for questions, please. But thank you for your time this morning.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, David. So we will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference.

But I mean, I guess, Thomas and David, both of you have been at the group for over 20 years now. And I'm just trying to understand essentially how -- in your view, how the group has got to a position where in 2021, we're having a debate where the group is looking to cut back on risk within the prime business. And there are questions about the future of the Asset Management business. So just trying to understand from your perspective how we've arrived at this point. And then secondly, on a go-forward basis, how do you think about the road map in terms of rebuilding investor and other stakeholder confidence and trust in the group? So just to get your sense on how you see that path in the coming periods.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Amit. Look, Generally, the prime services business in the past didn't have any losses. Clearly, this loss came as a big surprise to us. And we are taking measures that this will not reoccur. We are reducing our exposure in that business, and we are doing an investigation how it exactly happened and make sure it will not happen again. Asset Management, we had, again, the situation around Greensill. But the overall Asset Management business, as we saw also today, is actually doing very well from operational perspective. The same is true for the Investment Bank. So clearly, the 2 incidents are unacceptable. But at the same time, we have to move forward. We have to look forward. And the fact is that we can build on a very strong operational performance in Q1. We have taken the measure with the mandatory convertible to strengthen our balance sheet. We want to take any discussion on capital off the table. On a pro forma basis, we are back at 13%, higher than we were at the end of the year last year. And this was really the basis now for us to look forward and to move forward and to be back in business. So that was really the key. And in terms of overall road map, as I just said, we have to look forward now. Clearly, we have an incoming Chairman who will come in on the 1st of May. Together with the Board of Directors and the entire ExB management team, we will sit down, we will review everything. We have to do that after what happened in the first quarter. But at the same time, I'm a fundamental believer that the overall strategy of Credit Suisse is sound. And again, as we could prove in the first quarter with outperformance in almost every business. So this is the moment now to look forward.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Amit Goel',\n","    'text': 'Okay. And just if I can have just one follow-up.

And we're looking forward now to working through them through both situations and take the right conclusions. So this is going to be a collaborative work with FINMA together also with the internal investigation, which has been put in place by our Board of Directors.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Benjamin Goy',\n","    'text': \"One question on the Investment Bank. Should we think the capital commitment has a hard cap now? So effectively, passive shrinking in group context until a further review under the new Chairman, as you suggested, potentially? And then secondly, on Asset Management, you say it's strategic. I think in December, you mentioned the cross-selling in particular works with traditional products, but not so far with alternatives. Maybe you can give an update on the opportunities to see or potential reluctance by relationship managers given reputational issues here?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Yes. On the IB side, as David mentioned, we are planning to reduce our leverage exposure by $35 billion. Most, if not all of that, will come from the prime services side. And we will also reduce our RWAs to the level we were at, at the end of last year. And we will further calibrate and refine these over the next few weeks and months, together with Christian Meissner and the management team. There are certainly areas where we continue to want to be very proactive and have strong market positions, such as leverage finance, where we've had a very strong first quarter. But at the same time, we want to be very disciplined and want to really now manage that business accordingly. On the Asset Management, together with Ulrich Körner, we are also reviewing the areas where we want to have to emphasize going forward. Clearly, we are now still very much focused on maximizing the cash returns on the supply chain finance fund situation. But at the same time, we have some very strong businesses in Asset Management, as you could also see with the net new asset inflows we had in the first quarter. And together with Uli and the rest of the team, we are reviewing all of those opportunities.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citigroup.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': \"Three questions for me, please. Firstly, just to clarify on capital and FINMA enforcement actions. They talk about capital surcharges in their press release today. Can you confirm, does that just the 25 basis points that you referred to on Slide 22? Or do you expect further capital surcharges to come? And attached to that, I see that you mentioned 30 to 35 basis points on operational risk models. But the footnote suggests that's just for mortgage-related matters in the fourth quarter. So any thoughts on operational risk inflation going forward? That's the first question. Second question on the prime services review and the $35 billion leverage exposure reduction. Could you provide us an idea of both the direct revenue attrition attached to that but also the indirect revenue attrition? As one would assume, that shrinking in prime will also weigh in directly on cash and derivatives as well in your equities franchise. And then thirdly, on a more positive note, you've obviously had a very strong quarter on SPAC issuance. I'm conscious that a lot of the fees there already recognized on the de-SPAC event. So could you provide us an idea that if, for example, 100% of those SPACs were to de-SPAC successfully over the remainder of the year, what would the pipeline of these look like?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Okay. Before I hand over to David, who should take lead on most of these questions, I just want to make clear on the capital that the decision to issue the mandatory convertible notes was purely taken by ourselves. There was no kind of request by FINMA. It was really David and I who came to a view we want to do this. We want to take this whole discussion off the table. We made the recommendation to the Board. The Board supported us. And then we went ahead with that placement. So there was no request by FINMA in any shape or form. But with this, I would like to hand over to David to go through your 3 questions.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"No. I'd just second what Thomas said. I think we previously guided to a minimum of 12.5%. I think we really wanted to take the capital question off the table. So I think getting to an implied number of 13% with -- including the Allfunds credit, I think it was a very important thing. It also boosts our leverage ratio to 4% too. And as Thomas said, that was very much our decision. We discussed it with the Board, and we executed against that. And we're obviously very grateful for the support of both our existing and new shareholders in this. Just in terms of your detailed questions then. So there were 2 FINMA-related capital add-ons, one which I actually mentioned in our annual report, which is a Pillar 2 add-on of CHF2 billion. And that basically increases the minimum requirement from 10% to, I guess, 10.6%. That is in respect of the Greensill supply chains funds matter. The second is the one we actually show on the capital walk slide, which is the add-on, which is proportionate to the size of the residual positions that we hold in respect of -- on behalf of the U.S. hedge fund. And as those now declined towards 0, we've shifted obviously -- just over 97% of them. That buffer actually reduces proportionate to that. I think in terms of operational risk, You're correct. The op risk charge that I'm alluding to in the capital walk is in respect primarily the RMBS matters when we took -- the charge we took in the fourth quarter of last year. That's going through the process at this point. The number is not yet final, but I wanted just to remind you that we will have that impact in the second quarter. Yes, I clearly can't preclude any other add-ons. I think it would be wrong for me to do so. This is, though, a credit risk event regarding U.S. hedge fund, not an unauthorized trading issue. So it's not strictly speaking op risk point. But at this point, that's all I would want to say at this time. So I think those were your 2 questions in terms of capital. By the way, I just should note and you may have seen it in the press release that we have announced the settlement of the single largest RMBS case today. That's the so-called Euphrates Case for USD 500 million. That's exactly in line with the provision that we took in the fourth quarter. So there's no incremental charge in respect of either the first quarter or the second quarter of that. I think we're pleased to have resolved a matter which I guess must be now about 15 years old. Now moving on to your second question, which was around prime. I think I'm helpful and unhelpful, I think, if I'm being honest. Just to give you some idea, that $35 billion leverage reduction is about 1/3 of the total leverage we have deployed in prime. And I would expect clearly our prime revenues to fall as a consequence of that. But I think in terms of the actual revenue impact, quite clearly, we will be focusing our prime business around clients that have multiple connectivity to Credit Suisse, i.e., important across our businesses and obviously defocusing on clients that have much less connection across the banks. So one would clearly expect we'll be, at that point, reducing the lowest ROA businesses, but it does move prime to being more of a utility to actually support the overall bank as opposed to a stand-alone business model, which I think is the right way to go. But yes, we will see some revenue reduction. It's going to be difficult to estimate it given those 2 constraining factors. And that will obviously come through as a reduction in our equity sales and trading revenues going forward. In terms of SPAC number, I might have to ask Kinner to help me in terms of outstanding balance. But I think just to put the numbers in context, there was about CHF280 million of SPAC revenues out of the CHF1.4 billion of Investment Banking, capital markets and advisory numbers. Actually, I don't think we've given the de-SPAC before, so I'm not going to give it now basically. But as you rightly say, Andrew, we recognized just under half of SPAC revenues on issuance and the other half is dependent on the successful conversion or de-SPAC-ing of the entity normally within the 2 years following issuance. But yes, I'm not going to give the actual pipeline now. But what is clear is that more than half of the issuance revenues are still waiting there, subject to the appropriate due diligence and completion of the de-SPAC-ing, which may not always occur in the case of all of the SPACs, just to be clear.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from Exane.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee',\n","    'text': \"Apologies for focusing on the painful bits, but I still think there's more clarification that we need. I wanted to just ask 2 things. One is on Greensill. Can you -- you've got about $5 billion cash but also about $5 billion remaining exposure in those funds. And I just wondered if you could put a number on how much of that $5 billion remaining exposure is to doubtful borrowers, including obviously, Gupta, but also some of the other doubtful borrowers who seem reluctant to pay? So that's my first question. And my second question is on the other painful episode, I'm afraid, on the Archegos situation. Could you walk us through the mechanics of how that loss came about in terms of what the outstanding gross exposure was at the moment of problem? How much margin you had? And the sequence of events in terms of where you slowed to sell down? Or how do you assess what happened? Those are my 2 questions, please.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Okay. So I will take the lead on Greensill. So the CHF5.4 billion you mentioned, and we have very good visibility, I would say, on up to CHF7.5 billion. And then the rest, as we announced a couple of days ago, roughly CHF2.3 billion relates to 3 distinct situations where we have very strong legal positions. We also have discussions with insurance coverage around these situations. And these will take several weeks, if not months and quarters to resolve. But this is something that we are working through. This is our asset management team that is working with advisers, with the advisers also to Greensill and to the underlying companies. We have constructive discussions there. And it's simply premature now to make any estimates what the ultimate outcome will be, but we have very constructive discussions. And this is the -- under the lead of Credit Suisse Asset Management.  On Archegos, look, as you know, that this was a very special situation around the family office that was covered not only by us, but also 5, 6 other brokers out of Prime Services with a lack of disclosure, which I think also regulators now are looking into that had explosive growth over the last 12 months. And we are not commenting on detailed exposures, but we clearly had issues there that we are now looking into as part of our investigation around the absolute limits around the margining, around Delta One and the situation around the underlying concentration risks. So this is something we're all looking into and ensure that this cannot and must not ever be repeated. But it's too premature now to go into more details.  I'm very satisfied that we have essentially gone out of the exposures now. We have, as we said, reduced the exposures by over 97% to a very moderate number now, which we are managing through for the coming weeks with the clear intention that we'll get as quickly as possible to a 0 level.  Anything you wanted to add, David?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"No. I think I'll just make a couple of points really. I mean, firstly, I think I would just refute the suggestion that we were slow to sell down. We reduced our position in a lawful and orderly manner, I think with respect to the challenges we actually faced. And I think as far as I can tell, in terms of looking at the prices we achieved compared to the other prime brokers, the exit prices were broadly similar over the period of time. That's the point I'd make first.  I think the second point I'd make is, it is an exceptional event. I think the last time the industry has seen anything like this was LTCM in terms of its size and consequence, it's an industry-wide issue. But that said, I think, as Thomas has summarized, we've obviously conducted an immediate read across to anything similar, any other immediate lessons learned to ensure that, that is not the case within the rest of our prime portfolio. And we're obviously very focused on the investigation review that the Board of Directors is leading in terms of the longer-term lessons to be learned around this particular position.  But as Thomas said, clearly, this is likely to be a broader industry issue as well, given the number of other prime brokers involved and some of the disclosure requirements relating to these types of funds.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"I've got two questions. I'm going to have to return to the Archegos kind of issue as well, but more top-down. Because, of course, you have described what you've done so far, you've described today, the Board investigation. But kind of when you look back and that's particularly at the risk framework, the decision-making, the communication between executives, are there any kind of early learnings that -- or any kind of additional color that you can share with us to kind of to make the understanding of the situation, and is more helpful not only for yourself, but of course, as you said, on an industry level as well?  And my second question within that is that, how do you see this particular credit event? Is it isolated? We've talked about kind of your review of Prime Brokerage. But within the broader risk management at the IB level, are there any other businesses that you would be reviewing as well as a part of a kind of broader potential rethink of the business? So that's question #1.  And question #2 really is about IWM and the revenue trajectory there. Because, of course, we have seen very, very strong kind of net new money numbers. But of course, when we look at the kind of underlying revenues, we're of course seeing kind of weakness in NII, but also on the kind of transactional and recurring fees are kind of broadly flat. How should we -- and I know that there's a question about mix, there's a question about effects within the numbers, too. But going forward, how should we kind of think about that revenue trajectory within that part of your wealth business?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Okay. I will take the first one and then maybe, David, you can take the second one. So on Archegos early learnings, clearly, one of the early learnings is that the disclosure has to be improved around especially family offices in that business. Secondly, I think we have to look at absolute limits much more carefully, about margin limits, about how we look at Delta One and correlation between short and long positions and we have to look at concentration risk management. So these are all elements that we are extremely focused and on which basis we have done the first analysis of the entire book. But there will certainly be more learnings to come through as we go through the next few weeks in terms of the review that we are doing internally, but also that will be done as part of our excellent review with our regulators.  Is it an isolated case? Look, I definitely hope it is, and I think it is. But we are obviously reviewing the entire bank now just to make sure that our risk processes and systems are where they should be. And clearly, the -- historically, the prime business has not been subject to major losses, and that is now our prime focus. But we are, together with Christian Meissner, the first line of defense, but also the second line of defense, our Risk -- new Chief Risk Officer and the Head of Risk for the Investment Bank, doing a special effort now to review the entire division.  David, would you like to cover the IWM revenues?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Sure, of course. Magdalena, I think a few points to make really. I mean, firstly, as you know, the primary currency in terms of which IWM operates the largest single one is actually -- in revenue terms is actually the U.S. dollar. And if you look back to the first quarter of last year, beginning of the COVID crisis, you saw the dollar trading substantially stronger against the Swiss franc, which we report in compared to where it actually is now basically.  So what you're seeing is twofold. Firstly, the adverse impact on translation of those dollar revenues into Swiss francs. And then secondly, because of the importance of the dollar to IWM, you've obviously seen a very sharp reduction in U.S. dollar interest rates, which were at a peak a year ago. So that translates through into lower net interest income.  Now the point we've made before, though is sequentially, that is stabilizing. And even before the slight appreciation we see in the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc in the last 4 months, and some pickup, but limited in terms of longer-term U.S. dollar interest rates. So that's the point I made to start off with.  And clearly, in terms of recurring revenues, you see the same trends. Now generally speaking, transaction revenues across the whole Wealth Management business were substantially up compared to last year. They're down in IWM partly for the currency effect, but also because the first quarter of last year was extremely strong for IWM. And I think I'd just refer you, Magdalena, to Pages 38 and 39 within the presentation. What you see there basically is the gross margin trends within IWM PB. You can see it was a high of 114 basis points in the first quarter of last year, a low of 95, 96 and 97 in the second half of last year, now ticking up to 99. And in net terms with some of the cost measures, obviously, it was 37, down to 23, back up to 37 in terms of that.  I think the second point I'd actually make is actually on the following slide, Slide 39. And you can see that the growth in client business volume, which I think shows the expansion, both in terms of assets under management, but also in terms of net lending activity in IWM, which I think does support what we're seeing in terms of the sequential improvements in terms of that business. But transactions in IWM were particularly high in the first quarter a year ago, Magdalena.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher from UBS.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Daniele Brupbacher',\n","    'text': \"I have a follow-on question on Slide 22 and then one on the FINMA press release from this morning. I mean in that press release, they talk about a reduction or suspension of variable remuneration. Now how should we think about this? Is this a temporary thing, probably just for a few quarters? And is there a potential for a catch-up later in the year? How do you look at this statement and what's your optionality there?  And then just on Slide 22, again, sorry, probably in connection with Page 11 of the earnings release. I mean in the earnings release, you talk about potential additional capital and related actions, including an add-on to RWA and OpRisk Pillar 2 add-on, et cetera. So would that be potentially on top of the CHF6 billion and CHF1.9 billion you mentioned? And would this be included in the waterfall chart on Slide 22?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Daniele. So I'll take the first one and then David can take the second one. So on variable compensation, yes, we have been in constant dialogue with FINMA. We, that is obviously the Board but also myself on this topic. And we have taken some decisions, both on the Executive Board level, but also on the overall comp pool as we have done for the first quarter. And that dialogue will continue over the next few weeks. So this has been a very constructive discussion with FINMA. And there's not really more I can say at this stage. Clearly, they have taken a positive note, not only from the mandatory convertible, but also the operating performance. And we will -- even in the absence of FINMA, obviously, take all compensation-related decisions in relation to the future performance of the various businesses. On RWA, I hand over to you, David.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Sure. Yes. I think just to summarize, basically, if you look at page -- as you say, Page 11 of the earnings release and then the capital walk on Slide 22. So in essence, as I said already, there was a USD 2 billion Pillar 2 add-on in respect to Greensill operational risk basically which was imposed by FINMA in March. And I think we -- and as I said, we disclosed it in our annual report. There's then this add-on in respect of the U.S. hedge fund positions which is a proportion of that, which I've actually included on Slide 22. And then as you say, basically, I've made it clear that the operational risk number, which I've included towards the right-hand side, that is primarily in respect of the RMBS matter. It's not in respect of anything else at this point. There are certain other methodology changes I put in there as a sort of precautionary matter in terms of that. But I've not included an operational risk charge in respect of either.  But I think in terms of -- I think it's difficult to truly speculate on this because this is clearly sort of a developing matter, and we'll see how this changes over time. But I mean, quite clearly, because Credit Suisse itself has not suffered a loss, operational or otherwise, in respect of Greensill apart from the CHF30 million impairment of the fair value loan, so there's no basis for an operational risk charge to Pillar 1 pending such a loss.  I think in terms of the U.S.-based matter, as I said, this is a credit charge. It's not an operational risk failure. But I think quite rightly on Page 11, it's a risk factor. I can't preclude that as the -- both the Board investigation and as the FINMA investigation projections, we don't have some kind of add-on in future. But I'm not aware of such an add-on at this point, and it's impossible to estimate what that would be basically. So -- but I think it is appropriate we disclose it, Daniele, in the risk factors.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Daniele Brupbacher',\n","    'text': \"No, that's super helpful. Is it fair to conclude that this is probably why you want to have a 13% CET1 ratio target to which you should capture some of these uncertainties as well?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Actually, not really, actually. I mean I think there were 3 reasons why we wanted to have a 13% ratio and to actually reach it quickly with the issuance of the mandatory. I think, first, I think there's been obviously an extensive amount of media coverage about Credit Suisse. People have raised questions around the capital ratio, particularly before we put out the release at the beginning of April. And I think that's unhelpful. I've been here before. And I think, particularly unhelpful to our Wealth Management business. And I think taking it off the table is exactly the right thing to do in terms of the sort of capital security of the bank.  And I think that's true both for the CET1 ratio, but also the CET1 leverage ratio because, as you know, Switzerland has a relatively high floor in terms of the leverage ratio requirements.  I think the second point basically is, I think that whilst we are reducing capital in the investment bank, I think given the momentum we've seen in the Wealth Management businesses, I think allowing that growth to continue in a prudent and disciplined fashion I think is the right thing to do. And I think if we hadn't raised the mandatory and had a 13% goal, then I think that could have imposed undue restraints in terms of that.  And thirdly, and I just would caution this is more of a sort of personal view, I think there's a lot of volatility in these markets. And I'd rather basically operate with the bank at a 13% ratio, and that was a discussion we had at ExB and recommended to the Board, and the Board supported that. And I think that's the prudent thing to do in respect of 2021. Clearly, to your point, yes, I guess it does provide a buffer against that type of circumstance, too, but that wasn't our primary reason.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': \"Thomas, thank you very much for your openness and humility in this respect to the matters that clearly are of concern to shareholders.

And if I look at your investment bank, over 5, 10, 20 years, 30 years, you do not make cost of equity returns, even taking out what we could call specific issues such as we see now with Archegos. So really shouldn't there be a discussion around, do we really need an investment bank of this size rather than cutting at the edges of the PB business which makes you even more subscale than you are already against the top 3 competitors in PB? The second question is related to, if I can come back to risk. Where are you on reviewing the total risk book of the firm of the group? And in that context, when are we going to expect a new Head of Compliance and Risk Officer, I assume there will be two separate positions, if you can confirm that, and will that be coming from the outside?

Now look, the IB overall size as well as look is now clearly addressed in a second step now, primarily now with focus on Prime Services. And it's something that after an event like this, it's understandable that you asked that question. But we have some tremendous franchises in capital markets, in M&A, in SP, just to name a few. And as you can see also in some of the charts that I showed, we've had significant market gain -- market share gains in various areas.  So -- but this is clearly also something we are now going to discuss with Christian, with Antonio when he's on Board, and we'll have a further review. So this is certainly something that will continue to be discussed also internally. But we have definitely made a lot of progress in the business.  And as the first quarter numbers have shown, we were really on the right track. With 80% revenue growth, I think we have pretty much outperformed everybody else in the first quarter. So to say that everything is broken on the IB, which I kind of imply from your question, is a bit unfair, I think, against this background.  With respect to risk and compliance search, we have started that search. We have obviously very strong hands on the table now with Jo Oechslin and Thomas Grotzer. Jo Oechslin very clearly said, this is something he's prepared to do, but only on an interim basis, and he's very experienced, and he has already had very positive impact on the business. But we will now move forward with that search. We have not decided yet whether risk and compliance should be 1 or 2 functions. This will be also part of the outcome of the search. As you -- if you look at the top -- the largest 10 banks, maybe the largest 6 banks in the U.S. and the 4 -- largest 4 banks in Europe away from us, you can see that about 50% have risk and compliance together, and the other 50% have it separate.  We discussed it at the time with the regulator, with the Board. We have clearly some very good reasons to keep it together, including technology and other areas, anything that has to do with nonfinancial risk. So -- but there are also -- clearly now there was a need given the short-term nature of the need to have a comprehensive review across our group on all the risk positions that we wanted to keep it separate for the time being as far as the leadership is concerned with Jo and Thomas. But we kept certain areas together like technology for the 2 functions, that continues to be one team, and they're supporting both sides. And we will take a decision on that together with the Board of Directors over the coming weeks and months as we go through the search.  In terms of NNA, look, it's early days in the first quarter, but there have not been major flows in either direction. So it's too early to comment on NNA at this stage.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': 'And may I just ask -- sorry, just one more on the risk. Are you doing a review of all divisions, all exposures? Or is it specific to the areas where we have had issues? Or is it also other areas like lombard lending, et cetera?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Yes. We are doing a comprehensive review. Obviously, that's something that we owe to ourselves and to our stakeholders that we -- after such a shock loss that we had, we have to review that in detail.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Thomas, for your openness.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Alastair Ryan, Bank of America.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alastair Ryan',\n","    'text': \"Just cost in, please. So you had about CHF2.5 billion year-over-year revenue improvement in Q1. Historically, you've had a marginal cost-to-income ratio in good times of 50-ish . So there's probably CHF1.2 billion of costs that didn't get accrued for the reasons we discussed. Could you just discuss whether there's any potential overhang in the rest of the year, i.e., CIB does perform well. There needs to be a catch-up in costs because presumably there's quite a relevant differential between what you're accruing for some of your high performers and what competitors may be doing. So there's a strain for later in the year as a result of the discipline you've shown in Q1, I guess, is the question, please.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Alastair, I'll take the question. So firstly, I think, as I said in my presentation, you can see in the compensation and benefits line, it was about CHF109 million lower this year than it was actually last year. And that was primarily almost entirely due to reductions in variable compensation. So that gives you one measure. Now if we're stepping back and saying, given the improvement in revenues that we actually saw in the first quarter ex the U.S. hedge fund issue, would comp and benefits have been higher than last year, the answer is, yes, they would. But they wouldn't be higher anything like the amount you've actually said.  I think I step back and we have obviously CHF3.6 billion of 1Q PTI, excluding the U.S. hedge fund loss. I think you could basically say there was CHF109 million contribution of variable compensation in that. You might want to add a bit more in terms of how much I might have accrued. But I have to say every which way I actually looked at the first quarter number, it comfortably exceeded CHF3 billion excluding that. And I think the number that was reported in one newspaper, I think, around a much bigger comp reduction was erroneous in terms of that.  I mean the brutal truth, Alastair, which you know better than I do, is that banking is a fixed cost business. And when you have a very strong level of revenue growth like that, you do not see that degree of marginal cost increase coming through. It's really just the variable cost line plus some BCE type costs, basically, Alastair. And so that's, I guess, point one in terms of the point there, but I would certainly strongly dissuade you from thinking about there was some number like CHF1.5 billion or whichever in terms of marginal cost that didn't flow through. That's not the case.  I think in terms of the balance this year, I think we'll obviously be conscious of the need to retain and motivate staff. I think, conscious of the need to continue to execute well in the balance of this year and to sustain this momentum. But I think it is also appropriate that if you have an issue like this, then there needs to be a prudent approach in terms of variable compensation, and that's a line that we're trying to walk between those 2 things. And that's -- I think that's all I can really say at this point, Alastair.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And your next question comes from the line of Piers Brown, HSBC.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Piers Brown',\n","    'text': \"I've got two follow-up questions, please. First of all, on the IB deleveraging number, the CHF35 billion of LRD deleveraging. I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color on what the thought process was around that number? How you arrived at CHF35 billion? And which particular aspects of the prime business was I think you felt needed to be addressed in terms of derisking?  And the second question was just on the loan growth you've reported in the wealth business, which has obviously been extremely strong and whether that may be impacted by the risk review that you're currently undergoing?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Well, I think if we take the first one, I think I don't want to prejudge the work that Christian needs to looking at prime nor the work that we'll be doing together with our new Chairman in the second quarter. But I think we did want to set an initial target based on the overall book in terms of the leverage reduction, and that's what we're getting now, basically. I think that you should see that as a minimum, not a maximum basically. I think it does, as I've indicated, indicate a significant refocusing of prime away from being more of a stand-alone P&L center, albeit with a lot of connectivity elsewhere to be seen instead as a utility to actually support the rest of the businesses, which I think does mean we'll focus on clients that have the maximum connectivity to the rest of the bank as opposed to any sort of stand-alone type customers. And I think that's the right thing to do.  So I can certainly commit to at least that CHF35 billion reduction, but it may end up being more than that, Piers, as we actually look forward. I would just remind everybody that prime is a relatively low ROA business. And I think that we can actually deploy that leverage at higher returns elsewhere in the bank, and I think that's what we're going to do as well as boosting our ratio to above 4%.  And I think in terms of sort of immediate actions, I'll be candid, it's what Thomas has said already. The immediate action is to look at any time, some immediate lessons learned from the U.S. hedge fund matter and make sure that those are addressed as a priority. That may include the Delta One business, which does not come through in terms of leverage as opposed to this being primarily a leverage goal. It's a risk-reduction exercise as well as being a leverage goal. So just to be clear on that particular point.  I think the second point in terms of Wealth Management loan growth. I think we've been clear that we did see some reduction in our lending growth last year, which I think hitherto had been, I think, a steady and accretive growth for the bank over a period of about 5 or 6 years. Thomas was heavily involved in looking at that exercise with the Wealth Management business. We do have a very broad range of collateral across the Wealth Management businesses, some of which has absolutely no lending against whatsoever basically. There is client demand for that. And I think, therefore, in a disciplined and risk-controlled fashion, I think it's important to continue that lending expansion. And obviously, I think we've been generally pleased with the risk/return reward from that.  I think, yes, there'll be some pause in the growth here or some slowdown in the growth there because we are obviously looking very carefully, obviously, primarily at these -- the U.S. hedge fund and the Greensill matter. But obviously, the investigation, we will look beyond that. But I think one reason which we wanted to raise the mandatory, I think, was to ensure that we had sufficient capital to actually facilitate that in a steady, orderly and progressive fashion.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous Research.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Stefan Stalmann',\n","    'text': \"I have two questions, please. The first one, going back to Archegos. Do you think it's possible and maybe this is a bit too early to ask, but do you think it's possible that this could produce a very fundamental reset in how your IRB credit risk models work? I mean you have only CHF20 billion to CHF25 billion of counterparty credit risk-weighted assets on literally hundreds of billions of equity swaps and repos, et cetera. That's question #1.  Question number two goes back to the tax treatment of the Archegos-related loss. I'm not quite sure I understand what's happening here. It looks to me as if you have taken a tax credit of at least 30% against the loss in the first quarter. But there has been no increase in your deferred tax assets. So it seems that you're really assuming that you can fully offset this against taxable income during the rest of the year. Do you expect there to be an uptick or an increase in deferred tax assets later during the year? And is that what is reflected in your capital waterfall on Slide 22? Or is there no such issue?  And I was also wondering as an add-on, in which legal entity did you actually incur this loss, please?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Stefan, well, look, I think in terms of the U.S. hedge fund and counterparty credit risk exposure, I'm sure that we'll obviously be looking carefully at the capital model in respect of how we look at these types of hedge funds. But quite clearly, I think you're going to see a very substantial reduction in such Delta One type positions. And so it may become a slightly moot point, I think, Stefan, in terms of that.  I'm not sure I expect to see a broader read across in terms of this, but I'll defer that to the work that we'll do in the balance of this particular year.  I think in terms of tax treatment, it is complex. In essence, I mean just to be clear, the -- to answer your third point, the Credit Suisse International, which is the U.K. entity phased off to the U.S. hedge fund and therefore, had the credit exposure. But the risk was actually booked in a U.S. entity called BD Light in terms of the acquisition. But the client relationship was actually owned by CSI because the U.S. hedge fund dealt in both U.S. and non-U.S.-based derivatives.  Now that's relevant then to the second question really, which is in terms of the entities, you can actually offset the tax against. It clearly cannot be offset against CSAG or against Credit Suisse Schweiz or some of the other legal entities, the bank or the Hong Kong branch or anything like that. Therefore, it has to be offset against the entities that this actually relates to. And that obviously limits the tax asset that I can actually include in my balance sheet to the level I can expect to recover that over the foreseeable future, not just this year but over the longer-term future. And I don't have an expectation at this point that I'd have sufficient profitability to fully offset the tax loss that actually results from the U.S. hedge fund matter basically.  So what we're actually reflecting is the component which I actually expect to recover, not the amount. I mean to be helpful, well, sort of helpful basically, we're basically reflecting about CHF650 million of a tax credit against that sort of CHF4.4 billion. So essentially, in practical terms, it relates to just over half is something we're actually reflecting in terms of a deferred tax asset and half we're not recognizing.  So in the context of the total loss, you've got just under CHF2.5 billion of a pretax loss, which there's no tax credit. And therefore, that pushes up the effective tax rate for the year and for the first quarter. Is that helpful, Stefan? Sorry, it's not a trivial matter.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Stefan Stalmann',\n","    'text': 'Yes, I think it does help.

Firstly is just on the strategy again. Obviously, at the very detailed presentation in December last year and probably you were talking about the 10% to 12% and the investing for growth. Should we assume -- I mean, BARDA's facts the strategy stands that 10% to 12% [indiscernible] Or should we expect, as you indicated post the Investment Banking review and the new Chairman arriving that we will get a new strategic update?  And then secondly, just a follow-up question to Kian's point. I didn't quite hear your answer on the net new money, were you saying it's too early to comment? I just thought it was quite interesting, given that you said, yes, raising the convertible was also related to avoiding a negative impact on your Wealth Management business.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Yes. Look, the midterm 10% to 12% target has to be and continues to be our goal to achieve return on equity above our cost of equity, and that has to be our goal. So we will obviously calibrate this in more detail over the coming weeks and months and also we'll have strategic discussions with no, as we say in German, sacred cows. But this has to be our goal to maximize return on equity and continue to achieve a double-digit return on capital in the midterm.  On NNA, so first of all, too early to say, but there have not been major flows in either direction in the first few weeks in the second quarter.  And your question relating to capital. Again, as I think David said, there were really 3 reasons why we wanted to do this. First of all, we really want to take the whole capital debate off the table and really ensure that this is not a topic anymore, either internally or external clients or with clients or regulators. Secondly, we want to make sure that if there is a market downturn, that we have enough capital from a more defensive perspective. And the third is also to have enough capital to grow, especially in Switzerland, in IWM and in Asia.

I guess one element that arguably is missing from the capital waterfall you've outlined is potential losses from Greensill. I know ultimately, we don't know what these could be. But at the same time, there's rumors doing the rounds about whether you will or will not compensate investors for losses. So I just wanted to see if you could set the record straight as to your strategy here, whether you will compensate investors or whether as institutional investors, they should wear all of these losses?  And then the other question I had was regarding your statement on Credit Suisse Asset Management. I guess maybe it's a bit surprising, you're saying perhaps quite early on that you don't consider a sale of the business here despite [indiscernible] out. I was wondering why you're so keen to say such a statement there and whether you would, in any case, consider a merger of any sort or consider a reduction in your controlling stake there?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"So again on Greensill, we are focused on getting the cash back to our investors. That's our only focus right now, and we know this will take months and several quarters to go through, especially with respect to the 3 distinct situations. We've had a very good progress so far in terms of getting the cash back for all the others and have good visibility for a meaningful part. But through -- the 3 distinct situations that we have mentioned before are clearly going to take several months and quarters before we have clarity there. And therefore, there is absolutely no possibility at this stage to make any more comments on that.  Secondly, on CSAM, as I also said before, I always felt this should be its own division. And the issue around Greensill has accelerated that move and we created its own division and the leadership now of Ulrich Körner, as you could see from the first quarter, this business is actually doing very well with high returns. This is an important business for us. I believe very strongly that a global wealth manager needs to have strong asset management capabilities. So this is strategically important.  Having said that, we also had a very convoluted -- or still have legal entity structure around this, which is why we started the project already last fall to have a more streamlined legal entity structure around asset management. But structure follows strategy. And therefore, this is something that will take also a couple of quarters until we have that legal entity structure properly lined up.  As with other topics, be it IB, be it other areas of the bank, we will always have annual reviews, and this will -- strategic reviews, I mean, on the group level.

First is on the strategic review. Obviously, you haven't got into that yet. But will that be in discussion with the regulator and will they have an input into the future shape of the business and whether they might be able to regulate you out of certain areas that you clearly had difficulties in the past?  And then secondly is a technical one on the cap of RWA for the investment bank. Clearly, that's a step down from where you finished the quarter. I presume the CHF6 billion of RWA on Archegos is stacked in there, so we need to strip that out. But will the RMBS OpRisk inflation be in the IB? And is there any risk that you see further regulatory pressure there that actually means that cap means quite a bit of deleveraging on an RWA basis going forward?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"The strategy is the responsibility of the Board on the Swiss law and the management and not of the regulator.

Just in terms of the RWA targets, So to be clear, when I talk about reducing RWA for the Investment Bank, that is in addition to the runoff of the U.S. hedge fund buffer of CHF6.25 billion, basically. So it's -- because the FINMA Pillar 1 buffer in respect of positions obviously naturally expires as the size of the positions actually reduce. So I'm referring about a number in addition to that.  I think in terms of the OpRisk add-on, we normally split it between the IB and the Corporate Center. I've not basically really considered yet how that will be finalized basically itself in the second quarter. So I'm really thinking underlying in terms of that. So net back to where it was at the end of last year, plus the runoff of the U.S. hedge fund position basically. If that's helpful, Andrew -- Adam.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Adam Terelak',\n","    'text': \"So are there any OpRisk charges even if it's for IB specific will be shared across the bank?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"No, no, no.

I have a couple of questions left, but they're all reasonably brief. On Archegos, I don't think I was surprised by anything that you've said so far, apart from one thing. And I just want to make sure I got that right.  David, you received the question before, about the pace of the liquidation of collateral or positions. And I wrote down the response here saying that Credit Suisse achieved broadly the same prices as other prime brokers. And I wanted to make sure that, a, I got that right. And a, that the underlying implication of that is that the entirety of the CHF5 billion loss is due to poor collateral or poor margin management basically. And I think -- so a, is that accurate? b, is it true to say that the loss is entirely down to having held less margin than your peers?  And then the second question I want to ask you here. On the pace of the exit, on the one hand, you say that the pace of the exit isn't that different from everybody else. On the other hand, you say we still have 3% of our notional exposure that's outstanding. And I was wondering what is that 3%? I mean it's a month after the event. I guess, the reasonable expectation would be that at this point, you'd exited everything.  And the second question I have is on Greensill. And I'm just trying to understand this from the perspective, not of Credit Suisse, but of a client who invested in this product. So if I get this correctly, so if I'm a client and I bought 100 of Greensill, at this point, I've got 0.48 on the dollar back in cash. And I've got 0.52 on the dollar left in the residual exposure. Thomas, if I understood you correctly, Credit Suisse does not plan to step in and compensate clients at this point. I was just wondering, I mean, is there any other outcome here than to say, well, there's going to be extensive litigation, and we're going to be analyzing this for the next 2, 3 years as it runs through the court process?  And then two very brief numbers questions. Number one, David, on RWAs for the IB. If there is incremental RWA inflation from here due to regulatory intervention, does the point of RWAs will not exceed 4Q '20 levels still stand or could it be adjusted upwards?  And the second question, again, just a numbers question. On the capital issuance, what determined the size of the issue? Is it fair to say that you've maxed out on what was preapproved at the AGM and that any incremental issue from here would require AGM approval?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Well perhaps come as precise, I start basically on the first point around the U.S. hedge fund loss. Let me just sort of summarize what I said before, which is in the analysis of the position sales that Credit Suisse has completed on behalf of this U.S. hedge fund, if we look at the prices that we've achieved over the course of the last month as we've exited them, if we had executed those trades as certain prime brokers did in the first couple of days of this transaction, then I think the loss would have only been marginally higher than what we're incurring here basically. And that assumes basically that if Credit Suisse had acted in the -- to the volume we had in those first two days that any of the prime brokers would have been able to get out of those prices basically. So that's what I'm saying.  But you can't go from that only to your point, you're making around margining. Because although it's clear -- it would seem to be clear that the U.S. hedge fund had a number of concentrated similar positions across -- it would seem to be maybe as many as 8 prime brokers. It doesn't necessarily mean that they have the same proportions of that. So our loss could also reflect a different waiting a number in terms of position sizes to that owned by other houses. So there's more than 1 factor to actually complete that mathematic, so you can't make that direct link. Although clearly, the level of margining and collateral will be very much in scope for the review that the Board is conducting into the U.S. hedge fund matter, and it's clearly a risk factor in terms of this, but it's not a direct deduction from what you said. So that's the -- that would be my first point in terms of the U.S. hedge fund point.  Should I keep going on the other RWA points basically?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"And then I'll take Greensill, yes?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Yes. That sounds fine. I think your next -- well, I think question 4 was really around RWA for the Investment Bank. Look, I think we are announcing today both a constraint in terms of the IB RWA back to the end of last year as a minimum and an absolute $35 billion reduction in the amount of leverage doing. I think that's appropriate. It fits into our plans to downsize the prime and prime financing businesses. And I think that's the right thing to do and something that I'm very supportive of. I think in terms of any longer-term caps for the investment bank, I think that prejudges the review that the management will be doing. So Christian, Thomas, I, and also the work that we'll be doing with our new Chairman and the Board over the coming months, and we'll get back to you at that point. But I don't think it's really appropriate that I should bind or prejudge the Board in that decision until we've actually completed that work basically. So we'll get back to you in due course, Jernej, I think, so that's fine. Your fifth question, I think, was around the capital increase. I think to be clear, I think getting to 13%, including the mandatory on a converted basis and including the capital gain that we'll realize from the IPO today of all funds, I think, is the right level of capital for the bank to actually operate it. And I think to have a leverage ratio at least 4%, I think, is also a good thing given the calibration in Switzerland of the regime here.  I don't think necessarily that we like issuing capital at this price, and I think it needs to be done in a prudent and conservative manner. And that was something we did discuss with major shareholders going into this particular exercise. And I would say there was excess demand for this. But I'm not sure, personally, I say we would want to have issued more. But in any event, as you know, Jernej, that also matched where we were in terms of our authorized capital and in terms of our mandatory. But there was another motion to the AGM which we've now withdrawn, which would have allowed for more basically. So there was always options there. I think bottom line, I think it was the right thing to do in roughly the right size.

I will now hand over to our Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Kinner. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call to discuss our second quarter and first half 2021 results. As part of my introduction, I would like to make a few comments. Firstly, this has been an incredibly challenging first half of the year for our bank and for all our stakeholders, overshadowed by the Archegos and supply chain finance fund matters. We are taking these events very seriously and are determined to learn all the right lessons. We firmly believe we can and will emerge stronger from these events. Secondly, we have taken action. We have taken action to address many of the issues, and we will continue to do so. Regarding Archegos, we have exited all the remaining positions in early June and today have released the independent investigation report. We have proactively derisked our Prime Services business and overachieved the goals we set ourselves in the first quarter to reduce RWA and leverage exposure in the Investment Bank. We made key hires. We have reviewed our risk appetite across the bank, and we are proactively strengthening the overall risk culture across the group. Thirdly, our underlying business remains healthy. For the second quarter, we delivered a reported pretax income of CHF 830 million. And for the first half of 2021, we managed to move back into profitability on a reported basis. We achieved this despite incurring around CHF 5 billion in losses related to Archegos. This resilience is a testament to our people, our business and a global franchise that we are confident will continue to drive growth into the future. Furthermore, we strengthened our CET1 ratio to 13.7% from 12.2% at the end of the first quarter. Fourthly, we have clear priorities for the coming months, including maximizing the cash distributions to our supply chain finance fund investors and continuing to strengthen our first and second line of defense risk approach and governance. Most importantly, we remain fully focused on serving our private, corporate and institutional clients around the world. Let me be clear, we are open for business. In parallel, we shall continue our work around the group strategy review. Before I move on to the slides, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our clients for the trust they continue to place in us. I would also like to express my immense gratitude to all our employees around the world for the dedication and professionalism. They pulled together in difficult circumstances to deliver great solutions for our clients and to create sustainable value over the long term. I am very proud of what our employees are continuing to achieve every day for Credit Suisse and for all our stakeholders. With that, let me turn to Page 4. This slide summarizes the key highlights of the second quarter and outlines our resilient financial performance in the context of an enhanced risk approach and ongoing investments. During the second quarter, we reduced risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Investment Bank by USD 20 billion and USD 41 billion, respectively. At the same time, we delivered on key investments, including expansion of our Private Banking coverage teams, notably in APAC and specifically China, in technology and in other areas across the bank. We reported a pretax profit of CHF 830 million for the second quarter and the net profit attributable to shareholders of CHF 253 million. This includes a quarterly loss of approximately CHF 600 million relating to Archegos and approximately CHF 300 million gain on Allfunds. Adjusted pretax profit, excluding significant items and Archegos, was CHF 1.3 billion, reflecting the underlying strength of our business. Assets under management in our Wealth Management franchise increased to a record high CHF 853 billion, supporting robust recurring fee growth year-on-year. We saw continued strength in the Swiss Universal Bank, including the successful completion of the Neue Aargauer Bank integration, and continued momentum in the rollout of CSX, our digital retail offering. Our Investment Bank was resilient in the face of a significant reduction of risk and a less favorable trading environment. On an adjusted basis, excluding Archegos, we achieved a pretax profit of USD 601 million in the second quarter. We achieved a strong performance in Asset Management, with adjusted pretax income up 26% year-on-year. Finally, we significantly improved our capital position. Our CET1 ratio, as already mentioned, was 13.7%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6%, and our CET1 leverage ratio, 4.2%. Slide 5, please. Regarding Archegos, I will be clear. The total loss of approximately CHF 5 billion is unacceptable, and the independent report pointed to a number of failures. We have learned serious lessons and have taken multiple thorough steps to address these issues across the bank. Appropriate HR-related actions have been taken. You see here the selected key findings of the independent 160-page report, which we have made available in full on our website. The findings in the report included the failure to effectively manage risk in Prime Services by both lines of defense; a lack of escalation and of controlling limit excesses; a failure to discharge supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in risk; as well as insufficient prioritization of risk mitigation measures, including moving clients from static to dynamic margining. However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent, nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking or the existing systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns. On the right side of this page are selected recommendations, including investment of additional resources and risk, transitioning of clients to dynamic margining and reexamination of counterparty risk appetite and controls. The recommendations listed have either been completed or are in progress. Next slide, please. Let me turn to the supply chain finance fund matter. Credit Suisse Asset Management's priority remains the recovery of funds for investors in the 4 funds. We have an upcoming fourth cash payment planned for the first half of August. Total cash paid out and current cash and cash equivalents stands at 66% of net asset value as of February 25. The expected overall recovery of the non-focus areas is greater than 90%. With regard to the 3 focus areas, we plan to pursue every possible avenue to maximize recovery and are fully engaged with the respective parties. Finally, we continue to work on filing insurance claims. Slide 7, please. This slide shows our second quarter and first half results on both a reported and adjusted basis. While supported PTI for the quarter was CHF 813 million, our group adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items and Archegos, was CHF 1.3 billion. For the first half of 2021, our reported pretax income was a modest CHF 56 million; whilst the group adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items and Archegos, was CHF 4.9 billion, reflecting the strong underlying performance of our businesses. David Mathers will provide more details on this shortly. Slide 8, please. Here, you see the underlying results, how they stack up against the past few years. On the same adjusted basis, the second quarter 2021 pretax income of CHF 1.3 billion is the second highest second quarter result in the last 6 years. The first half of 2021 was the best first half over the same period, both in terms of underlying net revenues and pretax income. Next page, please. As I mentioned at the outset, we recognize the critical importance of investing to seize growth opportunities. As you see on the left of the slide, on the business side, we have made significant new hires in APAC to build out our leading franchise. Our relationship manager base rose from 600 to 650 in the first half of 2021. We have further expanded our IWM mid-market M&A advisory capabilities, and we continue to invest in our GTS solutions within the Investment Bank and elsewhere in the Investment Bank. We continued the build-out of our Mainland China presence and deepened our footprint in other faster growth markets. We are making ongoing investments in our CSX digital platform here in Switzerland, and we are prioritizing our investments in cybersecurity. Next page, please. At Credit Suisse, the health and well-being of our people is a top priority for us. As you can see from the left-hand side of the slide, whilst we would like to see more of our colleagues come back to the office, we have taken a cautious approach to returning to the office based on conditions in individual countries and regions. As far as turnover is concerned, after a relatively quiet 2020, a year when everyone was getting used to the new normal of working from home due to the pandemic, industry-wide turnover has clearly increased in 2021. This is also true for Credit Suisse, but let me give you a little perspective here. Our turnover is very much in line with the past 7 years. Whilst we have had some regretted departures, notably in capital markets and advisory in the U.S., we have been investing in new hires across all major divisions, including in the Investment Bank and in Asset Management. Next slide, please. Our group-wide assets under management grew 8% year-to-date to a record CHF 1.6 trillion, which should support recurring revenues going forward. Our group NNA number for the second quarter was negative CHF 5 billion but stands at a positive CHF 24 billion for the first half. We have seen positive market performance in Q2. In addition, we have seen strong growth in mandate penetration to 30% in the second quarter 2021, and we are on track to achieve our medium-term ambition of around 33%. Next page, please. We have generated strong client business volume growth across our Wealth Management businesses. Our ambition is to grow annual client business volume by mid-single digits for SUB, mid- to high single digits for IWM and double digits in APAC. We comfortably achieved those objectives in the last 12 months, as you can see on this page. As you also can see from the bottom of the chart, we are also showing the quarterly NNA numbers for the 3 Wealth Management businesses. Given the overall circumstances as well as various derisking measures, we did see net asset outflows in the second quarter, notably in APAC. However, over CHF 4 billion of these APAC outflows were due to proactive derisking measures related to a small number of clients. We have also continued to see solid gross inflows across all 3 of our Wealth Management businesses. For the first half of the year, Wealth Management NNA stands at a positive CHF 7 billion. Slide 13. Wealth Management-related adjusted revenues, excluding significant items, rose 1% year-on-year in the first half of 2021. On the same basis, strong year-on-year growth in recurring commissions and fees and slightly higher transactional activity more than offset lower net interest income. Slide 14, please. The underlying strength of our Wealth Management-related business was demonstrated by the 32% growth in adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020. The strength was seen across businesses, notably APAC. Return on regulatory capital in our Wealth Management-related businesses on the same basis was 24% in the first half of 2021, up from 19% 1 year earlier. The Asia Pacific region on the next page, we are providing some details on the APAC division. The APAC region is absolutely core to Credit Suisse's growth strategy. And as you can see on this slide, the region accounted for 19% of the group's adjusted net revenues, excluding significant items in the first half of the year. Adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items in the first half of 2021, increased 75% year-on-year with a return on regulatory capital of 35% on the same basis. Slide 16, please. As you know, we established Asset Management as a separate division effective 1st of April 2021. We're emphasizing the strategic importance of this business by doing so for the bank and its clients. Its results underscore the importance of this division. In the first half of 2021, adjusted Asset Management revenues, excluding significant items, were up 31%, driven by recurring management fees and performance and placement revenues. Pretax income on the same basis grew nearly fivefold year-on-year. AUM increased 11% year-on-year to CHF 470 billion, and net new assets increased solidly to CHF 11.6 billion in the first half of the year with contributions across index, equities and credit. Slide 17, please. The underlying performance of our Investment Bank has been resilient in the face of the Archegos matter, a more conservative approach to risk management and normalization of sales and trading revenues after an exceptional second quarter of 2020. Sales and trading saw a significant normalization in revenues from the first quarter 2021 performance. We saw multiple strength in securitized products, particularly our #1 ranked asset finance franchise. Whilst our M&A revenues declined in the second quarter, we have a strong M&A advisory pipeline up both sequentially and notably on a year-on-year basis. And our pipeline across equity capital markets and leveraged finance are also very healthy. Slide 18. In the second quarter, Investment Bank revenues, excluding Archegos, were down 23% from exceptional prior year levels. However, for the first half of 2021, revenues on the same basis grew 21% year-on-year, driven in particular by capital market and advisory revenues which were up 82% year-on-year. Slide 19. Given the additional Archegos charge in the second quarter, Investment Bank pretax income was negative USD 86 million, However, adjusted pretax income, excluding Archegos in Q2, was USD 601 million. And for the full first half, adjusted pretax income on the same basis stood at USD 2.8 billion. Slide 20, please. It was roughly 1 year ago that I announced the launch of our Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions function, SRI, to help deliver on our ambition to be a sustainability leader. In the last year, SRI has made excellent progress executing its strategy and delivering value to clients and stakeholders. On the right side of this slide, you see a few highlights. These include CHF 133 billion in assets managed accordingly to -- according to sustainability criteria at the end of the second quarter, which is an increase of 13% quarter-on-quarter. A great highlight for the second quarter for both SRI and the bank as a whole was our inaugural Sustainability Week. We hosted around 5,000 virtual attendees over the course of the summit that began in late June. We welcomed around 70 speakers to share ideas on how to drive sustainable growth. I was delighted to participate along with Lydie Hudson, Marisa Drew and members of the Board of Directors, and we are looking forward to future summits. Page 21, please. Before I hand over to David, let me summarize our key priorities for the months ahead. As previously discussed, we are continuing progress in cash distributions to the supply chain finance funds with the investigation expected to be concluded in the third quarter. We are recalibrating our risk appetite at both the group and divisional levels, are strengthening our key risk management processes and risk and control infrastructure. In terms of governance, we have announced 2 important executive appointments related to technology and risk: Joanne Hannaford as Chief Technology and Operations Officer; and David Wildermuth as Chief Risk Officer, both starting in early 2022. I'm proud to have been able to recruit 2 such high-caliber talents for our executive team. We are more focused than ever to provide best-in-class service and advice to our private, corporate and institutional clients globally. And finally, we initiated a joint group strategy review by the Board of Directors and the Executive Board with the goal to clearly define and articulate a long-term vision and a midterm plan expected to be finalized by the end of the year. With that, I would like to turn over to David.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much, Thomas, and good morning, everybody. Now before I take you through the financial results in more detail, I'd just like to second Thomas' comments. Our priority this quarter has been to ensure that we deal with and mitigate the challenges posed by the default of Archegos and by the supply chain finance matter. A core part of this has been to do whatever we can to ensure that there's no repetition of these events. We've taken a number of steps in this regard, and there will be more to come this year as we work our way through the strategic review. Fundamentally, we prioritized a more conservative approach to risk in both the first and the second lines of defense. This has been most apparent in the Investment Bank, where as you can see, we've substantially reduced the size of our Prime Service business and ensure that client accounts in this business have been fully migrated to dynamic margining, and that was completed by the end of the second quarter. And it's clearly one of the key lessons learned from the Archegos matter. That said, whilst we've been very focused on ensuring that we have a resized Prime Services and we have conducted a thorough and full risk review across the whole bank, we've also continued and sustained a number of the core investments that we've spoken about before, most notably in Wealth Management. We have significantly expanded the number of relationship managers in our APAC business, and we continue to build on our investments in onshore China. Now against this backdrop and accepting that these results are marred by the impact on shareholders from the second quarter Archegos loss of CHF 594 million, I think the firm has nonetheless delivered a resilient underlying performance. As Thomas has already outlined, both total assets under management and our Wealth Management client business volumes have risen to new highs of CHF 1.63 trillion and CHF 1.36 trillion, respectively. On an underlying basis, excluding the Archegos loss but also excluding other significant items such as the gain relating to the Allfunds transaction, we have delivered an adjusted profit of CHF 1.31 billion, close to last year's figure of CHF 1.48 billion. But I'd also like to highlight the progress that we've made in strengthening our capital ratios. These are well above the levels that I targeted at the end of the first quarter, with our CET1 ratio increasing to 13.7% and our leverage ratio to 4.2% in terms of the CET1 ratio and 6.0% in terms of the Tier 1 ratio. With that, let me turn, please, to Slide 23. I'll start with the reported numbers, and I'll deal in more detail on the next slide in terms of the reconciliation between the reported and the adjusted totals. Reported net revenues for the second quarter were 18% lower than in 2020 at CHF 5.1 billion. That includes a small increase in Wealth Management-related revenues driven by the strength in recurring fees, but this was more than offset by the 41% decline in Investment Bank revenues, which is due to a combination of the Archegos losses, the reduction in the size of our Prime Service business and the less volatile trading environment compared to the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Clearly, one positive note for this quarter has been the improvement in the macroeconomic environment, which has resulted in us releasing a further CHF 168 million in CECL-related charges. With regard to the tax charge, when we reported our numbers for the first quarter, I advised that the effective tax rate for the year was likely to remain significantly elevated before returning to a more normal level in 2022. The rate for the second quarter was 70%, similar to the 69% ratio that we incurred in the first quarter. I think just to remind you, the reason for this higher tax charge is due to the fact that whilst the whole of the Archegos tax loss -- the Archegos loss is tax deductible and will remain available for the group to offset against net income in future years. In terms of financial reporting, I can only recognize just over half of that Archegos tax credit on the balance sheet in the current financial year. Reported net income attributable to shareholders as a consequence, therefore, stood at CHF 253 million, which equates to a return on tangible equity of 2.6%. Let me turn now to the next slide. Just let me give you some more detail, please, on the difference between the adjusted and the reported numbers for both the second quarter of this year and the same period last year. The second quarter of 2020 only had a small number of significant adjusting items, a CHF 134 million gain on our stake in the Pfandbriefbank and offset by a major litigation charge of CHF 61 million. Now the second quarter of 2021 saw 3 substantial adjusting items. First, the CHF 594 million loss on Archegos, of which CHF 493 million related to revenues, CHF 70 million to credit provisions and CHF 31 million related to additional associated expenses, including those relating to the Archegos investigation itself. As Thomas has already confirmed, we exited all of our remaining positions resulting from the Archegos issue during the course of the second quarter. Second, we had a gain on Allfunds, which I think you know we successfully listed at the beginning of this quarter. We continue to hold a reduced 9.4% interest in the company and have made a gain in the second quarter of further CHF 298 million on that interest. Finally, just in terms of substantial items, we've taken a further CHF 159 million in net major litigation provisions. Now to be clear, these relate entirely to pre-existing litigation matters and are not in respect of either Archegos or the supply chain finance matter. Given that the cases for which we've taken these provisions are subject to ongoing legal discussions, I will not be able to give any further details beyond what we've included in the financial report today. Now with regard to the other items in the reconciliation, you can see a charge of CHF 45 million for restructuring expenses, primarily relating to the completion of the measures that we announced last year. Next slide, please. Let me turn now to our capital ratios. I'll focus first on the RWA and leverage numbers and then give some more details on the reconciliation in the following slide. With regard to RWA usage, you may recall that at the end of the first quarter, we said that by the end of 2021, we would reduce Investment Bank RWAs to below end 2Q -- sorry, end of 2020 levels and reduce leverage exposure in the Investment Bank by at least USD 35 billion, primarily through reductions in our Prime Service businesses. As you can see, we exceeded that objective in the second quarter. With regard to the Investment Bank, we've reduced RWAs by CHF 19 billion since the end of the first quarter and reduced leverage exposure by CHF 40 billion. At the same time, whilst we have been conducting a thorough risk review across the entire bank, we have broadly maintained levels of RWA and leverage in our Wealth Management businesses. Overall, this has brought RWAs down from CHF 303 billion at the end of the first quarter to CHF 284 billion at the end of the second quarter. You'll note that with regard to leverage, we've continued to take a conservative view on liquidity, with HQLA increasing by CHF 21 billion quarter-on-quarter. I'll talk about the capital ratios in more detail on the next slide, but you can see that our CET1 ratio has improved by 150 basis points from the end of the first quarter to 13.7% now, and our CET1 leverage ratio has improved by 40 basis points to 4.2%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 50 basis points higher at 6.0%. Now let me just walk through the numbers in a little bit more detail. We ended the first quarter of the year with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%. I said at that time that we expect to see further losses of approximately CHF 600 million with regard to the Archegos matter, which has proved to be the case. And this has reduced the CET1 ratio by 20 basis points. However, the elimination of the risk positions from Archegos has removed the temporary add-on relating to these positions, which was imposed at the end of the first quarter, which has improved the ratio by 24 basis points. Now moving across the Allfunds gain, combined with the opportunity to reduce our position in the company to less than 10% of the IPO has led to an improvement of 28 basis points. The mandatory convertible note capital raise of CHF 1.7 billion has added 55 basis points. And I would note that FINMA has now confirmed this can be treated as part of our common equity base. The reduction in Investment Bank RWAs though has delivered the most substantial improvement, totaling 67 basis points and taking us to the 13.7% that I've already mentioned. Now I'm not going to go through the corresponding points in respect to the CET1 leverage ratio, but as you can see here, the action we've taken have improved our position from 3.8% to 4.2% at the end of the second quarter. Now let me turn to financial performance. Clearly, one of the strongest points has been the growth in assets under management and in client business volume within our Wealth Management businesses over the course of the last year. We've seen continued growth in overall client business volume in SUB Private Clients, in IWM and in APAC. Within SUB Private Clients, client business volume has increased by 9%, in IWM by 20% and in APAC by 24%. Whilst we have seen net asset outflows of CHF 7.3 billion across these businesses during the second quarter, $4.2 billion of this was due to certain derisking actions that we have taken in APAC. And I think that the progress in AUM and in client business volume demonstrates the momentum in the Wealth Management franchise. Now in terms of business performance, we saw a drop in net interest income compared to the first quarter of the year, which reflected lower treasury revenues as well as costs relating to the MCN issuance program. Recurring commissions and fees have grown strongly, reflecting the growth in the AUM base and increased mandate penetration, which now stands at 30% compared to 28% in the same quarter of last year and on track to achieve our ambition of approximately 33%. We have seen, though, a reduction in transaction-based revenues. This reflects lower levels of client activity and lower market volatility in the second quarter compared to what we saw a year ago and indeed in the first quarter of this year. Let me now turn to operating expenses. We saw earlier that operating expenses were down 1% year-on-year, and what I show here are the adjusted numbers, excluding significant items and excluding Archegos across the business divisions and the Corporate Center for both the quarter and for last year. Now if we look at the second quarter, the total on a constant currency basis is 5% lower year-on-year at CHF 4.06 billion. As was the case in the first quarter, the main driver across the divisions is a significant reduction in the compensation and benefits line, driven by reduced levels of variable compensation. As you'd expect, this mainly reflects the impact on our shareholders of the Archegos losses that we took in the first and the second quarters and our response to that. You'll note that costs have risen in both APAC and in Asset Management in the quarter. In the case of APAC, this reflects the investments in the franchise, including in our China onshore presence and in the expansion of our Private Banking coverage teams. With regard to Asset Management, the increase primarily reflects 3 factors: first, certain severance costs that do not qualify for restructuring treatment; second, the realization of investments in partnerships and the associated costs for that; and third, the cost of our internal investigations into the supply chain finance matter. Next slide, please. Now here, I provide an update on our provision for credit losses, both specific and CECL-related over the course of the last 2 quarters. You'll remember that we ended the first quarter with a total allowance for credit losses of CHF 6.3 billion, of which CHF 4.43 billion was related to Archegos. During the second quarter, we took CHF 143 million of non-CECL-related provisions, but this was more than offset by a release of CECL-related provisions of CHF 168 million. We saw net write-offs of CHF 92 million in the quarter, and FX and other matters reduced the total by CHF 80 million to an overall total of CHF 6.14 billion by the end of June. Now I'd now like to turn to the divisional summaries, please. And unless I state otherwise, just for clarity, I will be referring to the adjusted numbers, excluding significant numbers, items and the Archegos loss. And I'd like to start, as usual, with the Swiss Universal Bank. Net revenues for the quarter were 1% lower year-on-year, CHF 1.33 billion. This was driven by higher recurring revenues on the back of expanded client business volumes, albeit offset by reductions in GTS revenues and in deposit income. Our mandate penetration increased to 39%, and that compares to 36% for the same quarter of last year. SUB benefited from further reductions in credit provisions as the macroeconomic environment continued to improve. We took CHF 26 million of new provisions in the quarter, consistent with levels for the first quarter of the year, and that was more than offset by CHF 47 million in CECL-related provision leases. Operating expenses were 4% lower year-on-year at CHF 758 million, helped by continued synergies from the completion of the integration of Neue Aargauer Bank, which resulted in an adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, of CHF 592 million, up 13% year-on-year. With regard to net new assets, our Private Clients business saw net outflows of CHF 0.9 billion in the quarter, offset by net inflows of CHF 1.5 billion for the quarter in our corporate and institutional client businesses. For the first half, these business lines saw net inflows of CHF 1.3 billion and CHF 5.4 billion, respectively. I'd now like to turn to International Wealth Management, which, as you know, we report separately to Asset Management. Net revenues for the division were 11% lower, CHF 803 million, and this was primarily due to lower transaction-based revenues which were 33% down year-on-year, driven by lower client activity and reduced GTS revenues as well as by a fall in net interest income, which was adversely impacted by the weaker U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc. Net interest income was 14% lower year-on-year, partly due to FX moves and partly due to lower rates on deposit income, but this was, to a degree, offset by income from higher loan volumes. Against this, recurring commissions and fees improved by 16% year-on-year, driven by a 20% increase in client business volume. Mandate penetration for the division was steady at 34%. A release of CHF 50 million for CECL-related provisions more than offset new provisions for credit losses of CHF 25 million in the quarter. And total operating expenses for the period improved by 7%, driven by lower variable compensation accruals. And this resulted in an adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, of CHF 225 million, marginally higher than for the same quarter of last year. But I would point out, this does include an adverse currency impact on translation of CHF 14 million. Now with regard to net new assets, we saw net outflows totaling CHF 0.3 billion for the division, with net new money from Western European clients, offset by outflows in emerging markets. For the first half, IWM saw net inflows of CHF 6.9 billion, equivalent to a growth rate of 4%. Let me turn now to Asia Pacific. After the strong start to the year, APAC saw net revenues declined by 8% year-on-year to USD 770 million, primarily due to a 22% decline in transaction-based revenues. This was largely driven by lower GTS and IBCM revenues, partly offset by substantially lower mark-to-market losses and improved levels of Private Clients activity. As in the other 2 Wealth Management divisions, we saw strong growth in recurring commissions and fees which were 39% higher year-on-year at USD 115 million, with mandate penetration higher at 15% compared to 12% in the same period of last year as well as by increased fund volumes. Net interest income was 2% higher year-on-year at USD 276 million, with lower deposit margins partly offset by growth in deposit volumes and net loans. A release in CECL-related provisions of USD 19 million resulted in a net USD 6 million in provision for credit losses in the quarter. Total operating expenses were 7% higher year-on-year at USD 586 million, largely due to the investments in the franchise that I mentioned before, with the weakening of the U.S. dollars also having an adverse impact on translated Swiss franc costs into APAC. The result was a decline in adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, of 13% year-on-year to USD 178 million. In terms of net new assets, whilst the outflows of USD 6.7 billion was disappointing, this was primarily driven by USD 4.2 billion of outflows resulting from the deliberate derisking measures that we implemented in the second quarter. These outflows mean that the NNA figure for the first half was a negative USD 1.3 billion. Let me turn now to Asset Management. Now first, I'd like to reiterate that Credit Suisse Asset management's top priority remains the return of cash to those of our clients who are invested in the Greensill supply chain finance funds, which we started to wind down at the beginning of March. As we highlighted earlier, we're planning our fourth cash distribution to fund investors. To date, the total cash position, including payments already made and cash recovered and remaining in the funds, is approximately USD 6.6 billion or 2/3 of the fund's net asset values at the end of February. Now whilst work on the supply chain finance funds continues at pace and remains a key priority, the division has delivered a good quarter. Net revenues were 12% higher year-on-year at CHF 404 million, driven by a 38% increase in performance and placement fees but partly offset by investment and partnership income, which was 15% lower year-on-year. Although as I mentioned before, total operating expenses were 8% higher at CHF 297 million, the division still generated an adjusted pretax income of CHF 106 million, an increase of 26% year-on-year. Now notwithstanding the supply chain finance matter, we had positive net new asset inflows of CHF 1.3 billion into our Asset Management division for the quarter, which contributed to the assets under management total at the end of the second quarter increasing to CHF 471 billion, 11% higher year-on-year. And then by the way, in the last 4 quarters, the Asset Management division has seen inflows of CHF 22.9 billion. Now let me just conclude then, please, with a few words on the Investment Bank. Clearly, the results from the Investment Bank were adversely affected by the loss relating to the exit of our remaining Archegos positions in the second quarter. As I've mentioned already, these totaled USD 542 million in revenue losses, USD 77 million in credit provisions and USD 33 million in related expenses. A second factor in our performance was the resizing of the Prime Service business and the more conservative approach to risk that we have been taking across the bank. We said in the first quarter that we would reduce leverage exposure in the Investment Bank by at least USD 35 billion, and we have, in fact, reduced it by USD 41 billion or 11% quarter-on-quarter, notwithstanding higher HQLA. We have also reduced RWAs in the Investment Bank by USD 20 billion quarter-on-quarter. Now I think unsurprisingly, this resizing of the Prime Service business has had an adverse impact on revenues within the equity sales and trading businesses, where adjusted revenues, excluding the Archegos loss, of USD 514 million, 17% lower year-on-year. But I think separate from these measures, we have delivered a more resilient performance elsewhere in our Investment Bank. Whilst we have seen some declines in certain business lines compared to a year ago, we have also seen continued outperformance in securitized products and a 23% increase in capital markets revenues, excluding the mark-to-market gains that we saw in leveraged finance in the second quarter of 2020. Advisory revenues were 34% lower at USD 123 million, primarily due to the delayed deals closings, with a number of transactions being pushed back into the next quarter. As Thomas has already commented, the pipeline, both in capital markets and in advisory, is at high levels as we go into the second half of 2021. Now as with the other divisions, we saw a net release of provisions for credit losses, in this case, of USD 61 million, of which $58 million were CECL-related. Our adjusted operating expenses were 5% lower year-on-year at USD 1.76 billion, primarily due to reduced compensation costs. In terms of profitability in the Investment Bank, as I've said before, the completion of the exit of the Archegos position has resulted in a pretax loss for the second quarter of USD 86 million on a reported basis. Now excluding Archegos and making the other usual adjustments, our pretax income was USD 601 million compared to USD 979 million a year ago. With that, I would like to conclude my part of this morning's presentation and hand back to Thomas. Thank you very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: I actually suggest we directly go into Q&A.\\nKinner Lakhani : So we will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. At the end of the Q&A, Thomas will provide some concluding remarks. [Operator Instructions] Sharon, let's open the line, please.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: I've got 2 questions, and they're both on the deleveraging particularly, kind of quarter-on-quarter. So really, my first question is about the Investment Bank because, of course, you have kind of shown higher, I suppose, deleveraging numbers than we expected. And of course, part of it or a large part of it was Prime Services. But is there any other kind of some business line or any other, yes, business that you would like to highlight from the perspective of the residual of that deleveraging to be coming from? And my second question is really around the risk-weighted assets fall quarter-on-quarter also within wealth. We have seen your risk-weighted assets coming down. We have seen your loans coming down quarter-on-quarter, particularly in APAC as well. Could you give us a sense what was happening kind of there apart from your kind of derisking that you have mentioned? And then so could you give us a sense, when you talk about this reduction in risk appetite currently, what does it actually mean? What sort of constraints are you operating on from a risk perspective?\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much, Magdalena, and thank you very much for the question. I think in terms of deleveraging, the primary focus was the resizing of the prime business within the Investment Bank. And as you know, it was partly offset by an increase in HQLA, but there's nothing else particularly to highlight, Magdalena. I think in terms of risk-weighted assets, within -- across the bank overall, I'd just refer you back to the table which we showed on Page 27 of the deck basically. So what you see here is, obviously, is -- and this is in Swiss franc terms, is a CHF 19 billion reduction in the Investment Banking RWA and a CHF 3 billion increase in SUB, IWM, APAC, Asset Management and CC. But you are correct because the CC number includes, as we've noted, opposite, a CHF 6 billion increase in operational risk RWA, which we've warned about before and flowed through. So net-net, the Wealth Management division was slightly down year-on-year. I mean, I don't think there's anything specific I'd like to highlight. I mean, I think one point I did bring out was the fact that we did review very carefully the businesses across the entire bank. There's been a very thorough risk review, which is being conducted by the tactical crisis committee of the Board of Directors. And that has included the Wealth Management operations as well as the Investment Bank. And we did basically result -- that did result in $4.2 billion of net new asset outflows within APAC, relating to certain clients where we did decide to significantly restrict our activities. But there was nothing broad in terms of that. I think it was fair and appropriate that I think following both the Greensill episodes and the Archegos issues, that we did do a thorough review of our risk appetite, which was led by our interim Chief Risk Officer, Jo Oechslin, and in conjunction with the tactical crisis committee of the Board, and we then continued a thorough risk review across the bank. And I think that taking that more conservative approaches has been the right thing to do in the second quarter. But clearly, the bulk of the reductions have clearly been borne by prime and by the Investment Bank.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: And David, are we likely to see more of those kind of reviews of clients into the third and fourth quarter, similar thing that you've described happened in APAC in the second quarter? Or would you think that, that process is largely complete?\\nDavid Mathers: That process is largely complete. I think you can understand that given the events of February and March, and this was done on an accelerated basis immediately after that. And as I said, the tactical crisis committee has been going through our business portfolio one by one, and obviously, [Zeth] is an executive member of that committee, and I think it has been a good and thorough process, but the bulk of that has now been completed. I mean, I think just generally speaking, in terms of group-wide RWA and leverage, I think you should probably assume that the levels pertaining at the end of the second quarter where I roughly expect to operate for the third quarter, if that’s of some help, Magdalena.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.\\nBenjamin Goy : Two questions, please, also one on Wealth Management and one on the Investment Bank. In Wealth Management, transaction-based revenues were down and also underperforming peers. So just wondering on some thoughts. How much is lower risk appetite? How much was client derisk taking? And how this fits into your strategic review? Should we assume once that is done for a division, so to say they can be more capital allocated even before it's formally announced in end of the year? And then secondly, in the Investment Bank, you mentioned the $100 million impact from the prime reduction. So is Q2 the new run rate, of course, with all the moving parts in the market? Or do you think there could be a knock-on effect into the second half further impacting revenues here?\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. It's Thomas here. I will take the first question, and then David will take the second question. So as you can see on Page 13, we did have weaker transactional revenues in the second quarter, which was primarily driven by the reduction in RWAs and risk and has been obviously driven by also lower client activity. But at the same time, as you can see, for the first full half, we are actually up in terms of transactional revenues, and we expect this to normalize again as we go into the second half of the year. Recurring has been on a positive trend given our increase in assets under management, and we continue to expect that. And we expect net interest income to stabilize where we are. Also, net interest income has been obviously impacted short term to some extent from our more conservative risk approach.\\nDavid Mathers : Yes. I think on the second point, I mean, I don’t particularly want to add to the outlook statement that we’ve actually made already. And as I said though, I think, to an answer to the previous question, I would expect the bank to offer at roughly constant levels of RWA and leverage through the third quarter. I think a few points really. As I’ve indicated, the drop in transaction activity in the Wealth Management business was primarily driven by GTS-related revenues, where we saw us much lower levels of client activity, but also given the importance of derivative products within GTS, a substantial fall in volatility in markets in which we actually operate in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter a year ago, which has a significant impact on GTS revenues. And I think I did note earlier that within the Wealth Management-related revenues in APAC, the IBCM component of that was actually down as well. So I think just looking forward, I said I’m not going to add to the outlook statement. I would point out that the third quarter is normally seasonally lower than what you’d normally see, and we’ll see how that seasonal pattern actually develops, but it’s always just worth remembering that. And I would also point out that whilst we do expect to see a more normalization in that, our transaction revenues per unit in Asset Management do remain comparatively high as a consequence of our business model. So I think that’s just worth keeping in mind.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Goel from Barclays.\\nAmit Goel: So yes, I'll ask 2 questions as well. The first one, just trying to get a sense, I appreciate you don't prejudge the outcome, but -- so the strategic review, just if we can get a bit more color in terms how the process works, how that's being conducted, how decisions will be made and the kind of trade-offs and the processes involved in that, that would be helpful. And secondly, just coming back to the Slide 10 in terms of the, I guess, employee hiring and attrition. I'm just curious, if you were to cut back instead of total employees but rather just looking at, for example, MDs or material risk takers, does it give the same picture? Or is it then slightly different?\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. Thank you, Amit. So with the strategic review, as we disclosed a couple of weeks ago, we did – we kicked off the process with a strategic offsite where the full Board of Directors and the full Executive Board participated, and this is now ongoing. We are looking at, obviously, our businesses, the strength and weaknesses, our portfolios. And this is a process that we will do very carefully and we’ll – we have a new Chairman on board who has been not even 3 months with this bank, which is 165 years old. So we are determined to come out with a clear long-term vision for this bank and a concrete 3-year plan. And this is something that we are doing together with the Board of Directors and Executive Board. We are having detailed sessions amongst the ExB as well on these different divisions and business areas. And the clear goal is to come out with an articulated and clear plan at the latest by the end of the year. So that is about the process. In terms of the employees, to your question, yes, absolutely, this is the full picture of all employees. If you look MDs, we do have a slight negative net movement in terms of MDs joiners versus leavers. But again, we are very much focused on investing in the business. We are replacing people through internal candidates and talents and, where needed, through external talents.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher from UBS.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: Yes. Just briefly again on the $4.2 billion derisking in APAC. Can you describe to us a little bit what the tactical crisis committee and generally, you, as a management team, didn't like about these positions? Was it LTVs, the liquidity of collateral counterparty, concentration, size of these positions? Just be interested to hear what you didn't like about these positions. And then secondly, on the supply chain finance situation, is there -- and you mentioned the 66%. Is there a, call it, a critical threshold you have in mind, above which you feel comfortable having limited side effects, even like litigation issues and stuff? Like is this -- I mean, we are at 66% now. Is it 70%, 80%, 90%? Or how should -- do you have a view on that one? That would be helpful.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. On the $4.2 billion NNA outflows in APAC, these were linked to situations where we wanted to exit clients either for risk or for other reasons. And this is a small number of clients, but we feel very good about that, having exited those positions. But there are various considerations where I would not like to go into the details. But this was a one-off move that we had to do and wanted to do, and I do not really want to comment more on individual clients. And on supply chain front, we really want to work through the pipeline of both the focus as well as the non-focus areas. As we say on our page that we have more than 60 internal and external experts working through this pipeline. We are in discussions with the obligors. We are in discussions with insurance. And this is quite a lot of work, but we are making steady process, and we will update you as we make progress. And there’s not really one particular number we have in mind. We just want to go through the entire book and make sure that we maximize the cash proceeds for the investors and really pursue all avenues to maximize recovery.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.\\nAndrew Coombs: Perhaps, a follow-up on the net new money. You've obviously flagged the $4.2 billion derisking in Asia. But perhaps outside of that, you could talk a bit more about the customer flows that you're seeing in the 3 different segments. And in particular, I'm interested in what the month-to-month progression was. So was it a case that you saw this improve as you move through the quarter? Did it deteriorate as you go through the quarter? What does the momentum look like on the underlying customer flows across the 3 segments? That would be my first question. Second question is more broadly on your outlook statement. You talk about a more conservative approach to risk in the near term, whilst you're finalizing your long-term vision and your midterm plan. In terms of the next couple of quarters, you've alluded that the prime balance reduction is done, but should we expect ongoing revenue attrition given some of the steps you're taking with your approach to risk?\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I will take the first one, and then maybe David can take the second one. So we did see positive inflows in the third month of the quarter, so in June. So April, May was really -- were 2 months where we had outflows and where we also proactively addressed some of the client situations that I was alluding to also in APAC. But actually, June was positive inflows in all 3 divisions. And so the momentum into the end of the quarter was very positive. So look, this is something we had to do. We wanted to work through. We clearly also had some side effects from our more cautious approach to lending volumes. We had clear targets for each of the divisions, including Asia, including SUB and including IWM in terms of RWA and leverage for the end of the second quarter because we were determined to achieve our targets that we have set ourselves. And that is obviously one of the side effects that some of the NNA or AUMs that were linked to lending volumes also came down. But as I said, the momentum into the end of the quarter was positive. And if you look at the first half as a whole, we are at around CHF 7 billion now for Wealth Management and CHF 24 billion if you include the institutional Asset Management business. So absolutely decent NNA flow for year-to-date.\\nDavid Mathers: Yes. I think, obviously, a lot of curiosity around the outlook statement. I don’t think there’s much I can really add. I mean, I think, first, I’d just reiterate usual seasonality to just – let’s not overlook at that point. Secondly, although in terms of the Prime Service impact, the $100 million that Thomas mentioned – alluded to in terms of the second quarter impact, I mean, let’s just be clear. After the Archegos incident, Credit Suisse, we moved, we focused extremely hard on, a, the resizing of the prime portfolio; and b, shifting any clients who are on static margining to dynamic margining. And those 2 things were the priority for the business during the quarter, and we moved as fast as possible in terms of that. So I think you’ve seen the revenue impact in the second quarter. We’re obviously not going to be resizing the prime business upwards going forward. So I think we’ve moved it to a new lower steady state basically. But I mean, this wasn’t a steady process during the quarter. We executed on this. It was fairly obvious what needed to be done, and we executed on that resizing as fast and as quickly as possible in terms of that. I think beyond that, as I said, I think in terms of the capital reduction reallocation process, we did complete that during the quarter. And as I said, I would expect to operate a broadly unchanged levels during the third quarter. And I think you’ll see more normal levels of activity beyond that. But I think certainly, second quarter, the priority was dealing with Archegos. It was dealing with the Greensill-related supply chain funds. That’s unfortunate, but I think it was the right thing to do on behalf of the shareholders, on behalf of the bank overall.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from Exane.\\nJeremy Sigee : Just a couple of follow-ups on that last point, actually, the restructuring, et cetera. So 2 questions really on it. The first is that the RWA reduction being bigger than expected, it's also actually bigger than what I thought the whole of the prime brokerage was in terms of RWAs. So I just wondered what sort of decisions that involved in terms of going further than targeted? And particularly, what decisions it involved in other areas outside prime, if it did? And then the second question relating to IB. Just sort of on the people side, we've seen a lot of reports about departures and also you'd announced retention packages. So I just wondered, are people leaving despite retention returns? Or is it that the retention effort is more focused on critical areas or something like that?\\nThomas Gottstein: Maybe, David, do you want to take the first question? I'll take the second.\\nDavid Mathers: Yes. So I think you're right. I mean, look, just to be clear, Jeremy, in terms of the deleveraging impact, as I said to Magdalena, that was driven by prime. And I think that was appropriate. It was the resizing in the prime business. In terms of the RWA impact. As you know, prime is a relatively risk -- low-risk density business, notwithstanding experience of Archegos. But we obviously did take a conservative approach to risk across the bank and particularly within the Investment Bank in the second quarter. And that did lead to some RWA reductions elsewhere, which clearly contributed to the RWA decline that we achieved in the second quarter. As I said, look, I think the Greensill matter closely followed by the Archegos matter, I think, necessitated a conservative approach to risk, necessitated a resizing of the risk appetite by our interim Chief Risk Officer and by the tactical crisis committee at the beginning of the second quarter. And I think that clearly has resulted in reductions in RWA beyond the prime financing business. But that said though, I just would say it before I said really now, that in terms of the third quarter level, I think I don't expect to see radical increases or decreases in terms of overall RWA and leverage for either the Investment Bank or for the group as a whole in the third quarter.\\nThomas Gottstein: And on your second question, as I mentioned before, we are fully focused on investing in the Investment Bank and within that in capital markets and advisory, where we have seen indeed a higher attrition level, especially on a senior level. If you look at Page 18, you see that year-to-date, we are up 82%, but it’s also a fact that we lost CHF 5 billion to one client in the Investment Bank. And this is not the year where Credit Suisse will be paying as high as you would maybe see in other firms at the moment. So we are clearly not the high payer of the street, if we want. But at the same time, we are fully focused. We have retention. And at the end of the day, we are investing in people internally, in young people. We have good talents internally to take these positions. And if needed, we will go externally and replace these people.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen from Royal Bank of Canada.\\nAnke Reingen : The first is with respect to capital and just trying to reconcile to the capital path you helpfully given us with the first quarter. So are we basically through the operational risk model updates, which you previously indicated 30 to 35 basis points, which I think you had 25 in Q2, but is that part basically done? And on the asset sales, you indicated in combination with the IB risk-weighted asset reduction of 40 to 50 basis points. Are there more benefits from asset sales to come? And then secondly, on costs, you're running underlying at around CHF 15.9 billion in the first half. And I mean, I understand things have changed, but you've previously given us the CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion for '21. So I was just thinking about what should we expect for the second half in terms of cost step-up for investment, cost savings, or also the operational costs related to the investigations.\\nDavid Mathers: Anke, let me take both of those questions. Firstly, with regard to the operational risk update, that -- those process in that calculation was completed in the second quarter, and that added CHF 6 billion of RWA in the second quarter, and that is certainly complete. There is potentially another CHF 2 billion of methodology changes and updates, which might, but not certainly, might materialize later this year, and that would account for the reconciliation to the number you gave before the 35 basis points, I believe. But I wouldn't regard that as certain at this point. It's more of a prudence buffer I think about in terms of my capital planning. But clearly, either which way, I think the bulk has been done in the second quarter. In terms of asset sales, quite clearly, the largest asset sale was the reduction in the Allfunds position where we dropped below the 10% threshold. So what you see in Allfunds really is a number of factors. Firstly, we had a further gain on Allfunds post the IPO of CHF 298 million recorded across our Wealth Management businesses. Second, we've actually -- we sold down to below 10% in the IPO process itself. And thirdly, you're obviously fully aware that once you drop below 10% under the Basel III rules, the capital treatment changes from being deduction process to being an RWA weighted process basically. So that contributes or that -- those 3 factors resulted in the 28 basis point improvement in the CET1 ratio as a consequence of Allfunds, and that's clearly a very large single disposal-related type event. We do expect to realize further asset sale gains, particularly real estate-related later in the year, and that is still to come, I think, in terms of your planning and thinking. I think the second point then, just in terms of cost guidance, I think it's just fair to say that whilst we will continue to invest across the bank, and obviously, we were pleased to see a 50 net additions in terms of RMs in APAC, which I think is the largest single increase in RMs we've ever achieved and I think demonstrates the investments in the franchise. And we're obviously continuing to invest in our onshore China platform. Nonetheless, I think given that we will be taking a prudent approach to variable compensation awards in light of the loss that our shareholders suffered in respect to Archegos, I think it's fair to say that we will be at the bottom end of the range of the CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion cost guidance that we gave at the Investor Day last year. So I hope that answers those questions, but please, is that helpful, Anke?\\nAnke Reingen: Yes, yes. No, that was very clear.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs.\\nJernej Omahen: I have so many questions. I don't know how to limit it down to 2. But let's kick it off here. Thomas, I listened to your opening statement very carefully. And I managed to find one of the passages that you quoted in this report that you published today. And it says here and you quoted is that this is not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct, nor is one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks. And I just wonder how that tallies with the bulk of what you have been communicating today. Because one of the key communications that I understood is that Credit Suisse immediately changed, for example, the way you margin in your prime brokerage, went from static to dynamic, and yet the report seems to suggest that systems are fine. Is that correct?\\nThomas Gottstein: Is it your first question? And what's your second?\\nJernej Omahen : Yes, that's the only question.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. Well, as we have tried to summarize also on our slide, so just to give you the example on dynamic and static margining. This was already discussed by the teams in September, October. They had agreed that they would move some of the clients, including Archegos, from static to dynamic. It was rediscussed in early March. And if you read the report, they were in the process of actually doing that and reaching out to the client. But it was just not prioritized the way it should have been. So this is, to a large extent, really a series of human errors and failures by the teams. They didn't effectively manage this situation, and whether it was lack of escalation or also limit -- control of limits, which had numerous occasions being breached, but they did not act on it even though they discussed it and were supposed to do it. So this was clearly a series of failures, which is regrettable and which we have now addressed with a new team both on the first line of defense in Prime Services, Prime Services risk and on the risk management side. So that's really how I would answer this question.\\nDavid Mathers: And one addendum and just to second what Thomas -- yes, just to second what Thomas is -- Jernej, sorry, just to second what Thomas is saying. It is clear and the report makes clear that the appropriate escalation protocols were in place in both the business and in the second line and in the CPOC committee, which you'll see described there, but they were not operated by the individuals. So the protocols were there, but they were not followed. It's clear that whilst we obviously can improve in our data systems, we can prove in the timeliness of those data systems. Nonetheless, the first and second line data systems did demonstrate the risks to Credit Suisse of Archegos. And again, those were not basically followed up as part of it. So I think that is the basis -- or part of the basis for the distinction that the independent counsel to the Board has made in their report.\\nJernej Omahen: But can I just go back to -- Thomas, just to get your assessment of this, do you agree with this conclusion here, that the architecture of risk controls and processes is fine?\\nThomas Gottstein : Yes. Well, this is the independent investigators' view, and it was discussed also within Credit Suisse, within also the Executive Board and the Board of Directors, and we collectively absolutely agree with that, yes.\\nDavid Mathers: Clearly, this report was not written by Credit Suisse. This was written by an external council, Paul, Weiss. It's an extremely thorough process they actually prepared. They prepared it under the aegis of the Board and specifically the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. And it was written by them. It's independent -- so the firm is independent of the Board. And I think they've conducted a thorough view. And I think we do agree with their conclusions, but it is their report.\\nJernej Omahen: Right. And then maybe just to -- just in the scheme of things of the various investigations that are being conducted into this, where does this report fit in? Because I'm assuming that there's various streams of investigation by various regulators in the regions of your operations that are going through this. So what -- when we look at this, it's a really chunky report, 140-plus pages, I think. But where does it fit in?\\nThomas Gottstein: Well, this is the independent investigation report which was mandated by our Board of Directors, and that was now concluded. In parallel, you're absolutely right. There are regulatory investigations, by the way, not only into Credit Suisse, but pretty much every other prime service -- prime broker to Archegos that was involved. There are at least 6 or 7 of them. They are all being investigated, and there is various regulatory activity in the U.S., in Switzerland and in the U.K., and we are fully cooperating and collaborating with them. And that's really all I can say to that.\\nJernej Omahen: And realistically, when should we expect those processes to conclude?\\nThomas Gottstein: Well, it's always difficult to predict how fast regulators are operating. But...\\nDavid Mathers: Look, I think – I don’t think we can really comment. And I think the Board decided to commission this independent review. They obviously brought in Paul, Weiss to do a fully independent review. I think that is the appropriate governance. I think the Board decided and I think rightly that in – given the magnitude of the Archegos loss for Credit Suisse, it was fully appropriate to publish the entire review, which, by the way, I think, is 163 pages. And I think that was the right thing to do. I think it’s important to be transparent to our investors, to our stakeholders basically about these events. And I would imagine this report will be read closely by all the regulators as part of their work.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Regli from Octavian.\\nDaniel Regli : My question go a bit in the direction of -- I mean, your results in Q2 have clearly been impacted still by Archegos and all the second and first order impact. But what is your mood when you talk to your clients? Or what is the mood of your clients when you talk to them going forward, particularly with regards to how shall we think about net new money generation and new wealth management? Do you expect these instances or these issues you had to continue to impact your ability to generate positive net new money going forward? Or have you maybe seen now everything of it? And then maybe the second question is on Greensill. Can you give us kind of a time line until when you expect the Greensill issue to be completed?\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. So on the mood of clients, we are fully engaged with our clients. One thing that I wanted to also add to the one of the previous questions on NNA momentum within the quarter and towards the end of the quarter is that the gross NNA flows are actually very similar to previous years. So clients are fully involved and active in the rare situations or in some of the situations of ultra-high-net worth clients who have asked for, for example, incremental lending, where we have been maybe more cautious. They fully understand that. They don't see that as an issue. You would also see that our assets under custody have increased. So in certain situations where we had a reduction of lending, the underlying collateral, it stayed with us. So we have very positive feedback about the way we have addressed some of these issues with respect to the risk-weighted asset reductions, the fact that we raised the capital immediately at the end of April and the read across from the lessons learned. So investors take a lot of -- sorry, clients take a lot of comfort from the fact also that we are increasing our capital ratio. So the client reaction is very constructive. Clearly, there are some clients, for example, those who were invested in supply chain funds that are having active dialogue with us, and we are keeping them updated on the cash redemptions, and we will continue to improve that situation. But they also understand that this is a process that will take some time. And that really brings me to your second question on the timetable of Greensill. We are paying out now another tranche, as we said, and we will continue to work through the book of work, both for the focus and the non-focus areas. The focus areas involves much more negotiations and also a number of people involved in these discussions, and this will also take a longer time. In parallel, we are engaging with insurers, and that's a process that will certainly continue over the next few months and quarters. We are keeping our clients fully informed about this, and they basically understand the process. And whenever they need any other support, we are there to do that.\\nDaniel Regli: Very helpful, particularly the comment about gross flows in Wealth Management.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\\nKian Abouhossein: Yes. The first question is about capital. I mean, you're clearly running well above your target level that you gave at the first quarter stage. And just wondering, should we assume that the bank will increase capital ratios further, considering there could be some hits coming your way, regulatory write-downs, litigation, et cetera? Should we think about 14%, even 14-plus? Or should we think that this kind of level is the level you want to run rate until you have potential impacts coming against your capital? And the second question is just taking a top-down view. Listening what we're hearing today and having a strategic update in December potentially, I'm not exactly clear what the update is about because on the one hand, it sounds like you have derisked, you're happy with the derisking, and now it's more seasonal adjustment to revenues and business. And please correct me if that's wrong, but that's kind of the impression I get from the call, the majority is done. And then secondly, in respect to the IB, where clearly there are a lot of questions. Clearly, you are investing as you have said, and you say that, I think, in an article, Thomas, at Bloomberg interview, it's absolutely core part of the business. So just wondering, why a strategic update considering you have mitigated the issue from your perspective and it's business as usual?\\nThomas Gottstein: Why don't you start -- David, why don't you start with the capital question? And I'll...\\nDavid Mathers : I will start, yes. Look, I think, firstly, I think I did guide at the end of the first quarter that I wanted to increase the CET1 ratio to at least 13% and ideally in excess of 13%. I think we have taken a very thorough approach to capital utilization, as I've outlined already, both in terms of the reset, the risk appetite and the bank-wide risk review, and I think that's been right and appropriate. And that has led to the CET1 ratio increasing to 13.7%. And that does, by the way, include the accrual for a dividend in respect to 2021, although the level of that will only be set by the Board of Directors as a recommendation to shareholders at the beginning of next year. And I just think that operating the bank above 13%, I think, is the prudent and the correct thing to do. I have to say I think the scale of the Archegos loss was shocking, a disappointment and clearly a cost to our shareholders. And I think it's an appropriate response. And I would certainly expect to operate in excess of 13% for at least the balance of this particular year basically. I think beyond that, I mean -- and by the way, the leverage ratio is always as important as the CET1 ratio. So the fact we're operating at 4.2% and 6% against the Swiss minimum requirements is as important as the RWA ratio. And I would just reiterate, I would expect to operate north of 4% for the leverage ratio for at least the balance of 2021. I think in terms of our longer-term capital guidance, I think we will provide a proper update to that as part of the conclusion of the strategic review once it's completed by the end of this year. But I don't think it's appropriate for me to actually add further at this moment.\\nThomas Gottstein : Yes. And on the group strategy review, as part of the discussions, it's always a question of what do we learn from these 2 events. Is it just the how, how we are doing things that we need to change? Or is it the what, i.e, what we are going to change? And these are the discussions that have been going on and are going on. And it's also very clear that you should never waste a crisis, and that's why we also want to take the right decisions on the basis of what we have seen now in the first 2 quarters on the back of both Archegos and supply chain fund. And that's why I'm not going to start to give piecemeal strategic insights on our thinking. We will go through the process, as I said. Together with the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, we are focused on clearly designing and articulating a long-term vision for the bank and a concrete midterm plan, and we will present those when we are ready to do so. And as I said, this will be at the latest by the end of the year.\\nDavid Mathers: And I'll just reiterate what Thomas is saying. This is -- the bank is 160 years old. I think it's only appropriate that we think about what we want to achieve, where we want to be over the long term and how we want to prioritize investments over that period of time. And I think this is a good moment to do that.\\nKian Abouhossein : If I may just ask, but do you feel that -- I mean, listening to you again, and maybe I'm interpreting it wrongly, and that's why I'm asking the question. It sounds like you're on the right path strategically, i.e., top-down, you feel that you're on the right path based on the statement that you make so far. So this sounds to me like the strategic review is more an execution rather than a material top-down change in the way the business looks like, and it comes back to the how and the what. But that's kind of my interpretation from the call today.\\nThomas Gottstein: It’s a good try. You’re trying to get more out of it, but I have to ask for your patience. We will present our long-term vision and our strategic plan when we are ready to do so. And until then, I have to ask you to show some patience. I’m sorry.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eoin Mullany from Berenberg.\\nEoin Mullany: Apologies if I missed it, but I heard you say you saw inflows in April and May and inflows in June across your Wealth Management business. Can I just confirm that you're continuing to see inflows in July? Apologies if I missed it. And then just secondly, on the dividend. Previously, you said you want to pay the canceled portion of the FY '20 dividend and restore your dividend to previous levels. And does that still stand? And should we think about that as more likely now given where your capital ratio is after this quarter?\\nThomas Gottstein: I'll take the first one, and maybe, David, you take the second one. Look, we are not starting to give intra-months NNA numbers. As a matter of fact, many of our competitors are not showing NNA numbers anymore. And as you know from previous calls, I'm much more focused on mid- to long-term flows in terms of client business volumes. We did, in this specific situation, provide some color because the question was asked how in the second quarter the monthly NNA development was, but we are not going now to answer questions on intra-months or weekly NNA developments. By the way, for me, it's absolutely irrelevant now how the last 2 or 3 weeks were in terms of NNA. It's for me much more the longer-term trends, and the longer-term trend is very positive.\\nDavid Mathers: And I think on dividend, there's nothing I'd really want to add to what I've said already, which is we've continued to accrue pro rata for a dividend in respect to 2021. But the absolute level will depend upon the review by the Board of Directors and their decision as a recommendation to shareholders, of course, who actually approved the dividend, and that decision will only be taken very early next year.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Piers Brown from HSBC.\\nPiers Brown: Yes. First is on the credit rating. I'm just conscious that in the risk section of the quarterly report, you referred to, I think, the wording is there can be no assurance that a further downgrade of the credit rating will not be material to us. Could you just give a little bit of an idea as to what sort of conversations are going on with the rating agencies and how real you view that risk? And the second question is on Greensill and insurance claims, which I think you mentioned you're pursuing. And alongside that, I think, in the July update on Greensill, you talked about having about $2.3 billion of late payments. So far on the underlying note, I presume those are the notes on which insurance is being pursued. Can you just give us a little bit of an idea how realistic it is you may get some insurance cover on those late payments and what practical difficulties you're actually encountering in terms of pursuing insurance?\\nDavid Mathers: Perhaps if I take the first question, and Thomas, you take the second. I mean, I think, look, I think quite clearly, the Archegos loss and the Greensill supply chain funds have caused reviews of our credit ratings by all the major agencies. And I think at least one of them actually has us on negative watch. And I think Moody's, as you know, did downgrade certain of our instruments early this month, although that was partly in the connection with a technical change relating to their treatment of certain AT1 instruments in terms of the subordination and treatment as equity or debt between the different layers of the bank. Now that's going to be, obviously, an ongoing process. And I imagine they'll be reviewing these results and also the Archegos report just as you are basically. And I think it's only appropriate, we do list that as a risk factor. I mean, as a matter of practicality, I would say, basically, if you look at the moves in certain management such as CDSs, they're really basically priced in such a downgrade some months ago basically. And the rating agencies now have to make their own decisions about this whole thing. But I think it's appropriate we list it as a risk factor just because it clearly is a risk factor. But I think it's probably priced in already. And I guess, we shall see and depend on -- and see how they choose to react to this report. Clearly, the capital ratios, in particular, are substantially higher than I think anybody was actually expecting, and that's obviously a key factor in terms of this. And I think it is worth bottom line in terms of pretax income on an underlying basis, it's about 11% lower than what was a very strong period a year ago. So I think there are some reassurance factors there, but that's a decision ultimately that the rating agencies will need to make on their own.\\nThomas Gottstein : And on the insurance, on Greensill, as you probably know, the insured party was not – were not the funds, but was the Greensill entity, Greensill Bank, principally. And we are, together with Greensill Capital, and there is a clear process where – because the funds are only payees, loss payees. And this is a process that has to go through a certain protocol, which means that there is a certain delay until when we can even post the claims. And this is now starting to happen for some of the outstanding payments, and it’s really now starting, and we will update our investors as we go on over the next few months in terms of the insurance claims reactions by the insurers.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Lee from Santander.\\nPatrick Lee: I just have a couple related to Archegos again, but more specifically, what were the remedy means in the longer term. I guess, if I look at the independent review on individual accountability, I think, in there, you mentioned that you actioned on 23 individuals, 9 got fired, but the clawback of CHF 70 million. If I do the arithmetic, these people on attrition, around CHF 3 million of bonus to be clawed back. So is it fair to say that these are relatively senior, well-paid or overpaid individuals? And what did you do to the 14 people that you did not remove from the position? And I guess, is there a risk that you are now rapidly losing the good people to competitors, and somehow, the bad actors are still around? And related to that, is this a 2Q-only event? Or would that be a longer-term tail impact as well on that?\\nThomas Gottstein : Yes. Actually, what we have disclosed ourselves and what was disclosed in the report is really as far as we would like to go in terms of disclosure, and we will not go into individuals. All I can say is that -- and confirm is that out of the 23 individuals, 9 were terminated, and the CHF 70 million relates to all 23 and included, to a large extent, [indiscernible] on deferred compensation and, in some instances, clawback on -- already paid out. And it includes various seniorities, members of Prime Services, first line of defense, members of second line of defense, certain members of committees. And this is really all we can say to this, and we do not want to go into more details.\\nDavid Mathers: I may make one point, Patrick. I think you referred to this a 2Q event. Strictly speaking, the report was finalized actually in July, and the decisions were actually made by the respective compensation remuneration committees in July, which is in the third quarter. So it’s announced today, but strictly speaking, it’s actually a 3Q event.\\nOperator: I will now hand the call back over to Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, Sharon. I will hand over to Thomas for some concluding remarks.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. Thank you, Kinner. And I'd like to maybe draw your attention to Slide 37 of the pack. Since the occurrence of the Archegos and supply chain finance fund matters, which we are taking very seriously, as I said, we have taken decisive actions around capital and risk management. We have learned and will continue to learn the lessons from these events, and we will ensure that we emerge stronger by improving our capital ratios and strengthening risk, compliance and control foundations. We have market-leading positions and strong capabilities across our client franchises in Wealth Management, Asset Management and in the Investment Bank as evidenced by the solid underlying results in the first half of the year. Our Swiss-anchored bank enjoys leading positions in our home market as well as in fast-growing economies around the world, and our integrated model should position us well to capture growth opportunities going forward. Finally, and most importantly, we value our deep pool of talented and dedicated employees, who are fully committed to serving our clients, whether corporate, institutional or wealth. They fill me and my colleagues on the ExB with confidence for our future, and I thank them immensely for the dedication and hard work. And with this, I would like to thank you again for your participation and would like to conclude this session. Thank you very much.\\nKinner Lakhani: Well, if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to IR. Thank you.\\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call for analysts and investors. A recording of the presentation will be available about 2 hours after the event on the Credit Suisse website. Thank you for joining today's call. You may all disconnect.\",\n","  'transcript_split': [{'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. So before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion, we refer you to the Credit Suisse second quarter 2021 financial report published this morning. I will now hand over to our Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Kinner. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call to discuss our second quarter and first half 2021 results. As part of my introduction, I would like to make a few comments. Firstly, this has been an incredibly challenging first half of the year for our bank and for all our stakeholders, overshadowed by the Archegos and supply chain finance fund matters. We are taking these events very seriously and are determined to learn all the right lessons. We firmly believe we can and will emerge stronger from these events. Secondly, we have taken action. We have taken action to address many of the issues, and we will continue to do so. Regarding Archegos, we have exited all the remaining positions in early June and today have released the independent investigation report. We have proactively derisked our Prime Services business and overachieved the goals we set ourselves in the first quarter to reduce RWA and leverage exposure in the Investment Bank. We made key hires. We have reviewed our risk appetite across the bank, and we are proactively strengthening the overall risk culture across the group. Thirdly, our underlying business remains healthy. For the second quarter, we delivered a reported pretax income of CHF 830 million. And for the first half of 2021, we managed to move back into profitability on a reported basis. We achieved this despite incurring around CHF 5 billion in losses related to Archegos. This resilience is a testament to our people, our business and a global franchise that we are confident will continue to drive growth into the future. Furthermore, we strengthened our CET1 ratio to 13.7% from 12.2% at the end of the first quarter. Fourthly, we have clear priorities for the coming months, including maximizing the cash distributions to our supply chain finance fund investors and continuing to strengthen our first and second line of defense risk approach and governance. Most importantly, we remain fully focused on serving our private, corporate and institutional clients around the world. Let me be clear, we are open for business. In parallel, we shall continue our work around the group strategy review. Before I move on to the slides, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our clients for the trust they continue to place in us. I would also like to express my immense gratitude to all our employees around the world for the dedication and professionalism. They pulled together in difficult circumstances to deliver great solutions for our clients and to create sustainable value over the long term. I am very proud of what our employees are continuing to achieve every day for Credit Suisse and for all our stakeholders. With that, let me turn to Page 4. This slide summarizes the key highlights of the second quarter and outlines our resilient financial performance in the context of an enhanced risk approach and ongoing investments. During the second quarter, we reduced risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure in the Investment Bank by USD 20 billion and USD 41 billion, respectively. At the same time, we delivered on key investments, including expansion of our Private Banking coverage teams, notably in APAC and specifically China, in technology and in other areas across the bank. We reported a pretax profit of CHF 830 million for the second quarter and the net profit attributable to shareholders of CHF 253 million. This includes a quarterly loss of approximately CHF 600 million relating to Archegos and approximately CHF 300 million gain on Allfunds. Adjusted pretax profit, excluding significant items and Archegos, was CHF 1.3 billion, reflecting the underlying strength of our business. Assets under management in our Wealth Management franchise increased to a record high CHF 853 billion, supporting robust recurring fee growth year-on-year. We saw continued strength in the Swiss Universal Bank, including the successful completion of the Neue Aargauer Bank integration, and continued momentum in the rollout of CSX, our digital retail offering. Our Investment Bank was resilient in the face of a significant reduction of risk and a less favorable trading environment. On an adjusted basis, excluding Archegos, we achieved a pretax profit of USD 601 million in the second quarter. We achieved a strong performance in Asset Management, with adjusted pretax income up 26% year-on-year. Finally, we significantly improved our capital position. Our CET1 ratio, as already mentioned, was 13.7%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6%, and our CET1 leverage ratio, 4.2%. Slide 5, please. Regarding Archegos, I will be clear. The total loss of approximately CHF 5 billion is unacceptable, and the independent report pointed to a number of failures. We have learned serious lessons and have taken multiple thorough steps to address these issues across the bank. Appropriate HR-related actions have been taken. You see here the selected key findings of the independent 160-page report, which we have made available in full on our website. The findings in the report included the failure to effectively manage risk in Prime Services by both lines of defense; a lack of escalation and of controlling limit excesses; a failure to discharge supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in risk; as well as insufficient prioritization of risk mitigation measures, including moving clients from static to dynamic margining. However, the investigation also found that this was not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct or acted with ill intent, nor was it one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking or the existing systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks and related concerns. On the right side of this page are selected recommendations, including investment of additional resources and risk, transitioning of clients to dynamic margining and reexamination of counterparty risk appetite and controls. The recommendations listed have either been completed or are in progress. Next slide, please. Let me turn to the supply chain finance fund matter. Credit Suisse Asset Management's priority remains the recovery of funds for investors in the 4 funds. We have an upcoming fourth cash payment planned for the first half of August. Total cash paid out and current cash and cash equivalents stands at 66% of net asset value as of February 25. The expected overall recovery of the non-focus areas is greater than 90%. With regard to the 3 focus areas, we plan to pursue every possible avenue to maximize recovery and are fully engaged with the respective parties. Finally, we continue to work on filing insurance claims. Slide 7, please. This slide shows our second quarter and first half results on both a reported and adjusted basis. While supported PTI for the quarter was CHF 813 million, our group adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items and Archegos, was CHF 1.3 billion. For the first half of 2021, our reported pretax income was a modest CHF 56 million; whilst the group adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items and Archegos, was CHF 4.9 billion, reflecting the strong underlying performance of our businesses. David Mathers will provide more details on this shortly. Slide 8, please. Here, you see the underlying results, how they stack up against the past few years. On the same adjusted basis, the second quarter 2021 pretax income of CHF 1.3 billion is the second highest second quarter result in the last 6 years. The first half of 2021 was the best first half over the same period, both in terms of underlying net revenues and pretax income. Next page, please. As I mentioned at the outset, we recognize the critical importance of investing to seize growth opportunities. As you see on the left of the slide, on the business side, we have made significant new hires in APAC to build out our leading franchise. Our relationship manager base rose from 600 to 650 in the first half of 2021. We have further expanded our IWM mid-market M&A advisory capabilities, and we continue to invest in our GTS solutions within the Investment Bank and elsewhere in the Investment Bank. We continued the build-out of our Mainland China presence and deepened our footprint in other faster growth markets. We are making ongoing investments in our CSX digital platform here in Switzerland, and we are prioritizing our investments in cybersecurity. Next page, please. At Credit Suisse, the health and well-being of our people is a top priority for us. As you can see from the left-hand side of the slide, whilst we would like to see more of our colleagues come back to the office, we have taken a cautious approach to returning to the office based on conditions in individual countries and regions. As far as turnover is concerned, after a relatively quiet 2020, a year when everyone was getting used to the new normal of working from home due to the pandemic, industry-wide turnover has clearly increased in 2021. This is also true for Credit Suisse, but let me give you a little perspective here. Our turnover is very much in line with the past 7 years. Whilst we have had some regretted departures, notably in capital markets and advisory in the U.S., we have been investing in new hires across all major divisions, including in the Investment Bank and in Asset Management. Next slide, please. Our group-wide assets under management grew 8% year-to-date to a record CHF 1.6 trillion, which should support recurring revenues going forward. Our group NNA number for the second quarter was negative CHF 5 billion but stands at a positive CHF 24 billion for the first half. We have seen positive market performance in Q2. In addition, we have seen strong growth in mandate penetration to 30% in the second quarter 2021, and we are on track to achieve our medium-term ambition of around 33%. Next page, please. We have generated strong client business volume growth across our Wealth Management businesses. Our ambition is to grow annual client business volume by mid-single digits for SUB, mid- to high single digits for IWM and double digits in APAC. We comfortably achieved those objectives in the last 12 months, as you can see on this page. As you also can see from the bottom of the chart, we are also showing the quarterly NNA numbers for the 3 Wealth Management businesses. Given the overall circumstances as well as various derisking measures, we did see net asset outflows in the second quarter, notably in APAC. However, over CHF 4 billion of these APAC outflows were due to proactive derisking measures related to a small number of clients. We have also continued to see solid gross inflows across all 3 of our Wealth Management businesses. For the first half of the year, Wealth Management NNA stands at a positive CHF 7 billion. Slide 13. Wealth Management-related adjusted revenues, excluding significant items, rose 1% year-on-year in the first half of 2021. On the same basis, strong year-on-year growth in recurring commissions and fees and slightly higher transactional activity more than offset lower net interest income. Slide 14, please. The underlying strength of our Wealth Management-related business was demonstrated by the 32% growth in adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020. The strength was seen across businesses, notably APAC. Return on regulatory capital in our Wealth Management-related businesses on the same basis was 24% in the first half of 2021, up from 19% 1 year earlier. The Asia Pacific region on the next page, we are providing some details on the APAC division. The APAC region is absolutely core to Credit Suisse's growth strategy. And as you can see on this slide, the region accounted for 19% of the group's adjusted net revenues, excluding significant items in the first half of the year. Adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items in the first half of 2021, increased 75% year-on-year with a return on regulatory capital of 35% on the same basis. Slide 16, please. As you know, we established Asset Management as a separate division effective 1st of April 2021. We're emphasizing the strategic importance of this business by doing so for the bank and its clients. Its results underscore the importance of this division. In the first half of 2021, adjusted Asset Management revenues, excluding significant items, were up 31%, driven by recurring management fees and performance and placement revenues. Pretax income on the same basis grew nearly fivefold year-on-year. AUM increased 11% year-on-year to CHF 470 billion, and net new assets increased solidly to CHF 11.6 billion in the first half of the year with contributions across index, equities and credit. Slide 17, please. The underlying performance of our Investment Bank has been resilient in the face of the Archegos matter, a more conservative approach to risk management and normalization of sales and trading revenues after an exceptional second quarter of 2020. Sales and trading saw a significant normalization in revenues from the first quarter 2021 performance. We saw multiple strength in securitized products, particularly our #1 ranked asset finance franchise. Whilst our M&A revenues declined in the second quarter, we have a strong M&A advisory pipeline up both sequentially and notably on a year-on-year basis. And our pipeline across equity capital markets and leveraged finance are also very healthy. Slide 18. In the second quarter, Investment Bank revenues, excluding Archegos, were down 23% from exceptional prior year levels. However, for the first half of 2021, revenues on the same basis grew 21% year-on-year, driven in particular by capital market and advisory revenues which were up 82% year-on-year. Slide 19. Given the additional Archegos charge in the second quarter, Investment Bank pretax income was negative USD 86 million, However, adjusted pretax income, excluding Archegos in Q2, was USD 601 million. And for the full first half, adjusted pretax income on the same basis stood at USD 2.8 billion. Slide 20, please. It was roughly 1 year ago that I announced the launch of our Sustainability, Research & Investment Solutions function, SRI, to help deliver on our ambition to be a sustainability leader. In the last year, SRI has made excellent progress executing its strategy and delivering value to clients and stakeholders. On the right side of this slide, you see a few highlights. These include CHF 133 billion in assets managed accordingly to -- according to sustainability criteria at the end of the second quarter, which is an increase of 13% quarter-on-quarter. A great highlight for the second quarter for both SRI and the bank as a whole was our inaugural Sustainability Week. We hosted around 5,000 virtual attendees over the course of the summit that began in late June. We welcomed around 70 speakers to share ideas on how to drive sustainable growth. I was delighted to participate along with Lydie Hudson, Marisa Drew and members of the Board of Directors, and we are looking forward to future summits. Page 21, please. Before I hand over to David, let me summarize our key priorities for the months ahead. As previously discussed, we are continuing progress in cash distributions to the supply chain finance funds with the investigation expected to be concluded in the third quarter. We are recalibrating our risk appetite at both the group and divisional levels, are strengthening our key risk management processes and risk and control infrastructure. In terms of governance, we have announced 2 important executive appointments related to technology and risk: Joanne Hannaford as Chief Technology and Operations Officer; and David Wildermuth as Chief Risk Officer, both starting in early 2022. I'm proud to have been able to recruit 2 such high-caliber talents for our executive team. We are more focused than ever to provide best-in-class service and advice to our private, corporate and institutional clients globally. And finally, we initiated a joint group strategy review by the Board of Directors and the Executive Board with the goal to clearly define and articulate a long-term vision and a midterm plan expected to be finalized by the end of the year. With that, I would like to turn over to David.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much, Thomas, and good morning, everybody. Now before I take you through the financial results in more detail, I'd just like to second Thomas' comments. Our priority this quarter has been to ensure that we deal with and mitigate the challenges posed by the default of Archegos and by the supply chain finance matter. A core part of this has been to do whatever we can to ensure that there's no repetition of these events. We've taken a number of steps in this regard, and there will be more to come this year as we work our way through the strategic review. Fundamentally, we prioritized a more conservative approach to risk in both the first and the second lines of defense. This has been most apparent in the Investment Bank, where as you can see, we've substantially reduced the size of our Prime Service business and ensure that client accounts in this business have been fully migrated to dynamic margining, and that was completed by the end of the second quarter. And it's clearly one of the key lessons learned from the Archegos matter. That said, whilst we've been very focused on ensuring that we have a resized Prime Services and we have conducted a thorough and full risk review across the whole bank, we've also continued and sustained a number of the core investments that we've spoken about before, most notably in Wealth Management. We have significantly expanded the number of relationship managers in our APAC business, and we continue to build on our investments in onshore China. Now against this backdrop and accepting that these results are marred by the impact on shareholders from the second quarter Archegos loss of CHF 594 million, I think the firm has nonetheless delivered a resilient underlying performance. As Thomas has already outlined, both total assets under management and our Wealth Management client business volumes have risen to new highs of CHF 1.63 trillion and CHF 1.36 trillion, respectively. On an underlying basis, excluding the Archegos loss but also excluding other significant items such as the gain relating to the Allfunds transaction, we have delivered an adjusted profit of CHF 1.31 billion, close to last year's figure of CHF 1.48 billion. But I'd also like to highlight the progress that we've made in strengthening our capital ratios. These are well above the levels that I targeted at the end of the first quarter, with our CET1 ratio increasing to 13.7% and our leverage ratio to 4.2% in terms of the CET1 ratio and 6.0% in terms of the Tier 1 ratio. With that, let me turn, please, to Slide 23. I'll start with the reported numbers, and I'll deal in more detail on the next slide in terms of the reconciliation between the reported and the adjusted totals. Reported net revenues for the second quarter were 18% lower than in 2020 at CHF 5.1 billion. That includes a small increase in Wealth Management-related revenues driven by the strength in recurring fees, but this was more than offset by the 41% decline in Investment Bank revenues, which is due to a combination of the Archegos losses, the reduction in the size of our Prime Service business and the less volatile trading environment compared to the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Clearly, one positive note for this quarter has been the improvement in the macroeconomic environment, which has resulted in us releasing a further CHF 168 million in CECL-related charges. With regard to the tax charge, when we reported our numbers for the first quarter, I advised that the effective tax rate for the year was likely to remain significantly elevated before returning to a more normal level in 2022. The rate for the second quarter was 70%, similar to the 69% ratio that we incurred in the first quarter. I think just to remind you, the reason for this higher tax charge is due to the fact that whilst the whole of the Archegos tax loss -- the Archegos loss is tax deductible and will remain available for the group to offset against net income in future years. In terms of financial reporting, I can only recognize just over half of that Archegos tax credit on the balance sheet in the current financial year. Reported net income attributable to shareholders as a consequence, therefore, stood at CHF 253 million, which equates to a return on tangible equity of 2.6%. Let me turn now to the next slide. Just let me give you some more detail, please, on the difference between the adjusted and the reported numbers for both the second quarter of this year and the same period last year. The second quarter of 2020 only had a small number of significant adjusting items, a CHF 134 million gain on our stake in the Pfandbriefbank and offset by a major litigation charge of CHF 61 million. Now the second quarter of 2021 saw 3 substantial adjusting items. First, the CHF 594 million loss on Archegos, of which CHF 493 million related to revenues, CHF 70 million to credit provisions and CHF 31 million related to additional associated expenses, including those relating to the Archegos investigation itself. As Thomas has already confirmed, we exited all of our remaining positions resulting from the Archegos issue during the course of the second quarter. Second, we had a gain on Allfunds, which I think you know we successfully listed at the beginning of this quarter. We continue to hold a reduced 9.4% interest in the company and have made a gain in the second quarter of further CHF 298 million on that interest. Finally, just in terms of substantial items, we've taken a further CHF 159 million in net major litigation provisions. Now to be clear, these relate entirely to pre-existing litigation matters and are not in respect of either Archegos or the supply chain finance matter. Given that the cases for which we've taken these provisions are subject to ongoing legal discussions, I will not be able to give any further details beyond what we've included in the financial report today. Now with regard to the other items in the reconciliation, you can see a charge of CHF 45 million for restructuring expenses, primarily relating to the completion of the measures that we announced last year. Next slide, please. Let me turn now to our capital ratios. I'll focus first on the RWA and leverage numbers and then give some more details on the reconciliation in the following slide. With regard to RWA usage, you may recall that at the end of the first quarter, we said that by the end of 2021, we would reduce Investment Bank RWAs to below end 2Q -- sorry, end of 2020 levels and reduce leverage exposure in the Investment Bank by at least USD 35 billion, primarily through reductions in our Prime Service businesses. As you can see, we exceeded that objective in the second quarter. With regard to the Investment Bank, we've reduced RWAs by CHF 19 billion since the end of the first quarter and reduced leverage exposure by CHF 40 billion. At the same time, whilst we have been conducting a thorough risk review across the entire bank, we have broadly maintained levels of RWA and leverage in our Wealth Management businesses. Overall, this has brought RWAs down from CHF 303 billion at the end of the first quarter to CHF 284 billion at the end of the second quarter. You'll note that with regard to leverage, we've continued to take a conservative view on liquidity, with HQLA increasing by CHF 21 billion quarter-on-quarter. I'll talk about the capital ratios in more detail on the next slide, but you can see that our CET1 ratio has improved by 150 basis points from the end of the first quarter to 13.7% now, and our CET1 leverage ratio has improved by 40 basis points to 4.2%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 50 basis points higher at 6.0%. Now let me just walk through the numbers in a little bit more detail. We ended the first quarter of the year with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%. I said at that time that we expect to see further losses of approximately CHF 600 million with regard to the Archegos matter, which has proved to be the case. And this has reduced the CET1 ratio by 20 basis points. However, the elimination of the risk positions from Archegos has removed the temporary add-on relating to these positions, which was imposed at the end of the first quarter, which has improved the ratio by 24 basis points. Now moving across the Allfunds gain, combined with the opportunity to reduce our position in the company to less than 10% of the IPO has led to an improvement of 28 basis points. The mandatory convertible note capital raise of CHF 1.7 billion has added 55 basis points. And I would note that FINMA has now confirmed this can be treated as part of our common equity base. The reduction in Investment Bank RWAs though has delivered the most substantial improvement, totaling 67 basis points and taking us to the 13.7% that I've already mentioned. Now I'm not going to go through the corresponding points in respect to the CET1 leverage ratio, but as you can see here, the action we've taken have improved our position from 3.8% to 4.2% at the end of the second quarter. Now let me turn to financial performance. Clearly, one of the strongest points has been the growth in assets under management and in client business volume within our Wealth Management businesses over the course of the last year. We've seen continued growth in overall client business volume in SUB Private Clients, in IWM and in APAC. Within SUB Private Clients, client business volume has increased by 9%, in IWM by 20% and in APAC by 24%. Whilst we have seen net asset outflows of CHF 7.3 billion across these businesses during the second quarter, $4.2 billion of this was due to certain derisking actions that we have taken in APAC. And I think that the progress in AUM and in client business volume demonstrates the momentum in the Wealth Management franchise. Now in terms of business performance, we saw a drop in net interest income compared to the first quarter of the year, which reflected lower treasury revenues as well as costs relating to the MCN issuance program. Recurring commissions and fees have grown strongly, reflecting the growth in the AUM base and increased mandate penetration, which now stands at 30% compared to 28% in the same quarter of last year and on track to achieve our ambition of approximately 33%. We have seen, though, a reduction in transaction-based revenues. This reflects lower levels of client activity and lower market volatility in the second quarter compared to what we saw a year ago and indeed in the first quarter of this year. Let me now turn to operating expenses. We saw earlier that operating expenses were down 1% year-on-year, and what I show here are the adjusted numbers, excluding significant items and excluding Archegos across the business divisions and the Corporate Center for both the quarter and for last year. Now if we look at the second quarter, the total on a constant currency basis is 5% lower year-on-year at CHF 4.06 billion. As was the case in the first quarter, the main driver across the divisions is a significant reduction in the compensation and benefits line, driven by reduced levels of variable compensation. As you'd expect, this mainly reflects the impact on our shareholders of the Archegos losses that we took in the first and the second quarters and our response to that. You'll note that costs have risen in both APAC and in Asset Management in the quarter. In the case of APAC, this reflects the investments in the franchise, including in our China onshore presence and in the expansion of our Private Banking coverage teams. With regard to Asset Management, the increase primarily reflects 3 factors: first, certain severance costs that do not qualify for restructuring treatment; second, the realization of investments in partnerships and the associated costs for that; and third, the cost of our internal investigations into the supply chain finance matter. Next slide, please. Now here, I provide an update on our provision for credit losses, both specific and CECL-related over the course of the last 2 quarters. You'll remember that we ended the first quarter with a total allowance for credit losses of CHF 6.3 billion, of which CHF 4.43 billion was related to Archegos. During the second quarter, we took CHF 143 million of non-CECL-related provisions, but this was more than offset by a release of CECL-related provisions of CHF 168 million. We saw net write-offs of CHF 92 million in the quarter, and FX and other matters reduced the total by CHF 80 million to an overall total of CHF 6.14 billion by the end of June. Now I'd now like to turn to the divisional summaries, please. And unless I state otherwise, just for clarity, I will be referring to the adjusted numbers, excluding significant numbers, items and the Archegos loss. And I'd like to start, as usual, with the Swiss Universal Bank. Net revenues for the quarter were 1% lower year-on-year, CHF 1.33 billion. This was driven by higher recurring revenues on the back of expanded client business volumes, albeit offset by reductions in GTS revenues and in deposit income. Our mandate penetration increased to 39%, and that compares to 36% for the same quarter of last year. SUB benefited from further reductions in credit provisions as the macroeconomic environment continued to improve. We took CHF 26 million of new provisions in the quarter, consistent with levels for the first quarter of the year, and that was more than offset by CHF 47 million in CECL-related provision leases. Operating expenses were 4% lower year-on-year at CHF 758 million, helped by continued synergies from the completion of the integration of Neue Aargauer Bank, which resulted in an adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, of CHF 592 million, up 13% year-on-year. With regard to net new assets, our Private Clients business saw net outflows of CHF 0.9 billion in the quarter, offset by net inflows of CHF 1.5 billion for the quarter in our corporate and institutional client businesses. For the first half, these business lines saw net inflows of CHF 1.3 billion and CHF 5.4 billion, respectively. I'd now like to turn to International Wealth Management, which, as you know, we report separately to Asset Management. Net revenues for the division were 11% lower, CHF 803 million, and this was primarily due to lower transaction-based revenues which were 33% down year-on-year, driven by lower client activity and reduced GTS revenues as well as by a fall in net interest income, which was adversely impacted by the weaker U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc. Net interest income was 14% lower year-on-year, partly due to FX moves and partly due to lower rates on deposit income, but this was, to a degree, offset by income from higher loan volumes. Against this, recurring commissions and fees improved by 16% year-on-year, driven by a 20% increase in client business volume. Mandate penetration for the division was steady at 34%. A release of CHF 50 million for CECL-related provisions more than offset new provisions for credit losses of CHF 25 million in the quarter. And total operating expenses for the period improved by 7%, driven by lower variable compensation accruals. And this resulted in an adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, of CHF 225 million, marginally higher than for the same quarter of last year. But I would point out, this does include an adverse currency impact on translation of CHF 14 million. Now with regard to net new assets, we saw net outflows totaling CHF 0.3 billion for the division, with net new money from Western European clients, offset by outflows in emerging markets. For the first half, IWM saw net inflows of CHF 6.9 billion, equivalent to a growth rate of 4%. Let me turn now to Asia Pacific. After the strong start to the year, APAC saw net revenues declined by 8% year-on-year to USD 770 million, primarily due to a 22% decline in transaction-based revenues. This was largely driven by lower GTS and IBCM revenues, partly offset by substantially lower mark-to-market losses and improved levels of Private Clients activity. As in the other 2 Wealth Management divisions, we saw strong growth in recurring commissions and fees which were 39% higher year-on-year at USD 115 million, with mandate penetration higher at 15% compared to 12% in the same period of last year as well as by increased fund volumes. Net interest income was 2% higher year-on-year at USD 276 million, with lower deposit margins partly offset by growth in deposit volumes and net loans. A release in CECL-related provisions of USD 19 million resulted in a net USD 6 million in provision for credit losses in the quarter. Total operating expenses were 7% higher year-on-year at USD 586 million, largely due to the investments in the franchise that I mentioned before, with the weakening of the U.S. dollars also having an adverse impact on translated Swiss franc costs into APAC. The result was a decline in adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, of 13% year-on-year to USD 178 million. In terms of net new assets, whilst the outflows of USD 6.7 billion was disappointing, this was primarily driven by USD 4.2 billion of outflows resulting from the deliberate derisking measures that we implemented in the second quarter. These outflows mean that the NNA figure for the first half was a negative USD 1.3 billion. Let me turn now to Asset Management. Now first, I'd like to reiterate that Credit Suisse Asset management's top priority remains the return of cash to those of our clients who are invested in the Greensill supply chain finance funds, which we started to wind down at the beginning of March. As we highlighted earlier, we're planning our fourth cash distribution to fund investors. To date, the total cash position, including payments already made and cash recovered and remaining in the funds, is approximately USD 6.6 billion or 2/3 of the fund's net asset values at the end of February. Now whilst work on the supply chain finance funds continues at pace and remains a key priority, the division has delivered a good quarter. Net revenues were 12% higher year-on-year at CHF 404 million, driven by a 38% increase in performance and placement fees but partly offset by investment and partnership income, which was 15% lower year-on-year. Although as I mentioned before, total operating expenses were 8% higher at CHF 297 million, the division still generated an adjusted pretax income of CHF 106 million, an increase of 26% year-on-year. Now notwithstanding the supply chain finance matter, we had positive net new asset inflows of CHF 1.3 billion into our Asset Management division for the quarter, which contributed to the assets under management total at the end of the second quarter increasing to CHF 471 billion, 11% higher year-on-year. And then by the way, in the last 4 quarters, the Asset Management division has seen inflows of CHF 22.9 billion. Now let me just conclude then, please, with a few words on the Investment Bank. Clearly, the results from the Investment Bank were adversely affected by the loss relating to the exit of our remaining Archegos positions in the second quarter. As I've mentioned already, these totaled USD 542 million in revenue losses, USD 77 million in credit provisions and USD 33 million in related expenses. A second factor in our performance was the resizing of the Prime Service business and the more conservative approach to risk that we have been taking across the bank. We said in the first quarter that we would reduce leverage exposure in the Investment Bank by at least USD 35 billion, and we have, in fact, reduced it by USD 41 billion or 11% quarter-on-quarter, notwithstanding higher HQLA. We have also reduced RWAs in the Investment Bank by USD 20 billion quarter-on-quarter. Now I think unsurprisingly, this resizing of the Prime Service business has had an adverse impact on revenues within the equity sales and trading businesses, where adjusted revenues, excluding the Archegos loss, of USD 514 million, 17% lower year-on-year. But I think separate from these measures, we have delivered a more resilient performance elsewhere in our Investment Bank. Whilst we have seen some declines in certain business lines compared to a year ago, we have also seen continued outperformance in securitized products and a 23% increase in capital markets revenues, excluding the mark-to-market gains that we saw in leveraged finance in the second quarter of 2020. Advisory revenues were 34% lower at USD 123 million, primarily due to the delayed deals closings, with a number of transactions being pushed back into the next quarter. As Thomas has already commented, the pipeline, both in capital markets and in advisory, is at high levels as we go into the second half of 2021. Now as with the other divisions, we saw a net release of provisions for credit losses, in this case, of USD 61 million, of which $58 million were CECL-related. Our adjusted operating expenses were 5% lower year-on-year at USD 1.76 billion, primarily due to reduced compensation costs. In terms of profitability in the Investment Bank, as I've said before, the completion of the exit of the Archegos position has resulted in a pretax loss for the second quarter of USD 86 million on a reported basis. Now excluding Archegos and making the other usual adjustments, our pretax income was USD 601 million compared to USD 979 million a year ago. With that, I would like to conclude my part of this morning's presentation and hand back to Thomas. Thank you very much.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'I actually suggest we directly go into Q&A.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani ',\n","    'text': \"So we will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. At the end of the Q&A, Thomas will provide some concluding remarks. [Operator Instructions] Sharon, let's open the line, please.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"I've got 2 questions, and they're both on the deleveraging particularly, kind of quarter-on-quarter. So really, my first question is about the Investment Bank because, of course, you have kind of shown higher, I suppose, deleveraging numbers than we expected. And of course, part of it or a large part of it was Prime Services. But is there any other kind of some business line or any other, yes, business that you would like to highlight from the perspective of the residual of that deleveraging to be coming from? And my second question is really around the risk-weighted assets fall quarter-on-quarter also within wealth. We have seen your risk-weighted assets coming down. We have seen your loans coming down quarter-on-quarter, particularly in APAC as well. Could you give us a sense what was happening kind of there apart from your kind of derisking that you have mentioned? And then so could you give us a sense, when you talk about this reduction in risk appetite currently, what does it actually mean? What sort of constraints are you operating on from a risk perspective?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much, Magdalena, and thank you very much for the question. I think in terms of deleveraging, the primary focus was the resizing of the prime business within the Investment Bank. And as you know, it was partly offset by an increase in HQLA, but there's nothing else particularly to highlight, Magdalena. I think in terms of risk-weighted assets, within -- across the bank overall, I'd just refer you back to the table which we showed on Page 27 of the deck basically. So what you see here is, obviously, is -- and this is in Swiss franc terms, is a CHF 19 billion reduction in the Investment Banking RWA and a CHF 3 billion increase in SUB, IWM, APAC, Asset Management and CC. But you are correct because the CC number includes, as we've noted, opposite, a CHF 6 billion increase in operational risk RWA, which we've warned about before and flowed through. So net-net, the Wealth Management division was slightly down year-on-year. I mean, I don't think there's anything specific I'd like to highlight. I mean, I think one point I did bring out was the fact that we did review very carefully the businesses across the entire bank. There's been a very thorough risk review, which is being conducted by the tactical crisis committee of the Board of Directors. And that has included the Wealth Management operations as well as the Investment Bank. And we did basically result -- that did result in $4.2 billion of net new asset outflows within APAC, relating to certain clients where we did decide to significantly restrict our activities. But there was nothing broad in terms of that. I think it was fair and appropriate that I think following both the Greensill episodes and the Archegos issues, that we did do a thorough review of our risk appetite, which was led by our interim Chief Risk Officer, Jo Oechslin, and in conjunction with the tactical crisis committee of the Board, and we then continued a thorough risk review across the bank. And I think that taking that more conservative approaches has been the right thing to do in the second quarter. But clearly, the bulk of the reductions have clearly been borne by prime and by the Investment Bank.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"And David, are we likely to see more of those kind of reviews of clients into the third and fourth quarter, similar thing that you've described happened in APAC in the second quarter? Or would you think that, that process is largely complete?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': 'That process is largely complete. I think you can understand that given the events of February and March, and this was done on an accelerated basis immediately after that. And as I said, the tactical crisis committee has been going through our business portfolio one by one, and obviously, [Zeth] is an executive member of that committee, and I think it has been a good and thorough process, but the bulk of that has now been completed. I mean, I think just generally speaking, in terms of group-wide RWA and leverage, I think you should probably assume that the levels pertaining at the end of the second quarter where I roughly expect to operate for the third quarter, if that’s of some help, Magdalena.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Benjamin Goy ',\n","    'text': \"Two questions, please, also one on Wealth Management and one on the Investment Bank. In Wealth Management, transaction-based revenues were down and also underperforming peers. So just wondering on some thoughts. How much is lower risk appetite? How much was client derisk taking? And how this fits into your strategic review? Should we assume once that is done for a division, so to say they can be more capital allocated even before it's formally announced in end of the year? And then secondly, in the Investment Bank, you mentioned the $100 million impact from the prime reduction. So is Q2 the new run rate, of course, with all the moving parts in the market? Or do you think there could be a knock-on effect into the second half further impacting revenues here?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Yes. It's Thomas here. I will take the first question, and then David will take the second question. So as you can see on Page 13, we did have weaker transactional revenues in the second quarter, which was primarily driven by the reduction in RWAs and risk and has been obviously driven by also lower client activity. But at the same time, as you can see, for the first full half, we are actually up in terms of transactional revenues, and we expect this to normalize again as we go into the second half of the year. Recurring has been on a positive trend given our increase in assets under management, and we continue to expect that. And we expect net interest income to stabilize where we are. Also, net interest income has been obviously impacted short term to some extent from our more conservative risk approach.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers ',\n","    'text': 'Yes. I think on the second point, I mean, I don’t particularly want to add to the outlook statement that we’ve actually made already. And as I said though, I think, to an answer to the previous question, I would expect the bank to offer at roughly constant levels of RWA and leverage through the third quarter. I think a few points really. As I’ve indicated, the drop in transaction activity in the Wealth Management business was primarily driven by GTS-related revenues, where we saw us much lower levels of client activity, but also given the importance of derivative products within GTS, a substantial fall in volatility in markets in which we actually operate in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter a year ago, which has a significant impact on GTS revenues. And I think I did note earlier that within the Wealth Management-related revenues in APAC, the IBCM component of that was actually down as well. So I think just looking forward, I said I’m not going to add to the outlook statement. I would point out that the third quarter is normally seasonally lower than what you’d normally see, and we’ll see how that seasonal pattern actually develops, but it’s always just worth remembering that. And I would also point out that whilst we do expect to see a more normalization in that, our transaction revenues per unit in Asset Management do remain comparatively high as a consequence of our business model. So I think that’s just worth keeping in mind.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Amit Goel from Barclays.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Amit Goel',\n","    'text': \"So yes, I'll ask 2 questions as well. The first one, just trying to get a sense, I appreciate you don't prejudge the outcome, but -- so the strategic review, just if we can get a bit more color in terms how the process works, how that's being conducted, how decisions will be made and the kind of trade-offs and the processes involved in that, that would be helpful. And secondly, just coming back to the Slide 10 in terms of the, I guess, employee hiring and attrition. I'm just curious, if you were to cut back instead of total employees but rather just looking at, for example, MDs or material risk takers, does it give the same picture? Or is it then slightly different?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Okay. Thank you, Amit. So with the strategic review, as we disclosed a couple of weeks ago, we did – we kicked off the process with a strategic offsite where the full Board of Directors and the full Executive Board participated, and this is now ongoing. We are looking at, obviously, our businesses, the strength and weaknesses, our portfolios. And this is a process that we will do very carefully and we’ll – we have a new Chairman on board who has been not even 3 months with this bank, which is 165 years old. So we are determined to come out with a clear long-term vision for this bank and a concrete 3-year plan. And this is something that we are doing together with the Board of Directors and Executive Board. We are having detailed sessions amongst the ExB as well on these different divisions and business areas. And the clear goal is to come out with an articulated and clear plan at the latest by the end of the year. So that is about the process. In terms of the employees, to your question, yes, absolutely, this is the full picture of all employees. If you look MDs, we do have a slight negative net movement in terms of MDs joiners versus leavers. But again, we are very much focused on investing in the business. We are replacing people through internal candidates and talents and, where needed, through external talents.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher from UBS.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Daniele Brupbacher',\n","    'text': \"Yes.

Was it LTVs, the liquidity of collateral counterparty, concentration, size of these positions? Just be interested to hear what you didn't like about these positions. And then secondly, on the supply chain finance situation, is there -- and you mentioned the 66%. Is there a, call it, a critical threshold you have in mind, above which you feel comfortable having limited side effects, even like litigation issues and stuff?

But this was a one-off move that we had to do and wanted to do, and I do not really want to comment more on individual clients. And on supply chain front, we really want to work through the pipeline of both the focus as well as the non-focus areas. As we say on our page that we have more than 60 internal and external experts working through this pipeline. We are in discussions with the obligors. We are in discussions with insurance. And this is quite a lot of work, but we are making steady process, and we will update you as we make progress. And there’s not really one particular number we have in mind.

You've obviously flagged the $4.2 billion derisking in Asia. But perhaps outside of that, you could talk a bit more about the customer flows that you're seeing in the 3 different segments. And in particular, I'm interested in what the month-to-month progression was. So was it a case that you saw this improve as you move through the quarter? Did it deteriorate as you go through the quarter? What does the momentum look like on the underlying customer flows across the 3 segments? That would be my first question. Second question is more broadly on your outlook statement. You talk about a more conservative approach to risk in the near term, whilst you're finalizing your long-term vision and your midterm plan. In terms of the next couple of quarters, you've alluded that the prime balance reduction is done, but should we expect ongoing revenue attrition given some of the steps you're taking with your approach to risk?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I will take the first one, and then maybe David can take the second one. So we did see positive inflows in the third month of the quarter, so in June. So April, May was really -- were 2 months where we had outflows and where we also proactively addressed some of the client situations that I was alluding to also in APAC. But actually, June was positive inflows in all 3 divisions. And so the momentum into the end of the quarter was very positive. So look, this is something we had to do. We wanted to work through. We clearly also had some side effects from our more cautious approach to lending volumes. We had clear targets for each of the divisions, including Asia, including SUB and including IWM in terms of RWA and leverage for the end of the second quarter because we were determined to achieve our targets that we have set ourselves. And that is obviously one of the side effects that some of the NNA or AUMs that were linked to lending volumes also came down. But as I said, the momentum into the end of the quarter was positive. And if you look at the first half as a whole, we are at around CHF 7 billion now for Wealth Management and CHF 24 billion if you include the institutional Asset Management business.

I don’t think there’s much I can really add. I mean, I think, first, I’d just reiterate usual seasonality to just – let’s not overlook at that point. Secondly, although in terms of the Prime Service impact, the $100 million that Thomas mentioned – alluded to in terms of the second quarter impact, I mean, let’s just be clear. After the Archegos incident, Credit Suisse, we moved, we focused extremely hard on, a, the resizing of the prime portfolio; and b, shifting any clients who are on static margining to dynamic margining. And those 2 things were the priority for the business during the quarter, and we moved as fast as possible in terms of that. So I think you’ve seen the revenue impact in the second quarter. We’re obviously not going to be resizing the prime business upwards going forward. So I think we’ve moved it to a new lower steady state basically. But I mean, this wasn’t a steady process during the quarter. We executed on this. It was fairly obvious what needed to be done, and we executed on that resizing as fast and as quickly as possible in terms of that. I think beyond that, as I said, I think in terms of the capital reduction reallocation process, we did complete that during the quarter. And as I said, I would expect to operate a broadly unchanged levels during the third quarter. And I think you’ll see more normal levels of activity beyond that. But I think certainly, second quarter, the priority was dealing with Archegos. It was dealing with the Greensill-related supply chain funds. That’s unfortunate, but I think it was the right thing to do on behalf of the shareholders, on behalf of the bank overall.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from Exane.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee ',\n","    'text': \"Just a couple of follow-ups on that last point, actually, the restructuring, et cetera. So 2 questions really on it. The first is that the RWA reduction being bigger than expected, it's also actually bigger than what I thought the whole of the prime brokerage was in terms of RWAs. So I just wondered what sort of decisions that involved in terms of going further than targeted? And particularly, what decisions it involved in other areas outside prime, if it did? And then the second question relating to IB. Just sort of on the people side, we've seen a lot of reports about departures and also you'd announced retention packages. So I just wondered, are people leaving despite retention returns? Or is it that the retention effort is more focused on critical areas or something like that?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Maybe, David, do you want to take the first question?

I mean, look, just to be clear, Jeremy, in terms of the deleveraging impact, as I said to Magdalena, that was driven by prime. And I think that was appropriate. It was the resizing in the prime business. In terms of the RWA impact. As you know, prime is a relatively risk -- low-risk density business, notwithstanding experience of Archegos. But we obviously did take a conservative approach to risk across the bank and particularly within the Investment Bank in the second quarter. And that did lead to some RWA reductions elsewhere, which clearly contributed to the RWA decline that we achieved in the second quarter. As I said, look, I think the Greensill matter closely followed by the Archegos matter, I think, necessitated a conservative approach to risk, necessitated a resizing of the risk appetite by our interim Chief Risk Officer and by the tactical crisis committee at the beginning of the second quarter. And I think that clearly has resulted in reductions in RWA beyond the prime financing business. But that said though, I just would say it before I said really now, that in terms of the third quarter level, I think I don't expect to see radical increases or decreases in terms of overall RWA and leverage for either the Investment Bank or for the group as a whole in the third quarter.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'And on your second question, as I mentioned before, we are fully focused on investing in the Investment Bank and within that in capital markets and advisory, where we have seen indeed a higher attrition level, especially on a senior level. If you look at Page 18, you see that year-to-date, we are up 82%, but it’s also a fact that we lost CHF 5 billion to one client in the Investment Bank. And this is not the year where Credit Suisse will be paying as high as you would maybe see in other firms at the moment. So we are clearly not the high payer of the street, if we want. But at the same time, we are fully focused. We have retention. And at the end of the day, we are investing in people internally, in young people. We have good talents internally to take these positions. And if needed, we will go externally and replace these people.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen from Royal Bank of Canada.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Anke Reingen ',\n","    'text': \"The first is with respect to capital and just trying to reconcile to the capital path you helpfully given us with the first quarter. So are we basically through the operational risk model updates, which you previously indicated 30 to 35 basis points, which I think you had 25 in Q2, but is that part basically done? And on the asset sales, you indicated in combination with the IB risk-weighted asset reduction of 40 to 50 basis points. Are there more benefits from asset sales to come? And then secondly, on costs, you're running underlying at around CHF 15.9 billion in the first half. And I mean, I understand things have changed, but you've previously given us the CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion for '21. So I was just thinking about what should we expect for the second half in terms of cost step-up for investment, cost savings, or also the operational costs related to the investigations.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Anke, let me take both of those questions. Firstly, with regard to the operational risk update, that -- those process in that calculation was completed in the second quarter, and that added CHF 6 billion of RWA in the second quarter, and that is certainly complete. There is potentially another CHF 2 billion of methodology changes and updates, which might, but not certainly, might materialize later this year, and that would account for the reconciliation to the number you gave before the 35 basis points, I believe. But I wouldn't regard that as certain at this point. It's more of a prudence buffer I think about in terms of my capital planning. But clearly, either which way, I think the bulk has been done in the second quarter. In terms of asset sales, quite clearly, the largest asset sale was the reduction in the Allfunds position where we dropped below the 10% threshold. So what you see in Allfunds really is a number of factors. Firstly, we had a further gain on Allfunds post the IPO of CHF 298 million recorded across our Wealth Management businesses. Second, we've actually -- we sold down to below 10% in the IPO process itself. And thirdly, you're obviously fully aware that once you drop below 10% under the Basel III rules, the capital treatment changes from being deduction process to being an RWA weighted process basically. So that contributes or that -- those 3 factors resulted in the 28 basis point improvement in the CET1 ratio as a consequence of Allfunds, and that's clearly a very large single disposal-related type event. We do expect to realize further asset sale gains, particularly real estate-related later in the year, and that is still to come, I think, in terms of your planning and thinking. I think the second point then, just in terms of cost guidance, I think it's just fair to say that whilst we will continue to invest across the bank, and obviously, we were pleased to see a 50 net additions in terms of RMs in APAC, which I think is the largest single increase in RMs we've ever achieved and I think demonstrates the investments in the franchise. And we're obviously continuing to invest in our onshore China platform. Nonetheless, I think given that we will be taking a prudent approach to variable compensation awards in light of the loss that our shareholders suffered in respect to Archegos, I think it's fair to say that we will be at the bottom end of the range of the CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion cost guidance that we gave at the Investor Day last year.

And I managed to find one of the passages that you quoted in this report that you published today. And it says here and you quoted is that this is not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct, nor is one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks. And I just wonder how that tallies with the bulk of what you have been communicating today. Because one of the key communications that I understood is that Credit Suisse immediately changed, for example, the way you margin in your prime brokerage, went from static to dynamic, and yet the report seems to suggest that systems are fine.

Well, as we have tried to summarize also on our slide, so just to give you the example on dynamic and static margining. This was already discussed by the teams in September, October. They had agreed that they would move some of the clients, including Archegos, from static to dynamic. It was rediscussed in early March. And if you read the report, they were in the process of actually doing that and reaching out to the client. But it was just not prioritized the way it should have been. So this is, to a large extent, really a series of human errors and failures by the teams. They didn't effectively manage this situation, and whether it was lack of escalation or also limit -- control of limits, which had numerous occasions being breached, but they did not act on it even though they discussed it and were supposed to do it. So this was clearly a series of failures, which is regrettable and which we have now addressed with a new team both on the first line of defense in Prime Services, Prime Services risk and on the risk management side.

It is clear and the report makes clear that the appropriate escalation protocols were in place in both the business and in the second line and in the CPOC committee, which you'll see described there, but they were not operated by the individuals. So the protocols were there, but they were not followed. It's clear that whilst we obviously can improve in our data systems, we can prove in the timeliness of those data systems. Nonetheless, the first and second line data systems did demonstrate the risks to Credit Suisse of Archegos. And again, those were not basically followed up as part of it.

Or what is the mood of your clients when you talk to them going forward, particularly with regards to how shall we think about net new money generation and new wealth management? Do you expect these instances or these issues you had to continue to impact your ability to generate positive net new money going forward? Or have you maybe seen now everything of it?

Can you give us kind of a time line until when you expect the Greensill issue to be completed?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Okay. So on the mood of clients, we are fully engaged with our clients. One thing that I wanted to also add to the one of the previous questions on NNA momentum within the quarter and towards the end of the quarter is that the gross NNA flows are actually very similar to previous years. So clients are fully involved and active in the rare situations or in some of the situations of ultra-high-net worth clients who have asked for, for example, incremental lending, where we have been maybe more cautious. They fully understand that. They don't see that as an issue. You would also see that our assets under custody have increased. So in certain situations where we had a reduction of lending, the underlying collateral, it stayed with us. So we have very positive feedback about the way we have addressed some of these issues with respect to the risk-weighted asset reductions, the fact that we raised the capital immediately at the end of April and the read across from the lessons learned. So investors take a lot of -- sorry, clients take a lot of comfort from the fact also that we are increasing our capital ratio. So the client reaction is very constructive. Clearly, there are some clients, for example, those who were invested in supply chain funds that are having active dialogue with us, and we are keeping them updated on the cash redemptions, and we will continue to improve that situation. But they also understand that this is a process that will take some time. And that really brings me to your second question on the timetable of Greensill. We are paying out now another tranche, as we said, and we will continue to work through the book of work, both for the focus and the non-focus areas. The focus areas involves much more negotiations and also a number of people involved in these discussions, and this will also take a longer time. In parallel, we are engaging with insurers, and that's a process that will certainly continue over the next few months and quarters. We are keeping our clients fully informed about this, and they basically understand the process.

Should we think about 14%, even 14-plus? Or should we think that this kind of level is the level you want to run rate until you have potential impacts coming against your capital? And the second question is just taking a top-down view. Listening what we're hearing today and having a strategic update in December potentially, I'm not exactly clear what the update is about because on the one hand, it sounds like you have derisked, you're happy with the derisking, and now it's more seasonal adjustment to revenues and business.

Clearly, you are investing as you have said, and you say that, I think, in an article, Thomas, at Bloomberg interview, it's absolutely core part of the business.

And I'll...\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers ',\n","    'text': \"I will start, yes. Look, I think, firstly, I think I did guide at the end of the first quarter that I wanted to increase the CET1 ratio to at least 13% and ideally in excess of 13%. I think we have taken a very thorough approach to capital utilization, as I've outlined already, both in terms of the reset, the risk appetite and the bank-wide risk review, and I think that's been right and appropriate. And that has led to the CET1 ratio increasing to 13.7%. And that does, by the way, include the accrual for a dividend in respect to 2021, although the level of that will only be set by the Board of Directors as a recommendation to shareholders at the beginning of next year. And I just think that operating the bank above 13%, I think, is the prudent and the correct thing to do. I have to say I think the scale of the Archegos loss was shocking, a disappointment and clearly a cost to our shareholders. And I think it's an appropriate response. And I would certainly expect to operate in excess of 13% for at least the balance of this particular year basically. I think beyond that, I mean -- and by the way, the leverage ratio is always as important as the CET1 ratio. So the fact we're operating at 4.2% and 6% against the Swiss minimum requirements is as important as the RWA ratio. And I would just reiterate, I would expect to operate north of 4% for the leverage ratio for at least the balance of 2021. I think in terms of our longer-term capital guidance, I think we will provide a proper update to that as part of the conclusion of the strategic review once it's completed by the end of this year.

And it's also very clear that you should never waste a crisis, and that's why we also want to take the right decisions on the basis of what we have seen now in the first 2 quarters on the back of both Archegos and supply chain fund. And that's why I'm not going to start to give piecemeal strategic insights on our thinking. We will go through the process, as I said. Together with the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, we are focused on clearly designing and articulating a long-term vision for the bank and a concrete midterm plan, and we will present those when we are ready to do so.

And I think Moody's, as you know, did downgrade certain of our instruments early this month, although that was partly in the connection with a technical change relating to their treatment of certain AT1 instruments in terms of the subordination and treatment as equity or debt between the different layers of the bank. Now that's going to be, obviously, an ongoing process. And I imagine they'll be reviewing these results and also the Archegos report just as you are basically. And I think it's only appropriate, we do list that as a risk factor. I mean, as a matter of practicality, I would say, basically, if you look at the moves in certain management such as CDSs, they're really basically priced in such a downgrade some months ago basically. And the rating agencies now have to make their own decisions about this whole thing. But I think it's appropriate we list it as a risk factor just because it clearly is a risk factor. But I think it's probably priced in already. And I guess, we shall see and depend on -- and see how they choose to react to this report. Clearly, the capital ratios, in particular, are substantially higher than I think anybody was actually expecting, and that's obviously a key factor in terms of this. And I think it is worth bottom line in terms of pretax income on an underlying basis, it's about 11% lower than what was a very strong period a year ago.

We have learned and will continue to learn the lessons from these events, and we will ensure that we emerge stronger by improving our capital ratios and strengthening risk, compliance and control foundations. We have market-leading positions and strong capabilities across our client franchises in Wealth Management, Asset Management and in the Investment Bank as evidenced by the solid underlying results in the first half of the year. Our Swiss-anchored bank enjoys leading positions in our home market as well as in fast-growing economies around the world, and our integrated model should position us well to capture growth opportunities going forward. Finally, and most importantly, we value our deep pool of talented and dedicated employees, who are fully committed to serving our clients, whether corporate, institutional or wealth. They fill me and my colleagues on the ExB with confidence for our future, and I thank them immensely for the dedication and hard work. And with this, I would like to thank you again for your participation and would like to conclude this session. Thank you very much.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': 'Well, if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to IR.

Welcome, and thank you for joining Credit Suisse Group's Third Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call for Analysts and Investors. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Kinner Lakhani, Head of Investor Relations and Group Strategy and Development. Please go ahead, Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We have a busy schedule ahead of us with our third quarter earnings presentation, followed by our Investor Day 2021 presentation, which begins at 8:45 GMT.  So please note that this call will only focus on earnings, and I kindly ask you to respect that in the Q&A that follows.  Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For more detail on our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse third quarter 2021 financial report, which we published this morning.  I will now hand over to our Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will then run through our numbers. Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Kinner, and good morning from London. I am pleased to present our third quarter results alongside David. This is the first of several presentations you will hear from the 2 of us, other Executive Board members and our Chairman today as we will present later the conclusions of our comprehensive strategy review.  Our strong third quarter results reflect 4 important factors that put us in excellent position to further our growth strategy: robust underlying performance, good net new asset inflows, strong capital and progress in addressing legacy issues. They reflect progress in achieving our clear objectives to become an even stronger, more client-centric bank that puts risk management at our core and to deliver sustainable growth for investors, clients and colleagues.  This is an important day for us at Credit Suisse. I would like to focus our attention for this presentation and our Q&A on third quarter results, as Kinner just said. We have a packed agenda, and we look forward to engaging with you later on our strategy. With that, let me turn to the slides.  On this summary slide, Page 4, I would like to highlight the following. We are reporting a pretax income of CHF1 billion for the third quarter, up 26% year-on-year. This included gains related to Archegos, mainly pertaining to the future recovery of receivables as well as further gain on our residual stake in all funds. We have taken a further CHF0.1 billion impairment on our York interest and major litigation charges of around CHF0.6 billion, including CHF0.2 billion in respect of our recent settlements on the Mozambique matter as well as provisions in respect of legacy mortgage-related matters and the supply chain finance funds matter.  On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items in Archegos, pretax income was CHF1.4 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Please note that we will describe the adjusted divisional figures on this basis throughout the presentation.  We were very pleased to see, after the outflows of the second quarter, positive net inflows across each of our 3 Wealth Management businesses totaling CHF6.2 billion, representing a 3% annualized growth rate. And we achieved this despite further outflows related to the supply chain finance fund matter as well as deleveraging and market-related client outflows in APAC as other competitors have also seen it.  We saw a record third quarter performance within our Swiss Universal Bank, where a 5% year-on-year increase in revenues underpinned a 24% increase in pretax income. Pretax income was down 25% year-on-year in IWM, impacted by lower net interest income, albeit stabilizing on a sequential basis and lower transactional revenues. This was offset by higher recurring fees with positive net new assets.  Our APAC division achieved a 5% year-on-year growth in pretax income with higher recurring fees, partially offset by a step-up in investments with relationship managers, which were up to 670 from 600 at the start of 2021. The Investment Bank delivered a strong performance with PTI up 25% year-on-year despite a roughly 10% decline in allocated capital from scaling back our prime services business. We saw notable strength in capital markets and advisory, securitized products and equity derivatives.  We saw a solid performance in adjusted results in our Asset Management division with a substantial, increase in pretax income year-on-year, supported by growth across all revenue lines. Our CET1 ratio stood at 14.4%, up from 13.7% at the end of the second quarter. This is the highest CET1 ratio Credit Suisse has ever reported.  Clearly, it has been another important quarter for the bank in terms of settling legacy issues. I would also note that FINMA, our Swiss regulator, has also concluded its enforcement action in respect of historic observation activities, and I would reiterate that we -- what we have said previously which is that we condemn any unjustified observations. We can now draw a line under this matter.  With regards to the independent investigation into the supply chain finance fund matter, this continues to be a focus for the bank and work is ongoing, as we can see on the next slide. Here, we provide some more detail on the current status of the supply chain finance fund matter. Eight months after we took the decision to gate the funds, CS AM's priority remains recovery of cash for investors. We made a fifth cash distribution at the end of September, taking the total returns to approximately USD 6.3 billion. Including current cash and cash equivalents, total recovery stands at approximately USD 7 billion or 70% of the fund's NAV as at the end of February.  We have recovered about 86% of the exposure in the so-called non-focus areas with approximately USD 600 million outstanding, and there is approximately USD 2.2 billion outstanding in the focus areas, where we continue to pursue all available recovery options open to us, including insurance.  And as at the end of October, we have filed several claims. CS AM was last month able to sign a debt restructuring arrangement with GFG Alliance Australia as part of which we have received an initial payment of approximately USD 96 million with approximately USD 178 million, including interest to be paid to us in installments by the middle of 2023 at the latest. While that process continues, we have also been actively engaging with clients to explore ways in which we can support them, and we have put in place a fee waiver program for eligible clients as a gesture of goodwill and a sign of the importance we put on these relationships.  On this Slide 8 -- 6, you see our underlying performance has been very strong, both in a year-on-year comparison, but also in a multiyear comparison. As I previously stated, in the third quarter of our current year, our adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items in Archegos, was CHF1.4 billion, by far the best third quarter in the last 5 years, as you see in the top chart. Even if market conditions were exceptionally strong at the start of the year, our 9-month revenue performance over the past 2 years highlights the core strength of our business. We have a great foundation to invest in and grow.  With that short presentation, let me now turn it over to David to go through our third quarter results in more detail. We look forward to your questions and to our engagement throughout the day. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much, Thomas. I'd just like to take a few minutes first to go through the key financials before outlining the performance for each of the divisions in more detail. And after that, we will move to take questions, although, as Thomas has already said, at this point, only in respect to the financial results for the third quarter, and we reserve questions relating to the strategy review for later today.  Now let me just start with a look at the reported results. Our revenues increased by 5% year-on-year to CHF5.4 billion, whilst our operating expenses were 6% higher at CHF4.6 billion. We released a net total of CHF144 million in provisions for credit losses, CHF188 million of which was in respect of Archegos. You'll note that we did see an increase, though, in our CECL-related revision, reflecting a degree of uncertainty around the pace and the nature of the economic recovery. Overall, we delivered a reported pretax income of CHF1 billion, 26% higher than the same period last year.  I think you know our tax rate continues to be adversely inflated due to the net Archegos loss in the first quarter and stands at 57% for the quarter, resulting in a net income attributable to shareholders of CHF434 million, 21% lower year-on-year. This equates to a return on tangible equity for the group of 4.5%.  Next slide, please. As you have seen from the media release, we have recorded a number of adjusted and significant items this quarter, both credits and debits, and I wanted to be clear about the effect that they've had on the reported numbers compared to the same period last year.  Now first, we have taken a total of CHF564 million with respect to major litigation provisions. A significant component of this is in respect to the Mozambique matter, which we announced 2 weeks ago. As you know, we reached a combined settlement of USD 475 million with respect -- with regulators in the U.S., the U.K. and in Switzerland, together with a commitment to forgive USD 200 million of Mozambican debt. As we said at the time, this has required a further charge of CHF214 million in the quarter, and that's in addition to the provisions that we've already taken in previous quarters.  The balance of the litigation provisions was taken primarily in connection with legacy mortgage-related matters, although I can confirm that we have taken a provision with respect to litigation risk resulting from the supply chain finance funds matter.  Now separate to litigation provisions, you can also see on the chart that we took an impairment of CHF113 million with regard to our stake in York Capital Management, which reduces the outstanding total on the balance sheet to CHF187 million.  Now against these negatives, we have 2 significant gains in the third quarter. With regard to Archegos, I said earlier in the year, that we are very focused on recovering as much as possible our loss from the Archegos estate, and we intend to pursue our claims regarding this matter with vigor. Following the initial work on this claim, the immediate assessment of the future recoverability of receivables at this stage, together with an expense recovery due to the clawbacks of the previously granted compensation awards, has resulted in a gain this quarter of CHF235 million, which are taken in the Investment Bank.  Just to be clear, this is an ongoing process. This remains a key priority for us, and we continue to expect that we should realize further gains over the course of the coming quarters, though it is, of course, difficult at this point to estimate the timing or the size of such recoveries.  Now the second positive significant item is the gain from our 8.6% interest in Allfunds, which was successfully listed back in April. The rise in the stock price in the third quarter has resulted in a gain in pretax income of CHF129 million. Now including other adjustments related to real estate and business sales, our adjusted pretax income, therefore, excluding significant items, totaled CHF1.36 billion, CHF354 million higher than the reported figure. By comparison, in the third quarter of last year, our adjusting for significant items contributed CHF284 million to reported pretax income, taking the adjusted total to CHF1.09 billion.  Let me turn now to capital ratios on the next slide. Our CET1 ratio for the third quarter stood at 14.4%, and that's an increase from 13.7% at the end of the previous quarter. Now if you move from left to right on the chart, you can see that 23 basis points of that 70 basis point increase is the result of organic pretax income. That's excluding the moves in Archegos and in the equity stake in Allfunds, which then contributed 8 and 5 basis points, respectively.  Now whilst our tax rate continues to be elevated when applied to our pretax income, this only results in a reduction of the CET1 ratio of 4 basis points as we've continued to earn out deferred tax assets resulting from the first quarter charge.  Then just completing this, RWA reductions contributed a further 28 basis points of uplift, and these occurred across the bank.  Now on the bottom chart, as you can see here, the same factors broadly resulted in an improvement in our CET1 leverage ratio totaling 10 basis points, which increased the ratio from 4.2% at the end of the second quarter to 4.3% at the end of the third quarter. Our leverage exposure actually increased by CHF6 billion in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, including an increase in HQLA balances of CHF8 billion, mainly driven by increased funding and higher customer deposits in Wealth Management. But this was more than offset by the leverage reductions that we've instigated over the last 6 months, together, clearly, with the increase to capital from our organic capital generation.  Now as I'm sure you've seen from the strategy documents that we published this morning, we intend to operate at a CET1 ratio in excess of 14%, that's pre the Basel III reforms; and equity leverage ratio of around 4.5%, but we'll cover this in more detail during our strategy review later this morning.  Let me turn to expenses, please. Cost discipline remains a key area of focus for us. In the first 9 months of the year, costs were 3% lower at CHF12 billion on an adjusted basis, that's excluding significant items and Archegos. This primarily reflects lower compensation expenses. And during the period, continued to invest in a number of strategic initiatives, including hiring relationship managers and strengthening our risk and our control processes. For the year as a whole, we would currently estimate adjusted operating expenses to be between CHF6.2 billion and CHF16.5 billion.  Next slide, please. Now what we show here is that whilst our overall allowance for credit losses has fallen from CHF6.1 billion at the end of the second quarter to CHF5.9 billion at the end of the third, we have seen a small increase in our CECL-related provision totaling CHF20 million. This reflects a conservative view on potentially adverse economic developments, including uncertainty around the timing and the pace of the withdrawal of the various measures introduced by central banks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the related shocks of which are a consequence of the recovery.  Now let me turn now to the divisional overviews, where, unless I state otherwise, I'll refer to the adjusted numbers, that is excluding significant items and excluding Archegos. Before doing so, I'd like everyone to note please that the divisional return on regulatory capital calculation has been updated to align more closely with the targets for group capital and leverage ratios. We are now applying a definition for allocated capital based on 13.5% of RWA and 4.25% of leverage exposure. We've applied this consistently across all of the third quarter documents that you will see this morning, and this will also be the basis of the allocated metrics that we will see in the strategy review presentations later on.  Now let me start just as usual with the Swiss Universal Bank. The Swiss Universal Bank has continued its strong performance so far this year, delivering a record third quarter, driven by higher revenues, which increased by 5% year-on-year to CHF1.36 billion. We saw increases in all major revenue categories, and I'd highlight, in particular, the 11% year-on-year increase in recurring commissions and fees, supported by record assets under management as well as higher revenues from our investment in the Swisscard partnership.  Our provision for credit losses remains low with a net provision of CHF4 million for the quarter, whilst operating expenses were slightly lower year-on-year at CHF764 million. Our adjusted pretax income for the division, excluding significant items, was 24% higher year-on-year at CHF586 million, resulting in a return on regulatory capital of 15% compared to 12% in the third quarter of last year.  Now in terms of net new assets, although we did see approximately CHF400 million of net outflows in our Corporate & Institutional Clients business, this was more than offset by CHF1.9 billion of net inflows in our Private Clients business reversing the outflows that we saw in the second quarter.  Let me turn now to International Wealth Management, please. Net revenues were 3% lower year-on-year at CHF812 million. Whilst recurring commissions and fees grew by 13%, in line with the increase in client business volumes, our net interest income was affected by the impact of lower interest rates on deposits, albeit partly offset by the impact from higher loan volumes, which increased by 4% compared to the same quarter of last year. However, the less volatile market conditions in 2021 compared to last year meant that we also saw reduced client activity and, therefore, reduced transaction-based revenues, including those from GTS.  Now operating expenses were 5% higher year-on-year at CHF624 million with lower deferred and discretionary compensation expenses more than offset by our investment in IT infrastructure and digitalization along with increased costs related to our sustainability initiatives. Provision for credit losses was CHF12 million compared to CHF8 million in the same quarter of last year.  Adjusted pretax income for the division, excluding significant items, was CHF176 million, 25% lower year-on-year. However, IWM did see a reversal of the net outflows of the second quarter with positive net new assets totaling CHF1.4 billion, notwithstanding CHF1.5 billion relating to the supply chain finance funds matter this quarter.  Let me now turn to the Asia Pacific division. Asia Pacific revenues were broadly stable year-on-year at USD 795 million. Revenues from recurring commissions and fees were 90% higher, reflecting strong mandate and fund volumes with mandate penetration again improving to 15%. Our transaction-based revenues were 4% higher with higher fees from increased M&A activity, albeit offset by weaker client -- private client activity and lower GTS revenues.  However, offsetting these gains, our net interest income was 14% lower at USD 242 million, adversely impacted by 2 factors. First, as part of our ongoing and overall strategy and risk review, we have continued to derisk certain lending positions, and we have reduced certain exposures. Second, from the client side, there's no doubt that the turbulence in the Greater China market has caused some clients to reduce leverage in response to these adverse conditions.  Provisions for credit losses decreased significantly year-on-year. A total of USD 7 million was well below the USD 49 million that we took in the third quarter of last year and similar to the level we took in the second quarter.  Now we've talked before on a number of occasions about the investments that we're making in the Asia Pacific region, and I'd just like to make a couple of points. We now have 670 relationship managers in the region compared to 600 at the start of the year, and we've continued to make strategic investments, including in our China franchise. This is the primary reason for the 5% year-on-year increase in operating expenses, which stood at USD 582 million for the quarter.  Overall, our adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, was 5% higher year-on-year at USD 206 million. As with SUB and with IWM, the asset outflows that we saw in the second quarter were reversed with net new assets totaling USD 3.2 billion in the quarter, notwithstanding the deleveraging that I mentioned before.  Let me turn now to the Investment Bank, please. Our Investment Bank delivered another robust performance despite continued constraints on capital usage with RWA 13% lower year-on-year at USD 78 billion, the strength of our client franchise and favorable conditions for our capital markets and advisory businesses enabled the investment bank to achieve revenues that were 9% higher than in the strong third quarter that we reported last year at USD 2.44 billion. And the main driver for this was increased client activity across our capital markets, M&A and equity derivative businesses.  The pipeline of new transaction in both ECM and advisory remains strong, which should enable us to sustain this momentum into the coming quarters.  As we've seen across the industry, fixed income revenues were lower. And whilst we've had continued outperformance in securitized products, this was offset by a reversion to more normal conditions in emerging markets, macro and global credit. If we look at equities. Whilst we saw a robust performance in both derivatives and in cash, the overall performance was adversely affected by the reduction in the size of prime services, which we commenced in the second quarter and which has continued in the third quarter.  Now as we said before, in addition to our strong adjusted pretax income, we also had a gain of USD 252 million relating to Archegos, $202 million of which was released from our provision for credit losses. As I already noted, this reflects an initial assessment of recoverability from receivables in the Archegos matter.  Operating expenses was 2% higher year-on-year at USD 1.84 billion, resulting -- meaning that our adjusted pretax income, excluding Archegos, was 25% higher at USD 582 million. On a reported basis, including the Archegos-related gain that I just mentioned, pretax income was 105% higher at USD 832 million.  So let me just conclude then with a few words on asset management. Overall, as you can see from this slide, we had a mixed performance in our Asset Management business in the quarter. First, as I've remarked already, we decided to impair our investment in York Capital by a further CHF113 million this quarter. Second, primarily due to a delay in new fund launches previously scheduled for the third quarter, we saw net outflows of CHF1.7 billion, primarily in respect to our index business.  However, against these negatives, if we look at the adjusted performance, excluding significant items, our revenues was higher across all 3 business lines and a well-managed approach to expenses, and that's notwithstanding additional costs in respect to the supply chain finance fund matter, means that on this basis, our pretax income improved to CHF115 million.  And with that, I'd like to conclude, and Thomas and I will now take your questions, although just to remind you, at this moment, this will just be in respect of our third quarter earnings. We're very happy to take questions on the strategy review later on this morning after the presentations. But thank you.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher from UBS.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: Yes. Can I ask two things? One, on just your visibility and expectation with regards to regulatory changes on the RWA side, capital requirement side on the back of recent matters and how that could additionally now impact multipliers, add-ons and what have you. I'm still struggling to get my arms around all of the moving parts there, whether you could give us some visibility.  And then on capital, I mean, capital ratio, you said it, record-high level at the group level 14.4%. Can you tell us how the parent bank looks like? I think it was at 13.3 on a phase-in basis at Q2 or 10.6 on the fully loaded, which feels a bit tied to me. And I was just wondering how you think about that ratio, how relevant it is and how you could basically improve that, what the optionalities around that, that would be super helpful.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Daniele. Thank you for your questions. So let me just kick off with -- on the point around regulatory changes, regulatory inflation. I think at this point, all I can really say is I think what you know already, which is that we have a Pillar 2 charge totaling USD 2 billion in respect of the Greensill supply chain finance funds matters, which was something that we agreed with FINMA during the first quarter, and that remains unchanged from now.  And in respect of the litigation provisions, which I've taken this morning, totaling CHF564 million, I would expect an increase in op risk RWA as it works its way through the system over the next couple of quarters of around CHF1 billion in terms of op risk increases.  I think in terms of other matters, just to anticipate the follow-on question, I don't have any more visibility at this point in terms of any other operational risk charges or moderated charges relating to the Archegos matter or, indeed, to the Greensill matter. So I can't update you on that basically, and nothing much I can really add. It's clearly a situation we're looking at very closely, but certainly the situation hasn't changed since I spoke at the end of the second quarter or indeed, for that matter, at the end of the first quarter.  Now I think Daniele, you asked a good question around the parent bank. And I just recognize that although this is in respect to the FINMA decree, which goes back to 2017, I think there have been a couple of good research notes written on this, including by yourself earlier this year. So let me just give you a few numbers.  So the group CET1 ratio, as you say, was 14.4%. The parent at the end of the third quarter was 13.4% on a transitional basis because I think you need to know that the decree from 2017 phases in over this decade up until 2028. And on a look-through basis, increased slightly to 10.7%. So just in terms of -- so those are the parent numbers.  Just in terms of capital requirements, the impairment looking forward because just to address the points which have been raised before, I think you know, we've said this morning, we're looking to maintain our CET1 ratio for the group in excess of 14% pre B3R in 2024. For the parent, I'm targeting a look-through ratio of around 12%, so that's the equivalent to that, which is slightly lower than the group number, really, for 2 reasons.  Firstly, the parent is clearly a subset of the group, and it reflects capital requirements that reflects the mix of activities actually in the parent, which are different from those in our subsidiaries, point one; and point two, which point -- I think you understand, which is the B3R impact, there is no B3R impact on the parent. In fact, B3R will actually slightly reduce the capital requirements of the parent because there's no FRTB impact actually on the parent. So the RWA for the parent actually goes down under B3R, whereas it goes up for the group as a whole. So that's why we set a stress-based target for the parent of 12%.  So you might ask a question. So you're at 10.7% now, how are you going to get to 12%? That requires retained capital between now and the end of 2027, beginning of '28 of about CHF6 billion. Just to put that in context, since '17, we have repatriated, with appropriate regulatory approval, CHF12 billion of capital, largely from the U.K. to Switzerland. In addition to that, we have received dividends, obviously, primarily from Credit Suisse Schweiz, but just recently from the U.S., totaling further CHF12 billion. So obviously, we obviously substantially improved the parent capital position since 2017 when the decree was enacted.  Looking forward, a couple of things just to be aware of. I think you're aware of this and it's been discussed before, but we've always, in the past, operated from 2 entities here in the U.K., Credit Suisse International and Credit Suisse Securities Limited, CSSL. CSSL is actually now decommissioned as a material legal entity, which means that there's about CHF8 billion of capital in there, a large proportion of which, again, subject to regulatory approval, we would seek to return to the parent in the near future. And then I think with regard to the United States, we actually passed the CCAR qualitatively, having passed it quantitatively as well, and that means we would be expecting to receive a dividend in excess of USD 2 billion from the U.S. subsidiary to the parent in the near future as well.  So I think you can see there's a number of measures in train to actually close that gap and essentially rebalance capital between the subsidiaries and the parent. So I hope that's helpful to that, and happy to take anything else on that point.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: So I will concentrate on the 3Q and 2 questions. One, still on net interest income within the International Wealth Management and another one on the advisory side of the Investment Bank. So on the NII, of course, we have seen it -- we've seen it coming down. You talked to us about the kind of impact on deposit income and, of course, kind of some offset on the lending side. But could you kind of give us maybe a little bit more steering on where to from here on a kind of quarterly basis? Because I have to say, I think that we've been kind of -- we've been looking out for a kind of more of a stabilization in that number kind of quarter-on-quarter. Should we assume that you're also attracting tremendous amounts of liquidity, i.e., additional deposits, that are kind of dragging that number down as well? So there's one -- question number one.  And question number two, within the investment bank because, of course, you beat consensus numbers quite nicely and, of course, particularly within the advisory and capital markets arena. And I have to say, over the last couple of quarters, we have seen quite a lot of people bleed in that business kind of for you. Should we kind of assume it turned the corner? Because, of course, your revenue performance was actually very decent within a relative context as well.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. I suggest, David, you take the first question, and I will take the second one.\\nDavid Mathers: Okay. Let me just kick off then. I think just in terms of net interest income, I mean, I think, Magdalena, you can see that sequentially, it is stabilizing. It was CHF264 million in the third quarter of '21 compared CHF269 million in the second quarter.  I think I'd just make a couple of points. I think absent any other changes, I would actually expect net interest income to stabilize sequentially in the fourth quarter. But I would just caution, I think you're aware that we have launched a goodwill program with respect to the supply chain finance fund matters, and that may adversely impact the net interest income, although I don't think the impact would be particularly material in the fourth quarter. But I would expect to stabilize, subject to that particular caveat, would be my guidance on that.  Clearly, as we move forward to the GSR movers and the expansion of lending implied then that, obviously, we'd start to expect it to increase, but that probably goes forward then into '22.\\nThomas Gottstein: And with respect to the investment banking pipeline, I think we have a decent pipeline for the fourth quarter, both across M&A and capital markets. We are fully focused on also the hiring side of the equation. And even though we are not talking now about strategy, but as you will have seen, we will move to a global investment bank organization, which will include also our Asian and Swiss IBCM teams who have very strong capital markets and M&A positions in their respective markets. Just as an example, today, we are a lead adviser in Switzerland of this relatively large health care situation.  So I think we have a very decent pipeline, but it's very clear we are focused on this business. It's a capital-light business. It's a business where we have traditionally had very strong positions, and we are focused on hiring. Thank you.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from Exane.\\nJeremy Sigee: Just one question, really, on net new money flows, which I thought were very welcome positive in the quarter and a lot very broad based across 3 regional units. But I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the dynamics behind the return of inflows, whether it's clients that had moved money out, moving it back in again or whether it's the impact of some of the new advisers that you've talked about. Just be interested to hear you talk about some of the dynamics there, please.\\nThomas Gottstein: I would say, generally, it has been broad-based across regions but also within the regions across ultra-high net worth and high net worth. So I'm very pleased with this pattern, but I have to say we are still not, I would say, 100% in terms of impact and growth ammunition. In particular, we still have had, for example, deleveraging going on in Asia, which was more market-driven compared to the second quarter, where it was more our initiative, where, now in the third quarter, this was more market-driven. And we still have, I would say, significant upside in terms of lending, whether it's structured lending in IWM, whether it's more traditional Lombard lending in Switzerland to further fuel NNA growth going forward.  So I think the 3% annualized is okay result, but it's definitely still -- there is room for upside to have a higher annualized growth rate in NNA terms.\\nJeremy Sigee: And is there a material impact from the new hires that you mentioned? Or is it too early to see those?\\nDavid Mathers: Jeremy, I'm really sorry, but you've actually got a bad line. Could you just try that again? Sorry.\\nThomas Gottstein: And if you can speak a bit slower, then we might understand your questions. Sorry.\\nDavid Mathers: Sorry, Jeremy.\\nJeremy Sigee: No problem. Simply asking whether the new hires had an impact on net new money.\\nDavid Mathers: Was that net hires' impact on net new money, I think, actually, Jeremy?\\nJeremy Sigee: Yes. Yes.\\nDavid Mathers: Go ahead, Tom.\\nThomas Gottstein: Well, I would say, generally, when we have net new hires, they always take 6 months to 12 months until you really see the benefit of it. So you will not see that immediately. And the net new hires we saw in Asia, in particular, China, they will not -- they would not have typically yet delivered the net new assets. But the -- so there's some delay there, but we are very focused on net new hires. We have also had net new hires in Premium Clients Switzerland, for example. So that's something we are focused on and will also be a topic in our strategy review this afternoon.\\nDavid Mathers: I'd just add, I think, I mean, I do think the net new asset numbers we saw in APAC were very good, plus CHF3.2 billion. And just to be clear, we have continued a strategic risk review as part of the strategy review process throughout the summer. That did lead to us derisk -- deleveraging further APAC positions during the quarter. So that's actually in that number. And what's more, as I think you've seen from some of our peers, the turbulence in the Greater China market has led to clients deleveraging. So I think to have both of those headwinds and still to be at 3.2, I think, speaks well to the franchise.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\\nKian Abouhossein: Yes. The first question is regarding Investment Banking. Just to understand, considering that it looks like you're making a loss in the Investment Bank, I just wanted to see if you could remind me of how the deferral and accrual of bonus retention works in case you make a loss in the Investment Bank, i.e., are there clawbacks that come into force due to a potential loss having looked at the third quarter and your guidance for the fourth?  And then the second question is just coming back to the rebate discussion. Can you just confirm that you have, on the risk-weighted asset rebate discussion on the parent bank, a permanent structure that this rebate is in place? Or are there any clauses that would lead to some kind of unwinding of the rebate?  And in respect to the upstream numbers that you gave, which were very helpful, David, in terms of capital from the U.S., what is the determinating factor besides CCAR and qualitative test? Is there anything else that determines the U.S. allowing you to upstream? I think you mentioned CHF2 billion.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. I will take the first one, and then David, you can take the second one. So Kian, in terms of the compensation, be it bonuses or be it potential clawbacks, that's ultimately a decision by the Compensation Committee and will be taken during the fourth quarter as we approach year-end. So clearly, that is premature. It's also important to say with respect to the clawback that we've obviously had a change last year where we had global markets join IBCM. So there is a technical way also to look at this from a previous year's clawback perspective.  So I would say it's premature to talk about that, but we are very focused on paying competitively through a combination of bonuses but also in -- with respect to retention programs.\\nDavid Mathers: And I think the only point I'd add to that is just with regard to the goodwill write-down, which we've noted in our 3Q numbers. That definitely is excluded from any such calculation. You may recall we had a similar goodwill write-down, again, relating to DOJ back in 2015 as the precedent for that. But that's all I'd add to what Thomas has said.  I think your second question, well, I think you referred to as a rebate. I think you're returning to what's called the regulatory filter in the parent capital regime. I think that's a little bit misunderstood. It was a core part of the '17 decree. And what -- all it does basically is it converts Swiss GAAP accounting, which is on a cost less impairment basis, to a fair value basis for the subsidiary entities. So in other words, they're actually treated at the fair value of the position as opposed to cost less impairment.  And the practical for that essentially is it means that the Swiss Universal Bank or Credit Suisse Schweiz, to be more accurate, the legal entity, clearly is valued at a premium to book value because I think we all know that Credit Suisse Schweiz is worth more than book value, and I can see that in your sum-of-parts calculations. And that's really what the regulatory filter actually refers to. So that's what -- how it actually works. As to its status, it's a permanent part of the 2017 decree, basically. So that's what it stands for.  Oh, sorry, you asked a question around the U.S. To my understanding, I think we passed the CCAR test, both qualitatively and quantitatively. So the process from here is that the Board of Directors of CSH U.S.A., which is the intermediate holding company, has to meet shortly, actually, to review the dividend in light of the results for the year and to make -- and declare a dividend on the back of that. I'm not going to be drawing the exact number. I certainly know it, but I think in excess of CHF2 billion will do for today.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous Research.\\nStefan Stalmann: Yes. I wanted to quickly follow up on the decommissioning of Credit Suisse Europe, the plans to decommission the entity. Is that plan at all affected by the fact that the entity did plead guilty in regard to this Mozambique affair and regarding the fact that there's still a Group DTA associated with this whole complex? Or do you think this will go ahead without any impact from this?  And the second question, I wanted to clarify what you said about dividend. The press release says 25% of net income in 2022. Is that the distribution that you're planning to make in 2022 for '21? Or is it looking 1 year further out?\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Stefan. Thank you very much. And I mean I just would echo what I said before. I said there have been 2 good research notes written on the parent, and yours was certainly excellent, Stefan. But just in terms of the decommissioning of CSSEL, so we have been working in London now for 6 years on the decommissioning of CSSEL because prior to that point, essentially, you had 2 entities in London, and CSSEL was actually the employer of the bulk of people, and CSI was the, as you might say, the operating entity. And I'm sure you understand from a resolution recovery point of view, that's basically a nonstarter. In addition to the complexity and intercompany capital regimes and fragmentation that results for having 2 such large entities.  So it has been a huge project because we actually had to move everybody out of one entity and into the other, including the pension fund, and actually build an entire securities infrastructure within CSI at the same time as doing Brexit. But I'm very pleased to say that we actually dropped below the key thresholds in terms of the percentage of balance sheet, percentage of RWA and importance of the operating systems. Actually, back in the first quarter of this year, we've continued to actually reduce the positions further because this is the key switch every year, and we no longer accept any new business in CSSEL from October. So it's definitely decommissioned as a material legal entity.  With regard to the Mozambique matter, the reason that Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited took the guilty plea because it was the employer of the 3 individuals who actually pled guilty in a U.S. court a couple of years ago, and that's why it took the guilty plea because that was clearly the precedent for this matter.  The deferred prosecution agreement actually relates to CSAG, not CSSEL. So whilst it's clearly very unfortunate, and we obviously very much regret the whole Mozambique exercise, it doesn't really pertain to the material legal entity status of CSSEL. So hopefully that's covered that point.  I think the -- I think -- thank you very much, Stefan. I think the second question, just in terms of dividend and payout guidance. I mean we're sort of crossing a bit on to the subject for later on this morning. But really, the Board's made 2 statements. Firstly, the dividend for 2021 payable following the approval by the AGM next April, that's a decision that the Board will calibrate once it actually has the full year 2021 results. The comment around the 25% of net income is a forward-looking statement relating to the Board's guidance for the expected percentage of net income that we paid out of 2022 in 2023, again, subject to the AGM or, at that point, basically, in the following year, Stefan.\\nOperator: There are no more questions at this time. I will hand back for closing remarks.\\nThomas Gottstein: Well, thank you very much for joining this call, and I'm sure we will speak to you again later this afternoon. I think the third quarter was a very solid basis on which we can build in not easy circumstances with very strong operating results in -- on an underlying basis but also given the various impairments we took and legal provisions on a reported basis with also strong NNA and strong capital numbers.  So I'm looking forward to talking to you later this morning, and thank you for joining this call. Bye-bye.\\nDavid Mathers: Bye.\",\n","  'transcript_split': [{'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': \"Good morning. This is the conference operator.

This is the first of several presentations you will hear from the 2 of us, other Executive Board members and our Chairman today as we will present later the conclusions of our comprehensive strategy review.  Our strong third quarter results reflect 4 important factors that put us in excellent position to further our growth strategy: robust underlying performance, good net new asset inflows, strong capital and progress in addressing legacy issues. They reflect progress in achieving our clear objectives to become an even stronger, more client-centric bank that puts risk management at our core and to deliver sustainable growth for investors, clients and colleagues.  This is an important day for us at Credit Suisse. I would like to focus our attention for this presentation and our Q&A on third quarter results, as Kinner just said. We have a packed agenda, and we look forward to engaging with you later on our strategy. With that, let me turn to the slides.  On this summary slide, Page 4, I would like to highlight the following. We are reporting a pretax income of CHF1 billion for the third quarter, up 26% year-on-year. This included gains related to Archegos, mainly pertaining to the future recovery of receivables as well as further gain on our residual stake in all funds. We have taken a further CHF0.1 billion impairment on our York interest and major litigation charges of around CHF0.6 billion, including CHF0.2 billion in respect of our recent settlements on the Mozambique matter as well as provisions in respect of legacy mortgage-related matters and the supply chain finance funds matter.  On an adjusted basis, excluding significant items in Archegos, pretax income was CHF1.4 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Please note that we will describe the adjusted divisional figures on this basis throughout the presentation.  We were very pleased to see, after the outflows of the second quarter, positive net inflows across each of our 3 Wealth Management businesses totaling CHF6.2 billion, representing a 3% annualized growth rate. And we achieved this despite further outflows related to the supply chain finance fund matter as well as deleveraging and market-related client outflows in APAC as other competitors have also seen it.  We saw a record third quarter performance within our Swiss Universal Bank, where a 5% year-on-year increase in revenues underpinned a 24% increase in pretax income. Pretax income was down 25% year-on-year in IWM, impacted by lower net interest income, albeit stabilizing on a sequential basis and lower transactional revenues. This was offset by higher recurring fees with positive net new assets.  Our APAC division achieved a 5% year-on-year growth in pretax income with higher recurring fees, partially offset by a step-up in investments with relationship managers, which were up to 670 from 600 at the start of 2021. The Investment Bank delivered a strong performance with PTI up 25% year-on-year despite a roughly 10% decline in allocated capital from scaling back our prime services business. We saw notable strength in capital markets and advisory, securitized products and equity derivatives.  We saw a solid performance in adjusted results in our Asset Management division with a substantial, increase in pretax income year-on-year, supported by growth across all revenue lines. Our CET1 ratio stood at 14.4%, up from 13.7% at the end of the second quarter. This is the highest CET1 ratio Credit Suisse has ever reported.  Clearly, it has been another important quarter for the bank in terms of settling legacy issues. I would also note that FINMA, our Swiss regulator, has also concluded its enforcement action in respect of historic observation activities, and I would reiterate that we -- what we have said previously which is that we condemn any unjustified observations. We can now draw a line under this matter.  With regards to the independent investigation into the supply chain finance fund matter, this continues to be a focus for the bank and work is ongoing, as we can see on the next slide. Here, we provide some more detail on the current status of the supply chain finance fund matter. Eight months after we took the decision to gate the funds, CS AM's priority remains recovery of cash for investors. We made a fifth cash distribution at the end of September, taking the total returns to approximately USD 6.3 billion. Including current cash and cash equivalents, total recovery stands at approximately USD 7 billion or 70% of the fund's NAV as at the end of February.  We have recovered about 86% of the exposure in the so-called non-focus areas with approximately USD 600 million outstanding, and there is approximately USD 2.2 billion outstanding in the focus areas, where we continue to pursue all available recovery options open to us, including insurance.  And as at the end of October, we have filed several claims. CS AM was last month able to sign a debt restructuring arrangement with GFG Alliance Australia as part of which we have received an initial payment of approximately USD 96 million with approximately USD 178 million, including interest to be paid to us in installments by the middle of 2023 at the latest. While that process continues, we have also been actively engaging with clients to explore ways in which we can support them, and we have put in place a fee waiver program for eligible clients as a gesture of goodwill and a sign of the importance we put on these relationships.  On this Slide 8 -- 6, you see our underlying performance has been very strong, both in a year-on-year comparison, but also in a multiyear comparison. As I previously stated, in the third quarter of our current year, our adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items in Archegos, was CHF1.4 billion, by far the best third quarter in the last 5 years, as you see in the top chart. Even if market conditions were exceptionally strong at the start of the year, our 9-month revenue performance over the past 2 years highlights the core strength of our business. We have a great foundation to invest in and grow.  With that short presentation, let me now turn it over to David to go through our third quarter results in more detail. We look forward to your questions and to our engagement throughout the day. Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much, Thomas. I'd just like to take a few minutes first to go through the key financials before outlining the performance for each of the divisions in more detail. And after that, we will move to take questions, although, as Thomas has already said, at this point, only in respect to the financial results for the third quarter, and we reserve questions relating to the strategy review for later today.  Now let me just start with a look at the reported results. Our revenues increased by 5% year-on-year to CHF5.4 billion, whilst our operating expenses were 6% higher at CHF4.6 billion. We released a net total of CHF144 million in provisions for credit losses, CHF188 million of which was in respect of Archegos. You'll note that we did see an increase, though, in our CECL-related revision, reflecting a degree of uncertainty around the pace and the nature of the economic recovery. Overall, we delivered a reported pretax income of CHF1 billion, 26% higher than the same period last year.  I think you know our tax rate continues to be adversely inflated due to the net Archegos loss in the first quarter and stands at 57% for the quarter, resulting in a net income attributable to shareholders of CHF434 million, 21% lower year-on-year. This equates to a return on tangible equity for the group of 4.5%.  Next slide, please. As you have seen from the media release, we have recorded a number of adjusted and significant items this quarter, both credits and debits, and I wanted to be clear about the effect that they've had on the reported numbers compared to the same period last year.  Now first, we have taken a total of CHF564 million with respect to major litigation provisions. A significant component of this is in respect to the Mozambique matter, which we announced 2 weeks ago. As you know, we reached a combined settlement of USD 475 million with respect -- with regulators in the U.S., the U.K. and in Switzerland, together with a commitment to forgive USD 200 million of Mozambican debt. As we said at the time, this has required a further charge of CHF214 million in the quarter, and that's in addition to the provisions that we've already taken in previous quarters.  The balance of the litigation provisions was taken primarily in connection with legacy mortgage-related matters, although I can confirm that we have taken a provision with respect to litigation risk resulting from the supply chain finance funds matter.  Now separate to litigation provisions, you can also see on the chart that we took an impairment of CHF113 million with regard to our stake in York Capital Management, which reduces the outstanding total on the balance sheet to CHF187 million.  Now against these negatives, we have 2 significant gains in the third quarter. With regard to Archegos, I said earlier in the year, that we are very focused on recovering as much as possible our loss from the Archegos estate, and we intend to pursue our claims regarding this matter with vigor. Following the initial work on this claim, the immediate assessment of the future recoverability of receivables at this stage, together with an expense recovery due to the clawbacks of the previously granted compensation awards, has resulted in a gain this quarter of CHF235 million, which are taken in the Investment Bank.  Just to be clear, this is an ongoing process. This remains a key priority for us, and we continue to expect that we should realize further gains over the course of the coming quarters, though it is, of course, difficult at this point to estimate the timing or the size of such recoveries.  Now the second positive significant item is the gain from our 8.6% interest in Allfunds, which was successfully listed back in April. The rise in the stock price in the third quarter has resulted in a gain in pretax income of CHF129 million. Now including other adjustments related to real estate and business sales, our adjusted pretax income, therefore, excluding significant items, totaled CHF1.36 billion, CHF354 million higher than the reported figure. By comparison, in the third quarter of last year, our adjusting for significant items contributed CHF284 million to reported pretax income, taking the adjusted total to CHF1.09 billion.  Let me turn now to capital ratios on the next slide. Our CET1 ratio for the third quarter stood at 14.4%, and that's an increase from 13.7% at the end of the previous quarter. Now if you move from left to right on the chart, you can see that 23 basis points of that 70 basis point increase is the result of organic pretax income. That's excluding the moves in Archegos and in the equity stake in Allfunds, which then contributed 8 and 5 basis points, respectively.  Now whilst our tax rate continues to be elevated when applied to our pretax income, this only results in a reduction of the CET1 ratio of 4 basis points as we've continued to earn out deferred tax assets resulting from the first quarter charge.  Then just completing this, RWA reductions contributed a further 28 basis points of uplift, and these occurred across the bank.  Now on the bottom chart, as you can see here, the same factors broadly resulted in an improvement in our CET1 leverage ratio totaling 10 basis points, which increased the ratio from 4.2% at the end of the second quarter to 4.3% at the end of the third quarter. Our leverage exposure actually increased by CHF6 billion in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, including an increase in HQLA balances of CHF8 billion, mainly driven by increased funding and higher customer deposits in Wealth Management. But this was more than offset by the leverage reductions that we've instigated over the last 6 months, together, clearly, with the increase to capital from our organic capital generation.  Now as I'm sure you've seen from the strategy documents that we published this morning, we intend to operate at a CET1 ratio in excess of 14%, that's pre the Basel III reforms; and equity leverage ratio of around 4.5%, but we'll cover this in more detail during our strategy review later this morning.  Let me turn to expenses, please. Cost discipline remains a key area of focus for us. In the first 9 months of the year, costs were 3% lower at CHF12 billion on an adjusted basis, that's excluding significant items and Archegos. This primarily reflects lower compensation expenses. And during the period, continued to invest in a number of strategic initiatives, including hiring relationship managers and strengthening our risk and our control processes. For the year as a whole, we would currently estimate adjusted operating expenses to be between CHF6.2 billion and CHF16.5 billion.  Next slide, please. Now what we show here is that whilst our overall allowance for credit losses has fallen from CHF6.1 billion at the end of the second quarter to CHF5.9 billion at the end of the third, we have seen a small increase in our CECL-related provision totaling CHF20 million. This reflects a conservative view on potentially adverse economic developments, including uncertainty around the timing and the pace of the withdrawal of the various measures introduced by central banks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the related shocks of which are a consequence of the recovery.  Now let me turn now to the divisional overviews, where, unless I state otherwise, I'll refer to the adjusted numbers, that is excluding significant items and excluding Archegos. Before doing so, I'd like everyone to note please that the divisional return on regulatory capital calculation has been updated to align more closely with the targets for group capital and leverage ratios. We are now applying a definition for allocated capital based on 13.5% of RWA and 4.25% of leverage exposure. We've applied this consistently across all of the third quarter documents that you will see this morning, and this will also be the basis of the allocated metrics that we will see in the strategy review presentations later on.  Now let me start just as usual with the Swiss Universal Bank. The Swiss Universal Bank has continued its strong performance so far this year, delivering a record third quarter, driven by higher revenues, which increased by 5% year-on-year to CHF1.36 billion. We saw increases in all major revenue categories, and I'd highlight, in particular, the 11% year-on-year increase in recurring commissions and fees, supported by record assets under management as well as higher revenues from our investment in the Swisscard partnership.  Our provision for credit losses remains low with a net provision of CHF4 million for the quarter, whilst operating expenses were slightly lower year-on-year at CHF764 million. Our adjusted pretax income for the division, excluding significant items, was 24% higher year-on-year at CHF586 million, resulting in a return on regulatory capital of 15% compared to 12% in the third quarter of last year.  Now in terms of net new assets, although we did see approximately CHF400 million of net outflows in our Corporate & Institutional Clients business, this was more than offset by CHF1.9 billion of net inflows in our Private Clients business reversing the outflows that we saw in the second quarter.  Let me turn now to International Wealth Management, please. Net revenues were 3% lower year-on-year at CHF812 million. Whilst recurring commissions and fees grew by 13%, in line with the increase in client business volumes, our net interest income was affected by the impact of lower interest rates on deposits, albeit partly offset by the impact from higher loan volumes, which increased by 4% compared to the same quarter of last year. However, the less volatile market conditions in 2021 compared to last year meant that we also saw reduced client activity and, therefore, reduced transaction-based revenues, including those from GTS.  Now operating expenses were 5% higher year-on-year at CHF624 million with lower deferred and discretionary compensation expenses more than offset by our investment in IT infrastructure and digitalization along with increased costs related to our sustainability initiatives. Provision for credit losses was CHF12 million compared to CHF8 million in the same quarter of last year.  Adjusted pretax income for the division, excluding significant items, was CHF176 million, 25% lower year-on-year. However, IWM did see a reversal of the net outflows of the second quarter with positive net new assets totaling CHF1.4 billion, notwithstanding CHF1.5 billion relating to the supply chain finance funds matter this quarter.  Let me now turn to the Asia Pacific division. Asia Pacific revenues were broadly stable year-on-year at USD 795 million. Revenues from recurring commissions and fees were 90% higher, reflecting strong mandate and fund volumes with mandate penetration again improving to 15%. Our transaction-based revenues were 4% higher with higher fees from increased M&A activity, albeit offset by weaker client -- private client activity and lower GTS revenues.  However, offsetting these gains, our net interest income was 14% lower at USD 242 million, adversely impacted by 2 factors. First, as part of our ongoing and overall strategy and risk review, we have continued to derisk certain lending positions, and we have reduced certain exposures. Second, from the client side, there's no doubt that the turbulence in the Greater China market has caused some clients to reduce leverage in response to these adverse conditions.  Provisions for credit losses decreased significantly year-on-year. A total of USD 7 million was well below the USD 49 million that we took in the third quarter of last year and similar to the level we took in the second quarter.  Now we've talked before on a number of occasions about the investments that we're making in the Asia Pacific region, and I'd just like to make a couple of points. We now have 670 relationship managers in the region compared to 600 at the start of the year, and we've continued to make strategic investments, including in our China franchise. This is the primary reason for the 5% year-on-year increase in operating expenses, which stood at USD 582 million for the quarter.  Overall, our adjusted pretax income, excluding significant items, was 5% higher year-on-year at USD 206 million. As with SUB and with IWM, the asset outflows that we saw in the second quarter were reversed with net new assets totaling USD 3.2 billion in the quarter, notwithstanding the deleveraging that I mentioned before.  Let me turn now to the Investment Bank, please. Our Investment Bank delivered another robust performance despite continued constraints on capital usage with RWA 13% lower year-on-year at USD 78 billion, the strength of our client franchise and favorable conditions for our capital markets and advisory businesses enabled the investment bank to achieve revenues that were 9% higher than in the strong third quarter that we reported last year at USD 2.44 billion. And the main driver for this was increased client activity across our capital markets, M&A and equity derivative businesses.  The pipeline of new transaction in both ECM and advisory remains strong, which should enable us to sustain this momentum into the coming quarters.  As we've seen across the industry, fixed income revenues were lower. And whilst we've had continued outperformance in securitized products, this was offset by a reversion to more normal conditions in emerging markets, macro and global credit. If we look at equities. Whilst we saw a robust performance in both derivatives and in cash, the overall performance was adversely affected by the reduction in the size of prime services, which we commenced in the second quarter and which has continued in the third quarter.  Now as we said before, in addition to our strong adjusted pretax income, we also had a gain of USD 252 million relating to Archegos, $202 million of which was released from our provision for credit losses. As I already noted, this reflects an initial assessment of recoverability from receivables in the Archegos matter.  Operating expenses was 2% higher year-on-year at USD 1.84 billion, resulting -- meaning that our adjusted pretax income, excluding Archegos, was 25% higher at USD 582 million. On a reported basis, including the Archegos-related gain that I just mentioned, pretax income was 105% higher at USD 832 million.  So let me just conclude then with a few words on asset management. Overall, as you can see from this slide, we had a mixed performance in our Asset Management business in the quarter. First, as I've remarked already, we decided to impair our investment in York Capital by a further CHF113 million this quarter. Second, primarily due to a delay in new fund launches previously scheduled for the third quarter, we saw net outflows of CHF1.7 billion, primarily in respect to our index business.  However, against these negatives, if we look at the adjusted performance, excluding significant items, our revenues was higher across all 3 business lines and a well-managed approach to expenses, and that's notwithstanding additional costs in respect to the supply chain finance fund matter, means that on this basis, our pretax income improved to CHF115 million.  And with that, I'd like to conclude, and Thomas and I will now take your questions, although just to remind you, at this moment, this will just be in respect of our third quarter earnings. We're very happy to take questions on the strategy review later on this morning after the presentations. But thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '[Operator Instructions].

I think at this point, all I can really say is I think what you know already, which is that we have a Pillar 2 charge totaling USD 2 billion in respect of the Greensill supply chain finance funds matters, which was something that we agreed with FINMA during the first quarter, and that remains unchanged from now.  And in respect of the litigation provisions, which I've taken this morning, totaling CHF564 million, I would expect an increase in op risk RWA as it works its way through the system over the next couple of quarters of around CHF1 billion in terms of op risk increases.  I think in terms of other matters, just to anticipate the follow-on question, I don't have any more visibility at this point in terms of any other operational risk charges or moderated charges relating to the Archegos matter or, indeed, to the Greensill matter. So I can't update you on that basically, and nothing much I can really add. It's clearly a situation we're looking at very closely, but certainly the situation hasn't changed since I spoke at the end of the second quarter or indeed, for that matter, at the end of the first quarter.  Now I think Daniele, you asked a good question around the parent bank. And I just recognize that although this is in respect to the FINMA decree, which goes back to 2017, I think there have been a couple of good research notes written on this, including by yourself earlier this year. So let me just give you a few numbers.  So the group CET1 ratio, as you say, was 14.4%. The parent at the end of the third quarter was 13.4% on a transitional basis because I think you need to know that the decree from 2017 phases in over this decade up until 2028. And on a look-through basis, increased slightly to 10.7%. So just in terms of -- so those are the parent numbers.  Just in terms of capital requirements, the impairment looking forward because just to address the points which have been raised before, I think you know, we've said this morning, we're looking to maintain our CET1 ratio for the group in excess of 14% pre B3R in 2024. For the parent, I'm targeting a look-through ratio of around 12%, so that's the equivalent to that, which is slightly lower than the group number, really, for 2 reasons.  Firstly, the parent is clearly a subset of the group, and it reflects capital requirements that reflects the mix of activities actually in the parent, which are different from those in our subsidiaries, point one; and point two, which point -- I think you understand, which is the B3R impact, there is no B3R impact on the parent. In fact, B3R will actually slightly reduce the capital requirements of the parent because there's no FRTB impact actually on the parent. So the RWA for the parent actually goes down under B3R, whereas it goes up for the group as a whole. So that's why we set a stress-based target for the parent of 12%.  So you might ask a question. So you're at 10.7% now, how are you going to get to 12%? That requires retained capital between now and the end of 2027, beginning of '28 of about CHF6 billion. Just to put that in context, since '17, we have repatriated, with appropriate regulatory approval, CHF12 billion of capital, largely from the U.K. to Switzerland. In addition to that, we have received dividends, obviously, primarily from Credit Suisse Schweiz, but just recently from the U.S., totaling further CHF12 billion. So obviously, we obviously substantially improved the parent capital position since 2017 when the decree was enacted.  Looking forward, a couple of things just to be aware of. I think you're aware of this and it's been discussed before, but we've always, in the past, operated from 2 entities here in the U.K., Credit Suisse International and Credit Suisse Securities Limited, CSSL. CSSL is actually now decommissioned as a material legal entity, which means that there's about CHF8 billion of capital in there, a large proportion of which, again, subject to regulatory approval, we would seek to return to the parent in the near future. And then I think with regard to the United States, we actually passed the CCAR qualitatively, having passed it quantitatively as well, and that means we would be expecting to receive a dividend in excess of USD 2 billion from the U.S. subsidiary to the parent in the near future as well.  So I think you can see there's a number of measures in train to actually close that gap and essentially rebalance capital between the subsidiaries and the parent. So I hope that's helpful to that, and happy to take anything else on that point.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"So I will concentrate on the 3Q and 2 questions. One, still on net interest income within the International Wealth Management and another one on the advisory side of the Investment Bank. So on the NII, of course, we have seen it -- we've seen it coming down. You talked to us about the kind of impact on deposit income and, of course, kind of some offset on the lending side. But could you kind of give us maybe a little bit more steering on where to from here on a kind of quarterly basis? Because I have to say, I think that we've been kind of -- we've been looking out for a kind of more of a stabilization in that number kind of quarter-on-quarter. Should we assume that you're also attracting tremendous amounts of liquidity, i.e., additional deposits, that are kind of dragging that number down as well? So there's one -- question number one.  And question number two, within the investment bank because, of course, you beat consensus numbers quite nicely and, of course, particularly within the advisory and capital markets arena. And I have to say, over the last couple of quarters, we have seen quite a lot of people bleed in that business kind of for you. Should we kind of assume it turned the corner? Because, of course, your revenue performance was actually very decent within a relative context as well.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Okay.

I think just in terms of net interest income, I mean, I think, Magdalena, you can see that sequentially, it is stabilizing. It was CHF264 million in the third quarter of '21 compared CHF269 million in the second quarter.  I think I'd just make a couple of points. I think absent any other changes, I would actually expect net interest income to stabilize sequentially in the fourth quarter. But I would just caution, I think you're aware that we have launched a goodwill program with respect to the supply chain finance fund matters, and that may adversely impact the net interest income, although I don't think the impact would be particularly material in the fourth quarter. But I would expect to stabilize, subject to that particular caveat, would be my guidance on that.  Clearly, as we move forward to the GSR movers and the expansion of lending implied then that, obviously, we'd start to expect it to increase, but that probably goes forward then into '22.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"And with respect to the investment banking pipeline, I think we have a decent pipeline for the fourth quarter, both across M&A and capital markets.

And even though we are not talking now about strategy, but as you will have seen, we will move to a global investment bank organization, which will include also our Asian and Swiss IBCM teams who have very strong capital markets and M&A positions in their respective markets. Just as an example, today, we are a lead adviser in Switzerland of this relatively large health care situation.  So I think we have a very decent pipeline, but it's very clear we are focused on this business. It's a capital-light business. It's a business where we have traditionally had very strong positions, and we are focused on hiring.

So I'm very pleased with this pattern, but I have to say we are still not, I would say, 100% in terms of impact and growth ammunition. In particular, we still have had, for example, deleveraging going on in Asia, which was more market-driven compared to the second quarter, where it was more our initiative, where, now in the third quarter, this was more market-driven. And we still have, I would say, significant upside in terms of lending, whether it's structured lending in IWM, whether it's more traditional Lombard lending in Switzerland to further fuel NNA growth going forward.  So I think the 3% annualized is okay result, but it's definitely still -- there is room for upside to have a higher annualized growth rate in NNA terms.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee',\n","    'text': 'And is there a material impact from the new hires that you mentioned?

But the -- so there's some delay there, but we are very focused on net new hires. We have also had net new hires in Premium Clients Switzerland, for example.

And just to be clear, we have continued a strategic risk review as part of the strategy review process throughout the summer. That did lead to us derisk -- deleveraging further APAC positions during the quarter. So that's actually in that number. And what's more, as I think you've seen from some of our peers, the turbulence in the Greater China market has led to clients deleveraging. So I think to have both of those headwinds and still to be at 3.2, I think, speaks well to the franchise.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': \"Yes. The first question is regarding Investment Banking. Just to understand, considering that it looks like you're making a loss in the Investment Bank, I just wanted to see if you could remind me of how the deferral and accrual of bonus retention works in case you make a loss in the Investment Bank, i.e., are there clawbacks that come into force due to a potential loss having looked at the third quarter and your guidance for the fourth?  And then the second question is just coming back to the rebate discussion. Can you just confirm that you have, on the risk-weighted asset rebate discussion on the parent bank, a permanent structure that this rebate is in place? Or are there any clauses that would lead to some kind of unwinding of the rebate?  And in respect to the upstream numbers that you gave, which were very helpful, David, in terms of capital from the U.S., what is the determinating factor besides CCAR and qualitative test? Is there anything else that determines the U.S. allowing you to upstream? I think you mentioned CHF2 billion.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Okay. I will take the first one, and then David, you can take the second one. So Kian, in terms of the compensation, be it bonuses or be it potential clawbacks, that's ultimately a decision by the Compensation Committee and will be taken during the fourth quarter as we approach year-end. So clearly, that is premature. It's also important to say with respect to the clawback that we've obviously had a change last year where we had global markets join IBCM. So there is a technical way also to look at this from a previous year's clawback perspective.  So I would say it's premature to talk about that, but we are very focused on paying competitively through a combination of bonuses but also in -- with respect to retention programs.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"And I think the only point I'd add to that is just with regard to the goodwill write-down, which we've noted in our 3Q numbers. That definitely is excluded from any such calculation. You may recall we had a similar goodwill write-down, again, relating to DOJ back in 2015 as the precedent for that. But that's all I'd add to what Thomas has said.  I think your second question, well, I think you referred to as a rebate. I think you're returning to what's called the regulatory filter in the parent capital regime. I think that's a little bit misunderstood. It was a core part of the '17 decree. And what -- all it does basically is it converts Swiss GAAP accounting, which is on a cost less impairment basis, to a fair value basis for the subsidiary entities. So in other words, they're actually treated at the fair value of the position as opposed to cost less impairment.  And the practical for that essentially is it means that the Swiss Universal Bank or Credit Suisse Schweiz, to be more accurate, the legal entity, clearly is valued at a premium to book value because I think we all know that Credit Suisse Schweiz is worth more than book value, and I can see that in your sum-of-parts calculations. And that's really what the regulatory filter actually refers to. So that's what -- how it actually works. As to its status, it's a permanent part of the 2017 decree, basically. So that's what it stands for.  Oh, sorry, you asked a question around the U.S. To my understanding, I think we passed the CCAR test, both qualitatively and quantitatively. So the process from here is that the Board of Directors of CSH U.S.A., which is the intermediate holding company, has to meet shortly, actually, to review the dividend in light of the results for the year and to make -- and declare a dividend on the back of that. I'm not going to be drawing the exact number. I certainly know it, but I think in excess of CHF2 billion will do for today.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Your next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous Research.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Stefan Stalmann',\n","    'text': \"Yes. I wanted to quickly follow up on the decommissioning of Credit Suisse Europe, the plans to decommission the entity. Is that plan at all affected by the fact that the entity did plead guilty in regard to this Mozambique affair and regarding the fact that there's still a Group DTA associated with this whole complex? Or do you think this will go ahead without any impact from this?  And the second question, I wanted to clarify what you said about dividend. The press release says 25% of net income in 2022. Is that the distribution that you're planning to make in 2022 for '21? Or is it looking 1 year further out?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Stefan. Thank you very much. And I mean I just would echo what I said before. I said there have been 2 good research notes written on the parent, and yours was certainly excellent, Stefan. But just in terms of the decommissioning of CSSEL, so we have been working in London now for 6 years on the decommissioning of CSSEL because prior to that point, essentially, you had 2 entities in London, and CSSEL was actually the employer of the bulk of people, and CSI was the, as you might say, the operating entity. And I'm sure you understand from a resolution recovery point of view, that's basically a nonstarter. In addition to the complexity and intercompany capital regimes and fragmentation that results for having 2 such large entities.  So it has been a huge project because we actually had to move everybody out of one entity and into the other, including the pension fund, and actually build an entire securities infrastructure within CSI at the same time as doing Brexit. But I'm very pleased to say that we actually dropped below the key thresholds in terms of the percentage of balance sheet, percentage of RWA and importance of the operating systems. Actually, back in the first quarter of this year, we've continued to actually reduce the positions further because this is the key switch every year, and we no longer accept any new business in CSSEL from October. So it's definitely decommissioned as a material legal entity.  With regard to the Mozambique matter, the reason that Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited took the guilty plea because it was the employer of the 3 individuals who actually pled guilty in a U.S. court a couple of years ago, and that's why it took the guilty plea because that was clearly the precedent for this matter.  The deferred prosecution agreement actually relates to CSAG, not CSSEL. So whilst it's clearly very unfortunate, and we obviously very much regret the whole Mozambique exercise, it doesn't really pertain to the material legal entity status of CSSEL. So hopefully that's covered that point.  I think the -- I think -- thank you very much, Stefan. I think the second question, just in terms of dividend and payout guidance. I mean we're sort of crossing a bit on to the subject for later on this morning. But really, the Board's made 2 statements. Firstly, the dividend for 2021 payable following the approval by the AGM next April, that's a decision that the Board will calibrate once it actually has the full year 2021 results. The comment around the 25% of net income is a forward-looking statement relating to the Board's guidance for the expected percentage of net income that we paid out of 2022 in 2023, again, subject to the AGM or, at that point, basically, in the following year, Stefan.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'There are no more questions at this time.

Welcome, and thank you for joining Credit Suisse Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results Conference Call for Analysts and Investors. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Kinner Lakhani, Head of Investor Relations, and Group Strategy and Development. Please go ahead, Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, Annette. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures.  For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse fourth quarter 2021 earnings release published this morning. Let me remind you that our 2021 Annual Report and audited financial statements for the year will be published on or around March 10, 2022. I will now hand over to our Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Kinner. And thank you all for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results presentation. We greatly appreciate your participation and engagement.  Let me be upfront and begin with some comments about 2021 and more recent events. Despite a very supportive market environment and strong underlying performances in most of our businesses, especially during the first 9 months of 2021, last year was very challenging for Credit Suisse in the context of the supply chain finance funds and the Archegos matters.  The fourth quarter was difficult as well as we flagged in our trading update in January. David and I will walk you through all the numbers over the course of today's presentation.  Our results were significantly affected by goodwill impairment and litigation provisions. In addition, they were impacted by lower transaction-based revenues and reflected more normal trading conditions, client deleveraging and a significant reduction of our overall risk appetite in 2021.  More generally, we were a bank which just embarked on a new organizational structure and have become very inward focused, especially in December. This all negatively impacted our franchise momentum. At the same time, we took a number of decisive steps last year to position ourselves for sustainable growth. And let me please highlight the following.  Firstly, we strengthened our capital position and substantially reduced our risk positions. Secondly, we strengthened risk and compliance teams, systems and processes and underwent a comprehensive risk review across the entire group, which was completed in the fourth quarter; and thirdly, we strengthened our leadership in the investment bank, in asset management, in risk, in compliance, in technology and operations, in wealth management, as well as most recently in human resources. This will not be a quick fix, and we expect 2022 will be a transition year. But we have made clear progress in creating the conditions for a much more stable and predictable bank. All of this in line with our announcements on the 4th of November.  We have 3 key priorities for 2022. First, is to execute with discipline the detailed group strategy and 3-year financial plan, which we presented at our Investor Day on the 4th of November. The Board of Directors under Axel Lehmann's leadership along with the Executive Board under my leadership, fully see eye to eye when it comes to our shared commitment to the new strategy of strengthening the core, simplifying the organization and investing for growth.  Second, we will continue to improve risk and compliance with an emphasis on risk culture, while it's not losing our client focus and entrepreneurial spirit that has been the hallmark of Credit Suisse since its founding more than 165 years ago.  Third, we aim to reestablish franchise momentum grounded in the positive basis for growth in our 4 divisions with a strong regional overlay and supported by a disciplined approach to costs. Running our business with a strong balance sheet and with a diligent execution of our strategy is an absolute focus of my Executive Board.  Finally, the root of my confidence for our future lies with our employees. And I want to thank them again for their incredibly hard work and dedication during the last 12 months. I have no doubt that with the commitment of each employee, we will build a stronger bank for our clients, shareholders and other stakeholders.  With that, let me turn to the slides, starting with our key points on Page 4.  For the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a pretax loss of CHF1.6 billion. Adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was CHF0.3 billion. Our fourth quarter reported results were significantly impacted by the goodwill impairment in our investment bank relating to the acquisition of DLJ in 2000 and legacy litigation provisions. For the full year, we recorded a pretax loss of CHF0.5 billion, primarily driven by the Archegos loss, the goodwill impairment and the major litigation provisions, together totaling CHF7.6 billion. Adjusted pretax income excluding significant items and Archegos was CHF6.6 billion in 2021.  At the same time, we maintained our strong capital position with a CET1 ratio of 14.4% and a CET1 leverage ratio of 4.4%, both in line with our ambition to run the bank with a strong capital base going forward. The Board will propose a dividend of CHF0.10 per share for 2021, subject to AGM approval.  We have already made considerable progress implementing our strategy, which includes the creation of a unified Wealth Management division, a global Investment Bank and a centralized Chief Technology and Operations Organization.  We grew our Wealth Management recurring commissions and fees, supported by an increase in mandate penetration and in assets under management. We progressed our plans to make significant increases in Relationship Manager hiring, including a roughly 13% increase in APAC Relationship Managers in 2021.  As part of our ambition to generate CHF1 million to CHF1.5 billion in annual structural cost savings by 2024 to be invested for growth, we announced a third-party agreement to deliver procurement savings. The Investment Bank already released USD 2 billion of allocated capital versus the end of 2020. That marked significant progress towards our ambition to release more than USD 3 billion over 2021 and 2022. In other words, we have achieved already 2/3 of the investment bank capital release ambition. We significantly reduced prime chargeable balances by 66%. These measures underscore our commitment to implementing our strategy.  Next slide, please. Here, you see historical reported and adjusted data and the factors that weighed on both sets of results for the fourth quarter. As I already mentioned, and as David will go into more detail about later on.  Next slide, please. We are on Page 6. As mentioned before, 2021 was a very challenging year with our reported results impacted by Archegos, the DLJ goodwill impairment and litigation provisions. At the same time, our underlying performance demonstrated the strength of our franchises. We saw record underlying pretax income in the Swiss Universal Bank and in APAC, reflecting our strength in both our home market and a key growth engine for the global economy, namely APAC.  The investment bank posted record revenues across a number of key products, and there was a strong performance in asset management. This provides a great platform to continue executing on our strategy. Finally, the level of provisions for credit losses reflects the strong underlying quality of our lending book. In the supplement, you can see that our provision for credit losses excluding Archegos have remained well controlled.  Slide 7. I would like to turn to the supply chain finance fund matter. The Board-commissioned report has been completed and shared with FINMA. And as the recovery process is ongoing, there is no intention by the Board to publish the report. As of the end of 2021, we have recorded 72% of net asset value. And we are taking every possible measure to maximize recovery for investors, including pursuing borrowers and related parties.  We filed 5 insurance claims with corresponding CSAM exposure of approximately USD 1.2 billion as of the end of 2021. Let me now turn to the decisive steps we have taken to align risk with our strategy, please. Slide 8. Management and the Board of Directors spent a great deal of time and energy in 2021 strengthening our risk and compliance efforts, including in our first line of defense. We are committed to continuing this process under the guidance of our new Chief Risk Officer, David Wildermuth, and our Chief Compliance Officer, Rafael Lopez, as well as under the new leadership in Asset Management, the Investment Bank and Wealth Management. We are confident that the changes we are making across our risk and compliance functions will support our growth ambitions in the strategic plan. You can see the steps we have taken at the top of the slide as regards our leadership and governance, our risk appetite and our risk culture. Next slide, please. Here, you see the substantial risk reduction we achieved since the first quarter of 2021 at the group level as well as in Investment Bank and across our Wealth Management businesses. Our absolute and relative performance in 2021 should be seen in this context versus our peers. Over the course of 2022, we expect to complete the exit of substantially all of our prime services businesses and progressively deploy capital into Wealth Management and other core businesses in all of our 4 divisions.  Next page, please. This slide shows the steps we have taken quarter-by-quarter to strengthen our capital position both in terms of our CET1 ratio as well as our Tier 1 leverage ratio. It also shows that these steps have put us at the top in terms of Tier 1 leverage and in the top half of CET1 capital versus our global peers. Our balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to execute our strategy, which I will turn to in the coming slides.  Next page, please. We are diligently executing our 3-pillar strategy. We are strengthening our balance sheet and strengthening our business model by shifting capital to what we see as the most value-creating parts of our businesses. These aspirations include redeploying approximately CHF3 billion of capital into Wealth Management over the next 3 years. We are simplifying our organization by driving structural cost discipline. We are investing for growth in clients, businesses, talent and technology, including our ambition to progressively add approximately 500 Relationship Managers over the next 3 years as market conditions allow.  We have already made good progress toward that objective. This goes hand-in-hand with corresponding first and second line of defense investments. Underlying these pillars is strong risk management and a diverse and inclusive culture that builds on our entrepreneurial spirit.  Next page, please. As I said at the Investor Day, structure follows strategy. I firmly believe we have the right team in place to implement our strategy together. The structure of the Executive Board has changed significantly with 7 new members since the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, Christian Meissner and Ulrich Körner joined us to run the Investment Bank and the Asset Management divisions, respectively. Chief Compliance Officer, Rafael Lopez Lorenzo started in the fourth quarter. Our new Chief Technology and Operations Officer, Joanne Hannaford; our new Chief Risk Officer, David Wildermuth; and our new CEO, Wealth Management, Francesco De Ferrari, all started on the 1st of January. Finally, we welcome Christine Graeff as our new Head of Human Resources, who took over from Antoinette Poschung as per the 1st of February.  Slide 13, please. We are executing our 3-pillar strategy across our 4 divisions. Let me call out just a few of them. We have invested for growth in Wealth Management with more than CHF600 million in investments in digitalization, automation and Relationship Manager hires in 2021. We have simplified the Investment Bank through global integration. We have strengthened the Swiss Bank through stronger collaboration between the corporate bank and private and institutional businesses, generating CHF10 billion client referral volume in 2021. And in terms of next steps for Wealth Management, we aim to achieve disciplined lending growth. In the Investment Bank, we plan to build out our M&A advisory and capital markets businesses, including our Investment Banking advisory offering for entrepreneurs and family offices in Wealth Management. We are targeting to more than double CSX clients in 2022 in the Swiss Bank. We aim to enhance the Asset Management coverage model for Wealth Management and institutional clients, as well as third-party clients.  Next page, please. Sustainability is a priority of mine, and it is of the utmost importance to infuse it across our divisions and regions. We made significant progress executing our 5-pillar strategy in 2021. Looking forward, I'm delighted that Emma Crystal will become our Chief Sustainability Officer effective 1st of April, reporting directly to me. Emma brings extensive wealth management and sustainability expertise that will enable her to effectively partner with all of our divisions and regions as we deploy our sustainability product shelf and financing to clients.  On the right, you see the significant increase in sustainable assets under management that we achieved in 2021. We believe sustainability is a vital part of our value proposition and the right thing to do for our economies and societies.  Next slide, please. Achieving structural cost savings is central to our strategy as it will help fund our growth initiatives. On the left side of the slide, you can see the 4 main drivers of savings and then our step-by-step approach to reaching our ambition by 2024.  These include: Firstly, synergies from Unified Wealth Management and globally integrated Investment Bank divisions; secondly, procurement centralization and other centralizations; Thirdly, simplification of booking model and reduction of legal entities. And I would note that we have already seen a greater than 20% reduction in CS operating legal entities since 2018; and finally, improved automation and digitalization.  Next page, please. Our strategy pillars are being leveraged to progress our digital transformation to drive change, growth and user experience in a modern world. These include strengthening our cybersecurity infrastructure and simplifying our business platforms. We are investing in our digitally enabled client experience to sharpen our high-touch versus high-tech segments.  As you can see on the right of the slide, we are running a 50-50 split in terms of using our current technology spending to both run the bank and change it. Our experienced global staff gives us a mature presence in high-value locations.  Next page, please. Today, we are reaffirming the financial aspirations outlined at the Investor Day, and I have outlined our step-by-step approach to delivering them. We aim to release more than $3 billion of Investment Bank capital over 2021 to 2022 and have already achieved 2/3 of that and to make targeted investments in the Investment Bank from 2023 onwards.  We plan to invest approximately CHF3 billion of capital into Wealth Management by 2024. And increase capital allocated into Wealth Management, the Swiss Bank and Asset Management divisions to 2x the Investment Bank allocated capital in 2022 and beyond.  We have clear return on regulatory capital aspirations for each division. We expect our strategy to drive growth and to improve our cost-to-income ratio by 2024 to around 70% while maintaining a strong balance sheet to support growth. Our ambition is to achieve a reported group return on tangible equity of greater than 10% by 2024. These aspirations are grounded in the continued implementation of our transformative agenda, building on a culture that drives accountability, diversity and excellence.  The successful execution of our strategy and achievements of the aspirations I have set out should deliver improving returns and value to our shareholders while rebuilding a bank that we can all be proud of and with a strong risk culture and a strong balance sheet.  I would like to hand over now to David, who will go over the results in greater detail. I look forward to your questions later on. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Thomas, and good morning to everybody. So just as usual, I'd like to go through the key financials and then give some more details on our performance at a divisional level.  First, I'd just like to remind you that the fourth quarter of 2021 is the last time that we'll be reporting under our old divisional structure. As you know, we implemented the new organizational structure with effect from the 1st of January of this year. And I've just included on the slide here a quick reminder what these changes look like, together with the key dates over the coming months.  Now just in particular, I think you should note that we'll be publishing the restated numbers for our historic time series on the morning of April 7, so a couple of months' time.  Now let's just go to a summary, please, of the group results. Now I think you saw our trading update, which we put out on January 25, and that highlighted a number of key themes. Firstly, clearly, the impairment of the goodwill, primarily in respect of the DLJ acquisition back in 2000, totaling approximately CHF1.6 billion that I mentioned last November.  Second, the increase in litigation provisions that we expected for the quarter, which have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the group has more proactively pursued settlements. And just to be clear, that increase primarily relates to legacy matters from our Investment Banking business. And then therefore, we booked either in the Investment Banking division or to the extent they're handled by the SRU and now the ARU in the corporate center.  Third, I think I mentioned on the 25th that we disclosed the benefit that we've taken in the quarter from real estate gains. And you may recall that -- so that was part of the strategy that we announced in response to the Archegos matter back in the second quarter of last year. And I'll cover these points in more detail as we go through the presentation.  Now just turning through the key reported numbers. Revenues for the quarter was CHF4.58 billion, that's 12% lower year-on-year. And that was primarily driven by a fall in revenues in the Investment Bank, which were 31% lower year-on-year at USD 1.6 billion. Our Wealth Management-related revenues were 2% higher at CHF3.2 billion, and that was driven by the strong performance of the Swiss Universal Bank.  Total operating expenses were 20% higher year-on-year at CHF6.19 billion the quarter. But you should remember that this is primarily due to the goodwill impairment of CHF1.6 billion. Goodwill impairments actually flow through the expense line, obviously, together with the litigation provisions.  Now overall for the quarter, we reported a pretax loss of CHF1.59 billion. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the goodwill impairment, litigation provisions and other significant items, we earned a pretax income of CHF328 million.  Now the income tax expense totaled CHF416 million in the quarter, and that continues to be adversely affected by the consequence of the Archegos loss and in the fourth quarter by other items and that's particularly the goodwill impairment for which no tax deduction is available when you actually write it off. Now for reference, that equates to a full year tax rate of about 196%. Although if you strip out Archegos and the goodwill impairment, you can calculate that normalizes at about 28%.  And looking forward to 2022, we'd expect an effective tax rate to be in the low 30s for the year. So let me just give some more detail regarding our adjusted and our reported numbers, both for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Now as I've indicated before, there are a number of items that have had an impact both credit and debit. And I've broken this out on the slide. Now just freeze, from this point on, just assume that when I refer to adjusted numbers, I mean adjusted excluding significant items at Archegos.  So if we start from the left. The fourth quarter reported loss was CHF1.59 billion. And that reconciles, as you can see moving to the right, to the pretax number on an adjusted basis of CHF328 million. At the bottom, you can see the full year numbers. So they correspond to CHF522 million pretax loss and adjusted pretax income of CHF6.6 billion.  So let's just go through these points in a bit more detail. So first of all, as I've already mentioned, we saw gains from real estate sales. And those were completed predominantly in Switzerland in the fourth quarter. Those gains were part of the capital steps that we announced in the second quarter of last year and we booked CHF224 million of gains in the fourth quarter with a total gain of CHF232 million for the year. And you can see we also booked a CHF31 million gain in the quarter on our 8.6% interest in Allfunds with a total gain for the year of CHF602 million.  We then saw smaller items totaling CHF57 million of losses in the fourth quarter and CHF212 million in the year as a whole. Now just most notably, I'm sure you remember that in the third quarter, that included the write-down on our investment in New York of a further CHF113 million, and there've been no moves on that since then.  There was no material move in our Archegos position in the fourth quarter. But clearly, the full year results are marred by the total loss relating to this matter of about CHF4.8 billion.  Now if we move to the right, we had restructuring charges of CHF33 million in the quarter, and CHF103 million in the year. And I just want to reiterate the guidance that we gave at the Investor Day that we'd expect a total cost of around CHF400 million in restructuring from the beginning of this program to the end -- at the end of 2022.  Clearly, though, those costs will only actually flow through as we actually complete our exit from the bulk of the prime services businesses and complete the other organization measures.  Now in terms of major litigation costs then. We took provisions of CHF436 million in the quarter and a total of CHF1.16 billion for the year. As I've said already, in the fourth quarter, these were predominantly against a number of legacy cases relating to the Investment Banking businesses and were booked either in the Investment Bank P&L, or for cases which were handled by the Strategic Resolution Unit, now the Asset Resolution Unit in the Corporate Center.  The residual investment bank-related goodwill of CHF1.6 billion mainly resulting from the DOJ acquisition in 2000 completes the write-off of all the residual goodwill relating to the acquired investment bank assets of DOJ and has been booked in the Investment Bank and APAC divisions.  Let's turn to capital ratios, please. Our CET1 ratio for the fourth quarter stood at 14.4%, and that's stable compared to third quarter but clearly is substantially ahead of the ratio of 12.9% that we reported at the end of 2020. The CET1 leverage ratio was 10 basis points higher quarter-on-quarter at 4.4% and due to lower leverage exposure, primarily from the reductions in prime services as headline CET1 leverage ratio is unchanged year-on-year. But you should remember that this is a function of the temporary COVID measures that FINRA introduced back in 2000, which excluded deposits held at the Central Bank from the leverage exposure calculation during the course of 2020. So if you exclude that temporary measure, the like-for-like improvement in the CET1 leverage ratio was from 3.9% to 4.4% at the end of 2021.  Our risk-weighted assets were CHF10 billion lower than at the end of the previous quarter at CHF268 billion, whilst leverage exposure was CHF48 billion lower, CHF875 billion. Lower risk appetite across the Investment Bank in '21, together with the Prime Services exit, has led to RWA and leverage exposure reductions of CHF1 billion and CHF18 billion, respectively, quarter-on-quarter.  And the reduced risk appetite and the deleveraging by clients I mentioned already led to corresponding falls of CHF5 billion in RWAs and CHF7 billion in leverage exposure across our Wealth Management businesses.  Now as we said already, in terms of our ambition to achieve at least USD 3 billion reduction in the capital allocated to the investment by the bank by the end of this year compared to 2020, that the actions that we already concluded means that we've achieved USD 2 billion of that total compared to the starting point at the end of 2020.  I'd remind you that our medium-term ambition remains to operate the CET1 ratio in excess of 14% pre the impact of the Basel III reforms and a CET1 leverage ratio of about 4.5% in the future.  Now I just wanted to make a brief point here about the Swiss CET1 capital ratio for Credit Suisse AG, the parent bank, which we discussed in some detail at the Investor Day back in November. As you know, our aspiration for the parent is a ratio of 12%. But at the end of 2021, it dipped to 11.7%. And with the phase-in of the transitional regime, to 11.4% as of January 1, 2022. And as we detailed in the earnings release, this is primarily due to FINRA imposing restrictions on the value of our subsidiaries for capital purposes.  Given that the group has an overall ratio of 14.4%, this is about the distribution of capital around the group and not the overall capital level. And as I said back in November, substantial capital repatriations and dividends are due from our U.K., U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries over the course of the next 12 months, which should rebalance this. As a consequence, I'd expect the Swiss CET1 ratio of the parent to increase to above our ratio -- our target of 12% by the year-end.  Next slide, please. Now as I've already mentioned, client deleveraging and challenging markets in some of the regions in which we operate, particularly in Asia, together with reductions in our own risk appetite resulted in a mixed performance for our Wealth Management businesses in the fourth quarter. However, we've continued to make progress in growing assets under management and increasing our mandate volumes.  If we look at the year as a whole, AUM grew by 7% to CHF1.6 trillion with net new asset contributions from our Institutional and Wealth Management businesses of CHF20 billion and CHF11 billion, respectively. We saw year-end mandate volumes of CHF241 billion, 9% higher than the end of 2020, whilst mandate penetration stood at 31% at the end of '21 compared to 29% a year earlier. And that puts us on track to achieve our medium-term ambition to have a range between 33% and 35%.  Let me touch on costs in the next few slides. So what I'll give here is a bit more detail about the operating expenses. Our reported total for group operating expenses for the full year was CHF19 billion, and that compares to CHF17.8 billion for 2020. This increase was adversely impacted by the goodwill impairment of CHF1.6 billion, which flows through our expense line, but clearly does not relate to ongoing operating expenses. The costs are also inflated by the increase in major litigation provisions that we took in the year.  Now on an adjusted basis, therefore, costs decreased from CHF16.6 billion to CHF16.0 billion, a decline of 4% year-on-year. But I would remind you that the variable compensation costs are lower given that the events of last year required us to make changes to both the amount and the type of compensation that was awarded.  So let's turn to that in more detail, please. Now we will give clearly a full summary in the compensation report that we published as part of our annual report on March 10. But there are a few details that I thought it would be useful to cover now.  The challenges that the firm faced in 2021 required us to balance 3 factors. First, we need to recognize the losses that our shareholders had suffered from Archegos, the goodwill impairment, the major litigation provisions and the other costs incurred over the course of '21. Second, and against that, we needed to reflect the competitive compensation environment and the strong underlying performance that was delivered by many of our businesses, notwithstanding other problems in '21. And third, clearly, the need to retain and motivate key franchises and personnel as we execute on the strategic plan over '22 to '24.  So the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, therefore, decided to reduce the variable compensation pool to CHF2 billion compared to CHF2.9 billion in 2020. And that equates to a reduction of 32%. Furthermore, for most Managing Directors and Directors, we also changed the composition of the awards with a higher proportion of cash being paid subject to clawback and a lower proportion in terms of share awards.  Just the point I made above though, we remain very focused on ensuring that there is clear alignment with the strategic plan. And therefore, we've awarded a further instrument to most of our Managing Directors and Directors with a par value of just under CHF500 million. That includes an upside clause aligned to the achievement of our strategic objectives and a downside clause as certain ambitions and targets are not met.  Now one consequence of this mix of deferred awards for our expense recognition has been the reduction of compensation costs for '21. And therefore, a subsequent increase in deferral costs for future years. So just provide some guidance here. I'd expect to see an increase of around CHF1 billion in 2022. That compares to the guidance we gave at the Investor Day of an increase of about CHF500 million. That reflects the combination of the amortization of the increased deferred compensation costs I've just summarized, plus an assumption of a more normal accrual of cash awards in 2022. And although clearly, the size of that increase will depend on the total bonus pool for the current year.  So let's just bring this altogether and give you an idea of where we do expect costs will look like for '22. So you'll probably recall some of these numbers from the Investor Day. But if we move from left to right, we start with the 2021 adjusted expenses, which stood at CHF16 billion. In '22, we expect to see the savings resulting from business exits totaling about CHF400 million and about another CHF300 million from the structural cost saving measures that we're pushing through. However, the approximately CHF1 billion increase in compensation costs that I've just outlined, together, our investment plans of an additional CHF700 million means that overall I would expect our adjusted operating expenses to be at the top of the range of CHF16.5 billion to CHF17 billion that we gave last November and probably around CHF17 billion, but clearly subject to the caveats I've given already.  Just to be clear, though, we are not changing our guidance for costs for '23 and '24. I'd reiterate that we would expect that to remain in the range of CHF16.5 billion to CHF17 billion once we're through this transitional year.  Let me turn now to the divisional summaries, and let's start with the Swiss Universal Bank. The Swiss Universal Bank concluded a strong performance through the year, with adjusted net revenues for the quarter -- fourth quarter of CHF1.31 billion, 6% higher year-on-year. Our businesses delivered increases in all major revenue categories, in particular, recurring commissions and fees. We also saw a good performance from our Investment Banking operations in Switzerland.  Adjusted operating expenses were 3% lower year-on-year at CHF770 million, resulting in an adjusted pretax income of CHF546 million, and that's 41% higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. Our reported pretax income was 47% higher year-on-year at CHF716 million.  Now as we've seen before in the fourth quarter, and this is -- this often happens, there were outflows in our Private Client business totaling CHF1.8 billion. But I'd remind you for the year, we saw total net new assets in private clients of CHF1.4 billion positive. Overall, the Swiss Universal Bank reported a record adjusted pretax income for the full year of CHF2.4 billion, 25% higher year-on-year as provisions for credit losses fell from CHF270 million to CHF6 million.  Let me now turn to International Wealth Management. Adjusted net revenues for the quarter were CHF695 million, 19% lower year-on-year. Whilst we saw some stabilization of net interest income on a sequential basis, it's clearly lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the cumulative interest rate moves over the period.  Our recurring commissions and fees were 7% lower year-on-year at CHF277 million, with higher mandate revenues and a stable margin, offset by lower fees from lending activities. At CHF156 million, our transaction-based fees were 40% lower than last year, reflecting, amongst other factors: First, a mark-to-market loss on an investment in Brazil of CHF19 million compared to a gain on the same investment of CHF31 million in the same quarter last year; second, the reversion of trading activity to more normal levels; and clearly, third, our own risk reduction in 2021. We should also note reduction in GTS revenues compared to a year ago.  But one final point, which is worth mentioning. that is the impact of the fee waiver program. This was established in the fourth quarter as a goodwill measure for clients impacted by the supply chain finance matter and entails the reimbursement on a quarterly basis of certain commissions and fees arising from current and future business transactions. The negative impact on revenue from this goodwill program across the Wealth Management businesses was CHF28 million in the fourth quarter, and the majority of this was incurred in IWM.  Operating expenses in IWM was 7% higher at CHF671 million as we continue to make investments in IWM infrastructure as well as a number of risk and sustainability plans. I think it's clear that a strong aspect of IWM's performance in the fourth quarter was client inflows. We saw net new assets totaling CHF2.7 billion in the quarter, which took the total for the year to CHF11 billion and that's notwithstanding the adverse impact of the supply chain finance matter throughout much of 2021. But it is clear though the overall financial performance for the fourth quarter was unsatisfactory. A combination of the reduction in revenues, particularly transactional revenues, plus the increase in costs, reduced adjusted pretax income to CHF25 million in the quarter.  Now if you look at the performance for the whole year, a 1% reduction in adjusted costs and a significant decline in provisions was not enough to offset the 10% decline in net revenues and our adjusted pretax income was CHF770 million, 23% lower than in 2020.  Let's turn to APAC. So the region has been adversely impacted by the weakening of market conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter, but in the second half to a degree as a whole. And that was evidenced both by the significant client deleveraging that we've seen in Asia and by a reduction in activity.  In the case of the client deleveraging, the 11% reduction in loans year-on-year reflected the change in market environment as well as the reduction in our own risk appetite towards a number of customers.  In the case of lower client activity, declining net interest income of 13% and in transaction-based revenues of 33% reflects the weaker environment and a softer GTS performance compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Although recurring commissions and fees for the quarter improved by 19% to USD 118 million year-on-year, driven by higher mandate and fee revenues, our adjusted net revenues were 20% lower year-on-year at USD 661 million.  Slightly lower operating expenses of USD 581 million for the quarter meant that the division delivered an adjusted pretax income of USD 94 million. Now if we include APAC's USD 113 million share of the goodwill charge relating to DOJ, that results in a reported pretax loss for the quarter of USD 9 million.  Now for the full year, the more resilient market environment earlier in the year meant that notwithstanding higher costs related to the Relationship Manager hiring and the investments that we've made in China, the division reported an adjusted pretax income of $1.01 billion for the year, and that's an increase of 22% compared to 2020.  Right, next slide, please. After the strong trading environment that prevailed for most of 2021, we saw a weak close to the year in our Investment Bank with net revenues of USD 1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to USD 2.3 billion in the very strong final quarter of 2020. We saw weakness in fixed income sales and trading, which was primarily credit-related. And reduction in equity revenues, which primarily results to our decision to exit the majority of our prime service businesses.  Now furthermore, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 when our equity capital market franchise was buoyed by very heavy levels of SPAC activity, this new issuance has clearly been lower in recent months. And on a more positive note, we saw a strong performance in equity derivatives in our macro businesses and continued momentum in our advisory operations, which were increased market share resulted in a 51% year-on-year increase in revenues to USD 300 million for the quarter.  However, overall, the weaker revenue performance resulted in adjusted pretax loss of USD 233 million for the quarter, and that's notwithstanding a 5% drop in operating expenses which was primarily due to the compensation points that I made earlier in this presentation.  Overall, our underlying performance of the year was much stronger with adjusted net revenues 5% higher compared to 2020 and 25% higher compared to 2019. Our adjusted pretax income was 2/3 higher than in 2020 at USD 3.15 billion, and that's notwithstanding a 15% reduction in allocated capital. However, just to be clear, given the losses relating to Archegos and the DOJ goodwill impairment, that meant this translated into a reported loss for the year of USD 3.92 billion.  Let's turn now to Asset Management. Now adjusted net revenues for the division were broadly flat at CHF387 million compared to CHF392 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. A 9% improvement in management fees, reflecting higher assets under management and higher investment and partnership income was offset by a 36% decline in performance and placement revenues and that clearly compares to a comparatively strong fourth quarter close to 2020.  We saw an increase in adjusted operating expenses of 10% quarter -- for the quarter year-on-year at CHF310 million, and that reflected both higher variable compensation costs in the quarter and expenses relating to the supply chain finance funds. We saw positive net new asset inflows for the quarter of CHF4.7 billion, driven by flows into our index solutions funds and into our emerging markets joint venture, which was partly offset by outflows from some of our fixed income funds.  Overall, the adjusted pretax income for the quarter was CHF79 million, and that's 31% lower year-on-year. Clearly, if you look at the performance for the full year, 21% revenue growth with good momentum across all the business lines meant that the division delivered an adjusted pretax income of CHF417 million, and that clearly compares to an undoubtedly weak performance of CHF192 million in 2020.  Net new assets for the year was CHF14.6 billion, and that increased the assets under management for AM division from CHF440 billion to CHF477 billion.  So let me just close then with just a few words, please, on the outlook for the current year. Clearly, as we've said already, 2022 will be a transitional year for Credit Suisse as the benefits of the strategic capital allocation towards our Wealth Management businesses and the structural cost saving measures that we discussed already will only really materialize from 2023 onwards. And I'd caution that I think we are seeing the end of the extremely favorable business environment that we've seen, particularly from transactions over the last couple of years, which has been driven by the substantial measures that central banks and governments have taken to sustain economies during the pandemic. We're clearly now seeing the start of the tightening of the interest rate environment, which has already begun in the United States and in the U.K. and certain other markets and we expect to be followed by the ECB later this year or in early 2023. I think this will mean a shift to a more normal trading environment that we've seen over the last couple of years, and we would expect this to be reflected in our results for the first quarter. And adjusted results for the first quarter, that is excluding the Archegos loss last year, are likely weaker than the first quarter of 2021, which arguably saw the peak benefit from the various monetary and fiscal incentives.  I think it's worth remembering, though, that whilst this will be a very different market, it will be one in which our clients do remain in need of good advice and products as they navigate a challenging landscape with the expectation of much higher levels of inflation and interest rates than we've seen for the last decade or so.  I think after a difficult close to 2021, we do expect though to see renewed franchise momentum as the new divisional structure takes shape. And as we've said in our outlook statement in the release, we have seen positive net new asset inflows year-to-date in our Wealth Management business. Nonetheless, I think it's clear, results this year will be adversely reflected by compensation normalization, by restructuring expenses and of course, by the decline in equity revenues following our decision to exit the majority of our prime business.  Now just one point, just to conclude. Whilst this isn't relevant to our underlying performance, I'd also note that we continue to hold an 8.6% stake in Allfunds, the value of which has fallen by about CHF204 million in the market sell off so far this year. Now clearly, Allfunds has been an extremely successful investment for Credit Suisse over the last 3 years. But now it's a quoted listed company that will contribute to a continuing degree of P&L volatility going forward.  And with that, I'd like to just to hand back to Thomas before we move to Q&A.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, David. Let me conclude with a few comments. The Board of Directors and the Executive Board are fully committed to the group strategy we outlined in November 2021 with 2022 being a transition year. We reaffirm our financial aspirations, including for group reported return on tangible equity of greater than 10% by 2024. And we are now fully focused on executing on this strategic plan.  We have achieved significant progress on the risk and compliance as we have outlined earlier today by recognizing that there is more to do. And finally, although we experienced a slowdown across our business in the fourth quarter, we are confident that we are regaining client and revenue momentum in the first quarter and have seen encouraging signs so far.  Thank you very much. And with this, I would like to open the Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: I've got two questions and they're both on wealth as the kind of driver of the group going forward. So my first question is about business growth and how you see it further out than the first quarter of this year. And if you could give us a sense of your expected trajectory of kind of net new assets and of course, also lending given how much capital becomes available to that division over time.  And really, when you look at the transactional side of things, I know we're coming off of the 2 strong years. Where do you think that normalizes?  And my last one, really on wealth is on net interest income. Because effectively, we have -- we are seeing a tremendous shift in interest rate expectations, U.S., Eurozone as well. Could you give us a sense of the sensitivity that you're likely to see, particularly within the wealth business to the moves in rates in '22 and maybe further out?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you. Maybe I will kick it off, and then David will add a few points, especially on the net interest income.  So for the 2022 period, as we also outlined at the Investor Day, the key drivers for growth will be in terms of transactional revenues -- sorry, in terms of recurring revenues, AUM growth, M&A growth which will be driven by a combination of organic NNA growth that we expect to normalize again and be stronger than in 2021. And also driven by more lending growth, which will both help our NNA growth as well as our net interest.  And in addition to that, our Relationship Manager hiring intentions across the regions.  And as far as transactional revenues are concerned, I would say that the slowdown we saw, especially in the second half this year was somewhat unusual, and we would expect some more normalized levels of transactional revenues in 2022. In addition to that, we are committed to further increasing our level in terms of private equity and alternative investments, as well as other initiatives around mandate penetration which should also help our recurring revenues.  These are some of the elements that we discussed in detail at the Investor Day in November. But maybe, David, you want to add a few things on the net interest income side?\\nDavid Mathers: Thanks very much, Thomas. Look, I think there's no doubt that the moves that we've seen already in U.S. interest rates and we expect to continue to see during the course of 2022 will be favorable to our dollar net interest income.  I mean, I think to give some numbers, if we look at the forward rate curve now, we probably expect to see about a $50 million gain in U.S. dollar net interest income in '22. And that rises to more like about $175 million in '23. So I think that gives some degree of the sensitivity due to U.S. dollars.  I think I should balance that, though, by -- Magdalena, I think you're fully aware of this, but the major Swiss banks are all subject to the exemption threshold that the Swiss National Bank operates, which I believe is broadly similar in concept to that, that the ECB operates as well. So at some point, I mean, I think it seems unlikely that the ECB is going to be at the front of this queue. I guess we're talking late this year, maybe in '23, we would expect Swiss francs -- Swiss rates to then follow that. So at that point, you'd expect to see some diminution in Swiss franc net interest income as we go back towards 0 interest rates in Swiss franc, which is obviously going to take some time. So that will clearly partly offset the U.S. dollar moves.  So U.S. dollar favorable. Clearly, we need to watch closely when the move in Swiss rates. And you understand perfectly well how the exemption thresholds work in Switzerland and in Europe, although it's slightly bigger, I think, there's a multiplier for Swiss banks, than it is for Eurozone banks.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: David, can I just go back to the lending growth because, of course, we've got -- we had kind of 2 things here. One, quite a significant shift of capital over medium term to wealth. And two, of course, '21 being also that kind of transition year where you've seen quite a lot of deleveraging. Where is that kind of -- where do you see that loan demand kind of returning within your risk appetite?\\nThomas Gottstein: I think it's really across all lending activities within Wealth Management. So starting with mortgages in Switzerland, lombard -- traditional lombard lending, single stock structured lending and some of the real asset lending. So it's broad based in terms of the type of lending instruments. And geographically, it's also well balanced. I think that especially Middle East and in some parts of Asia, we still continue to see a big potential for a pickup in lending growth as well as in certain areas in Europe.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from BNB Paribas Exane.\\nJeremy Sigee: A couple of questions on costs, please, and the change in the guidance. So firstly, are there any unexpected elements in the deferred comp cost increasing? And if so, just could you talk us through what those unexpected bits are?  And then the second question is, does this changing dynamic have any impact on your investment plans either in '22 or '23 or '24 as you try to manage to the existing cost target?\\nDavid Mathers: Well, I think that's a very good question, Jeremy. And I wanted to be very open around the comp plan. I think historically we said wait until the comp pool comes out in a month's time. And we thought it would be more useful given the complexity this year to actually give the slides.  So just to recap, I think you can -- saw that we did have a very difficult balance to actually walk in terms of the compensation pool, particularly given the losses that our shareholders suffered in respect of the issues last year. So that was behind the decision to reduce the variable compensation pool by 32% to CHF2 billion.  But I think there's 2 factors then to keep in mind. Firstly, and this was something that we agreed on and also discussed with our regulators, we did pay those instruments with a number of deferred cash instruments, as I think has been widely reported. And secondly, I think as part of the implementation of the strategic plan from '22 to '24, we did also provide our Managing Directors and Directors with this strategic delivery award totaling just under CHF500 million, which is a cliff vesting instrument. That cliff vesting instrument, as you know, Jeremy, doesn't mean that the cost comes in '24. It's actually time weighted under U.S. GAAP. And we'd expect probably just under around 50% of that to actually flow through in '22. So that's half of the increase.  The other half of the increase reflects a decision which we've made to actually move to lower levels of deferral in 2023 than the past. So that's basically the driver of that increase in our guidance from CHF500 million to CHF1 billion in terms of the normalization of the compensation program.  Absent that, there's nothing else that you should be focused on. We obviously are very pleased to have now signed the procurement outsourcing transaction with Chain IQ. There's a number of other strategic cost measures we're actually pushing through, which I discussed in more detail back in November, so we're pushing hard on that. And certainly, driving efficiency from the new structure is a core focus for the Executive Board of Credit Suisse. And I think we would look to outperform against what we said before.  But I think in the context of the compensation moves, I wanted to be very explicit that essentially, I think we will be at the top end of our guidance for 2022. But also, as I said before, that I'm not changing our guidance for '23 and '24.  I think on investment spending, I mean, I think, look, I think we're very committed to our core expansion plans in Wealth and for that matter, in the Investment Bank, too. But honestly, as you move forward over time, some things become more attractive and some things become less attractive.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous Research.\\nStefan Stalmann: They actually center around the situation at the bank, the solvency situation. Last time, I think you mentioned that you would need to generate about CHF6 billion of capital through 2027 -- end of 2027 given the current risk-weighted asset increases baked into the situation at the bank.  Given what has happened in the fourth quarter with the impairment and the change to the regulatory treatment of participation values, where would you say the CHF6 billion number roughly stands now, please?  And the second question related to this is -- have there been already material repatriations of capital or special dividends out of the subsidiaries of the bank into the bank in the fourth quarter? Or is that all still coming? And if it's still coming, it seems that something is holding up the process. I thought you were expecting substantial repatriations already in 2021. Could you maybe add a little bit of color around that, please?\\nDavid Mathers: Look, I think we obviously discussed this in some detail back in November. And I think in light of that, we obviously wanted to just give an update on where we stood at this particular point.  To your specific question, the CHF6 billion increase I said before, which is the gap to achieve a 12% target ratio with the full phase-in of the step-up in RWA weightings by '28, is that CHF6 billion number, it's about CHF9 billion at this point for 2028, assuming no change in the valuation of the subsidiaries. I mean, I think, Stefan, a sort of unspoken question, which I'll answer anyway really is why did we see this rate reduction in the valuation of the subsidiaries, which we also touched on in the earnings release, you'll see in there as well, is that was a reduction in the regulatory filter that FINMA imposed, really following a review of the value subsidiaries post Archegos and clearly also post the strategic review. So it was applied at the end of December, basically, and that's what led to this reduction in the parent ratio to 11.7% at the end of December. And as I said, 11.4%, including the phase-in from the 1st of January. So that's the context. And in terms of that look through to '28, that would mean the GAAP increases from CHF6 billion to CHF9 billion.  Now in terms of the timing of capital repatriations dividends, that there's been no change is the answer. I mean, we expected to receive a significant dividend from CSH USA at the end of last year in December, and we actually received that dividend. But that was in the plan, which I discussed on the 4th of November. We are expecting to see some very substantial numbers in 2022, which was part of the planning.  Just in order, most notably, we have completed the decommissioning of Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited, which is the sister entity of CSI. That is now a nonmaterial legal entity. So -- and it has significant trapped capital in it. So that's obviously quite a complex program to go through as we actually do that. And that's something we'll obviously be in discussion with the U.K. regulators about during the course of this year.  Secondly, of course, we will expect to see further dividend from the U.S. I'm not going to comment, but it's probably somewhat material in terms of these numbers.  And then finally, we will receive, I won't expect, the normal dividend from Credit Suisse Schweiz, and then there's obviously other smaller numbers as well in the total of that.  I think in timing of that, basically, obviously, the Credit Suisse Schweiz dividend would come in first. And we would expect the U.S. dividend to come in towards later in the year and the restructuring of CECL, which I've talked about before, clearly would be subject to regulatory approval later on this year. So come way, I guess, somewhere during the year, but I'm not going to give an exact date.  But those plans are all the same as they were before, Stefan. I think the change for the 4th of November was that point I made before about the FINMA's decision to reduce the value of the regulatory filter as a consequence of the numbers of last year.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.\\nAndrew Coombs: If I could ask one follow-up to David and then one broader question to Thomas. First on the follow-up to David, turning back to Jeremy's question, I think you said that of the CHF500 million increase in compensation in 2022, about half is due to the amortization structure on that CHF497 million one-off award.  Two parts. First is, can you just reiterate what the second half of the increase in compensation relates to? And with regard to that one-off award, how does the amortization structure then play out over 2023 and 2024 as well, please?  My broader question to Thomas would be on Slide 34, where you talk about 2 real aims accelerating the revenue momentum and strengthening the risk culture. Do you think those 2 things go hand in hand? And the reason I ask is usually we hear from companies saying, we're going to take on a bit more risk to accelerate our revenue momentum or alternatively taking down risk levels, but perhaps moving to a higher payout ratio or something along those lines. The 2 things that you are flagging sound almost slightly contradictory. So interested in your broad thoughts on how you can achieve both at the same time.\\nDavid Mathers: First, your first question. I think in terms of the deferral impact. The strategic delivery award is a 3-year cliff-vested instrument. So in other words, the Compensation Committee will assess the progress that's been made during the course of '22, '23 and '24 in terms of the achievement of the strategic goals, which does include the achievement of the risk and compliance goals. And we'll then decide what the uplift in the value is. There are certain knockout clauses as well in terms of that instrument. So that's the instrument.  In terms of the deferral treatment, as it's a 3-year cliff vest, cliff vest absent early retirement clauses, I'll come back to that, vest once -- run through the expense line under U.S. GAAP at 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. But because certain individuals would be eligible for retirement, that pushes up the recognition if they become eligible in that year.  So in practice, and it's a little bit of a complex calculation because it's population dependent, you'd expect around 50% of that CHF500 million to flow through in 2022. And then it's obviously a smaller proportion in '23 and '24. So it will be something like 50%, 30%, 20%, but it depends very much on the retirement calculations. And that's obviously different from a level vest, and I'd be very happy, Andrew, to talk to you about level vesting amortization under U.S. GAAP separate, but I won't waste everyone's time at this point, but that's how it works.  But you asked a very good point on the second question, the other half of the number, which I've given in terms of guidance. And that is that Credit Suisse has historically operated quite high levels of deferral above that of our peers in Europe. And we would like to move back to a more normal deferral table. Clearly, that doesn't change the economic cost of bonus awards over the lifetime of those bonus awards, but it does mean that more flows through in the first year of that. And I said that's about the other half of this.  Clearly, there's an important caveat on that, Andrew, which is what is the variable compensation pool in total in 2022, which is clearly indetermined at this point. And therefore, there has to be some uncertainty around that guidance. But I think it's material enough that it's worth talking about and making clear, that you understand that does push us towards the top end of our guidance range for '22. Hopefully, that's okay, but I'll be more than happy to follow up afterwards, Andrew.\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. And Andrew, to your second question, no, I don't think there is any contradiction to that at all. And I would like to come from 2 angles.  First of all, what we've seen really in Q4 was the result of a series of steps we've taken during the year in terms of strengthening our leadership and governance in risk management in terms of recalibrating our risk appetite and reducing our risk positions starting, obviously, within the Investment Bank and Prime Services. But across frankly, the Board also exiting certain other businesses like GTS, emerging markets, reduced oil and gas exposures and overall RWA and leverage reduction since the end of the first quarter, as we showed between 10% and 12%. And as a consequence of that, we really saw in Q4, a very low activity in new business, and that has been very much also influenced by slower markets and -- but also somewhat inward focus, I would say, of the organization as we immediately implemented the new structure -- organizational structure, which followed the strategic review that we presented on the 4th of November.  And then obviously, as a consequence of that, we are strengthening the risk culture with a much more disciplined approach around risk in both the first line and second line of defense, significant investments across risk and compliance, et cetera. And this all leads to -- or led to a real slowdown in Q4 and has now been really, I would say, embedded and has now laid the foundation for a very disciplined slow growth coming forward now in Q1 and beyond.  And maybe more conceptually, I mean, banking is about risk management. It's not about avoiding risk. It's about proper risk management, and that's really what the Executive Board and including myself, are telling all our troops. We want to have disciplined approach to risk, but we want to do new business. So that's very clear. And in that sense, we see absolutely no contradiction when we say on one side, we want to further strengthen the risk culture, but at the same time, regaining some revenue momentum.\\nAndrew Coombs: I guess just to follow up, and I understand all the points you're making. I think, the issue last year is that your employees necessarily didn't know how much risk they were able to take. And as a function of that, you've clearly seen a large downturn in revenues. Do you think with the steps that you've now put in place, there is a deep understanding across the franchise about exactly what risk tolerance levels are acceptable? And now from here, you're in a position where you can take that forward?\\nThomas Gottstein: Absolutely. I think that has become very clear. We have recalibrated our risk appetite division by division and region by region. That broken down to country limits, to limits for each of the business areas and product areas. And we have a very clear framework on limits, and this is now very clear in the organization and fully signed up by all ExB members, both the old ExB members, but also the new ExB members. And I'm really very excited about Francesco on the Wealth Management side and Christian's collaboration together with David Wildermuth and the risk teams and compliance teams. So this has really been now starting to work very well.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\\nKian Abouhossein: The first question is just coming back to the Credit Suisse AG parent bank, the CHF7.6 billion versus your CHF3.5 billion i.e., the additional CHF7.6 billion. You mentioned regulatory filters. And I just wondered if you can give us a little bit more color on those?  And secondly, we haven't heard anything from FINMA on regulatory add-ons on the holding under Basel III, so your regulatory capital. And I just wonder, can you read anything from this CHF7.6 billion towards what we should be thinking around FINMA add-ons? If you can maybe comment on that conceptually.  And then the second question is regarding your PB business. You indicated 2/3 of balances have been reduced. At the Investor Day, you talked about CHF600 million of revenue loss, CHF400 million of cost from what I recall. Could you tell us where we stand at this point in terms of revenue reductions and cost reductions? And even if I adjust my numbers within the IB, both in fixed income and equities and compare them to peers, you seem to be underperforming. Maybe you could just touch on that, again, should we just read that as a fourth quarter event, whether derisking? Or should we think we will see further potential relative performance differences against peers for a while?\\nDavid Mathers: Shall I take the first question, Thomas?\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes, please.\\nDavid Mathers: So I think, Kian, you're absolutely right. And by the way, the page that, just for everyone's benefit, is Page 43 of the earnings release. So just to cover that. So essentially, -- so yes, as part of the assessment of the financial plans of the entities and particularly post the strategy review, we did revalue them by about CHF3.5 billion. And obviously, we've also taken into account in the course of the year, the adverse impact on the entities of the Archegos loss because obviously, that was actually suffered in our subsidiaries and not in the parent itself.  However, I think your point is more the application by the FINMA on a cap on the regulatory value for capital purposes. FINMA is entitled to do that under the 2017 decree to put a cap or to provide a different number then valued by us. And that was something they did do on the basis of the numbers projected forward, and they employ an external assessor to do so. I don't think you can read anything more into it than that. Clearly, that does reduce the value of the Clearly, that does reduce the value of the subsidiaries for capital purposes at the end of the year. That's the 11.7% number and then 11.4% reflects the phasing of the decree basically there afterwards.  Clearly, that does obviously provide a reason why what we've talked about before in terms of the distribution of capital being very important and why the redistribution of capital within the bank is also important, too, which is really comes back to what I said to Stefan earlier, which is clearly, Credit Suisse Schweiz has been a regular source of dividends over the years. But essentially, we obviously need all of our subsidiaries to pay capital back to the parent, basically, and that's a critical process. And incidentally, by the way we have been very successful in terms of that.  I think go back to the comment that I made back at in the fourth, I think we've seen about GBP 12 billion of dividends and about EUR 12 billion of capital flowing back into the parent over the last 3 or 4 years. But it is obviously important that we complete that during the course of the current year. And as I said, in order of importance, it is the CECL, which is now a nonmaterial legal entity and has quite substantial capital balances. I think you can dig out the accounts and see them, but the order of CHF6 billion to CHF8 billion depending on how much we need for the dormant activities. And then obviously, the U.S. numbers and then Credit Suisse Schweiz, which, as I said before, has been a consistent dividend payer since it was formed back at the end of 2016. So I hope that helps answer the question. Kian, do you want to just have a follow-on that? Just in case there's anything else I can help with before we move to the second question.\\nKian Abouhossein: For David. Just is there -- clearly, there's expectation that we see some FINMA add-ons. And could we see this adjustment on top of your adjustment on the Swiss parent Bank AG. Just wondering, is there any read across that we can take in terms of FINMA add-on? And if you can give us a bit of color around that.\\nDavid Mathers: Can't really comment. It is a separate process. What I would say in terms of helpful guidance at this point is for the group as a whole, this is not a parent issue per se. For the group as a whole, we expect around CHF6.5 billion of methodology changes coming through in terms of the RWA numbers for 2022. Just under half of that is our risk add-ons in respect to the litigation amounts. But I think clearly, I think one cannot rule out that there will be further more direct add-ons in terms of RWA as this process actually works through. But there's nothing I can give any particular guidance at this point, basically to help you out, Kian, sorry.\\nKian Abouhossein: Sorry, on the PB business, if you could help us on the numbers.\\nThomas Gottstein: Apology, -- can you repeat?\\nKian Abouhossein: Sorry, on the prime brokerage business, you indicated 2/3 of the, I think, balances down, but you also gave an indication of CHF600 million of revenues, CHF400 million of cost to be reduced in 2022. I just wonder -- I assume some of that is already in the numbers? Or should we think about the numbers getting bigger?\\nThomas Gottstein: I was just going to tackle that second part of your question. So where do we stand? So as we said, 2/3 of the balances have been reduced. And in terms of your related question on market share development and how we see it also into the Q1 and '22, I would say the following. First of all, if you take the full year, I think our market shares and relative performance market shares and relative performance versus our peers was, I think, very strong in SP and more broadly in credit. Left in equity capital markets, M&A was very solid. But clearly, on the GTS side and within that, some of the macro and FX businesses probably underperformed.  And then there is obviously the whole equities business where starting from the second quarter, we have not only reduced our prime balances, but also had some negative effect on cash equities. We had a very strong performance in equity derivatives for the full year. And I would say equity capital markets was obviously strong for a long time up to, I would say, second, third quarter in IPOs. But then clearly, fourth quarter, the SPAC -- or I would say, second half, the SPAC activity really slowed down quite markedly. And as a consequence, on a year-on-year comparison, the fourth quarter to fourth quarter last year or fourth quarter '20 was clearly an underperformance because of the lower SPAC activity.  So going forward, I think we are very well positioned in credit in SP as well as in M&A and where we continue to invest. LevFin, we do think that we are also very well positioned. But with the higher interest rates coming, we think that there will be some slowdown in financing and LevFin activity. And otherwise, in equities, we continue to invest in our technology and AES business as well as in equity derivatives, where we continue to see a good momentum.  So that's how I would say we are developing in terms of investments and market shares. Anything you would like to add, David? Okay.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.\\nBenjamin Goy: Two questions, please, one on cost and one on your RM hiring pipeline. So first on cost you highlighted the CHF17 billion is at the upper end of the range. And then you get some incremental benefit as you outlined in '23 and '24 from this CHF500 million vesting schedule. But still want to double check given we are at inflationary times, you want to hire more people and ideally, revenues grow. So maybe you can speak about the '23, '24 measures a bit more. Why you're not, so to say, further increasing when you're already at the upper end of the cost range this year?  And then secondly, you mentioned the Relationship Manager hiring APAC but it was good, IWM is down. But maybe you can comment on the pipeline and how this process of RM hiring is progressing this year? Or is it more that -- a bit more stability is needed until we see a significant acceleration towards the target?\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you very much, Benjamin. So Thomas, I'll take the first question?\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes.\\nDavid Mathers: Well, look, I think, firstly, in terms of the expense guidance, I think there's nothing much I'd add to what you said, Benjamin, around 2022. And we've obviously covered CV in some detail.  In terms of '23 and '24, I just cast your mind back to the Investor Day. And we did include the same numbers on Slide 27, which is the structural cost measures we're pushing through. It's just the nature of these reorganizations that you don't see that much of the benefit in the first year. The prime benefits in terms of the cost reductions will only really start to flow through later this year as we actually complete the transition of our clients off the platform. Until then, we need to maintain that platform for the benefit of our clients whilst they're finishing it.  Equally, the procurement savings coming from the Chain IQ deal, yes, they start this year because the whole relationship goes live later this quarter. But they only actually build up over time, and they continue to accrete in '23 and '24 as we actually move forward. I think beyond that, and I think we obviously will give updates later this year. But I think it will be very important to talk about the benefits we expect from the centralization of IT and some of the other organizational measures, all of which really only flow through in '23 and '24 from a materiality point of view.  And if you look back what we said, we're talking here about structural cost saves of CHF1 billion to CHF1.5 billion by '24, of which CHF300 million comes through only in this year. So that's, as you might say, is the mathematical underpinning or the result of that basically. So I think that's why we can make this comment that I think we are going to see pressure in '22 as a consequence of the CV effect from the deferred compensation awards and the normalization of CV. But there afterwards, basically, I think we are reiterating our guidance for '23 and '24.\\nThomas Gottstein: So the Relationship Manager hiring, as you know, our plan is for the next 3 years, about 500. That's about 170 per year. And if you look at what we did last year in APAC, that gives you an indication roughly where we think regionally, we will continue to grow in our plan. So 40% to 50% in APAC, about 25% to 30% in the former IWM regions, that is Middle East, that's Europe, that's Latin America and the rest in Switzerland.  Now clearly, the slowdown that we have seen in the last few months in Asia will probably mean that the growth in 2022 in terms of hiring, we'll have to look at and we have to see how the market will further develop. And I cannot exclude that we will be a bit more flexible about the hiring in that region in 2022. But the plan is a 3-year plan. It's a long-term plan. And we'll have to see how China and the rest of Asia will develop over the next few months, and we will adapt accordingly. But in principle, that's kind of the regional breakdown of the growth that we are planning to implement.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from Daniele Brupbacher from UBS.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: You mentioned that group risk review, which I think is important. Can you tell us in that context, the Greensill report and the conclusions out of that report, is that also part of that, i.e. are all the conclusions and the decisions taken in that sense? And let's say, at least the immediate reactions and actions are taken out of that also in terms of, I don't know, responsibilities, et cetera?  And then sorry, just very briefly on the parent bank again. David, could you give us the fully loaded ratio versus the 11.4%, is that still above 10% or now a little bit below that? And in that context, the Archegos add-on CHF1.9 billion, 70 bps more or less at the group level. Is that also relevant for the parent? I guess the domestic add-on for mortgages is not because that's in the Swiss entity. And if you could just give us some numbers there and probably the regulatory filter, the CHF7.6 billion you mentioned, doesn't mean you basically FINMA halved the regulatory still to benefit. Is that how I should read it?\\nThomas Gottstein: Okay. Let me start with the first question, and then David will take the second question.  So the risk review is separate from the supply chain funds and also from Archegos. So as part of the work we went through over the 9 months, I would say, since April to the end of the year under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee, initially, that was with the former Chief Risk Officer -- sorry, the former Chair of the Risk Committee on the Board and then subsequently under the leadership of our former Chairman, we really had 3 themes that this Tactical Crisis Committee looked at. One was Archegos agreed across, one was supply chain funds and agreed across and the third one was the risk review. And the risk review was really a very systematic review of all balance sheet items and off-balance sheet items. It was really a very detailed analysis so to speak, vertically through the balance sheet and -- but then also looking at each of the divisions and regions, looking at special themes, special businesses, whether it was in Investment Banking, whether it was in Corporate Banking, whether it was Level 3 assets, et cetera.  So this -- these 3 themes really were part of our work that we went through with the Tactical Crisis Committee week-by-week in the first phase and then every second week thereafter. So the risk review was really separate from the supply chain fund. And all 3 have essentially been completed.  As we said already earlier, the Archegos -- with the Archegos report coming out, the Paul, Weiss report at the time, then the risk review was completed in the fourth quarter, and we have now also completed the review by the Board with respect to the report on the supply chain finance fund, which was commissioned to Deloitte and a Swiss law firm. So all 3 themes have really been completed. And from that perspective, also the Tactical Crisis committee is now essentially being phased out. David, the parent?\\nDavid Mathers: Yes. On the second point, I mean, I think this is the other -- so as I said in answer to Stefan's question before, the look through capital required to be accumulated in the parent by '28 has increased from CHF6 billion to CHF9 billion. That means the equivalent look-through ratio is, I think, somewhere between 9.5% and 9.6% actually, Daniele. So that's the look-through ratio as of now, basically, in terms of that, so just below the 10% level. Clearly, it's the transitional ratio, which is the 11.7% and 11.4%, which is relevant in terms of the capital measures.  I think your second question then was around the Pillar 2 add-on in respect of Greensill supply chain funds. That was, as I said, applied originally by FINMA to the parent. It's still sitting there as well as the group. So that for them means you still got a 60 basis point increase against the 10% minimum for the parent, again, on a transitional basis for that, basically, that's still sitting there. And I think at some point, that will have to be decided where it sits within the legal entity structure, but it's still sitting there at this particular moment.  In terms of your third point, which is around the Tactical cyclical add-on, which the Swiss National Bank has decided to reimpose with effect from September, you're absolutely correct. Because there's de minimis residential mortgages booked in the parent, it has a minute impact of 0.2 basis points to be exact of the [indiscernible] cyclical add-on, whereas the [indiscernible] cyclical add-on for the group is about 24 basis points. And obviously, for CS Schweiz, it's obviously considerably more than that because that's what actually sits, but it does -- it doesn't affect the parent requirements.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim from Societe Generale.\\nAndrew Lim: You said quite little about the litigation that you incurred. Just reading through the notes, it seems like it might have arisen due to a change in your settlement strategy for the legacy issues. I was wondering if you could give a bit more color on that and confirm that it is due to RMBS legacy issues? And if we still have any other outstanding cases going forward? So that's my first question.  And then my second question is regarding your strategy for resolution of the SCF finance funds and the outstanding amount there, it's still quite material. In terms of timeline and strategy, are you looking to see what happens with your insurance claims. And then how long would that take to resolve? And then if you are unsuccessful in claiming against insurance, what would be your strategy then? Perhaps you might not be able to give an answer, but I guess my concern here is that you're having investors sitting on losses for several years now, and this is not good for your franchise, of course, it doesn't really give a great message here. So just keen to see what your thinking is here.\\nDavid Mathers: Perhaps if I kick off just on litigation. Look, I think there's a limit to what I'm going to be able to say. I mean, we do make a point of not commenting on issues which are clearly under active discussion, negotiation about this. What we clearly have said is the charge that we took in the fourth quarter primarily relates to current or former Investment Banking activities. And that clearly does include the RMBS cases, but I think it's also fair to say that we did sweep up a larger number of smaller cases, shall we say, if that's helpful.  I'm not sure I'd necessarily define it as an entire change in terms of litigation strategy. But I think what we have seen in some of these cases are very long standing. And I think there has been a willingness on both sides, as you might say, to reach a resolution of these things at levels which are, shall we say, more satisfactory. And therefore, we have accrued towards closing out those transactions. So yes, I think that you will see the number of active cases actually dropping. But there still is some significant litigation outstanding.  And I would just draw your attention to the fact we have disclosed the RPL in our earnings statement, that is 0 to CHF1.6 billion. And you will note that was 0 to CHF1.4 billion. I'm not going to comment, but I think just aware of that. So we still do have a significant litigations open and just to be aware of that point.\\nThomas Gottstein: And with respect to our strategy on the supply chain front, it continues what we have been describing also over the last few months. It's really on 2 levels. One is on the recovery. And within that, we also have 2 levels, namely the focus areas of the obligors and the non focus areas plus the insurance. So that's a process that is ongoing. We have a large team of internal and external legal and other experts as we are pursuing the recovery of the underlying notes and balances.  And secondly, we have, as you know, started a goodwill program for our Wealth Management clients who have been investing and that has been a very successful exercise where we provide fee waivers and other programs, which has had a lot of traction and where we're making very good progress. And in some instances, actually increased our share of wallet with these clients. So that is really the strategy to continue the work on both of these elements, i.e., recovery of the underlying assets under the goodwill program.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Amit Goel from Barclays.\\nAmit Goel: So two questions. The first one, just in relation to the commentary or guidance for the start of this year. Please, could you just give a little bit more color in terms of -- I think the comment was the weak start to the year, across the -- just how that splits across the different businesses and potentially how it compares perhaps rather than to 2021, but 2020 or 2019?  And the second question, maybe a clarification. But on the additional award, the CHF497 million, I wasn't sure if that was a kind of a fair value. So I was just wondering if the group were to hit its targets, would that number be considerably larger and/or how much could it potentially total?\\nDavid Mathers: Very good question, Amit. Shall I take the second one first? Just in terms of the award of CHF497 million I mean this will be disclosed in the compensation report. But just to dimension it, it's not actually a fair value, that's the par value. And the upside on this award is plus 50% and it's -- but it's -- that's at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. And basically -- and we will give more detail on March 10. But essentially, the criteria fall into delivery of the risk and compliance and control goals, point one. And obviously, delivery of some of the other key profit metrics, point two by 2024. So that's the upside in terms of this. It's not for those, obviously, you have a history of us, it's not a multiplier type instrument that you may have seen in the past, basically, but there is upside and it's clearly linked to both the risk remediation, risk culture point as well as the profit goals we actually laid out in GSR.  And I would say there are also knockout clauses to the downside, but we'll give more details on that on March 10. So hopefully, that helps you in terms of thinking about that instrument basically.  I think your second question was really about the sort of start of January. Look, I think we're still in it 4 or 5 weeks into the year. What certainly occurred to me, I think, is that there was a sort of weak start in terms of financing activity at the beginning of this year, and that was really kind of true across the bank. What we've seen, obviously, with this volatility is a pickup in terms of some of the sort of trading lines, the stronger performance by GTS and obviously, a stronger performance by equity derivatives, which is exactly what you expect in the circumstances. So it has picked up. But certainly, I think we're always to January starting very strongly, and that was not the case this year, and I think we did want to make that clear.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Adam Terelak from Mediobanca.\\nAdam Terelak: I have one on capital and one on cost inflation. On capital, I mean, you finished the year at 14.4%. You're 2/3 of the way is deleveraging the IP, but you've got strong growth plans opposite that. I'm just wondering how quickly you can be deploying capital back into Wealth? You've clearly finished the year CHF5 billion lower on RWA since deleveraging. You've got some regulatory inflation coming. So I was just wondering how quick kind of the CHF3 billion back into the Private Bank can come through?  And then secondly, on the cost walk into next year, the CHF700 million investment, is that pure investment? And how much of that is kind of rollover of run rates of investments year-to-date? And is there any kind of cost inflation underlying that, that we should think about also?\\nDavid Mathers: Perhaps to start on the cost point first. I think what we're referring to there is additional investments that we're actually making across the bank. I mean clearly, if we're talking about our total investment spend, we're obviously talking more around CHF3 billion in terms of IT, for example, each year. So that's the additional investments we expect to coming through the expense line. Because as you know, certain investments are capitalized and then amortized. So that's the guidance, as you might say, to how much the cost run rate we'll incur as a consequence. I mean, and we are very focused on driving cost efficiency across our existing infrastructure and therefore, releasing reserves and resources for that investment program. So there's very much a bifurcation how we think about costs between these 2 components and these 2 elements. But it's obviously, we didn't -- we obviously invest more than CHF700 million every year, so you should see that as the margin or incremental investment spend. And that does include expenditure on risk and control initiatives as well, just to be clear.  I think in terms of the capital point, I think, clearly, from a group point of view, I mean, I'd just repeat what we said back on the 4th of November, I think 2021 was a challenging and difficult year for us. And clearly, for our shareholders and for our clients, too. And I think we feel it is only appropriate to operate at a ratio above 14% and around 4.5% on leverage ratio because I think we have to be seen as unquestioned in terms of our capital position, and that's very much our capital strategy.  Quite clearly, we've outlined the plan to actually reinvest. So we're obviously reducing capital investment bank by CHF3 billion, of which CHF2 billion has already been accomplished, obviously largely through the exit at the majority of prime. That does release reserves for the Wealth Management businesses. But I think we were very clear back on the 4th of November that we would expect that to be delivered in a measured and balanced way compatible with our risk appetite and risk goals. So it's not all going to come out and we're going to go back in again. That would not be. But clearly, we do have capacity to support that Wealth Management growth provided it meets our risk criteria.\\nAdam Terelak: And underlying cost inflation in the '22 cost then?\\nDavid Mathers: Yes, I mean, yes, and so forth, we've got 6.6, I think, of our expected methodology just under half is off risk. So that will absorb some capital, and that's obviously primarily at the group level.  Our cost inflation, we're watching it closely. I wouldn't -- I think we're obviously conscious of what's going on out there in terms of the movement in inflation. I think it's reflected properly in our cost guidance, I think is the best way of summing that. I think there's plenty of things we can do. I think the Chain IQ deal is a very good deal and it's -- let's be clear, it's something we should have done before. So there is potential. And I think there are other things we can do as well.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen from Royal Bank of Canada.\\nAnke Reingen: The first is coming back to the Investment Bank and what you described a more normalization of the environment. And I guess given the change in the business, it's somewhat harder to see what that could be. In that context, would you think Q4 is like a reasonable base considering that there's more prime brokerage business going out according to plan?  And then on the fee waiver, thank you very much for giving us the financial impact. Is it sort of like now implemented across the clients and assets you're planning to? Or should we expect a further step up in the next quarter?\\nThomas Gottstein: Maybe I'll kick off with the first question, and then David will do the second question. I mean 2021 saw clearly a very elevated Investment Banking activities in -- across the board, frankly. But in particular, in areas such as equity capital markets, IPOs, SPACs but also in other areas like SP, credit and LevFin. Some of this will probably more normalize now in 2022 on the other side. So other areas like FX, where we have clearly more volatility, which is a good thing, I guess, for our business. And the same is true for some other GTS businesses we have. And equity derivatives, we think, will continue to be a source of opportunity in these volatile markets. So that's an area where we had already very strong results in '21, and we continue to see a good opportunity there. And then there are certain macro businesses that will probably also benefit from more volatile markets around interest rate hikes. So -- but clearly, compared to '21, overall Investment Banking revenues to the Street will normalize more to -- toward 2020 and '19 levels.\\nDavid Mathers: I think on the fee waiver program, Anke, I think, firstly, I think interest in this has been high and I think take-up amongst the clients has been high as well. As we said, the -- we saw an adverse impact on revenues of about CHF28 million in the fourth quarter, the majority of which was in respect of IWM.  Just to be helpful, I don't think you should take CHF28 million and multiply it by 4 for '22, that would not be correct. I would expect the number probably somewhere between, say, CHF50 million and CHF100 million, maybe let's pick CHF75 million at that, difficult to be exact. And that's mainly because, of course, as clients' losses or potential losses in respect of the SCF fund are actually absorbed, obviously, the program becomes irrelevant at that point.  And that's clearly very good because I think it is good to see the take-up. It does, obviously, I think, demonstrate our support for clients, and this is very important in respect to this matter. But clearly, essentially, it's also resolving this issue, which I think is actually important in terms of that. So I think -- and then clearly, one would expect the number to be less in '23 and '24, I think that hopefully helps.\\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Piers Brown from HSBC.\\nPiers Brown: I've just got a couple of -- that are actually just detailed number of questions. But first of all, on Wealth Management net loans, you gave a number on Slide 9 of CHF203 billion at the end of Q4. Can you -- have you got the number for the end of Q3 because there was a figure of CHF184 million given that the 9-month stage in the November Investor Day pack, which just seems a very large quarter-on-quarter increase. So maybe that's not like-for-like. So if you could just give us the corresponding Q3 number that relates to that CHF203 billion that you've shown for the fourth quarter?  And the second question is just on the distribution guidance for 2022 that you gave back in November of 25%. Forgive me if I'm mistaken, I can't see any reference for that in the slide pack today, but is that still the intention in terms of the level at which you accrue the dividend through this year?\\nDavid Mathers: I think on the first point, I think we'll revert to you and indeed, if everybody else wants a number, we're more than happy to give that to you afterwards, but we need to do a detailed reconciliation to that CHF203 billion, but we'll get back to you and give you those numbers later today, basically.  In terms of distribution, yes, we're not changing what we said on the 4th of November. As you know, the Board of Directors recommends to shareholders a CHF0.10 dividend in respect to 2021, which is unchanged from the lowered level in respect to 2020. And we certainly confirm our guidance of 25% of net income for 2022. So no change from what we've said previously.\\nOperator: Thank you. Kinner, please continue.\\nKinner Lakhani: Great.

I will now hand over to our Group CEO, Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Kinner. And thank you all for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results presentation. We greatly appreciate your participation and engagement.  Let me be upfront and begin with some comments about 2021 and more recent events. Despite a very supportive market environment and strong underlying performances in most of our businesses, especially during the first 9 months of 2021, last year was very challenging for Credit Suisse in the context of the supply chain finance funds and the Archegos matters.  The fourth quarter was difficult as well as we flagged in our trading update in January. David and I will walk you through all the numbers over the course of today's presentation.  Our results were significantly affected by goodwill impairment and litigation provisions. In addition, they were impacted by lower transaction-based revenues and reflected more normal trading conditions, client deleveraging and a significant reduction of our overall risk appetite in 2021.  More generally, we were a bank which just embarked on a new organizational structure and have become very inward focused, especially in December. This all negatively impacted our franchise momentum. At the same time, we took a number of decisive steps last year to position ourselves for sustainable growth. And let me please highlight the following.  Firstly, we strengthened our capital position and substantially reduced our risk positions. Secondly, we strengthened risk and compliance teams, systems and processes and underwent a comprehensive risk review across the entire group, which was completed in the fourth quarter; and thirdly, we strengthened our leadership in the investment bank, in asset management, in risk, in compliance, in technology and operations, in wealth management, as well as most recently in human resources. This will not be a quick fix, and we expect 2022 will be a transition year. But we have made clear progress in creating the conditions for a much more stable and predictable bank. All of this in line with our announcements on the 4th of November.  We have 3 key priorities for 2022. First, is to execute with discipline the detailed group strategy and 3-year financial plan, which we presented at our Investor Day on the 4th of November. The Board of Directors under Axel Lehmann's leadership along with the Executive Board under my leadership, fully see eye to eye when it comes to our shared commitment to the new strategy of strengthening the core, simplifying the organization and investing for growth.  Second, we will continue to improve risk and compliance with an emphasis on risk culture, while it's not losing our client focus and entrepreneurial spirit that has been the hallmark of Credit Suisse since its founding more than 165 years ago.  Third, we aim to reestablish franchise momentum grounded in the positive basis for growth in our 4 divisions with a strong regional overlay and supported by a disciplined approach to costs. Running our business with a strong balance sheet and with a diligent execution of our strategy is an absolute focus of my Executive Board.  Finally, the root of my confidence for our future lies with our employees. And I want to thank them again for their incredibly hard work and dedication during the last 12 months. I have no doubt that with the commitment of each employee, we will build a stronger bank for our clients, shareholders and other stakeholders.  With that, let me turn to the slides, starting with our key points on Page 4.  For the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a pretax loss of CHF1.6 billion. Adjusted pretax income excluding significant items was CHF0.3 billion. Our fourth quarter reported results were significantly impacted by the goodwill impairment in our investment bank relating to the acquisition of DLJ in 2000 and legacy litigation provisions. For the full year, we recorded a pretax loss of CHF0.5 billion, primarily driven by the Archegos loss, the goodwill impairment and the major litigation provisions, together totaling CHF7.6 billion. Adjusted pretax income excluding significant items and Archegos was CHF6.6 billion in 2021.  At the same time, we maintained our strong capital position with a CET1 ratio of 14.4% and a CET1 leverage ratio of 4.4%, both in line with our ambition to run the bank with a strong capital base going forward. The Board will propose a dividend of CHF0.10 per share for 2021, subject to AGM approval.  We have already made considerable progress implementing our strategy, which includes the creation of a unified Wealth Management division, a global Investment Bank and a centralized Chief Technology and Operations Organization.  We grew our Wealth Management recurring commissions and fees, supported by an increase in mandate penetration and in assets under management. We progressed our plans to make significant increases in Relationship Manager hiring, including a roughly 13% increase in APAC Relationship Managers in 2021.  As part of our ambition to generate CHF1 million to CHF1.5 billion in annual structural cost savings by 2024 to be invested for growth, we announced a third-party agreement to deliver procurement savings. The Investment Bank already released USD 2 billion of allocated capital versus the end of 2020. That marked significant progress towards our ambition to release more than USD 3 billion over 2021 and 2022. In other words, we have achieved already 2/3 of the investment bank capital release ambition. We significantly reduced prime chargeable balances by 66%. These measures underscore our commitment to implementing our strategy.  Next slide, please. Here, you see historical reported and adjusted data and the factors that weighed on both sets of results for the fourth quarter. As I already mentioned, and as David will go into more detail about later on.  Next slide, please. We are on Page 6. As mentioned before, 2021 was a very challenging year with our reported results impacted by Archegos, the DLJ goodwill impairment and litigation provisions. At the same time, our underlying performance demonstrated the strength of our franchises. We saw record underlying pretax income in the Swiss Universal Bank and in APAC, reflecting our strength in both our home market and a key growth engine for the global economy, namely APAC.  The investment bank posted record revenues across a number of key products, and there was a strong performance in asset management. This provides a great platform to continue executing on our strategy. Finally, the level of provisions for credit losses reflects the strong underlying quality of our lending book. In the supplement, you can see that our provision for credit losses excluding Archegos have remained well controlled.  Slide 7. I would like to turn to the supply chain finance fund matter. The Board-commissioned report has been completed and shared with FINMA. And as the recovery process is ongoing, there is no intention by the Board to publish the report. As of the end of 2021, we have recorded 72% of net asset value. And we are taking every possible measure to maximize recovery for investors, including pursuing borrowers and related parties.  We filed 5 insurance claims with corresponding CSAM exposure of approximately USD 1.2 billion as of the end of 2021. Let me now turn to the decisive steps we have taken to align risk with our strategy, please. Slide 8. Management and the Board of Directors spent a great deal of time and energy in 2021 strengthening our risk and compliance efforts, including in our first line of defense. We are committed to continuing this process under the guidance of our new Chief Risk Officer, David Wildermuth, and our Chief Compliance Officer, Rafael Lopez, as well as under the new leadership in Asset Management, the Investment Bank and Wealth Management. We are confident that the changes we are making across our risk and compliance functions will support our growth ambitions in the strategic plan. You can see the steps we have taken at the top of the slide as regards our leadership and governance, our risk appetite and our risk culture. Next slide, please. Here, you see the substantial risk reduction we achieved since the first quarter of 2021 at the group level as well as in Investment Bank and across our Wealth Management businesses. Our absolute and relative performance in 2021 should be seen in this context versus our peers. Over the course of 2022, we expect to complete the exit of substantially all of our prime services businesses and progressively deploy capital into Wealth Management and other core businesses in all of our 4 divisions.  Next page, please. This slide shows the steps we have taken quarter-by-quarter to strengthen our capital position both in terms of our CET1 ratio as well as our Tier 1 leverage ratio. It also shows that these steps have put us at the top in terms of Tier 1 leverage and in the top half of CET1 capital versus our global peers. Our balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to execute our strategy, which I will turn to in the coming slides.  Next page, please. We are diligently executing our 3-pillar strategy. We are strengthening our balance sheet and strengthening our business model by shifting capital to what we see as the most value-creating parts of our businesses. These aspirations include redeploying approximately CHF3 billion of capital into Wealth Management over the next 3 years. We are simplifying our organization by driving structural cost discipline. We are investing for growth in clients, businesses, talent and technology, including our ambition to progressively add approximately 500 Relationship Managers over the next 3 years as market conditions allow.  We have already made good progress toward that objective. This goes hand-in-hand with corresponding first and second line of defense investments. Underlying these pillars is strong risk management and a diverse and inclusive culture that builds on our entrepreneurial spirit.  Next page, please. As I said at the Investor Day, structure follows strategy. I firmly believe we have the right team in place to implement our strategy together. The structure of the Executive Board has changed significantly with 7 new members since the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, Christian Meissner and Ulrich Körner joined us to run the Investment Bank and the Asset Management divisions, respectively. Chief Compliance Officer, Rafael Lopez Lorenzo started in the fourth quarter. Our new Chief Technology and Operations Officer, Joanne Hannaford; our new Chief Risk Officer, David Wildermuth; and our new CEO, Wealth Management, Francesco De Ferrari, all started on the 1st of January. Finally, we welcome Christine Graeff as our new Head of Human Resources, who took over from Antoinette Poschung as per the 1st of February.  Slide 13, please. We are executing our 3-pillar strategy across our 4 divisions. Let me call out just a few of them. We have invested for growth in Wealth Management with more than CHF600 million in investments in digitalization, automation and Relationship Manager hires in 2021. We have simplified the Investment Bank through global integration. We have strengthened the Swiss Bank through stronger collaboration between the corporate bank and private and institutional businesses, generating CHF10 billion client referral volume in 2021. And in terms of next steps for Wealth Management, we aim to achieve disciplined lending growth. In the Investment Bank, we plan to build out our M&A advisory and capital markets businesses, including our Investment Banking advisory offering for entrepreneurs and family offices in Wealth Management. We are targeting to more than double CSX clients in 2022 in the Swiss Bank. We aim to enhance the Asset Management coverage model for Wealth Management and institutional clients, as well as third-party clients.  Next page, please. Sustainability is a priority of mine, and it is of the utmost importance to infuse it across our divisions and regions. We made significant progress executing our 5-pillar strategy in 2021. Looking forward, I'm delighted that Emma Crystal will become our Chief Sustainability Officer effective 1st of April, reporting directly to me. Emma brings extensive wealth management and sustainability expertise that will enable her to effectively partner with all of our divisions and regions as we deploy our sustainability product shelf and financing to clients.  On the right, you see the significant increase in sustainable assets under management that we achieved in 2021. We believe sustainability is a vital part of our value proposition and the right thing to do for our economies and societies.  Next slide, please. Achieving structural cost savings is central to our strategy as it will help fund our growth initiatives. On the left side of the slide, you can see the 4 main drivers of savings and then our step-by-step approach to reaching our ambition by 2024.  These include: Firstly, synergies from Unified Wealth Management and globally integrated Investment Bank divisions; secondly, procurement centralization and other centralizations; Thirdly, simplification of booking model and reduction of legal entities. And I would note that we have already seen a greater than 20% reduction in CS operating legal entities since 2018; and finally, improved automation and digitalization.  Next page, please. Our strategy pillars are being leveraged to progress our digital transformation to drive change, growth and user experience in a modern world. These include strengthening our cybersecurity infrastructure and simplifying our business platforms. We are investing in our digitally enabled client experience to sharpen our high-touch versus high-tech segments.  As you can see on the right of the slide, we are running a 50-50 split in terms of using our current technology spending to both run the bank and change it. Our experienced global staff gives us a mature presence in high-value locations.  Next page, please. Today, we are reaffirming the financial aspirations outlined at the Investor Day, and I have outlined our step-by-step approach to delivering them. We aim to release more than $3 billion of Investment Bank capital over 2021 to 2022 and have already achieved 2/3 of that and to make targeted investments in the Investment Bank from 2023 onwards.  We plan to invest approximately CHF3 billion of capital into Wealth Management by 2024. And increase capital allocated into Wealth Management, the Swiss Bank and Asset Management divisions to 2x the Investment Bank allocated capital in 2022 and beyond.  We have clear return on regulatory capital aspirations for each division. We expect our strategy to drive growth and to improve our cost-to-income ratio by 2024 to around 70% while maintaining a strong balance sheet to support growth. Our ambition is to achieve a reported group return on tangible equity of greater than 10% by 2024. These aspirations are grounded in the continued implementation of our transformative agenda, building on a culture that drives accountability, diversity and excellence.  The successful execution of our strategy and achievements of the aspirations I have set out should deliver improving returns and value to our shareholders while rebuilding a bank that we can all be proud of and with a strong risk culture and a strong balance sheet.  I would like to hand over now to David, who will go over the results in greater detail. I look forward to your questions later on. Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Thomas, and good morning to everybody. So just as usual, I'd like to go through the key financials and then give some more details on our performance at a divisional level.  First, I'd just like to remind you that the fourth quarter of 2021 is the last time that we'll be reporting under our old divisional structure. As you know, we implemented the new organizational structure with effect from the 1st of January of this year. And I've just included on the slide here a quick reminder what these changes look like, together with the key dates over the coming months.  Now just in particular, I think you should note that we'll be publishing the restated numbers for our historic time series on the morning of April 7, so a couple of months' time.  Now let's just go to a summary, please, of the group results. Now I think you saw our trading update, which we put out on January 25, and that highlighted a number of key themes. Firstly, clearly, the impairment of the goodwill, primarily in respect of the DLJ acquisition back in 2000, totaling approximately CHF1.6 billion that I mentioned last November.  Second, the increase in litigation provisions that we expected for the quarter, which have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the group has more proactively pursued settlements. And just to be clear, that increase primarily relates to legacy matters from our Investment Banking business. And then therefore, we booked either in the Investment Banking division or to the extent they're handled by the SRU and now the ARU in the corporate center.  Third, I think I mentioned on the 25th that we disclosed the benefit that we've taken in the quarter from real estate gains. And you may recall that -- so that was part of the strategy that we announced in response to the Archegos matter back in the second quarter of last year. And I'll cover these points in more detail as we go through the presentation.  Now just turning through the key reported numbers. Revenues for the quarter was CHF4.58 billion, that's 12% lower year-on-year. And that was primarily driven by a fall in revenues in the Investment Bank, which were 31% lower year-on-year at USD 1.6 billion. Our Wealth Management-related revenues were 2% higher at CHF3.2 billion, and that was driven by the strong performance of the Swiss Universal Bank.  Total operating expenses were 20% higher year-on-year at CHF6.19 billion the quarter. But you should remember that this is primarily due to the goodwill impairment of CHF1.6 billion. Goodwill impairments actually flow through the expense line, obviously, together with the litigation provisions.  Now overall for the quarter, we reported a pretax loss of CHF1.59 billion. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the goodwill impairment, litigation provisions and other significant items, we earned a pretax income of CHF328 million.  Now the income tax expense totaled CHF416 million in the quarter, and that continues to be adversely affected by the consequence of the Archegos loss and in the fourth quarter by other items and that's particularly the goodwill impairment for which no tax deduction is available when you actually write it off. Now for reference, that equates to a full year tax rate of about 196%. Although if you strip out Archegos and the goodwill impairment, you can calculate that normalizes at about 28%.  And looking forward to 2022, we'd expect an effective tax rate to be in the low 30s for the year. So let me just give some more detail regarding our adjusted and our reported numbers, both for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Now as I've indicated before, there are a number of items that have had an impact both credit and debit. And I've broken this out on the slide. Now just freeze, from this point on, just assume that when I refer to adjusted numbers, I mean adjusted excluding significant items at Archegos.  So if we start from the left. The fourth quarter reported loss was CHF1.59 billion. And that reconciles, as you can see moving to the right, to the pretax number on an adjusted basis of CHF328 million. At the bottom, you can see the full year numbers. So they correspond to CHF522 million pretax loss and adjusted pretax income of CHF6.6 billion.  So let's just go through these points in a bit more detail. So first of all, as I've already mentioned, we saw gains from real estate sales. And those were completed predominantly in Switzerland in the fourth quarter. Those gains were part of the capital steps that we announced in the second quarter of last year and we booked CHF224 million of gains in the fourth quarter with a total gain of CHF232 million for the year. And you can see we also booked a CHF31 million gain in the quarter on our 8.6% interest in Allfunds with a total gain for the year of CHF602 million.  We then saw smaller items totaling CHF57 million of losses in the fourth quarter and CHF212 million in the year as a whole. Now just most notably, I'm sure you remember that in the third quarter, that included the write-down on our investment in New York of a further CHF113 million, and there've been no moves on that since then.  There was no material move in our Archegos position in the fourth quarter. But clearly, the full year results are marred by the total loss relating to this matter of about CHF4.8 billion.  Now if we move to the right, we had restructuring charges of CHF33 million in the quarter, and CHF103 million in the year. And I just want to reiterate the guidance that we gave at the Investor Day that we'd expect a total cost of around CHF400 million in restructuring from the beginning of this program to the end -- at the end of 2022.  Clearly, though, those costs will only actually flow through as we actually complete our exit from the bulk of the prime services businesses and complete the other organization measures.  Now in terms of major litigation costs then. We took provisions of CHF436 million in the quarter and a total of CHF1.16 billion for the year. As I've said already, in the fourth quarter, these were predominantly against a number of legacy cases relating to the Investment Banking businesses and were booked either in the Investment Bank P&L, or for cases which were handled by the Strategic Resolution Unit, now the Asset Resolution Unit in the Corporate Center.  The residual investment bank-related goodwill of CHF1.6 billion mainly resulting from the DOJ acquisition in 2000 completes the write-off of all the residual goodwill relating to the acquired investment bank assets of DOJ and has been booked in the Investment Bank and APAC divisions.  Let's turn to capital ratios, please. Our CET1 ratio for the fourth quarter stood at 14.4%, and that's stable compared to third quarter but clearly is substantially ahead of the ratio of 12.9% that we reported at the end of 2020. The CET1 leverage ratio was 10 basis points higher quarter-on-quarter at 4.4% and due to lower leverage exposure, primarily from the reductions in prime services as headline CET1 leverage ratio is unchanged year-on-year. But you should remember that this is a function of the temporary COVID measures that FINRA introduced back in 2000, which excluded deposits held at the Central Bank from the leverage exposure calculation during the course of 2020. So if you exclude that temporary measure, the like-for-like improvement in the CET1 leverage ratio was from 3.9% to 4.4% at the end of 2021.  Our risk-weighted assets were CHF10 billion lower than at the end of the previous quarter at CHF268 billion, whilst leverage exposure was CHF48 billion lower, CHF875 billion. Lower risk appetite across the Investment Bank in '21, together with the Prime Services exit, has led to RWA and leverage exposure reductions of CHF1 billion and CHF18 billion, respectively, quarter-on-quarter.  And the reduced risk appetite and the deleveraging by clients I mentioned already led to corresponding falls of CHF5 billion in RWAs and CHF7 billion in leverage exposure across our Wealth Management businesses.  Now as we said already, in terms of our ambition to achieve at least USD 3 billion reduction in the capital allocated to the investment by the bank by the end of this year compared to 2020, that the actions that we already concluded means that we've achieved USD 2 billion of that total compared to the starting point at the end of 2020.  I'd remind you that our medium-term ambition remains to operate the CET1 ratio in excess of 14% pre the impact of the Basel III reforms and a CET1 leverage ratio of about 4.5% in the future.  Now I just wanted to make a brief point here about the Swiss CET1 capital ratio for Credit Suisse AG, the parent bank, which we discussed in some detail at the Investor Day back in November. As you know, our aspiration for the parent is a ratio of 12%. But at the end of 2021, it dipped to 11.7%. And with the phase-in of the transitional regime, to 11.4% as of January 1, 2022. And as we detailed in the earnings release, this is primarily due to FINRA imposing restrictions on the value of our subsidiaries for capital purposes.  Given that the group has an overall ratio of 14.4%, this is about the distribution of capital around the group and not the overall capital level. And as I said back in November, substantial capital repatriations and dividends are due from our U.K., U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries over the course of the next 12 months, which should rebalance this. As a consequence, I'd expect the Swiss CET1 ratio of the parent to increase to above our ratio -- our target of 12% by the year-end.  Next slide, please. Now as I've already mentioned, client deleveraging and challenging markets in some of the regions in which we operate, particularly in Asia, together with reductions in our own risk appetite resulted in a mixed performance for our Wealth Management businesses in the fourth quarter. However, we've continued to make progress in growing assets under management and increasing our mandate volumes.  If we look at the year as a whole, AUM grew by 7% to CHF1.6 trillion with net new asset contributions from our Institutional and Wealth Management businesses of CHF20 billion and CHF11 billion, respectively. We saw year-end mandate volumes of CHF241 billion, 9% higher than the end of 2020, whilst mandate penetration stood at 31% at the end of '21 compared to 29% a year earlier. And that puts us on track to achieve our medium-term ambition to have a range between 33% and 35%.  Let me touch on costs in the next few slides. So what I'll give here is a bit more detail about the operating expenses. Our reported total for group operating expenses for the full year was CHF19 billion, and that compares to CHF17.8 billion for 2020. This increase was adversely impacted by the goodwill impairment of CHF1.6 billion, which flows through our expense line, but clearly does not relate to ongoing operating expenses. The costs are also inflated by the increase in major litigation provisions that we took in the year.  Now on an adjusted basis, therefore, costs decreased from CHF16.6 billion to CHF16.0 billion, a decline of 4% year-on-year. But I would remind you that the variable compensation costs are lower given that the events of last year required us to make changes to both the amount and the type of compensation that was awarded.  So let's turn to that in more detail, please. Now we will give clearly a full summary in the compensation report that we published as part of our annual report on March 10. But there are a few details that I thought it would be useful to cover now.  The challenges that the firm faced in 2021 required us to balance 3 factors. First, we need to recognize the losses that our shareholders had suffered from Archegos, the goodwill impairment, the major litigation provisions and the other costs incurred over the course of '21. Second, and against that, we needed to reflect the competitive compensation environment and the strong underlying performance that was delivered by many of our businesses, notwithstanding other problems in '21. And third, clearly, the need to retain and motivate key franchises and personnel as we execute on the strategic plan over '22 to '24.  So the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, therefore, decided to reduce the variable compensation pool to CHF2 billion compared to CHF2.9 billion in 2020. And that equates to a reduction of 32%. Furthermore, for most Managing Directors and Directors, we also changed the composition of the awards with a higher proportion of cash being paid subject to clawback and a lower proportion in terms of share awards.  Just the point I made above though, we remain very focused on ensuring that there is clear alignment with the strategic plan. And therefore, we've awarded a further instrument to most of our Managing Directors and Directors with a par value of just under CHF500 million. That includes an upside clause aligned to the achievement of our strategic objectives and a downside clause as certain ambitions and targets are not met.  Now one consequence of this mix of deferred awards for our expense recognition has been the reduction of compensation costs for '21. And therefore, a subsequent increase in deferral costs for future years. So just provide some guidance here. I'd expect to see an increase of around CHF1 billion in 2022. That compares to the guidance we gave at the Investor Day of an increase of about CHF500 million. That reflects the combination of the amortization of the increased deferred compensation costs I've just summarized, plus an assumption of a more normal accrual of cash awards in 2022. And although clearly, the size of that increase will depend on the total bonus pool for the current year.  So let's just bring this altogether and give you an idea of where we do expect costs will look like for '22. So you'll probably recall some of these numbers from the Investor Day. But if we move from left to right, we start with the 2021 adjusted expenses, which stood at CHF16 billion. In '22, we expect to see the savings resulting from business exits totaling about CHF400 million and about another CHF300 million from the structural cost saving measures that we're pushing through. However, the approximately CHF1 billion increase in compensation costs that I've just outlined, together, our investment plans of an additional CHF700 million means that overall I would expect our adjusted operating expenses to be at the top of the range of CHF16.5 billion to CHF17 billion that we gave last November and probably around CHF17 billion, but clearly subject to the caveats I've given already.  Just to be clear, though, we are not changing our guidance for costs for '23 and '24. I'd reiterate that we would expect that to remain in the range of CHF16.5 billion to CHF17 billion once we're through this transitional year.  Let me turn now to the divisional summaries, and let's start with the Swiss Universal Bank. The Swiss Universal Bank concluded a strong performance through the year, with adjusted net revenues for the quarter -- fourth quarter of CHF1.31 billion, 6% higher year-on-year. Our businesses delivered increases in all major revenue categories, in particular, recurring commissions and fees. We also saw a good performance from our Investment Banking operations in Switzerland.  Adjusted operating expenses were 3% lower year-on-year at CHF770 million, resulting in an adjusted pretax income of CHF546 million, and that's 41% higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. Our reported pretax income was 47% higher year-on-year at CHF716 million.  Now as we've seen before in the fourth quarter, and this is -- this often happens, there were outflows in our Private Client business totaling CHF1.8 billion. But I'd remind you for the year, we saw total net new assets in private clients of CHF1.4 billion positive. Overall, the Swiss Universal Bank reported a record adjusted pretax income for the full year of CHF2.4 billion, 25% higher year-on-year as provisions for credit losses fell from CHF270 million to CHF6 million.  Let me now turn to International Wealth Management. Adjusted net revenues for the quarter were CHF695 million, 19% lower year-on-year. Whilst we saw some stabilization of net interest income on a sequential basis, it's clearly lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the cumulative interest rate moves over the period.  Our recurring commissions and fees were 7% lower year-on-year at CHF277 million, with higher mandate revenues and a stable margin, offset by lower fees from lending activities. At CHF156 million, our transaction-based fees were 40% lower than last year, reflecting, amongst other factors: First, a mark-to-market loss on an investment in Brazil of CHF19 million compared to a gain on the same investment of CHF31 million in the same quarter last year; second, the reversion of trading activity to more normal levels; and clearly, third, our own risk reduction in 2021. We should also note reduction in GTS revenues compared to a year ago.  But one final point, which is worth mentioning. that is the impact of the fee waiver program. This was established in the fourth quarter as a goodwill measure for clients impacted by the supply chain finance matter and entails the reimbursement on a quarterly basis of certain commissions and fees arising from current and future business transactions. The negative impact on revenue from this goodwill program across the Wealth Management businesses was CHF28 million in the fourth quarter, and the majority of this was incurred in IWM.  Operating expenses in IWM was 7% higher at CHF671 million as we continue to make investments in IWM infrastructure as well as a number of risk and sustainability plans. I think it's clear that a strong aspect of IWM's performance in the fourth quarter was client inflows. We saw net new assets totaling CHF2.7 billion in the quarter, which took the total for the year to CHF11 billion and that's notwithstanding the adverse impact of the supply chain finance matter throughout much of 2021. But it is clear though the overall financial performance for the fourth quarter was unsatisfactory. A combination of the reduction in revenues, particularly transactional revenues, plus the increase in costs, reduced adjusted pretax income to CHF25 million in the quarter.  Now if you look at the performance for the whole year, a 1% reduction in adjusted costs and a significant decline in provisions was not enough to offset the 10% decline in net revenues and our adjusted pretax income was CHF770 million, 23% lower than in 2020.  Let's turn to APAC. So the region has been adversely impacted by the weakening of market conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter, but in the second half to a degree as a whole. And that was evidenced both by the significant client deleveraging that we've seen in Asia and by a reduction in activity.  In the case of the client deleveraging, the 11% reduction in loans year-on-year reflected the change in market environment as well as the reduction in our own risk appetite towards a number of customers.  In the case of lower client activity, declining net interest income of 13% and in transaction-based revenues of 33% reflects the weaker environment and a softer GTS performance compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Although recurring commissions and fees for the quarter improved by 19% to USD 118 million year-on-year, driven by higher mandate and fee revenues, our adjusted net revenues were 20% lower year-on-year at USD 661 million.  Slightly lower operating expenses of USD 581 million for the quarter meant that the division delivered an adjusted pretax income of USD 94 million. Now if we include APAC's USD 113 million share of the goodwill charge relating to DOJ, that results in a reported pretax loss for the quarter of USD 9 million.  Now for the full year, the more resilient market environment earlier in the year meant that notwithstanding higher costs related to the Relationship Manager hiring and the investments that we've made in China, the division reported an adjusted pretax income of $1.01 billion for the year, and that's an increase of 22% compared to 2020.  Right, next slide, please. After the strong trading environment that prevailed for most of 2021, we saw a weak close to the year in our Investment Bank with net revenues of USD 1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to USD 2.3 billion in the very strong final quarter of 2020. We saw weakness in fixed income sales and trading, which was primarily credit-related. And reduction in equity revenues, which primarily results to our decision to exit the majority of our prime service businesses.  Now furthermore, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 when our equity capital market franchise was buoyed by very heavy levels of SPAC activity, this new issuance has clearly been lower in recent months. And on a more positive note, we saw a strong performance in equity derivatives in our macro businesses and continued momentum in our advisory operations, which were increased market share resulted in a 51% year-on-year increase in revenues to USD 300 million for the quarter.  However, overall, the weaker revenue performance resulted in adjusted pretax loss of USD 233 million for the quarter, and that's notwithstanding a 5% drop in operating expenses which was primarily due to the compensation points that I made earlier in this presentation.  Overall, our underlying performance of the year was much stronger with adjusted net revenues 5% higher compared to 2020 and 25% higher compared to 2019. Our adjusted pretax income was 2/3 higher than in 2020 at USD 3.15 billion, and that's notwithstanding a 15% reduction in allocated capital. However, just to be clear, given the losses relating to Archegos and the DOJ goodwill impairment, that meant this translated into a reported loss for the year of USD 3.92 billion.  Let's turn now to Asset Management. Now adjusted net revenues for the division were broadly flat at CHF387 million compared to CHF392 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. A 9% improvement in management fees, reflecting higher assets under management and higher investment and partnership income was offset by a 36% decline in performance and placement revenues and that clearly compares to a comparatively strong fourth quarter close to 2020.  We saw an increase in adjusted operating expenses of 10% quarter -- for the quarter year-on-year at CHF310 million, and that reflected both higher variable compensation costs in the quarter and expenses relating to the supply chain finance funds. We saw positive net new asset inflows for the quarter of CHF4.7 billion, driven by flows into our index solutions funds and into our emerging markets joint venture, which was partly offset by outflows from some of our fixed income funds.  Overall, the adjusted pretax income for the quarter was CHF79 million, and that's 31% lower year-on-year. Clearly, if you look at the performance for the full year, 21% revenue growth with good momentum across all the business lines meant that the division delivered an adjusted pretax income of CHF417 million, and that clearly compares to an undoubtedly weak performance of CHF192 million in 2020.  Net new assets for the year was CHF14.6 billion, and that increased the assets under management for AM division from CHF440 billion to CHF477 billion.  So let me just close then with just a few words, please, on the outlook for the current year. Clearly, as we've said already, 2022 will be a transitional year for Credit Suisse as the benefits of the strategic capital allocation towards our Wealth Management businesses and the structural cost saving measures that we discussed already will only really materialize from 2023 onwards. And I'd caution that I think we are seeing the end of the extremely favorable business environment that we've seen, particularly from transactions over the last couple of years, which has been driven by the substantial measures that central banks and governments have taken to sustain economies during the pandemic. We're clearly now seeing the start of the tightening of the interest rate environment, which has already begun in the United States and in the U.K. and certain other markets and we expect to be followed by the ECB later this year or in early 2023. I think this will mean a shift to a more normal trading environment that we've seen over the last couple of years, and we would expect this to be reflected in our results for the first quarter. And adjusted results for the first quarter, that is excluding the Archegos loss last year, are likely weaker than the first quarter of 2021, which arguably saw the peak benefit from the various monetary and fiscal incentives.  I think it's worth remembering, though, that whilst this will be a very different market, it will be one in which our clients do remain in need of good advice and products as they navigate a challenging landscape with the expectation of much higher levels of inflation and interest rates than we've seen for the last decade or so.  I think after a difficult close to 2021, we do expect though to see renewed franchise momentum as the new divisional structure takes shape. And as we've said in our outlook statement in the release, we have seen positive net new asset inflows year-to-date in our Wealth Management business. Nonetheless, I think it's clear, results this year will be adversely reflected by compensation normalization, by restructuring expenses and of course, by the decline in equity revenues following our decision to exit the majority of our prime business.  Now just one point, just to conclude. Whilst this isn't relevant to our underlying performance, I'd also note that we continue to hold an 8.6% stake in Allfunds, the value of which has fallen by about CHF204 million in the market sell off so far this year. Now clearly, Allfunds has been an extremely successful investment for Credit Suisse over the last 3 years. But now it's a quoted listed company that will contribute to a continuing degree of P&L volatility going forward.  And with that, I'd like to just to hand back to Thomas before we move to Q&A.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you, David. Let me conclude with a few comments.

So my first question is about business growth and how you see it further out than the first quarter of this year. And if you could give us a sense of your expected trajectory of kind of net new assets and of course, also lending given how much capital becomes available to that division over time.  And really, when you look at the transactional side of things, I know we're coming off of the 2 strong years. Where do you think that normalizes?  And my last one, really on wealth is on net interest income. Because effectively, we have -- we are seeing a tremendous shift in interest rate expectations, U.S., Eurozone as well. Could you give us a sense of the sensitivity that you're likely to see, particularly within the wealth business to the moves in rates in '22 and maybe further out?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': 'Thank you. Maybe I will kick it off, and then David will add a few points, especially on the net interest income.  So for the 2022 period, as we also outlined at the Investor Day, the key drivers for growth will be in terms of transactional revenues -- sorry, in terms of recurring revenues, AUM growth, M&A growth which will be driven by a combination of organic NNA growth that we expect to normalize again and be stronger than in 2021. And also driven by more lending growth, which will both help our NNA growth as well as our net interest.  And in addition to that, our Relationship Manager hiring intentions across the regions.  And as far as transactional revenues are concerned, I would say that the slowdown we saw, especially in the second half this year was somewhat unusual, and we would expect some more normalized levels of transactional revenues in 2022. In addition to that, we are committed to further increasing our level in terms of private equity and alternative investments, as well as other initiatives around mandate penetration which should also help our recurring revenues.  These are some of the elements that we discussed in detail at the Investor Day in November. But maybe, David, you want to add a few things on the net interest income side?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thanks very much, Thomas. Look, I think there's no doubt that the moves that we've seen already in U.S. interest rates and we expect to continue to see during the course of 2022 will be favorable to our dollar net interest income.  I mean, I think to give some numbers, if we look at the forward rate curve now, we probably expect to see about a $50 million gain in U.S. dollar net interest income in '22. And that rises to more like about $175 million in '23. So I think that gives some degree of the sensitivity due to U.S. dollars.  I think I should balance that, though, by -- Magdalena, I think you're fully aware of this, but the major Swiss banks are all subject to the exemption threshold that the Swiss National Bank operates, which I believe is broadly similar in concept to that, that the ECB operates as well. So at some point, I mean, I think it seems unlikely that the ECB is going to be at the front of this queue. I guess we're talking late this year, maybe in '23, we would expect Swiss francs -- Swiss rates to then follow that. So at that point, you'd expect to see some diminution in Swiss franc net interest income as we go back towards 0 interest rates in Swiss franc, which is obviously going to take some time. So that will clearly partly offset the U.S. dollar moves.  So U.S. dollar favorable. Clearly, we need to watch closely when the move in Swiss rates. And you understand perfectly well how the exemption thresholds work in Switzerland and in Europe, although it's slightly bigger, I think, there's a multiplier for Swiss banks, than it is for Eurozone banks.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"David, can I just go back to the lending growth because, of course, we've got -- we had kind of 2 things here.

I think that especially Middle East and in some parts of Asia, we still continue to see a big potential for a pickup in lending growth as well as in certain areas in Europe.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And the next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from BNB Paribas Exane.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee',\n","    'text': \"A couple of questions on costs, please, and the change in the guidance. So firstly, are there any unexpected elements in the deferred comp cost increasing? And if so, just could you talk us through what those unexpected bits are?  And then the second question is, does this changing dynamic have any impact on your investment plans either in '22 or '23 or '24 as you try to manage to the existing cost target?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Well, I think that's a very good question, Jeremy. And I wanted to be very open around the comp plan. I think historically we said wait until the comp pool comes out in a month's time. And we thought it would be more useful given the complexity this year to actually give the slides.  So just to recap, I think you can -- saw that we did have a very difficult balance to actually walk in terms of the compensation pool, particularly given the losses that our shareholders suffered in respect of the issues last year. So that was behind the decision to reduce the variable compensation pool by 32% to CHF2 billion.  But I think there's 2 factors then to keep in mind. Firstly, and this was something that we agreed on and also discussed with our regulators, we did pay those instruments with a number of deferred cash instruments, as I think has been widely reported. And secondly, I think as part of the implementation of the strategic plan from '22 to '24, we did also provide our Managing Directors and Directors with this strategic delivery award totaling just under CHF500 million, which is a cliff vesting instrument. That cliff vesting instrument, as you know, Jeremy, doesn't mean that the cost comes in '24. It's actually time weighted under U.S. GAAP. And we'd expect probably just under around 50% of that to actually flow through in '22. So that's half of the increase.  The other half of the increase reflects a decision which we've made to actually move to lower levels of deferral in 2023 than the past. So that's basically the driver of that increase in our guidance from CHF500 million to CHF1 billion in terms of the normalization of the compensation program.  Absent that, there's nothing else that you should be focused on. We obviously are very pleased to have now signed the procurement outsourcing transaction with Chain IQ. There's a number of other strategic cost measures we're actually pushing through, which I discussed in more detail back in November, so we're pushing hard on that. And certainly, driving efficiency from the new structure is a core focus for the Executive Board of Credit Suisse. And I think we would look to outperform against what we said before.  But I think in the context of the compensation moves, I wanted to be very explicit that essentially, I think we will be at the top end of our guidance for 2022. But also, as I said before, that I'm not changing our guidance for '23 and '24.  I think on investment spending, I mean, I think, look, I think we're very committed to our core expansion plans in Wealth and for that matter, in the Investment Bank, too. But honestly, as you move forward over time, some things become more attractive and some things become less attractive.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And the next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous Research.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Stefan Stalmann',\n","    'text': \"They actually center around the situation at the bank, the solvency situation. Last time, I think you mentioned that you would need to generate about CHF6 billion of capital through 2027 -- end of 2027 given the current risk-weighted asset increases baked into the situation at the bank.  Given what has happened in the fourth quarter with the impairment and the change to the regulatory treatment of participation values, where would you say the CHF6 billion number roughly stands now, please?  And the second question related to this is -- have there been already material repatriations of capital or special dividends out of the subsidiaries of the bank into the bank in the fourth quarter? Or is that all still coming? And if it's still coming, it seems that something is holding up the process. I thought you were expecting substantial repatriations already in 2021. Could you maybe add a little bit of color around that, please?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Look, I think we obviously discussed this in some detail back in November. And I think in light of that, we obviously wanted to just give an update on where we stood at this particular point.  To your specific question, the CHF6 billion increase I said before, which is the gap to achieve a 12% target ratio with the full phase-in of the step-up in RWA weightings by '28, is that CHF6 billion number, it's about CHF9 billion at this point for 2028, assuming no change in the valuation of the subsidiaries. I mean, I think, Stefan, a sort of unspoken question, which I'll answer anyway really is why did we see this rate reduction in the valuation of the subsidiaries, which we also touched on in the earnings release, you'll see in there as well, is that was a reduction in the regulatory filter that FINMA imposed, really following a review of the value subsidiaries post Archegos and clearly also post the strategic review. So it was applied at the end of December, basically, and that's what led to this reduction in the parent ratio to 11.7% at the end of December. And as I said, 11.4%, including the phase-in from the 1st of January. So that's the context. And in terms of that look through to '28, that would mean the GAAP increases from CHF6 billion to CHF9 billion.  Now in terms of the timing of capital repatriations dividends, that there's been no change is the answer. I mean, we expected to receive a significant dividend from CSH USA at the end of last year in December, and we actually received that dividend. But that was in the plan, which I discussed on the 4th of November. We are expecting to see some very substantial numbers in 2022, which was part of the planning.  Just in order, most notably, we have completed the decommissioning of Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited, which is the sister entity of CSI. That is now a nonmaterial legal entity. So -- and it has significant trapped capital in it. So that's obviously quite a complex program to go through as we actually do that. And that's something we'll obviously be in discussion with the U.K. regulators about during the course of this year.  Secondly, of course, we will expect to see further dividend from the U.S. I'm not going to comment, but it's probably somewhat material in terms of these numbers.  And then finally, we will receive, I won't expect, the normal dividend from Credit Suisse Schweiz, and then there's obviously other smaller numbers as well in the total of that.  I think in timing of that, basically, obviously, the Credit Suisse Schweiz dividend would come in first. And we would expect the U.S. dividend to come in towards later in the year and the restructuring of CECL, which I've talked about before, clearly would be subject to regulatory approval later on this year. So come way, I guess, somewhere during the year, but I'm not going to give an exact date.  But those plans are all the same as they were before, Stefan. I think the change for the 4th of November was that point I made before about the FINMA's decision to reduce the value of the regulatory filter as a consequence of the numbers of last year.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And the next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': \"If I could ask one follow-up to David and then one broader question to Thomas. First on the follow-up to David, turning back to Jeremy's question, I think you said that of the CHF500 million increase in compensation in 2022, about half is due to the amortization structure on that CHF497 million one-off award.  Two parts. First is, can you just reiterate what the second half of the increase in compensation relates to? And with regard to that one-off award, how does the amortization structure then play out over 2023 and 2024 as well, please?  My broader question to Thomas would be on Slide 34, where you talk about 2 real aims accelerating the revenue momentum and strengthening the risk culture. Do you think those 2 things go hand in hand? And the reason I ask is usually we hear from companies saying, we're going to take on a bit more risk to accelerate our revenue momentum or alternatively taking down risk levels, but perhaps moving to a higher payout ratio or something along those lines. The 2 things that you are flagging sound almost slightly contradictory. So interested in your broad thoughts on how you can achieve both at the same time.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"First, your first question. I think in terms of the deferral impact. The strategic delivery award is a 3-year cliff-vested instrument. So in other words, the Compensation Committee will assess the progress that's been made during the course of '22, '23 and '24 in terms of the achievement of the strategic goals, which does include the achievement of the risk and compliance goals. And we'll then decide what the uplift in the value is. There are certain knockout clauses as well in terms of that instrument. So that's the instrument.  In terms of the deferral treatment, as it's a 3-year cliff vest, cliff vest absent early retirement clauses, I'll come back to that, vest once -- run through the expense line under U.S. GAAP at 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. But because certain individuals would be eligible for retirement, that pushes up the recognition if they become eligible in that year.  So in practice, and it's a little bit of a complex calculation because it's population dependent, you'd expect around 50% of that CHF500 million to flow through in 2022. And then it's obviously a smaller proportion in '23 and '24. So it will be something like 50%, 30%, 20%, but it depends very much on the retirement calculations. And that's obviously different from a level vest, and I'd be very happy, Andrew, to talk to you about level vesting amortization under U.S. GAAP separate, but I won't waste everyone's time at this point, but that's how it works.  But you asked a very good point on the second question, the other half of the number, which I've given in terms of guidance. And that is that Credit Suisse has historically operated quite high levels of deferral above that of our peers in Europe. And we would like to move back to a more normal deferral table. Clearly, that doesn't change the economic cost of bonus awards over the lifetime of those bonus awards, but it does mean that more flows through in the first year of that. And I said that's about the other half of this.  Clearly, there's an important caveat on that, Andrew, which is what is the variable compensation pool in total in 2022, which is clearly indetermined at this point. And therefore, there has to be some uncertainty around that guidance. But I think it's material enough that it's worth talking about and making clear, that you understand that does push us towards the top end of our guidance range for '22. Hopefully, that's okay, but I'll be more than happy to follow up afterwards, Andrew.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Okay. And Andrew, to your second question, no, I don't think there is any contradiction to that at all. And I would like to come from 2 angles.  First of all, what we've seen really in Q4 was the result of a series of steps we've taken during the year in terms of strengthening our leadership and governance in risk management in terms of recalibrating our risk appetite and reducing our risk positions starting, obviously, within the Investment Bank and Prime Services. But across frankly, the Board also exiting certain other businesses like GTS, emerging markets, reduced oil and gas exposures and overall RWA and leverage reduction since the end of the first quarter, as we showed between 10% and 12%. And as a consequence of that, we really saw in Q4, a very low activity in new business, and that has been very much also influenced by slower markets and -- but also somewhat inward focus, I would say, of the organization as we immediately implemented the new structure -- organizational structure, which followed the strategic review that we presented on the 4th of November.  And then obviously, as a consequence of that, we are strengthening the risk culture with a much more disciplined approach around risk in both the first line and second line of defense, significant investments across risk and compliance, et cetera. And this all leads to -- or led to a real slowdown in Q4 and has now been really, I would say, embedded and has now laid the foundation for a very disciplined slow growth coming forward now in Q1 and beyond.  And maybe more conceptually, I mean, banking is about risk management. It's not about avoiding risk. It's about proper risk management, and that's really what the Executive Board and including myself, are telling all our troops. We want to have disciplined approach to risk, but we want to do new business. So that's very clear. And in that sense, we see absolutely no contradiction when we say on one side, we want to further strengthen the risk culture, but at the same time, regaining some revenue momentum.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': \"I guess just to follow up, and I understand all the points you're making. I think, the issue last year is that your employees necessarily didn't know how much risk they were able to take. And as a function of that, you've clearly seen a large downturn in revenues. Do you think with the steps that you've now put in place, there is a deep understanding across the franchise about exactly what risk tolerance levels are acceptable? And now from here, you're in a position where you can take that forward?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Absolutely. I think that has become very clear. We have recalibrated our risk appetite division by division and region by region. That broken down to country limits, to limits for each of the business areas and product areas. And we have a very clear framework on limits, and this is now very clear in the organization and fully signed up by all ExB members, both the old ExB members, but also the new ExB members. And I'm really very excited about Francesco on the Wealth Management side and Christian's collaboration together with David Wildermuth and the risk teams and compliance teams.

And secondly, we haven't heard anything from FINMA on regulatory add-ons on the holding under Basel III, so your regulatory capital.

And then the second question is regarding your PB business. You indicated 2/3 of balances have been reduced. At the Investor Day, you talked about CHF600 million of revenue loss, CHF400 million of cost from what I recall. Could you tell us where we stand at this point in terms of revenue reductions and cost reductions? And even if I adjust my numbers within the IB, both in fixed income and equities and compare them to peers, you seem to be underperforming.

And by the way, the page that, just for everyone's benefit, is Page 43 of the earnings release. So just to cover that. So essentially, -- so yes, as part of the assessment of the financial plans of the entities and particularly post the strategy review, we did revalue them by about CHF3.5 billion. And obviously, we've also taken into account in the course of the year, the adverse impact on the entities of the Archegos loss because obviously, that was actually suffered in our subsidiaries and not in the parent itself.  However, I think your point is more the application by the FINMA on a cap on the regulatory value for capital purposes. FINMA is entitled to do that under the 2017 decree to put a cap or to provide a different number then valued by us. And that was something they did do on the basis of the numbers projected forward, and they employ an external assessor to do so. I don't think you can read anything more into it than that. Clearly, that does reduce the value of the Clearly, that does reduce the value of the subsidiaries for capital purposes at the end of the year. That's the 11.7% number and then 11.4% reflects the phasing of the decree basically there afterwards.  Clearly, that does obviously provide a reason why what we've talked about before in terms of the distribution of capital being very important and why the redistribution of capital within the bank is also important, too, which is really comes back to what I said to Stefan earlier, which is clearly, Credit Suisse Schweiz has been a regular source of dividends over the years. But essentially, we obviously need all of our subsidiaries to pay capital back to the parent, basically, and that's a critical process. And incidentally, by the way we have been very successful in terms of that.  I think go back to the comment that I made back at in the fourth, I think we've seen about GBP 12 billion of dividends and about EUR 12 billion of capital flowing back into the parent over the last 3 or 4 years. But it is obviously important that we complete that during the course of the current year. And as I said, in order of importance, it is the CECL, which is now a nonmaterial legal entity and has quite substantial capital balances. I think you can dig out the accounts and see them, but the order of CHF6 billion to CHF8 billion depending on how much we need for the dormant activities. And then obviously, the U.S. numbers and then Credit Suisse Schweiz, which, as I said before, has been a consistent dividend payer since it was formed back at the end of 2016.

So as we said, 2/3 of the balances have been reduced. And in terms of your related question on market share development and how we see it also into the Q1 and '22, I would say the following. First of all, if you take the full year, I think our market shares and relative performance market shares and relative performance versus our peers was, I think, very strong in SP and more broadly in credit. Left in equity capital markets, M&A was very solid. But clearly, on the GTS side and within that, some of the macro and FX businesses probably underperformed.  And then there is obviously the whole equities business where starting from the second quarter, we have not only reduced our prime balances, but also had some negative effect on cash equities. We had a very strong performance in equity derivatives for the full year. And I would say equity capital markets was obviously strong for a long time up to, I would say, second, third quarter in IPOs. But then clearly, fourth quarter, the SPAC -- or I would say, second half, the SPAC activity really slowed down quite markedly. And as a consequence, on a year-on-year comparison, the fourth quarter to fourth quarter last year or fourth quarter '20 was clearly an underperformance because of the lower SPAC activity.  So going forward, I think we are very well positioned in credit in SP as well as in M&A and where we continue to invest. LevFin, we do think that we are also very well positioned. But with the higher interest rates coming, we think that there will be some slowdown in financing and LevFin activity. And otherwise, in equities, we continue to invest in our technology and AES business as well as in equity derivatives, where we continue to see a good momentum.  So that's how I would say we are developing in terms of investments and market shares. Anything you would like to add, David?

But still want to double check given we are at inflationary times, you want to hire more people and ideally, revenues grow. So maybe you can speak about the '23, '24 measures a bit more. Why you're not, so to say, further increasing when you're already at the upper end of the cost range this year?  And then secondly, you mentioned the Relationship Manager hiring APAC but it was good, IWM is down.

So Thomas, I'll take the first question?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein', 'text': 'Yes.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Well, look, I think, firstly, in terms of the expense guidance, I think there's nothing much I'd add to what you said, Benjamin, around 2022. And we've obviously covered CV in some detail.  In terms of '23 and '24, I just cast your mind back to the Investor Day. And we did include the same numbers on Slide 27, which is the structural cost measures we're pushing through. It's just the nature of these reorganizations that you don't see that much of the benefit in the first year. The prime benefits in terms of the cost reductions will only really start to flow through later this year as we actually complete the transition of our clients off the platform. Until then, we need to maintain that platform for the benefit of our clients whilst they're finishing it.  Equally, the procurement savings coming from the Chain IQ deal, yes, they start this year because the whole relationship goes live later this quarter. But they only actually build up over time, and they continue to accrete in '23 and '24 as we actually move forward. I think beyond that, and I think we obviously will give updates later this year. But I think it will be very important to talk about the benefits we expect from the centralization of IT and some of the other organizational measures, all of which really only flow through in '23 and '24 from a materiality point of view.  And if you look back what we said, we're talking here about structural cost saves of CHF1 billion to CHF1.5 billion by '24, of which CHF300 million comes through only in this year. So that's, as you might say, is the mathematical underpinning or the result of that basically. So I think that's why we can make this comment that I think we are going to see pressure in '22 as a consequence of the CV effect from the deferred compensation awards and the normalization of CV. But there afterwards, basically, I think we are reiterating our guidance for '23 and '24.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"So the Relationship Manager hiring, as you know, our plan is for the next 3 years, about 500. That's about 170 per year. And if you look at what we did last year in APAC, that gives you an indication roughly where we think regionally, we will continue to grow in our plan. So 40% to 50% in APAC, about 25% to 30% in the former IWM regions, that is Middle East, that's Europe, that's Latin America and the rest in Switzerland.  Now clearly, the slowdown that we have seen in the last few months in Asia will probably mean that the growth in 2022 in terms of hiring, we'll have to look at and we have to see how the market will further develop. And I cannot exclude that we will be a bit more flexible about the hiring in that region in 2022. But the plan is a 3-year plan. It's a long-term plan. And we'll have to see how China and the rest of Asia will develop over the next few months, and we will adapt accordingly.

And then sorry, just very briefly on the parent bank again. David, could you give us the fully loaded ratio versus the 11.4%, is that still above 10% or now a little bit below that? And in that context, the Archegos add-on CHF1.9 billion, 70 bps more or less at the group level. Is that also relevant for the parent? I guess the domestic add-on for mortgages is not because that's in the Swiss entity.

So the risk review is separate from the supply chain funds and also from Archegos. So as part of the work we went through over the 9 months, I would say, since April to the end of the year under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee, initially, that was with the former Chief Risk Officer -- sorry, the former Chair of the Risk Committee on the Board and then subsequently under the leadership of our former Chairman, we really had 3 themes that this Tactical Crisis Committee looked at. One was Archegos agreed across, one was supply chain funds and agreed across and the third one was the risk review. And the risk review was really a very systematic review of all balance sheet items and off-balance sheet items. It was really a very detailed analysis so to speak, vertically through the balance sheet and -- but then also looking at each of the divisions and regions, looking at special themes, special businesses, whether it was in Investment Banking, whether it was in Corporate Banking, whether it was Level 3 assets, et cetera.  So this -- these 3 themes really were part of our work that we went through with the Tactical Crisis Committee week-by-week in the first phase and then every second week thereafter. So the risk review was really separate from the supply chain fund. And all 3 have essentially been completed.  As we said already earlier, the Archegos -- with the Archegos report coming out, the Paul, Weiss report at the time, then the risk review was completed in the fourth quarter, and we have now also completed the review by the Board with respect to the report on the supply chain finance fund, which was commissioned to Deloitte and a Swiss law firm. So all 3 themes have really been completed. And from that perspective, also the Tactical Crisis committee is now essentially being phased out. David, the parent?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Yes. On the second point, I mean, I think this is the other -- so as I said in answer to Stefan's question before, the look through capital required to be accumulated in the parent by '28 has increased from CHF6 billion to CHF9 billion. That means the equivalent look-through ratio is, I think, somewhere between 9.5% and 9.6% actually, Daniele. So that's the look-through ratio as of now, basically, in terms of that, so just below the 10% level. Clearly, it's the transitional ratio, which is the 11.7% and 11.4%, which is relevant in terms of the capital measures.  I think your second question then was around the Pillar 2 add-on in respect of Greensill supply chain funds. That was, as I said, applied originally by FINMA to the parent. It's still sitting there as well as the group. So that for them means you still got a 60 basis point increase against the 10% minimum for the parent, again, on a transitional basis for that, basically, that's still sitting there. And I think at some point, that will have to be decided where it sits within the legal entity structure, but it's still sitting there at this particular moment.  In terms of your third point, which is around the Tactical cyclical add-on, which the Swiss National Bank has decided to reimpose with effect from September, you're absolutely correct. Because there's de minimis residential mortgages booked in the parent, it has a minute impact of 0.2 basis points to be exact of the [indiscernible] cyclical add-on, whereas the [indiscernible] cyclical add-on for the group is about 24 basis points. And obviously, for CS Schweiz, it's obviously considerably more than that because that's what actually sits, but it does -- it doesn't affect the parent requirements.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And the next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim from Societe Generale.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Lim',\n","    'text': \"You said quite little about the litigation that you incurred.

What we've seen, obviously, with this volatility is a pickup in terms of some of the sort of trading lines, the stronger performance by GTS and obviously, a stronger performance by equity derivatives, which is exactly what you expect in the circumstances.

And is there any kind of cost inflation underlying that, that we should think about also?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Perhaps to start on the cost point first. I think what we're referring to there is additional investments that we're actually making across the bank. I mean clearly, if we're talking about our total investment spend, we're obviously talking more around CHF3 billion in terms of IT, for example, each year. So that's the additional investments we expect to coming through the expense line. Because as you know, certain investments are capitalized and then amortized. So that's the guidance, as you might say, to how much the cost run rate we'll incur as a consequence. I mean, and we are very focused on driving cost efficiency across our existing infrastructure and therefore, releasing reserves and resources for that investment program. So there's very much a bifurcation how we think about costs between these 2 components and these 2 elements. But it's obviously, we didn't -- we obviously invest more than CHF700 million every year, so you should see that as the margin or incremental investment spend. And that does include expenditure on risk and control initiatives as well, just to be clear.  I think in terms of the capital point, I think, clearly, from a group point of view, I mean, I'd just repeat what we said back on the 4th of November, I think 2021 was a challenging and difficult year for us. And clearly, for our shareholders and for our clients, too. And I think we feel it is only appropriate to operate at a ratio above 14% and around 4.5% on leverage ratio because I think we have to be seen as unquestioned in terms of our capital position, and that's very much our capital strategy.  Quite clearly, we've outlined the plan to actually reinvest. So we're obviously reducing capital investment bank by CHF3 billion, of which CHF2 billion has already been accomplished, obviously largely through the exit at the majority of prime. That does release reserves for the Wealth Management businesses. But I think we were very clear back on the 4th of November that we would expect that to be delivered in a measured and balanced way compatible with our risk appetite and risk goals. So it's not all going to come out and we're going to go back in again. That would not be. But clearly, we do have capacity to support that Wealth Management growth provided it meets our risk criteria.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Adam Terelak',\n","    'text': \"And underlying cost inflation in the '22 cost then?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Yes, I mean, yes, and so forth, we've got 6.6, I think, of our expected methodology just under half is off risk. So that will absorb some capital, and that's obviously primarily at the group level.  Our cost inflation, we're watching it closely. I wouldn't -- I think we're obviously conscious of what's going on out there in terms of the movement in inflation. I think it's reflected properly in our cost guidance, I think is the best way of summing that. I think there's plenty of things we can do. I think the Chain IQ deal is a very good deal and it's -- let's be clear, it's something we should have done before. So there is potential. And I think there are other things we can do as well.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And the next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen from Royal Bank of Canada.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Anke Reingen',\n","    'text': \"The first is coming back to the Investment Bank and what you described a more normalization of the environment.

Or should we expect a further step up in the next quarter?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Maybe I'll kick off with the first question, and then David will do the second question. I mean 2021 saw clearly a very elevated Investment Banking activities in -- across the board, frankly. But in particular, in areas such as equity capital markets, IPOs, SPACs but also in other areas like SP, credit and LevFin. Some of this will probably more normalize now in 2022 on the other side. So other areas like FX, where we have clearly more volatility, which is a good thing, I guess, for our business. And the same is true for some other GTS businesses we have. And equity derivatives, we think, will continue to be a source of opportunity in these volatile markets. So that's an area where we had already very strong results in '21, and we continue to see a good opportunity there. And then there are certain macro businesses that will probably also benefit from more volatile markets around interest rate hikes. So -- but clearly, compared to '21, overall Investment Banking revenues to the Street will normalize more to -- toward 2020 and '19 levels.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"I think on the fee waiver program, Anke, I think, firstly, I think interest in this has been high and I think take-up amongst the clients has been high as well. As we said, the -- we saw an adverse impact on revenues of about CHF28 million in the fourth quarter, the majority of which was in respect of IWM.  Just to be helpful, I don't think you should take CHF28 million and multiply it by 4 for '22, that would not be correct. I would expect the number probably somewhere between, say, CHF50 million and CHF100 million, maybe let's pick CHF75 million at that, difficult to be exact. And that's mainly because, of course, as clients' losses or potential losses in respect of the SCF fund are actually absorbed, obviously, the program becomes irrelevant at that point.  And that's clearly very good because I think it is good to see the take-up. It does, obviously, I think, demonstrate our support for clients, and this is very important in respect to this matter. But clearly, essentially, it's also resolving this issue, which I think is actually important in terms of that. So I think -- and then clearly, one would expect the number to be less in '23 and '24, I think that hopefully helps.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'And the next question comes from the line of Piers Brown from HSBC.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Piers Brown',\n","    'text': \"I've just got a couple of -- that are actually just detailed number of questions. But first of all, on Wealth Management net loans, you gave a number on Slide 9 of CHF203 billion at the end of Q4. Can you -- have you got the number for the end of Q3 because there was a figure of CHF184 million given that the 9-month stage in the November Investor Day pack, which just seems a very large quarter-on-quarter increase. So maybe that's not like-for-like. So if you could just give us the corresponding Q3 number that relates to that CHF203 billion that you've shown for the fourth quarter?  And the second question is just on the distribution guidance for 2022 that you gave back in November of 25%.

In terms of distribution, yes, we're not changing what we said on the 4th of November. As you know, the Board of Directors recommends to shareholders a CHF0.10 dividend in respect to 2021, which is unchanged from the lowered level in respect to 2020. And we certainly confirm our guidance of 25% of net income for 2022. So no change from what we've said previously.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator', 'text': 'Thank you.

Welcome, and thank you for joining Credit Suisse Group's First Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call for Analysts and Investors. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is recorded. [Operator Instructions] 00:32 I will now turn the conference over to Kinner Lakhani, Head of Investor Relations and Group Strategy and Development. Please go ahead, Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: 00:48 Thank you, operator. Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to the forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse first quarter 2022 earnings release, published this morning. 1:14 Let me remind you that our first quarter 2022 financial report and the accompanying financial statements for the period will be published on or around May 5. 01:25 I will now hand over to our Group CEO Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO David Mathers, who will run you through the numbers.\\nThomas Gottstein: 01:35 Thank you, Kinner. And thank you all for joining our first quarter 2022 results presentation. We greatly appreciate your participation and engagement. 01:45 Let me begin by addressing the broader economic and geopolitical environment. Financial markets enter 2022 dealing with some of the highest inflation rates in a generation, putting significant pressure on central banks and weighing on the purchasing power of many of our fellow citizens. In addition, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. 02:13 Credit Suisse and its employees would like to express our sympathy and support towards the Ukrainian people as we continue to show our solidarity through support for aid groups and other organizations. The Ukrainian crisis has also had a significant impact on the global economy, financial markets and many businesses, including our own, during the first quarter, as you will have seen in the reports from many of our global peers. 02:45 As I've have said previously, in the context of our long-term strategic plan, the year 2022 is one of transition for us at Credit Suisse. We are determined to continue with the implementation of our strategy as announced in November last year and remain focused on refining and reinvigorating our franchise consistent with our approved risk appetite. 03:14 The financial performance in the first quarter of 2022 highlights our work in progress and what more we need to do. As we disclosed last week, we reported a loss in the first quarter. This was partly a consequence of our decision to increase provisions relating to developments in a number of previously disclosed legacy legal matters. This is in line with our proactive approach to resolving legacy litigation matters, many of which go back more than one decade. Our results were also negatively impacted by Russia related losses of CHF206 million. 03:56 As you will see in the slides, we have already made significant concrete progress in executing our strategy across our divisions with a simplified structure that went live on January 1. Before I turn to the presentation, as you have seen today, we have announced a series of appointments to the Executive Board as well as management changes. We are delighted to welcome Francesca McDonagh as incoming CEO of the EMEA region; Edwin Low, CEO of the Asia Pacific region; and Markus Diethelm as General Counsel. They will take up their roles in the coming weeks and months. 04:38 David, who has served as Chief Financial Officer since 2010 has indicated his wish to seek alternative opportunities outside of Credit Suisse. While I have accepted his request with regret, I look forward to working with him over the coming months until a successor is found. And on a personal note, I would like to add that I’ll not only miss him as a competent CFO, but as a friend and colleague, but we still have several months to go. 05:16 I would also like to thank Romeo and Helman for their service to bank over the many years. And I'm very pleased that Helman will serve as Senior Adviser to me, focusing on the core clients around the APAC region, as well as serving on our Asia Advisory Council. The determined delivery of our strategy over the coming quarters is the absolute focus of the Board of Directors, the Executive Board and all our employees. 05:45 With that, let me turn to the slides, starting with our key messages from the first quarter on Slide four. We recorded CHF0.4 billion pre-tax loss in the first quarter. As our reported results were negatively impacted by CHF0.7 billion of legal provisions, a CHF0.2 billion Russia related losses and by CHF0.4 billion market value losses related to our old fund stake. These were offset somewhat by real estate gains and the net release of provision for credit losses. 06:26 On an adjusted basis, we reported pre-tax income of CHF0.3 billion. Overall, we saw net revenues decline year-on-year, mainly due to a particularly strong comparable in the first quarter of 2021, especially in the Investment Bank and Wealth Management. We also experienced significant industry wide headwinds in the form of more challenging market conditions due to higher inflation and interest rates as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine impacting a number of our businesses. 07:00 In the first quarter, we reduced our Russia related net credit exposure by 56% and we continue to make further progress in exposure reductions. David will discuss this in greater detail later. We have continued to run our businesses with a strong capital base. Our CET1 ratio was 13.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 12.2% in the same period as one year earlier. Our CET1 leverage ratio was 4.3% also up from prior year levels. We stand by our medium term guidance of CET1 ratio of at least 14% pre-Basel III reforms and a CET1 leverage ratio of around 4.5%. 07:46 While our performance has been impacted by significant headwinds, our focus remains on executing the strategy we set out in November 2021. I will go into details a bit later. But as you can see from the middle of the slide, we have made considerable progress on key aspects of our integrated strategy. Regarding risk, the strengthening of both our first and second lines of defense are on track. We are confident that our strengthened risk culture should help us build a stronger and customer-centric bank that puts risk management at the core to deliver sustainable growth and value for investors, clients and colleagues. 08:30 Next slide, please. Here you see some of the factors affecting our reported and adjusted results in the quarter. Our adjusted results were characterized by recent client activity and capital markets issuance in volatile market conditions. They also -- sorry, by reduced client activity and capital market. They also reflect the cumulative reduction in risk appetite in 2021, the impact of the flattening yield curve on corporate center treasury results and increased cash accruals for compensation, due to the normalized deferral level. 09:10 Let me turn now to the divisional breakdown. Next slide, please. In terms of adjusted pre-tax income and net revenues, Wealth Management had a challenging start to the year. With adjusted PTI adversely impacted by lower transaction activity and further reduced lending volumes. The results were also impacted by Russia related effects and APAC Financing Group mark-to-market losses, which combined were approximately CHF130 million. Still, we increased investments, including in talent and saw positive net new assets across regions, reflecting our client franchise strength. 09:55 Our Investment Bank results were impacted by our continued efforts toward our planned exit from Prime Services, the slowdown in capital markets, as well as the Russia related impact on our GTS results. It is important to remember that our franchise mix, which particularly benefited us in the first quarter of 2021 was less supportive in the recent environment, given our much more limited exposure to macro and commodity sectors that performed particularly well in the first quarter. 10:28 Despite this effect, the IB posted solid performances across equity derivatives, securitized products and M&A. The advisory pipeline was up quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year. Our Swiss Bank had a good performance with stable net revenues from higher recurring commissions and fees and strong net new assets from the institutional client business. Asset management had lower pre-tax income and softer revenues due to the market environment and reduced activity levels. However, recurring management fees were broadly stable with higher investment and partnership income. 11:11 Next slide, please. We made a number of decisive actions throughout 2021 to strengthen risk and compliance teams, systems and processes. As you know, we underwent a comprehensive risk review across the entire group, which was completed in the fourth quarter. Our derisking measures have improved our risk profile, but also have negatively impacted our topline in the short term. For example, the derisking measures in Wealth Management that you see on the left of the slide led to a reduction of roughly CHF25 million in net revenues during the first quarter. 11:53 In the Investment Bank, the derisking led to approximately CHF250 million in reduced revenues. Notwithstanding the expected impact from our planned exit from the remaining part of Prime, our growth ambitions are fully aligned with our risk appetite. Strengthening risk management and addressing legacy issues remain a focus even as we implement our growth strategy. Here you see selected updates of our progress on risk and compliance topics and our proactive approach to resolving litigation cases, whether by settlements or dismissal which you can see on the right side of this page. 12:37 Next slide, please. We are focused on refining and reinvigorating our franchise in order to drive forward our vision for Credit Suisse. We are convinced, it is the right strategy even in the midst of volatile markets and economic conditions which are challenging. Please allow me to give you just a few examples of our determined execution of this strategy. We have achieved $2.5 billion reduction in allocated capital in Investment Bank since the fourth quarter of 2020, which amounts to over 80% of our more than $3 billion ambition. 13:19 We launched an outsourcing agreement on April 1, 2022 to generate procurement savings and aim to step up synergies from unified, operating platforms and technology platforms, and the divisions in the coming quarters. This should help us meet our ambition of CHF1 billion to CHF1.5 billion, in structural cost savings per annum by 2024 to invest in our growth ambitions. 13:49 In Wealth Management and Private Banking Switzerland, we achieved mandate penetration of approximately 33% in the first quarter near our 33% to 35% ambition. In the Investment Bank, we reached an 84% reduction in Prime balances since the first quarter of 2021, with our goal of a full Prime services exit by the end of 2022 at the latest, which should allow us to generate significant cost savings. We added approximately 50 managing directors in the Investment Bank, underscoring our commitments to attract talent. In our Swiss Bank, we reached 125,000 clients for our digital offering CSX, as of the first quarter 2022 with an ambition to reach 200,000 by year end. 14:44 Let me discuss each division in more detail. Starting with Wealth Management on Page 10. We aim to progressively deploy resources in Wealth Management under the new divisional leadership of Francesco De Ferrari to accelerate growth. We have made meaningful progress in laying the foundations for integrated wealth management and defined and initiated 10 execution priorities that reflect the changing geopolitical climate. These include client segments, priority markets, products and solutions, simplification and people. 15:27 We have also started execution on our initiative roadmap. Examples, include the exit of private banking activities in Sub-Sahara Africa markets, excluding South Africa and accelerated digital outreach in the core high net worth individual segment. We invested in 50 relationship managers net, mainly in Asia Pacific, Switzerland and EMEA. I would also point out that higher U.S. dollar interest rates should provide benefits to the bank through incremental net interest income of an estimated CHF550 million through 200 -- sorry, through 2023, which David will address later. 16:13 As with each of our divisional slides, you can see our key medium term ambitions at the bottom of the page, which remain unchanged. Let me turn to the investment back. Christian Meissner and his team have made continued progress reshaping the Investment Bank. And on this page, you see some of our specific actions. We have released capital from Prime and derisk the franchise. We had increased connectivity to wealth management in GTS to build a global franchise. We are investing in the capital-light investment banking and capital markets business. In the first quarter, we grew market share in both EMEA and APAC with top five market positions in both. We are driving growth in our market leading credit and securitized products businesses. 17:07 Slide 12. On the Health & Stein Swiss business has been a resounding success and is an anchor for our transformative agenda. The division continues to focus on growing our market leading mid and up market franchises in private, corporate and institutional banking. We have seen strong growth in our digital offering, notably CSX, and we are simplifying and digitalizing front-to- back processes. We are well positioned to capitalize on the post-COVID normalization in credit cards, FX and in leasing. 17:46 Next page, please. Under the leadership of Ulrich Korner, we have also made solid progress, executing our ambitious strategy in Asset Management with a focus on talent and technology. We have strengthened and simplified the organization with a number of key leadership hires. We joined the net zero Asset Managers initiative, underscoring the manner in which our group wide sustainability strategy is embedded across divisions, including Asset Management and we have strengthened risk management and our control environment. 18:25 Next slide, please. Our investments in technology are a significant focus of our ambition to simplify our business model, drive digitalization and maximize our client experience. We have started implementing the engineering strategy in our recently established Chief Technology and Operations organization under the leadership of Joanne Hannaford. We recently announced the CTOO organization and leadership team and are focusing on agility, digital transformation, and productivity across our three group strategic pillars. Many of the underlying efforts have started and are progressing well. 19:13 Next slide, please. Credit Suisse continues to emphasize the importance of sustainability as a core element to our value proposition for our clients, shareholders, employees and society as a whole. We made significant progress executing our five pillar strategy in 2021 and many of our objectives and achievements are outlined in our 2021 Sustainability Report. 19:44 Let me outline some of our achievements here. We reached sustainable assets under management of CHF144 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from CHF118 billion in the first quarter of 2021. We also increased sustainable AUM penetration as a share of total assets under management. We are proud to have earned the Sustainability Bond of the Year Serving Award for our role as sole structure and the ranger of the blue bond for the Nature Conservancy. 20:19 And on the right side of this page, you see our progress and our way forward. Emma Crystal, our new Chief Sustainability Officer, is driving these efforts in close collaboration with all four businesses. We remain committed to supporting our clients’ transition and expanding our sustainable investment and financing offering as we make further progress toward our ambition of providing at least CHF300 billion in sustainable financing by 2030. 20:53 I would now like to hand over to David, who will go over our results in more detail.\\nDavid Mathers: 21:01 Thank you very much, Thomas, and good morning to everybody. So I'd like to go through the key financials and provide some more details on our performance at the group and at the divisional level. Just to be clear, this is of course, the first time that we're presenting these numbers under the new divisional structure, which took effect from the January 1st 2022. 21:22 Now before I turn to the numbers, I’d just like to make a few introductory points. You'll recall that last week, on April 20th, we issued a trading update, which flagged an increase to our legal provisions of approximately CHF600 million in relation to the developments in a number of previously disclosed matters, all of which originated more than a decade ago. We also highlighted the negative impact of over CHF200 million relating to the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now in the adjusted numbers, we well as usual, exclude all the major litigation provisions, but to clear, we are not excluding the Russian-related impact in the adjusted definition. 22:09 Second, I'd like to make a broader point on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now, whilst the tragic humanitarian aspect this conflict remain, of course, front of mind, the disruption to financial markets, as well as the breadth and the depth of the sanctions introduced by the Swiss, UK, European and U.S. authorities in response to this have also been significant. In keeping our peers, therefore, I will be providing further detail on the impact this has had within our different business lines in the first quarter. 22:41 Third, I’d just note that as we continue to execute on the strategic plan with the investment spending, internal reorganization and the capital reallocation associated with this, our risk appetite and our risk management remain key focuses. Now this combines clearly with a period of reduced risk appetite and lower activity from our clients. The overall impact to which has been a decline in revenues across our major business lines. 23:12 Now as I'm sure you know, the first quarter of ’21 was particularly strong in terms of our underlying performance that is excluding the Archegos charge and the comparison to this quarter's figures should be seen in that context. 23:27 Let me just start then with a Group -- a summary of the Group's results, and let me first remind you of the three significant items the quarter, that we highlighted in last week statement. First, since the listing of all funds, in April of last year, we have seen and continue to see mark to market volatility in the stock market price of this publicly listed entity. Of which as you know, we own about 8.6%. In the first quarter, we booked a loss of CHF353 million as a consequence of the fall in all fund share price during the first quarter. 24:09 As you will note, we listed this risk in our 2021 annual report, which we published last month. I would remind you though, that this has been and remains a successful transaction and that Credit Suisse has to the end of March 2022 booked a cumulative of gain of CHF971 million, even including the loss in the first quarter. 24:36 Second, we booked gains of CHF164 million in the quarter as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio. And third, our provision for credit losses includes a release relating to Archegos of CHF155 million. You may remember that we recorded a similar net gain relating to the Archegos exposure of CHF235 million in the third quarter of last year, and we clearly continue to seek further recoveries from these states. 25:11 Now going through the key reported figures then, our net revenues were CHF4.41 billion, 42% lower year-on-year. With declines across Wealth Management, the investment bank and asset management offset to a degree by the resilient performance in Swiss Bank. With regards to the provision for credit losses, we had a net release of CHF110 million, driven by the Archegos related release of CHF155 million that I've already mentioned, but offset clearly, by new provisions of CHF58 million relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 25:52 However, the increases in litigation provisions that mentioned, which took the total to CHF703 million to quarter, contributed to a 26% increase in reported operating expenses, totaling CHF4.95 billion. That means we reported a pretax tax loss for the quarter of CHF428 million, compared to the reported pretax tax loss of CHF757 million in the first quarter of 2021. 26:24 Now on an adjusted basis, that is excluding all funds and the real estate gains, the Archegos release, net litigation provisions and certain other items. We delivered a pretax income of CHF300 million. If you were to exclude the Russia related impact, that would have equated to an adjusted pretax income of CHF506 million. 26:50 Now just a brief point on operating expenses, one recurring theme that you'll notice as we go through the materials is around the normalization of our compensation deferral levels and a consequent increase in cash accruals, compared to last year. And I'll give some more details on this shortly. 27:09 Before we get to that, let me give you some more details on the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and what has had on our first quarter performance. Now you remember that we did give some disclosures on this with the publication of our annual report on March 10th and we provided a further update since then. Just to summarize that, on March 10th, we said that our 2021 credit risk exposure was CHF1.57 billion gross, and CHF848 million net. We've reduced these figures significantly in the first quarter with net credit exposure at the end of the first quarter standing at CHF373 million, that's about 56% lower than the end of 2021. 27:56 Now if we consider the impact these events on our P&L in the first quarter, there are three broad themes. First, we were generally successful in reducing our exposure before the envasion, but we did see some defaults on amounts owed to us by Russian counterparties, partly due to the imposition of the sanctions and certain other developments. 28:19 Second, we took a limits demand of specific credit provisions across the bank. And third, a scenario review of the provision for credit losses led us to increase our non-specific provisions that is related to CECL accounting by CHF44 million. Overall, we saw a negative impact of CHF206 million on pretax income with respect to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter, comprising CHF58 million in the provisions for credit losses and CHF148 million of trading and fair value losses. Just to be clear that was split across the divisions as follows: CHF99 million in Wealth Management; $101 in the Investment bank and CHF14 million in the Swiss Bank. 29:12 Now more broadly, in terms of the Wealth Management's divisions, exposure to Russia, I think you will recall that at the Morgan Stanley Financials’ Conference last month, Thomas confirmed that about 4% of our assets under management was linked to Russian clients globally. And just to say that number has not changed significantly since then. 29:33 In terms of our general position, with respect to Russia. Clearly, we've stopped pursuing any new client business in Russia, we continue to reduce our exposure to Russia as the figures that I've just given demonstrate. We're helping our clients to unwind their own exposure and we have moved roles out of Russia. I would make it clear that we're making no new investments in our Russian subsidiaries. And have not done so since the invasion on February 24th. And I'd reiterate that as a matter of principle and policy Credit Suisse applies international sanctions worldwide in particular, those issued by Switzerland, the European Union, the UK and United States. 30:19 Let's turn to expenses now. As I said at the end of the fourth quarter, and I just reiterate now, we're guiding for adjusted operating expenses for 2022 to be around CHF17 billion. The 9% increase that we see in the adjusted operating expenses, compared to the first quarter of last year is primarily driven by two factors. First, the increased cash accruals for compensation, due to the normalization deferral rates that I referred to earlier. As you remember, as part of our response to the Archegos, and to the supply chain finance matters last year, we both reduced variable compensation overall and increased the amount deferred, thereby reducing the cash component and increasing the amount carried forward to future years. 31:13 We do not believe this is sustainable over the long-term, believe it does to a buildup in future compensation liabilities. And so we decided as we highlighted at our fourth quarter results in February, that we’re going to revert to a deferral table in line with out of our European peers for the current year. For the first quarter, all these changes had the impact of increasing compensation costs by CHF214 million overall, and that's in line with the guidance that I gave that we should expect an increase in compensation costs for the year of about CHF1 billion. 31:53 Now just to be clear, I'd stress that at this early stage in the year, we're not forecasting a change in the economic value of the awards. This reflects the change in the deferral tables. Now, the second factor driving the year-on-year increases in expenses is incremental investments of CHF152 million in the quarter. These relate both -- these relate to our strategic priorities particularly in respect to the Wealth Management businesses together with the investments in risk and compliance remediation, and the supporting work on IT systems for -- to support our growth. 32:34 I'd expect the bulk of the savings from these investments to flow through in 2023, particularly from major projects like the reunification of the IT platforms across the bank, which should yield significant savings, which I’ll discuss in more detail at our planned investor deep dive, which I’ll talk about towards the end of my presentation. 32:57 I would add though, that we are beginning to see initial cost measures savings from other measures. For example, through the outsourcing of our procurement function to Chain IQ. This arrangement went live at the start of April, and we're on track to achieve about CHF150 million of cash savings this year. 33:20 Now just to be clear, in addition to these incremental investments we have taken restructuring expenses, which feature in the reported numbers. And that totals is about CHF79 million over the past two quarters, of which CHF46 million was in the first quarter of 2022. I'd just repeat our guidance for restructuring expenses to total about CHF400 million with a balance to be utilized over the rest of this year. 33:51 Next slide please. Now what I show here is the quarter-on-quarter decline in client business volume across Wealth Management and Private Banking Switzerland, which is 5% lower at CHF1.24 trillion. This reduction is primarily driven by market moves in the period, partly offset by net new assets of CHF4.6 billion for the quarter. The majority of which were achieved in Switzerland and in Asia Pacific, notwithstanding the deleveraging environment we see in that market. 34:23 You'll note that we allocated CHF16 billion of AUM to a align – other, that includes about CHF10 billion of assets, which have been reclassified due to the impact of the sanctions imposed in connection with Russians invasion of Ukraine early this quarter. 34:44 Let's now look at capital please. Our capital and leverage ratios remain resilient. Our CET1 capital ratio was 60 basis points lower, compared to the end of the fourth quarter at 13.8%. This drop below our ambition to be at 14% pre the start of the Bal IIIR reforms in ’24, was primarily due to internal model and parameter updates with CHF2 billion of the CHF5 billion quarter-on-quarter increase in risk weighted assets, due to operational risk excluding the related FX impact. 35:20 I would note that we did see an RWA reduction of $2 billion, due to the Prime Service Exit Investment bank with a balance to increase due to FX. Our CET1 leverage and our Tier 1 leverage ratios were both unchanged quarter-on-quarter at 4.3% and 6.1% respectively. Leverage exposure overall was down by CHF11 billion, that includes a reduction of $20 billion, due to the Prime Service Exit. This was partly offset by a seasonal increase in business activity and by the weakening of the Swiss franc against the US dollar. 36:00 I'd just like to touch briefly on the Swiss CET1 capital ratio for Credit Suisse AG, the parent company. You’ll recall that in February, I mentioned the ratio had fall at the end of last year to 11.7% and then with the phase in the transitional regime to 11.4% as of January 1st 2022. At the end of the first quarter, this ratio increased to 11.8%, due to the combination of a dividend payment from Credit Suisse wise and a capital repatriation from our US Holding company, together totaling around CHF2 billion. We continue to execute on our other dividend and capital repatriation plans for 2022. Although clearly, as we said before, these remain subject to regulatory approval and I expect the bulk to arise in the second half of the year rather than the second quarter. Just in terms of the Group CET1, I just remind you that our medium term ambition remains to operate at a CET1 ratio of least 14%, pre the Bal IIIR reforms and a CET1 leverage ratio of around 4.5%. 37:13 Let me turn briefly now and let's look at net interest income sensitivity. I did want to spend a few minutes on this particularly given the level of interest rate moves that we've seen so far this year. If you look at the current exposure to rising US dollar rates on the current forward curve, we'd expect about a CHF150 million benefit in ’22, compared to ’21. And if you look at the current forward curve again into 2023, that should equate to a further CHF400 million benefit for next year, compared to ‘22. 37:46 Now, you’ll note, and I said this before, at some point we would expect the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to increase rates. Whilst we've likely benefit overall from higher euro rates, you should remember that the increase in Swiss interest rates from the current level of minus 75 basis points would result in a drop in net interest income in the Swiss Bank at least in the initial phase. 38:16 Now, let me turn now to the overviews of the new business divisions, and we report port this as usual on an adjusted basis unless I state otherwise. And let's start please with Wealth Management. Net revenues of CHF1.51 billion was 12% higher than the fourth quarter, but 22%, compared to the strong first quarter of last year. We can see that whilst both net interest income and recurring commissions and fees, declined broadly in line with a 9% fall in client business volume at 8% and 5% respectively. Transaction based revenues fell by 38%. That reflected a substantial decline in contributions to the GTS joint ventures the Investment Bank in line with the normalization of market conditions, compared to the first quarter of 2021, as well as lower brokerage and product issuance fees. 39:12 Of this CHF360 million decline in transaction based revenues, you should note the CHF59 million was directly linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. You should also note the further weighing on the divisions performance was mark-to-market losses of CHF32 million and APAC financing, compared to last year. 39:39 In terms of expenses, these were 16% high year-on-year at CHF1.27 billion, the bulk of which was due to increased cash accruals relating to the normalization of compensation deferral levels that I’ve already mentioned. But we also made further investments in technology and risk and in compliance, as well as executing the increase in our relationship manager headcount. 40:04 Now provision for credit losses of CHF24 million, included CHF40 million are primarily non-specific provisions for expected credit losses relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. I mean, the total impact of the invasion to the divisions pretax income was CHF99 million in the first quarter. Overall pretax income was 74% lower year-on-year at CHF212 million, but we did though see net new assets of CHF4.8 billion booked in the period and that's a reversal clearly of the net asset outflows that we saw in the previous quarter. 40:45 Just let me turn now to the Investment Bank. As has been the case with our peers Investment Bank revenues was specifically lower compared to the record first quarter of last year. Though they were 11% higher than the previous quarter, that is the fourth quarter of ‘21 at $2.02 billion, that still equates to a 53% reduction year-on-year. This reflects three factors. 41:12 First, our decision to exit Prime Services, which directly resulted in a year-on-year decline in revenues of $173 million. Second, our reductions in risk appetite and in allocated capital, which contributed to lower revenues, especially in leveraged finance. And third, the market disruptions caused by Russia's invasions of Ukraine, which contributed to significantly lower ECN market activity and reduced M&A fees. Overall, Russia-related losses totaled $101 million in division, primarily due to trading the fair value losses in the GTS business. 41:53 That said our equity derivatives business, while not seeing the strength to trading in the first quarter of last year still performed well in the first three months of 2022, and our fixed income results reflected normalized securitized product revenues lower than in recent periods, but still above historic levels. 42:14 Operating expenses were 6% higher year-on-year, $2.08 billion, largely due to the increased cash accruals relating to the normalization deferral levels that I mentioned before, but also to higher Group wide technology, risk and compliance costs. The division therefore delivered an adjusted pretax loss of $55 billion against a backdrop of reduced capital usage and lower client activity across all business lines. I would note that the $174 million release in the provision for credit losses relating to Archegos, as well as real estate gains, partly offset by restructuring meant that on a reported basis our pretax income was $134 million. 43:03 Now just a brief word on capital. Risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure was down by 21% and 18%, respectively, year-on-year, primarily due to reductions in Prime Services. We've also continued to allocate capital away from the Investment Bank as per our strategy and we've now reduced capital in the division by $2.5 billion compared to the end of 2020, putting us well on track to deliver our ambition of a more than $3 billion reduction by the end of ’22. 43:37 Let’s just turn to the Swiss Bank. Now as we've already said the Swiss Bank delivered another resilient performance in the first quarter. Net revenues were stable year-on-year at just over CHF1 billion, with a 7% increase in recurring commissions and fees, supported by an improved performance in our investment in the Swiss Guard and higher levels of assets under management. And that's offset by lower net interest income and decreased transaction-based revenues. 44:07 The provision for credit losses of CHF33 million includes a Russia-related impact of CHF14 million. Operating expenses were 5% higher at CHF614 million, reflecting again the normalized level of deferrals at target investments and higher -- and again, the higher Group wide technology risk and compliance costs. Overall, pretax income was 8% lower year-on-year at CHF385 million. The division saw CHF6 billion in net new assets, albeit entirely in our institutional client business rather than wealth or private banking. 44:49 Finally, let me just turn to Asset Management. Net revenues for the division were 10% lower year-on-year at CHF359 million, 48% increase in investment and partnership income more than offset by a 52% decline in performance, transaction and placement revenues. That does include a reversal of a gain that we reported a year ago in certain SEDER (ph) funds. 45:16 Now taken together with the 15% year-on-year increase in operating expenses to CHF308 million, reflecting the increased cash accruals due to normalized compensation deferral levels, the group wide investments in risk technology and compliance and CHF15 million of costs relating to the supply chain finance matter, pretax income for the quarter was CHF51 million 62% lower year-on-year. That reflects the volatile macro environment, as well as reduced activity levels and risk appetite from clients. And I just note that we saw about CHF0.6 billion of outflows in the quarter, primarily from fixed income and credit, whilst we maintained good momentum in inflows in index solutions. 46:04 Now, just before I pass to Thomas one point which I alluded to before. We're planning on hosting an Investor Deep Dive event towards the end of the second quarter, which will give us an opportunity to talk you through the progress and the plans that we have in our risk and compliance functions, our technology function and the developments in our wealth management division. Now these parts of the Group are all headed by relatively new Executive Board Members. And so, this event will also give us the chance to introduce you more formally to David Wildermuth, Rafael Lopez Lorenzo, Jo Hannaford and Francesco De Ferrari. 46:41 And on that note, I'd like to hand back to Thomas just to conclude before we open for Q&A. Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: 46:49 Thank you, David. Allow me to conclude by reiterating our 2022 priorities that you see on this page. First is to execute with discipline the detailed Group strategy and three year financial plan, which we presented at our Investor Day on November 4. Together with my colleagues on the EXP, we share a clear commitment to implementing the new strategy of strengthening the core, simplifying the organization and investing for growth. 47:21 Second, we will continue to improve, risk and compliance with an emphasis on risk, culture. Whilst not losing our client focus and the entrepreneurial spirit that has been the hallmark of Credit Suisse since its foundation more than 165 years ago. Third, we aim to reestablish franchise momentum grounded in the positive basis for growth in our four divisions with the regional overlay and supported by a disciplined approach to costs and investments. 47:53 With that let me turn to Kinner to begin the Q&A.\\nKinner Lakhani: 48:01 We will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. May I please ask everyone to stick to a maximum of two questions please. Operator, let's open the line, please.\\nOperator: 48:17 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Your line is now open.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: 48:45 Thank you very much. Can you actually hear me well?\\nThomas Gottstein: 48:48 Yes.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: 48:49 Okay. Lovely. I've got two questions, and thank you very much for the slide seven in the presentation, which I thought was very useful. And really my first question is about exactly that. Could you give us a sense of the impact from the kind of derisking measures, but going forward in wealth, in particular, what are the milestones to the business normalization in wealth as you see it. Is it the finalization of the FINMA outstanding investigation? Is it the additional client reviews? Could you give us a sense, kind of, what does it take to see the kind of normalization of wealth business kind of going forward? 49:39 And the second one. Net new money, they have been relatively strong in the first quarter. Could you give us your sense of the quality and -- the quality of the flows in wealth, but also on the institutional Suisse side. Thank you very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: 49:59 Yeah. Thank you. Magdalena. So first of all, as you can see on Page 7 in terms of the wealth management, derisking measures, they touched really on five areas, cheap financing, exit of sub-Sahara Africa markets, then the Russia related derisking, concentration risks and client risk review. And if you look at some of the lending volumes that we have, also shown in David sections, for example, on Global Wealth Management, the reduction was quite significant in terms of lending volume. So you can see, for example, net loans are down 14% since the first quarter of ‘21, you can see that on Page 23. 50:52 And what we are really have not yet seen is a rebound of that, it's actually quite the opposite. As you can also see on Page 23, net loans went down a further CHF6 billion from the end of the fourth quarter. And this was partially impacted by Russia, and partially by deleveraging in Asia. So in terms of the milestone through the wealth management normalization you could see in our chart also on page six, for example, that the Russia and AFG impact was about CHF130 million to the adjusted PTI of CHF212 million for wealth management. 51:38 And then as you go through the second, third, fourth quarter, we clearly expect and would like to drive reversal from what we've seen over the last 12 months. Namely, a reduction of lending volumes, but also clearly a more proactive approach, generally with respect to some of the transactional revenues that are related to larger transactions for our ultra-high net worth clients. So step-by-step over the next few quarters, we expect to move back to a more normalized return on regulatory capital towards the 18% that we have as a target for 2024. This will not be achieved in the next one or two quarters. But clearly, as we move over the next two years, we are moving towards that 18%, that's clearly our target under the leadership of Francesco and his team and we are fully focused on that. 52:45 Secondly, on your question on M&A. You say it was positive, yes, it was positive, but it's not nearly there where I would like it to be. It was marginally positive in every region. It was mainly positive in Switzerland and in Asia. But -- and also in our external asset management business. But I see substantial more opportunities, particularly also, for example, in the Middle East and in other area. So I have never been a big fan of quarterly NNA, because they are volatile by nature, but this will clearly be the mid-term target of Francesco and his team, both not only for assets under management, but more the entire client business volume, which was always my preferred metric, which includes also assets under custody and especially lending volumes and that's where we want to grow the business and where we see mid-term substantial growth opportunities.\\nDavid Mathers: 53:58 I think the only point I'd probably add Magdalena to Thomas’s points, which I agree entirely. It's just, I would say on the interest rate sensitivity, because that is clearly most noted within the Wealth Management division given where we are in the curve, because clearly the US has moved first, and that will be the benefit we should begin to see in the second half of this year and then into 2023. And I just wanted to just note that basically.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: 54:26 Thank you very. Thomas, so can I just confirm that your internally driven kinds of client derisking deleveraging that we had kind of seen in wealth, over the last 12 months. It's broadly done. So what we are going to see, and I know very, very gradually, is the -- it's more of an underlying business dynamics as we move forward. Would that be fair?\\nThomas Gottstein: 54:53 That is fair. Yes. Absolutely.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: 54:56 Thank you.\\nOperator: 54:58 Thank you. And we are now taking our next question. And the next question comes from the line from Flora Bocahut from Jefferies. Please ask your question. Your line is now open.\\nFlora Bocahut: 55:09 Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So the first question I had is regarding the cost guidance that you have provided, you gave us guidance of adjusted cost of CHF17 billion for this year. Indeed, if I annualized the adjusted cost you printed for Q1, this is the run rate we are heading too. The only issue is that the adjusted revenues has been running around CHF18 billion of annualized run rate, in the past two quarters. I understand that part of the cost guidance has to do with variable compensation in the investments that you talked about. I know the environment has been tough the past two quarters. The only issue is, it could remain so for the rest of the year. So the question, I wanted to ask you is, do you stick to the CHF17 billion cost guidance, no matter what the revenues end of being this year, which means you could be hardly profit making on an adjusted basis this year with your core Tier 1 ratio just below the target? 56:15 And the second question is actually on capital whether you could just elaborate please on any capital impact that you think could come for the rest of the year, whether you expect further increase in op risk RWA, further impact from model changes. So any other element you have in mind as of today’s standpoint on capital would be helpful? Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: 56:35 Okay. Thank you very much. Let's take the two questions in turn. Look, I think there is limited cost flexibility in 2022 for two primary reasons. Firstly, I think, if we look back at ‘21, our response to Greensill and the Archegos matters was to reduce both the absolute amount of variable compensation, but also to increase the amount of deferrals. And that's what drove our cost down to just over 16 billion last year. That was the right thing to do in the circumstance. But it's not sustainable for long term and it's why I guided when we spoke earlier this year and indeed back at the Investor Day. But we'd expect to see it about 1 billion increase in our expenses. 57:23 Now that's not to say that I'm giving any particular guidance over the economic value, the total value of awards for 2022. It's much too early in this year to make that kind of statement and clearly is, flexibility in terms of that. But I think sitting here at the first quarter, I think it's appropriate to be prudent in terms of what I say about that. I think the second reason is, if we think about what we're doing in terms of risk compliance and the IT to actually support it. I think clearly, those are necessary investments we need to make as we address the issues that caused so much damage in 2021 to our results and everything else. We are obviously executing a substantial strategic cost program. So I mentioned already the outsourcing of procurement to 150 million of cash savings that should generate. We're also putting together all of our operating IT, --- operations and IT functions on Jo, so moving back to the sort of pre-2016 structure. And that should yield very significant savings, but to be clear, majority of that actually flows through in 2023. And ditto, the exit from prime. We will save money from that. 58:41 But at the moment, we're still in the rundown of that particular business. So there is whether we like it or not a significant delivery of short term inflexibility in the cost base for 2022 and I think we've warned about that before in terms of where we are now. It doesn't mean there's no flexibility. But I think that's why I'm sticking to the guidance of around 17 billion for this year. We're working very hard at this. We're considering what we should prioritize, what we should deprioritized, but there are certain things particularly around the risk and control investments that really do have to actually happen. But I think that's all I can really say, at this point early in the year, there is clearly some flexibility around variable compensation, particularly with a much lower level of deferral. You understand that the gearing through to cash is therefore higher. 59:31 I think in terms of capital, I think our medium term ambition was same. We want to have a CET1 ratio of the group of at least 14% before the Bal IV transition in 2024. We've obviously dipped slightly below that this quarter, mainly due to the 600 million increase in litigation provisions, which mathematically just drops you almost exactly by 20 basis points. I think I probably expect the ratio to rain somewhere in the 13.5% to 14% for the next six months, depending on the level of cash generation, other issues we actually deal with and how we actually allocate capital but I'd expect our CET1 ratio there afterwards to actually improve at and above our 14 % medium term target in terms of that. I think you asked specific question in terms of methodology, I think I said, back in February that we expected about 6 billion to 7 billion of methodology changes this year I think that's still the case, but clearly there will be some increase in op risk RWA above and beyond that, as we work through the impact of the litigation provisions that we took two weeks there, but I don't have a particular view at this point in terms of that number and that's something I'd expect to see in the second half of this year not in the second quarter. 60:54 So, I hope that some help. On the cost point, we are super focused on moving to a more flexible structure. But as I said, a lot of this comes through in ‘23, rather than ‘22.\\nFlora Bocahut: 61:08 This is very clear. Thank you, David and all the best for the future.\\nDavid Mathers: 61:12 Thank you very much.\\nOperator: 61:15 Thank you and we will take our next question. And the next question comes from the line of Alastair Ryan from Bank of America. Please ask you question. Your line is now.\\nAlastair Ryan: 61:25 Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning. So just on the trade-off to draw a little bit on that David if I may between the CET1 below target and sort of the risk capacity that the group's put into work. You've got a lot of good franchisees, which I think you've sort of sketched your not gearing with the risk they might normally take at this point. And absolutely understandably in the current circumstances but just whether you'd be happy running below the capital target for longer to put some more money back to work or whether the capital targets more of a constraint you're still a good surplus to requirements, but below your goals? Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: 62:16 That's a very good question, Alastair. Look, I think the target setting for the 14% is clearly in respect to the inflation we expect to see when we finally get to the B3R transition a couple of years’ time. And we want to make sure that we have sufficient buffer for that and we don't have a rerun of what we saw with the B3 transition a decade ago. But nonetheless, I think we set a medium term ambition of 14%. I've kind of said it could be in the range of 13.5% to 14% for the next six months. I think there is a balance in terms of that, in terms of putting money to work within the Wealth Management lending business in particular, and we obviously like to see that, but I think it is important that we remain prudent in terms of the group CET1 levels that we actually operate at. So that's the balance that I'm thinking about really in terms of how we actually operate. 63:12 I think we have taken some tough decisions in the first quarter, particularly around the litigation provisions, but I think those were the right things to say. And if the cost of that as we dropped to 13.8% then it is where it is, I guess. But I think it is important to really put a dent into this. As Thomas said, we've actually got through the dismissal of more than 80 cases and settled 12. So I think it's finally the right time to draw a line under this issue.\\nAlastair Ryan: 63:42 Thank you, David.\\nOperator: 63:45 Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee from BNB Paribas. Please ask your question. Your line is now open.\\nJeremy Sigee: 63:55 Good morning. Thank you very much. First one on Russia, I don't know, if I missed it, could you just -- did you give us an update on the percent of AUM with Russian clients. I think you previously said 4%, I'm not sure you gave an update here on that number? Then could you just talk a bit about how you're managing those kind of frozen clients, your ability to charge fees and net interest income and generally kind of how you see that going forward? That’s the first question. 64:24 Secondly, you mentioned in the Investment Bank, strong market share performance in EMEA and APAC. I just wonder whether you could talk about the products and geographies where you're below what you see as a normal market share and what it needs to get that back to normal?\\nThomas Gottstein: 64:45 Okay. So, with respect to the AUM, as you mentioned the 4% that we outlined at the Morgan Stanley Conference, and David mentioned they have broadly been said they actually reduced a little bit, but not much. As you also saw the total AUM have also reduced given market performance and other factors. So, broadly speaking, those top number has marginally reduced, but not too much. The terms of how we deal with Russian clients, now obviously, you have the sanctioned clients and there, you basically can't touch them and basically, it's just sitting there. And then you have the other Russian clients where they are legally not sanctioned, but the fact given the rules in Switzerland and the EU, which are broadly the same is basically that they cannot bring any new assets so, but they can obviously retrieve assets. And that's really the situation that we have at the moment with those non-sanctioned Russian clients of which some of them are living in Russia, some of them are living in the west. So, but they are all subject to the restrictions that we see in the EU and in Switzerland. So that's really how it works and we do not really have any new business with Russian clients at all. 66:31 With respect to the IBCM market shares in EMEA and APAC. Yes, they were marginally up and we had some good transactions, but it's also fair to say that the overall market as you know is down significantly. And we always also see that the U.S. usually is 60% to 70% of the market. So, and we have traditionally a strong leverage finance in ECM and M&A practice and especially, leveraged finance in ECM was down more. And DCM investment grade, capital market is the market where we have lower market share. So that obviously that mix was not helpful in this first quarter. But that was just the first quarter and we'll have to now, hopefully see how capital markets activity will develop over the next couple of quarters.\\nJeremy Sigee: 67:44 Great. Thank you very much.\\nOperator: 67:47 Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher from UBS. Please ask your question. Your line is now open.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: 67:57 Yeah. Good morning and thank you. Can I ask about the Prime Services exit and what kind of side effect or multiplier effects you would expect to see in all the businesses probably what's happened so far and what you expect going forward? And then just a bit more general question on leverage lending given interest rate moves or expected interest rate moves. How do you think about risks in that business for the industry overall and how you think about your own business in that context? That would be helpful. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: 68:34 I mean, I think just to kick off on the Prime business. And we estimate that the adverse revenue impacts about 170 million in the 1Q numbers. I think so far in terms of revenue impact, it's probably similar perhaps less than what we talked about back in November either hasn't been that much of a multiplier impact. And clearly, there was a cost aspect this as well. But realistically those cost savings will only come in late in the year and into 2023 because we obviously need to ensure that our customers are actually dealt with fairly and properly as we actually transition this business. 69:20 I think in terms of Prime Service, and Thomas you may have to comment, but I have a first crack at the leverage finance type point. I think our market share and leverage finance obviously did drop in the fourth quarter of last year. I think we're just outside of the top ten. It's improved to about fifth, I think in the first quarter. I think what we are seeing as a consequence of the volatility and interest rates and to lesser extent credit markets in the first quarter is the market of shifted away from the sponsors business and perhaps more to corporate issuers. So it's slightly adverse market shift for us. But I think you can see in the numbers we've given one of the appendices is that we've got about 7.4 billion of leverage finance pipeline, and that's increased and steadily over the last few quarters. But I think as we commented in the outlook statement, I think, clearly, we are hostess to fortune in terms of the stability of markets to actually how well work and how fast we can actually execute that business. But Thomas I don't if you want to.\\nThomas Gottstein: 70:23 No, we are obviously actively managing our exposure and the 7.4 billion that we had at the end of the first quarter compared to 10.2, we had at the end of the first quarter ‘21, so it's down 30% and we are obviously observing the markets for leverage loans and high yield bonds and in close collaboration between both the first line and the second line, and it's a market that is clearly significantly slower and less active than it was a year ago, but at the same time, we also more cautious, but at the same time, as you we were said, it's not only sponsor deals, but it also corporate deals and we look at a deal by deal.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: 71:16 Okay. Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: 71:17 Thank you.\\nOperator: 71:21 Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JP Morgan. Please ask your question. Your line is now open.\\nThomas Gottstein: 71:35 Hello?\\nOperator: 71:36 Kian Abouhossein from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\\nKian Abouhossein: 71:41 Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The first question is regarding fixed income sales in trading again. Just trying to understand how we should think about the environment, considering that the first quarter was difficult, but it was not a dislocation. And your revenues declined around 50% year-on-year. And just thinking about the run rate and the potentially impact of higher credit spreads that is having on your credit business, which is mainly a fixed income business? 72:17 And then the second question is related to your return on equity target in the Investment Bank of over 12% by 2024. I think you made clear that 2022 was restructuring year or a transformation year. But your clearly follow off looking at the numbers today and the environment actually has been reasonably good for other players. So I'm just trying to understand the path to 12% in a more difficult revenue environment.\\nThomas Gottstein: 72:55 Yeah. So if you look at our fixed income sales and trading and the various components, so with securitized products and GTS, then you can clearly see, if you compare the Q1 significant reduction, but if you go more back, let's say the first quarter ‘20 then the -- but basically, we are up in securitized products. We are up about 30% compared to the first quarter ‘20. So had a very decent performance there. In other credit products, as you can remember ‘20 was a very strong quarter in terms of credit trading, there we are down and GTS was, which is mainly driven on the fixed income side by financing on our side as well as by FX and macro businesses, which are clearly much smaller than some of our competitors where we are also down to that comparable quarter. But It is clear that we have not the exposure that others have to certain interest rate trading business with a macro FX or commodities that some of our other peers have where they saw some benefits after dislocation created by the Russia innovation, which we do not have. So we did obviously have the benefit as we actually predicted in our 2020 Investor Day, we said that 2021 will be the year for Credit, and that is exactly what happened in the first quarter, 2021, where we saw an absolute record in our fixed income sales and trading of 1.6 billion compared to the 800 million that we now saw in the first quarter ’22, so we are half, basically of where we were. 75:05 So I don't think that the first quarter ‘22 is necessarily the right basis to look at for where we should be maybe in ’23, ‘24. The first quarter 20 was more in the 1.3 billion area. We are now at 800 million. So there's clearly upside from where we are now, but the same is true for capital markets, whether it's ECM, whether it's leverage finance where we had a very, I would say slow quarter in the first quarter like many of our peers as well. So one thing is the business mix, clearly, we have much more geared towards credit to capital markets, M&A and much less to macro. And the second is that we foresee clear improvement in some of our market shares through the investments we are making, especially around M&A and capital markets.\\nKian Abouhossein: 76:12 And sorry, if I can just very briefly on the accrual of compensation, which clearly, David had highlighted a few times now on this call. The normalization that you talk about is just a year-on-year comparison issue. Going forward, clearly, you will pay higher cash components, so there will be comparable? Is that what you're trying to say?\\nDavid Mathers: 76:35 Yeah. I think, well, let me see if I can be helpful here. I think, as I said, the level of compensation into -- I mean response that we decided in response to Archegos and Greensill was to reduce the overall level of variable compensation as you know and we've summarized that in the comp report and the annual report. But what we also did, which we’re also clear about is we actually reduced the amount of cash and increased demand of deferral last year for many reasons, which as you know. 77:04 Now moving into ‘22 that level of deferral was not sustainable. And as you said back in November and again in February, essentially, we want to normalize that. So that's what we've actually done unless we've accrued to in the first quarter. As I said, I'm not making any particular statements around the economic value of awards for compensation this year. I mean, if you want to push me a bit, I think I've used a basis of something similar in both conversation and the strategic delivery award as the plan for the accruals. But clearly, that's at this point in the first quarter just a place market shall we say, but then I'd use that the low deferral levels to actually calculate the cash accrual, which I think is the a prudent thing to do, and I think it's the right thing to do. But clearly as we actually work through this year, we'll have to decide what is the right level for economic value and that's obviously going to depend on our performance and on the conditions in which we actually operate. 78:00 There afterwards if you're asking the question around 2023, you're right, we will then have had that step change and then we move forward basically. I don't think the banks intention necessarily will be to change that deferral plan in ‘23 compared to ‘22. But that'll will be a decision to made at the time. But I think clearly once you actually get into ‘23 then some of the cost pressures that we've seen away from this in ’22 fall away. We have clearly the savings from the integration of the technology function, which will be substantial and we'll discuss that in more detail in the deep dive and later on this quarter. And we'll have some relief elsewhere in terms obviously have the accelerating benefits from procurement outsourcing and some of the other reengineering benefits, and we'll also have the cost savings from the Prime exit, which will help the investment bank numbers. So I think certainly from a cost point of view, I think ‘22 is perhaps the most challenging year to be dealing with, provided that we manage things well going through the period.\\nKian Abouhossein: 78:59 Thank you.\\nOperator: 79:04 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Amit Goel from Barclays. Please ask your question. Your line is now open.\\nAmit Goel: 79:20 Hi. Thank you. So two questions for me. So first actually just going back to the redivisionalization and the kind of updated numbers that were released also a few -- I guess few weeks back. It looks also like the redivisionalization was slightly different to what was initially presented at the Investor Day and in terms, some of the business movements. It seems like obviously, the sub-high net worth businesses retained within the Swiss Bank and it seemed like there's a higher IB contribution or revenue contribution than previously anticipated. Just wanted to understand some of those dynamics and whether that changes also some of a divisional kind of aspiration or target? 80:14 And the second question just relates further to restructuring and parent co-capital levels? So just wanted to understand better as well whether or not parent co-capitalization limits your ability to do further restructuring at some of the businesses, if it potentially impacts further participation values? Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: 80:41 Should I take the second one and then pass back to you Thomas for the PBS change. But I think in terms of the parent, I mean, I think what we've done so far in this -- in the year is pretty much in mind what I said back in February. So, I think you may recall that I was talking about something like 10 billion of dividend recap to dividends and capital repatriation to come out of the subsidiaries and into the parent to basically strengthen the ratio from the 11.4% that we had basically as of the first of January this year. And so for this year, we've moved in about 2 billion from both Switzerland and from CSH USA, and that's obviously increased the ratio to 11.8%. 81:31 And I think if we look forward to the balance this year, I think the other dividends and capital restructuring are on track. They do remain subject to regulatory approval and some of those approvals do have to go through a process that takes several months. So as I said before, I would expect those to come through primarily in the second half of this year rather than the second quarter this year. But I think, so that's really as per our plan. 82:02 I think in terms of your other question, -- which is, the answer is yes, clearly, if you have to reduce the value of those subsidiaries without further capital repatriation that has an adverse impact on the parent ratio. So it does act as some constraint in terms of what we can do basically. But I think equally if we actually think about the bank overall, when we talked about shifting 3 billion of capital from the Investment Bank to the Wealth Management businesses that's a clearly an overall MIS sense. 82:32 But in order to actually accomplish that, given that more of the investment banking business is actually in the subsidiaries compared to the branch shares. We also need to move capital to actually support our Wealth Management ambition, Amit. So I hope that's of some help at least.\\nThomas Gottstein: 82:49 And as far as your first question is concerned, yes, indeed, we did decide to move the Swiss, private banking business, which is the high net worth as opposed to the ultra-high net worth or the external asset manager business back into the Swiss division. So, out of the three businesses which we originally were planning to move into the global wealth, we moved in indeed two, namely the Swiss Premium Clients business, which is the ultra-high network business and the Global External Asset Management business in Switzerland into Global Wealth. 83:26 But the Swiss high net worth business we decided to leave in the Swiss Bank because the collaboration between both that business and the corporate bank on one side, but secondly also with the retail bank is just too close and is in addition to that, they share, for example, the mortgage centers and they are in all the 109 branches as we have in Switzerland. So for all these reasons, we came to view it's much easier if they stay in the same division, but Serge Fehr, who runs that business, he's also on the Global Wealth Management, Management Committee. And he's very closely also liaising with our global high net worth strategy because some of the successes we've seen now in Switzerland also with CSX, for example, is something that he can also help build out internationally with the Global Wealth Management team, but we are and we'll continue to show our volumes in terms of AUM and net new assets for our Global Wealth Management business including that business going forward as well. 84:43 And in terms of the investment banking revenues. I think they are pretty much in line with what we showed already in November. And obviously, they were – through the finalization of the restatement, we had to finalize the numbers for GTS and for AFG, especially those the AFG is the Asia Finance Group and the split between Wealth Management and Investment Banking and for those two businesses went through a finalization, iteration in the first quarter, but broadly speaking there and absolutely in line with what we had already presented on the 4 of November at our Strategy Day.\\nAmit Goel: 85:34 Okay. Thank you. And those differences they are going to change the divisional targets.\\nThomas Gottstein: 85:39 No. They don’t.\\nAmit Goel: 85:42 Okay. Thank you. Thanks, both. And thank you, David as well for your help.\\nDavid Mathers: 85:46 Thanks, Amit.\\nOperator: 85:49 Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen from Bank of -- sorry, Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\\nAnke Reingen: 86:00 Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. And the first is, thanks David for the help. And on that note, on the strategic plan you presented last year. I mean, most of them managers that were heading the divisions and the operations probably have changed since then. So as I see, I just wonder, I mean, what's the appetite to review on the strategic path getting suppose new people have new ideas, and I'd see things differently. And you also mentioned before that 2021 was too inward looking and is there like a risk from the number of management changes that this will impact on year 2022 as well the acknowledge say it's a year of transition, but is there risk of the management changes put more pressure on this as well? 86:59 And then on your disclosure about the losses from litigation covered, not covered by existing provisions. I mean the numbers only changed for 100 million versus the year-end number. I mean, is it just this number is just accounting, and we should really pay any attention on it or is it to do with flow in the first quarter while the number hasn’t really changed? Thank you very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: 87:22 Let me take the first one and David, the second -- although the second I was struggling to...\\nDavid Mathers: 87:27 Yeah, I think you might have to another go, let me frank you on the second one, if I'm afraid? But why don’t you take the first one, first?\\nThomas Gottstein: 87:33 Okay. I'll take the first one, so just to be clear, each of Andre Helfenstein for the Swiss business, Ulrich Korner for Asset Management and Christian Meissner for Investment Bank were at the Investor Day, so three out of four. And obviously, Francesco, who started in the 1 of January, was before he joined fully aware of all these targets and fully bought into this before he joined. So three out of the four divisional CEOs were indeed already there when we presented our presentation and Philipp Wehle, who is now the CFO of Francesco planted the numbers and plans. So there is very much continuity and I would not agree with the statement that we have different CEOs now executing the strategy. We have broadly the same lineup. 88:39 Secondly, we obviously did strengthen and appoint some additional ExB members for risk with David Wildermuth, who started on the 1 of January as did Jo Hannaford for our technology and engineering effort and they have very much had a very busy first four months since they joined reviewing the strategic plans, reviewing also what it means for both technology engineering for Jo’s and for David Wildermuth. He has had a lot of positive impact on our risk management approach. So, this is the reason also why we will do a deep dive for you guys at the end of June and to really go into each of those businesses with our new ExB colleagues with Francesco, with David Wildermuth for risk with our technology effort with Jo and Rafael from compliance all four will be presenting to you and you will be able to get a feeling about the progress. We've had Rafael as our head of compliance. He was already on board at the time that we presented our strategy in November. He joined us, as you know on the 1 of October, our compliance effort. 90:26 So that's on your first question. And maybe you can repeat again your second question, It was difficult to understand.\\nDavid Mathers: 90:32 Let me – was it about the reasonably possible loss, Anke?\\nAnke Reingen: 90:36 Exactly. Under the litigation, I'm not covered by existing provisions, yeah, the decline from 1.5 billion to 1.4 billion.\\nDavid Mathers: 90:45 So your question is why did it only drop by 100 million plus or minus? Whilst the provisions went up by 700 million. So, I think that, I mean, it's always difficult to provide complete visibility on this because we are referring to a number of matters, which are actually live and court at this particular moment and therefore it's not appropriate for me to comment in detail. But if I speak more generally, then I think it's clear to say that we had some positive developments on a number of the cases, where we have visibility to be able to settle and dismiss or reduce the scale number of those things and that reduced the RPL. 91:27 However, we did have certain adverse developments during the quarter and I think we've talked about those publicly already, but I'm not going to add to what we've said already. And therefore, we have generally reassessed our reasonably possible loss in terms of that. So there's a balance of things going on as you might say, in the RPL disclosure. And I think that's probably all I can say given the live nature of these actions. 91:54 I think more generally, I just would repeat what Thomas has already said, which is we have been making a very determined and proactive effort to seek to resolve dismiss, reduce the scale of these cases. Things such as the RMBS case is clearly date back to pre-2008, which is a very long time. And we managed to get more than 80 dismissed over the last two years. We've settled another 12. So I think we are getting through the lump of this legacy at this particular point. And hopefully, we can continue to actually work through these issues basically. But I think that's all I can really see Anke into terms of given the live nature of the materials.\\nAnke Reingen: 92:38 Okay. Thank you very much and all the best.\\nOperator: 92:42 Thank you. And the final question comes from the line of Andrew Lim. Please ask your question. Your line is now open.\\nAndrew Lim: 92:52 Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first question is, I’m just wondering how you think about the Investment Bank strategically, whether there's opportunities are further deleveraging. And I asked is, of course, because it's a seasonally strong first quarter have done well and you've made a loss and seems be losing market share across all business lines. I mean it's supposed to be year where it's a transition rather than a big restructuring year. And I wonder just feeding on from Kian’s question, how you think about opportunities for different business lines improving for the remainder of the year? And if not, where actually some businesses could be delevered further. And you’re notably in structured products securitized products and leverage lending and whether you think about these products actually being synergistic with the rest of IB, or even synergistic with Wealth Management and whether these could be delivered? 93:56 My second question is on the CET1 target that you have a 14%. We've discussed this before, but this -- I think it's worth we're revisiting again. It's optically quite high versus peers, especially Swiss peers of yours -- and I wonder whether you think -- whether this could be lowered, perhaps like 13% or whether there's some kind of like steady state where all regulatory changes have been implemented, are other charges can be taken into account and that you feel comfortable bringing that down to a lower level or not?\\nDavid Mathers: 94:36 Well, perhaps should I take the second question. Sure, but that's right. So, look, I think, as I said already, I think when we announced our 14% ambition, it was last November. It was very clearly said, on the basis of the Basel 3R transition a couple of years’ time. And I think we got that point correct me anyone here, but to about a 35 billion to 40 billion increase in RWA. And I think we wanted to make sure that there were no questions around the capital ratios in the bank for that particular transition. 95:09 And I think that very much remains our position. I think if we get to 2024, and the impact is less or things have changed, then that's the decision we should make at that point, but it should be driven by a, that regulatory change, and b, let's be clear by the stress calculations we make in terms of our capital needs, and that's what will I think guide the board in terms of their views on that. But I think for this point, nothing has changed materially to justify change in that being where we want to be for that ambition. It doesn't mean we have to be there for the end of the second quarter or the end of third quarter. We're still talking about a change several years away, but couple of years away, but that's been our thinking in terms of the CET1 ratio, is that helpful Andrew.\\nAndrew Lim: 95:58 That's great. Thank.\\nThomas Gottstein: 95:59 And on the deleveraging in the IB, as you know, the main areas where we are deleveraging, which is also -- which was part of our presentation. November, our three areas, one is Prime Services; the second one is emerging market, GTS and those markets where we do not want to strategically be active anymore going forward; and thirdly in the Corporate bank, which is mainly a U.S. Corporate Bank book. Those are the three areas where we are focused on the deleveraging and that hasn't changed. 96:35 We did mentioned some ideas at the Investor Day about some incremental opportunities potentially in other areas, where we -- in principle see ourselves as strong players and market leading franchises. They are always there for further analysis, and we will report if and when we have any news on that, but clearly our focused to invest in those market leading franchises being the SP, be it leverage finance, be the M&A, be the equity capital markets.\\nAndrew Lim: 97:19 That’s great. Thank you very much and best of luck for the future.\\nDavid Mathers: 97:22 Thank you. Actually just -- I think Thomas has may I probably should just say something, which is, I think I have indicated my decision to Thomas into to the Board that I do think after 12 years, it's right and proper to seek some fresh challenges and opportunities. But I would just reiterate that I've also committed to Thomas and to the Board that my first priority is to ensure a smooth and a seamless transition of my CFO responsibilities. And to that end, I have committed to stay at Credit Suisse until my successors in both the CFO role and in my role as Chief Executive CSI are actually been selected and are in place and to support Thomas, the Chairman and the Board throughout that period. So sorry, regret to tell you, that you'll probably be talking to me in three months’ time, and I'm certainly going be looking forward to seeing you at the investor deep dive, but just to make that point clear.\\nThomas Gottstein: 98:28 Thank you, David, Indeed.\\nKinnerLakhani: 98:32 Okay. With this… Please go ahead.\\nOperator: 98:36 We have got one more question from Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\\nStefan Stalmann: 98:44 Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking my question. There's only one left for me. You are making a change in the position of your General Counsel. And the press release is relatively silent on why that is? And also more importantly, what do you expect to change under the new General Counsel, maybe you can add a little bit of color on that, that would be great. Thank you.\\nThomas Gottstein: 99:13 Well, Romeo has also been with us over 10 years and these discussions have started, I mean, has been with us in the role of General Counsel on the Group Executive Board over 10 years and these discussions also started already last year. There is no change in policy. We did decide already in 2020 to more proactively address our legacy cases, many of which date back 10 years or more, and we started to execute on that under the leadership of Romeo already in 2020 and ‘21. So there is no change in policy, but this was part of succession planning and materialize now, we have the fortune to have somebody very qualified with very relevant experience being in the U.S. or elsewhere. And with Markus detail, we have somebody who can start on the 1 of July and that's why we made that decision. And we are both grateful to Romeo for everything he has done and we're looking forward to working, with Markus from 1 July onwards.\\nStefan Stalmann: 100:34 Great. Thank you very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: 100:37 Thank you very much, Stefan.\\nOperator: 100:41 Thank you. May I hand over to Kinner. Please continue.\\nKinner Lakhani: 100:48 Thank you all for all your questions and your time this morning.

And thank you all for joining our first quarter 2022 results presentation. We greatly appreciate your participation and engagement. 01:45 Let me begin by addressing the broader economic and geopolitical environment. Financial markets enter 2022 dealing with some of the highest inflation rates in a generation, putting significant pressure on central banks and weighing on the purchasing power of many of our fellow citizens. In addition, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. 02:13 Credit Suisse and its employees would like to express our sympathy and support towards the Ukrainian people as we continue to show our solidarity through support for aid groups and other organizations. The Ukrainian crisis has also had a significant impact on the global economy, financial markets and many businesses, including our own, during the first quarter, as you will have seen in the reports from many of our global peers. 02:45 As I've have said previously, in the context of our long-term strategic plan, the year 2022 is one of transition for us at Credit Suisse. We are determined to continue with the implementation of our strategy as announced in November last year and remain focused on refining and reinvigorating our franchise consistent with our approved risk appetite. 03:14 The financial performance in the first quarter of 2022 highlights our work in progress and what more we need to do. As we disclosed last week, we reported a loss in the first quarter. This was partly a consequence of our decision to increase provisions relating to developments in a number of previously disclosed legacy legal matters. This is in line with our proactive approach to resolving legacy litigation matters, many of which go back more than one decade. Our results were also negatively impacted by Russia related losses of CHF206 million. 03:56 As you will see in the slides, we have already made significant concrete progress in executing our strategy across our divisions with a simplified structure that went live on January 1. Before I turn to the presentation, as you have seen today, we have announced a series of appointments to the Executive Board as well as management changes. We are delighted to welcome Francesca McDonagh as incoming CEO of the EMEA region; Edwin Low, CEO of the Asia Pacific region; and Markus Diethelm as General Counsel. They will take up their roles in the coming weeks and months. 04:38 David, who has served as Chief Financial Officer since 2010 has indicated his wish to seek alternative opportunities outside of Credit Suisse. While I have accepted his request with regret, I look forward to working with him over the coming months until a successor is found. And on a personal note, I would like to add that I’ll not only miss him as a competent CFO, but as a friend and colleague, but we still have several months to go. 05:16 I would also like to thank Romeo and Helman for their service to bank over the many years. And I'm very pleased that Helman will serve as Senior Adviser to me, focusing on the core clients around the APAC region, as well as serving on our Asia Advisory Council. The determined delivery of our strategy over the coming quarters is the absolute focus of the Board of Directors, the Executive Board and all our employees. 05:45 With that, let me turn to the slides, starting with our key messages from the first quarter on Slide four. We recorded CHF0.4 billion pre-tax loss in the first quarter. As our reported results were negatively impacted by CHF0.7 billion of legal provisions, a CHF0.2 billion Russia related losses and by CHF0.4 billion market value losses related to our old fund stake. These were offset somewhat by real estate gains and the net release of provision for credit losses. 06:26 On an adjusted basis, we reported pre-tax income of CHF0.3 billion. Overall, we saw net revenues decline year-on-year, mainly due to a particularly strong comparable in the first quarter of 2021, especially in the Investment Bank and Wealth Management. We also experienced significant industry wide headwinds in the form of more challenging market conditions due to higher inflation and interest rates as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine impacting a number of our businesses. 07:00 In the first quarter, we reduced our Russia related net credit exposure by 56% and we continue to make further progress in exposure reductions. David will discuss this in greater detail later. We have continued to run our businesses with a strong capital base. Our CET1 ratio was 13.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 12.2% in the same period as one year earlier. Our CET1 leverage ratio was 4.3% also up from prior year levels. We stand by our medium term guidance of CET1 ratio of at least 14% pre-Basel III reforms and a CET1 leverage ratio of around 4.5%. 07:46 While our performance has been impacted by significant headwinds, our focus remains on executing the strategy we set out in November 2021. I will go into details a bit later. But as you can see from the middle of the slide, we have made considerable progress on key aspects of our integrated strategy. Regarding risk, the strengthening of both our first and second lines of defense are on track. We are confident that our strengthened risk culture should help us build a stronger and customer-centric bank that puts risk management at the core to deliver sustainable growth and value for investors, clients and colleagues. 08:30 Next slide, please. Here you see some of the factors affecting our reported and adjusted results in the quarter. Our adjusted results were characterized by recent client activity and capital markets issuance in volatile market conditions. They also -- sorry, by reduced client activity and capital market. They also reflect the cumulative reduction in risk appetite in 2021, the impact of the flattening yield curve on corporate center treasury results and increased cash accruals for compensation, due to the normalized deferral level. 09:10 Let me turn now to the divisional breakdown. Next slide, please. In terms of adjusted pre-tax income and net revenues, Wealth Management had a challenging start to the year. With adjusted PTI adversely impacted by lower transaction activity and further reduced lending volumes. The results were also impacted by Russia related effects and APAC Financing Group mark-to-market losses, which combined were approximately CHF130 million. Still, we increased investments, including in talent and saw positive net new assets across regions, reflecting our client franchise strength. 09:55 Our Investment Bank results were impacted by our continued efforts toward our planned exit from Prime Services, the slowdown in capital markets, as well as the Russia related impact on our GTS results. It is important to remember that our franchise mix, which particularly benefited us in the first quarter of 2021 was less supportive in the recent environment, given our much more limited exposure to macro and commodity sectors that performed particularly well in the first quarter. 10:28 Despite this effect, the IB posted solid performances across equity derivatives, securitized products and M&A. The advisory pipeline was up quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year. Our Swiss Bank had a good performance with stable net revenues from higher recurring commissions and fees and strong net new assets from the institutional client business. Asset management had lower pre-tax income and softer revenues due to the market environment and reduced activity levels. However, recurring management fees were broadly stable with higher investment and partnership income. 11:11 Next slide, please. We made a number of decisive actions throughout 2021 to strengthen risk and compliance teams, systems and processes. As you know, we underwent a comprehensive risk review across the entire group, which was completed in the fourth quarter. Our derisking measures have improved our risk profile, but also have negatively impacted our topline in the short term. For example, the derisking measures in Wealth Management that you see on the left of the slide led to a reduction of roughly CHF25 million in net revenues during the first quarter. 11:53 In the Investment Bank, the derisking led to approximately CHF250 million in reduced revenues. Notwithstanding the expected impact from our planned exit from the remaining part of Prime, our growth ambitions are fully aligned with our risk appetite. Strengthening risk management and addressing legacy issues remain a focus even as we implement our growth strategy. Here you see selected updates of our progress on risk and compliance topics and our proactive approach to resolving litigation cases, whether by settlements or dismissal which you can see on the right side of this page. 12:37 Next slide, please. We are focused on refining and reinvigorating our franchise in order to drive forward our vision for Credit Suisse. We are convinced, it is the right strategy even in the midst of volatile markets and economic conditions which are challenging. Please allow me to give you just a few examples of our determined execution of this strategy. We have achieved $2.5 billion reduction in allocated capital in Investment Bank since the fourth quarter of 2020, which amounts to over 80% of our more than $3 billion ambition. 13:19 We launched an outsourcing agreement on April 1, 2022 to generate procurement savings and aim to step up synergies from unified, operating platforms and technology platforms, and the divisions in the coming quarters. This should help us meet our ambition of CHF1 billion to CHF1.5 billion, in structural cost savings per annum by 2024 to invest in our growth ambitions. 13:49 In Wealth Management and Private Banking Switzerland, we achieved mandate penetration of approximately 33% in the first quarter near our 33% to 35% ambition. In the Investment Bank, we reached an 84% reduction in Prime balances since the first quarter of 2021, with our goal of a full Prime services exit by the end of 2022 at the latest, which should allow us to generate significant cost savings. We added approximately 50 managing directors in the Investment Bank, underscoring our commitments to attract talent. In our Swiss Bank, we reached 125,000 clients for our digital offering CSX, as of the first quarter 2022 with an ambition to reach 200,000 by year end. 14:44 Let me discuss each division in more detail. Starting with Wealth Management on Page 10. We aim to progressively deploy resources in Wealth Management under the new divisional leadership of Francesco De Ferrari to accelerate growth. We have made meaningful progress in laying the foundations for integrated wealth management and defined and initiated 10 execution priorities that reflect the changing geopolitical climate. These include client segments, priority markets, products and solutions, simplification and people. 15:27 We have also started execution on our initiative roadmap. Examples, include the exit of private banking activities in Sub-Sahara Africa markets, excluding South Africa and accelerated digital outreach in the core high net worth individual segment. We invested in 50 relationship managers net, mainly in Asia Pacific, Switzerland and EMEA. I would also point out that higher U.S. dollar interest rates should provide benefits to the bank through incremental net interest income of an estimated CHF550 million through 200 -- sorry, through 2023, which David will address later. 16:13 As with each of our divisional slides, you can see our key medium term ambitions at the bottom of the page, which remain unchanged. Let me turn to the investment back. Christian Meissner and his team have made continued progress reshaping the Investment Bank. And on this page, you see some of our specific actions. We have released capital from Prime and derisk the franchise. We had increased connectivity to wealth management in GTS to build a global franchise. We are investing in the capital-light investment banking and capital markets business. In the first quarter, we grew market share in both EMEA and APAC with top five market positions in both. We are driving growth in our market leading credit and securitized products businesses. 17:07 Slide 12. On the Health & Stein Swiss business has been a resounding success and is an anchor for our transformative agenda. The division continues to focus on growing our market leading mid and up market franchises in private, corporate and institutional banking. We have seen strong growth in our digital offering, notably CSX, and we are simplifying and digitalizing front-to- back processes. We are well positioned to capitalize on the post-COVID normalization in credit cards, FX and in leasing. 17:46 Next page, please. Under the leadership of Ulrich Korner, we have also made solid progress, executing our ambitious strategy in Asset Management with a focus on talent and technology. We have strengthened and simplified the organization with a number of key leadership hires. We joined the net zero Asset Managers initiative, underscoring the manner in which our group wide sustainability strategy is embedded across divisions, including Asset Management and we have strengthened risk management and our control environment. 18:25 Next slide, please. Our investments in technology are a significant focus of our ambition to simplify our business model, drive digitalization and maximize our client experience. We have started implementing the engineering strategy in our recently established Chief Technology and Operations organization under the leadership of Joanne Hannaford. We recently announced the CTOO organization and leadership team and are focusing on agility, digital transformation, and productivity across our three group strategic pillars. Many of the underlying efforts have started and are progressing well. 19:13 Next slide, please. Credit Suisse continues to emphasize the importance of sustainability as a core element to our value proposition for our clients, shareholders, employees and society as a whole. We made significant progress executing our five pillar strategy in 2021 and many of our objectives and achievements are outlined in our 2021 Sustainability Report. 19:44 Let me outline some of our achievements here. We reached sustainable assets under management of CHF144 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from CHF118 billion in the first quarter of 2021. We also increased sustainable AUM penetration as a share of total assets under management. We are proud to have earned the Sustainability Bond of the Year Serving Award for our role as sole structure and the ranger of the blue bond for the Nature Conservancy. 20:19 And on the right side of this page, you see our progress and our way forward. Emma Crystal, our new Chief Sustainability Officer, is driving these efforts in close collaboration with all four businesses. We remain committed to supporting our clients’ transition and expanding our sustainable investment and financing offering as we make further progress toward our ambition of providing at least CHF300 billion in sustainable financing by 2030. 20:53 I would now like to hand over to David, who will go over our results in more detail.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"21:01 Thank you very much, Thomas, and good morning to everybody. So I'd like to go through the key financials and provide some more details on our performance at the group and at the divisional level. Just to be clear, this is of course, the first time that we're presenting these numbers under the new divisional structure, which took effect from the January 1st 2022. 21:22 Now before I turn to the numbers, I’d just like to make a few introductory points. You'll recall that last week, on April 20th, we issued a trading update, which flagged an increase to our legal provisions of approximately CHF600 million in relation to the developments in a number of previously disclosed matters, all of which originated more than a decade ago. We also highlighted the negative impact of over CHF200 million relating to the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now in the adjusted numbers, we well as usual, exclude all the major litigation provisions, but to clear, we are not excluding the Russian-related impact in the adjusted definition. 22:09 Second, I'd like to make a broader point on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now, whilst the tragic humanitarian aspect this conflict remain, of course, front of mind, the disruption to financial markets, as well as the breadth and the depth of the sanctions introduced by the Swiss, UK, European and U.S. authorities in response to this have also been significant. In keeping our peers, therefore, I will be providing further detail on the impact this has had within our different business lines in the first quarter. 22:41 Third, I’d just note that as we continue to execute on the strategic plan with the investment spending, internal reorganization and the capital reallocation associated with this, our risk appetite and our risk management remain key focuses. Now this combines clearly with a period of reduced risk appetite and lower activity from our clients. The overall impact to which has been a decline in revenues across our major business lines. 23:12 Now as I'm sure you know, the first quarter of ’21 was particularly strong in terms of our underlying performance that is excluding the Archegos charge and the comparison to this quarter's figures should be seen in that context. 23:27 Let me just start then with a Group -- a summary of the Group's results, and let me first remind you of the three significant items the quarter, that we highlighted in last week statement. First, since the listing of all funds, in April of last year, we have seen and continue to see mark to market volatility in the stock market price of this publicly listed entity. Of which as you know, we own about 8.6%. In the first quarter, we booked a loss of CHF353 million as a consequence of the fall in all fund share price during the first quarter. 24:09 As you will note, we listed this risk in our 2021 annual report, which we published last month. I would remind you though, that this has been and remains a successful transaction and that Credit Suisse has to the end of March 2022 booked a cumulative of gain of CHF971 million, even including the loss in the first quarter. 24:36 Second, we booked gains of CHF164 million in the quarter as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio. And third, our provision for credit losses includes a release relating to Archegos of CHF155 million. You may remember that we recorded a similar net gain relating to the Archegos exposure of CHF235 million in the third quarter of last year, and we clearly continue to seek further recoveries from these states. 25:11 Now going through the key reported figures then, our net revenues were CHF4.41 billion, 42% lower year-on-year. With declines across Wealth Management, the investment bank and asset management offset to a degree by the resilient performance in Swiss Bank. With regards to the provision for credit losses, we had a net release of CHF110 million, driven by the Archegos related release of CHF155 million that I've already mentioned, but offset clearly, by new provisions of CHF58 million relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 25:52 However, the increases in litigation provisions that mentioned, which took the total to CHF703 million to quarter, contributed to a 26% increase in reported operating expenses, totaling CHF4.95 billion. That means we reported a pretax tax loss for the quarter of CHF428 million, compared to the reported pretax tax loss of CHF757 million in the first quarter of 2021. 26:24 Now on an adjusted basis, that is excluding all funds and the real estate gains, the Archegos release, net litigation provisions and certain other items. We delivered a pretax income of CHF300 million. If you were to exclude the Russia related impact, that would have equated to an adjusted pretax income of CHF506 million. 26:50 Now just a brief point on operating expenses, one recurring theme that you'll notice as we go through the materials is around the normalization of our compensation deferral levels and a consequent increase in cash accruals, compared to last year. And I'll give some more details on this shortly. 27:09 Before we get to that, let me give you some more details on the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and what has had on our first quarter performance. Now you remember that we did give some disclosures on this with the publication of our annual report on March 10th and we provided a further update since then. Just to summarize that, on March 10th, we said that our 2021 credit risk exposure was CHF1.57 billion gross, and CHF848 million net. We've reduced these figures significantly in the first quarter with net credit exposure at the end of the first quarter standing at CHF373 million, that's about 56% lower than the end of 2021. 27:56 Now if we consider the impact these events on our P&L in the first quarter, there are three broad themes. First, we were generally successful in reducing our exposure before the envasion, but we did see some defaults on amounts owed to us by Russian counterparties, partly due to the imposition of the sanctions and certain other developments. 28:19 Second, we took a limits demand of specific credit provisions across the bank. And third, a scenario review of the provision for credit losses led us to increase our non-specific provisions that is related to CECL accounting by CHF44 million. Overall, we saw a negative impact of CHF206 million on pretax income with respect to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter, comprising CHF58 million in the provisions for credit losses and CHF148 million of trading and fair value losses. Just to be clear that was split across the divisions as follows: CHF99 million in Wealth Management; $101 in the Investment bank and CHF14 million in the Swiss Bank. 29:12 Now more broadly, in terms of the Wealth Management's divisions, exposure to Russia, I think you will recall that at the Morgan Stanley Financials’ Conference last month, Thomas confirmed that about 4% of our assets under management was linked to Russian clients globally. And just to say that number has not changed significantly since then. 29:33 In terms of our general position, with respect to Russia. Clearly, we've stopped pursuing any new client business in Russia, we continue to reduce our exposure to Russia as the figures that I've just given demonstrate. We're helping our clients to unwind their own exposure and we have moved roles out of Russia. I would make it clear that we're making no new investments in our Russian subsidiaries. And have not done so since the invasion on February 24th. And I'd reiterate that as a matter of principle and policy Credit Suisse applies international sanctions worldwide in particular, those issued by Switzerland, the European Union, the UK and United States. 30:19 Let's turn to expenses now. As I said at the end of the fourth quarter, and I just reiterate now, we're guiding for adjusted operating expenses for 2022 to be around CHF17 billion. The 9% increase that we see in the adjusted operating expenses, compared to the first quarter of last year is primarily driven by two factors. First, the increased cash accruals for compensation, due to the normalization deferral rates that I referred to earlier. As you remember, as part of our response to the Archegos, and to the supply chain finance matters last year, we both reduced variable compensation overall and increased the amount deferred, thereby reducing the cash component and increasing the amount carried forward to future years. 31:13 We do not believe this is sustainable over the long-term, believe it does to a buildup in future compensation liabilities. And so we decided as we highlighted at our fourth quarter results in February, that we’re going to revert to a deferral table in line with out of our European peers for the current year. For the first quarter, all these changes had the impact of increasing compensation costs by CHF214 million overall, and that's in line with the guidance that I gave that we should expect an increase in compensation costs for the year of about CHF1 billion. 31:53 Now just to be clear, I'd stress that at this early stage in the year, we're not forecasting a change in the economic value of the awards. This reflects the change in the deferral tables. Now, the second factor driving the year-on-year increases in expenses is incremental investments of CHF152 million in the quarter. These relate both -- these relate to our strategic priorities particularly in respect to the Wealth Management businesses together with the investments in risk and compliance remediation, and the supporting work on IT systems for -- to support our growth. 32:34 I'd expect the bulk of the savings from these investments to flow through in 2023, particularly from major projects like the reunification of the IT platforms across the bank, which should yield significant savings, which I’ll discuss in more detail at our planned investor deep dive, which I’ll talk about towards the end of my presentation. 32:57 I would add though, that we are beginning to see initial cost measures savings from other measures. For example, through the outsourcing of our procurement function to Chain IQ. This arrangement went live at the start of April, and we're on track to achieve about CHF150 million of cash savings this year. 33:20 Now just to be clear, in addition to these incremental investments we have taken restructuring expenses, which feature in the reported numbers. And that totals is about CHF79 million over the past two quarters, of which CHF46 million was in the first quarter of 2022. I'd just repeat our guidance for restructuring expenses to total about CHF400 million with a balance to be utilized over the rest of this year. 33:51 Next slide please. Now what I show here is the quarter-on-quarter decline in client business volume across Wealth Management and Private Banking Switzerland, which is 5% lower at CHF1.24 trillion. This reduction is primarily driven by market moves in the period, partly offset by net new assets of CHF4.6 billion for the quarter. The majority of which were achieved in Switzerland and in Asia Pacific, notwithstanding the deleveraging environment we see in that market. 34:23 You'll note that we allocated CHF16 billion of AUM to a align – other, that includes about CHF10 billion of assets, which have been reclassified due to the impact of the sanctions imposed in connection with Russians invasion of Ukraine early this quarter. 34:44 Let's now look at capital please. Our capital and leverage ratios remain resilient. Our CET1 capital ratio was 60 basis points lower, compared to the end of the fourth quarter at 13.8%. This drop below our ambition to be at 14% pre the start of the Bal IIIR reforms in ’24, was primarily due to internal model and parameter updates with CHF2 billion of the CHF5 billion quarter-on-quarter increase in risk weighted assets, due to operational risk excluding the related FX impact. 35:20 I would note that we did see an RWA reduction of $2 billion, due to the Prime Service Exit Investment bank with a balance to increase due to FX. Our CET1 leverage and our Tier 1 leverage ratios were both unchanged quarter-on-quarter at 4.3% and 6.1% respectively. Leverage exposure overall was down by CHF11 billion, that includes a reduction of $20 billion, due to the Prime Service Exit. This was partly offset by a seasonal increase in business activity and by the weakening of the Swiss franc against the US dollar. 36:00 I'd just like to touch briefly on the Swiss CET1 capital ratio for Credit Suisse AG, the parent company. You’ll recall that in February, I mentioned the ratio had fall at the end of last year to 11.7% and then with the phase in the transitional regime to 11.4% as of January 1st 2022. At the end of the first quarter, this ratio increased to 11.8%, due to the combination of a dividend payment from Credit Suisse wise and a capital repatriation from our US Holding company, together totaling around CHF2 billion. We continue to execute on our other dividend and capital repatriation plans for 2022. Although clearly, as we said before, these remain subject to regulatory approval and I expect the bulk to arise in the second half of the year rather than the second quarter. Just in terms of the Group CET1, I just remind you that our medium term ambition remains to operate at a CET1 ratio of least 14%, pre the Bal IIIR reforms and a CET1 leverage ratio of around 4.5%. 37:13 Let me turn briefly now and let's look at net interest income sensitivity. I did want to spend a few minutes on this particularly given the level of interest rate moves that we've seen so far this year. If you look at the current exposure to rising US dollar rates on the current forward curve, we'd expect about a CHF150 million benefit in ’22, compared to ’21. And if you look at the current forward curve again into 2023, that should equate to a further CHF400 million benefit for next year, compared to ‘22. 37:46 Now, you’ll note, and I said this before, at some point we would expect the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to increase rates. Whilst we've likely benefit overall from higher euro rates, you should remember that the increase in Swiss interest rates from the current level of minus 75 basis points would result in a drop in net interest income in the Swiss Bank at least in the initial phase. 38:16 Now, let me turn now to the overviews of the new business divisions, and we report port this as usual on an adjusted basis unless I state otherwise. And let's start please with Wealth Management. Net revenues of CHF1.51 billion was 12% higher than the fourth quarter, but 22%, compared to the strong first quarter of last year. We can see that whilst both net interest income and recurring commissions and fees, declined broadly in line with a 9% fall in client business volume at 8% and 5% respectively. Transaction based revenues fell by 38%. That reflected a substantial decline in contributions to the GTS joint ventures the Investment Bank in line with the normalization of market conditions, compared to the first quarter of 2021, as well as lower brokerage and product issuance fees. 39:12 Of this CHF360 million decline in transaction based revenues, you should note the CHF59 million was directly linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. You should also note the further weighing on the divisions performance was mark-to-market losses of CHF32 million and APAC financing, compared to last year. 39:39 In terms of expenses, these were 16% high year-on-year at CHF1.27 billion, the bulk of which was due to increased cash accruals relating to the normalization of compensation deferral levels that I’ve already mentioned. But we also made further investments in technology and risk and in compliance, as well as executing the increase in our relationship manager headcount. 40:04 Now provision for credit losses of CHF24 million, included CHF40 million are primarily non-specific provisions for expected credit losses relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. I mean, the total impact of the invasion to the divisions pretax income was CHF99 million in the first quarter. Overall pretax income was 74% lower year-on-year at CHF212 million, but we did though see net new assets of CHF4.8 billion booked in the period and that's a reversal clearly of the net asset outflows that we saw in the previous quarter. 40:45 Just let me turn now to the Investment Bank. As has been the case with our peers Investment Bank revenues was specifically lower compared to the record first quarter of last year. Though they were 11% higher than the previous quarter, that is the fourth quarter of ‘21 at $2.02 billion, that still equates to a 53% reduction year-on-year. This reflects three factors. 41:12 First, our decision to exit Prime Services, which directly resulted in a year-on-year decline in revenues of $173 million. Second, our reductions in risk appetite and in allocated capital, which contributed to lower revenues, especially in leveraged finance. And third, the market disruptions caused by Russia's invasions of Ukraine, which contributed to significantly lower ECN market activity and reduced M&A fees. Overall, Russia-related losses totaled $101 million in division, primarily due to trading the fair value losses in the GTS business. 41:53 That said our equity derivatives business, while not seeing the strength to trading in the first quarter of last year still performed well in the first three months of 2022, and our fixed income results reflected normalized securitized product revenues lower than in recent periods, but still above historic levels. 42:14 Operating expenses were 6% higher year-on-year, $2.08 billion, largely due to the increased cash accruals relating to the normalization deferral levels that I mentioned before, but also to higher Group wide technology, risk and compliance costs. The division therefore delivered an adjusted pretax loss of $55 billion against a backdrop of reduced capital usage and lower client activity across all business lines. I would note that the $174 million release in the provision for credit losses relating to Archegos, as well as real estate gains, partly offset by restructuring meant that on a reported basis our pretax income was $134 million. 43:03 Now just a brief word on capital. Risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure was down by 21% and 18%, respectively, year-on-year, primarily due to reductions in Prime Services. We've also continued to allocate capital away from the Investment Bank as per our strategy and we've now reduced capital in the division by $2.5 billion compared to the end of 2020, putting us well on track to deliver our ambition of a more than $3 billion reduction by the end of ’22. 43:37 Let’s just turn to the Swiss Bank. Now as we've already said the Swiss Bank delivered another resilient performance in the first quarter. Net revenues were stable year-on-year at just over CHF1 billion, with a 7% increase in recurring commissions and fees, supported by an improved performance in our investment in the Swiss Guard and higher levels of assets under management. And that's offset by lower net interest income and decreased transaction-based revenues. 44:07 The provision for credit losses of CHF33 million includes a Russia-related impact of CHF14 million. Operating expenses were 5% higher at CHF614 million, reflecting again the normalized level of deferrals at target investments and higher -- and again, the higher Group wide technology risk and compliance costs. Overall, pretax income was 8% lower year-on-year at CHF385 million. The division saw CHF6 billion in net new assets, albeit entirely in our institutional client business rather than wealth or private banking. 44:49 Finally, let me just turn to Asset Management. Net revenues for the division were 10% lower year-on-year at CHF359 million, 48% increase in investment and partnership income more than offset by a 52% decline in performance, transaction and placement revenues. That does include a reversal of a gain that we reported a year ago in certain SEDER (ph) funds. 45:16 Now taken together with the 15% year-on-year increase in operating expenses to CHF308 million, reflecting the increased cash accruals due to normalized compensation deferral levels, the group wide investments in risk technology and compliance and CHF15 million of costs relating to the supply chain finance matter, pretax income for the quarter was CHF51 million 62% lower year-on-year. That reflects the volatile macro environment, as well as reduced activity levels and risk appetite from clients. And I just note that we saw about CHF0.6 billion of outflows in the quarter, primarily from fixed income and credit, whilst we maintained good momentum in inflows in index solutions. 46:04 Now, just before I pass to Thomas one point which I alluded to before. We're planning on hosting an Investor Deep Dive event towards the end of the second quarter, which will give us an opportunity to talk you through the progress and the plans that we have in our risk and compliance functions, our technology function and the developments in our wealth management division. Now these parts of the Group are all headed by relatively new Executive Board Members. And so, this event will also give us the chance to introduce you more formally to David Wildermuth, Rafael Lopez Lorenzo, Jo Hannaford and Francesco De Ferrari. 46:41 And on that note, I'd like to hand back to Thomas just to conclude before we open for Q&A. Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': '46:49 Thank you, David. Allow me to conclude by reiterating our 2022 priorities that you see on this page. First is to execute with discipline the detailed Group strategy and three year financial plan, which we presented at our Investor Day on November 4. Together with my colleagues on the EXP, we share a clear commitment to implementing the new strategy of strengthening the core, simplifying the organization and investing for growth. 47:21 Second, we will continue to improve, risk and compliance with an emphasis on risk, culture. Whilst not losing our client focus and the entrepreneurial spirit that has been the hallmark of Credit Suisse since its foundation more than 165 years ago. Third, we aim to reestablish franchise momentum grounded in the positive basis for growth in our four divisions with the regional overlay and supported by a disciplined approach to costs and investments. 47:53 With that let me turn to Kinner to begin the Q&A.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': \"48:01 We will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference. May I please ask everyone to stick to a maximum of two questions please. Operator, let's open the line, please.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '48:17 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Your line is now open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': '48:45 Thank you very much. Can you actually hear me well?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein', 'text': '48:48 Yes.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"48:49 Okay. Lovely. I've got two questions, and thank you very much for the slide seven in the presentation, which I thought was very useful. And really my first question is about exactly that. Could you give us a sense of the impact from the kind of derisking measures, but going forward in wealth, in particular, what are the milestones to the business normalization in wealth as you see it. Is it the finalization of the FINMA outstanding investigation? Is it the additional client reviews? Could you give us a sense, kind of, what does it take to see the kind of normalization of wealth business kind of going forward? 49:39 And the second one. Net new money, they have been relatively strong in the first quarter. Could you give us your sense of the quality and -- the quality of the flows in wealth, but also on the institutional Suisse side. Thank you very much.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"49:59 Yeah. Thank you. Magdalena. So first of all, as you can see on Page 7 in terms of the wealth management, derisking measures, they touched really on five areas, cheap financing, exit of sub-Sahara Africa markets, then the Russia related derisking, concentration risks and client risk review. And if you look at some of the lending volumes that we have, also shown in David sections, for example, on Global Wealth Management, the reduction was quite significant in terms of lending volume. So you can see, for example, net loans are down 14% since the first quarter of ‘21, you can see that on Page 23. 50:52 And what we are really have not yet seen is a rebound of that, it's actually quite the opposite. As you can also see on Page 23, net loans went down a further CHF6 billion from the end of the fourth quarter. And this was partially impacted by Russia, and partially by deleveraging in Asia. So in terms of the milestone through the wealth management normalization you could see in our chart also on page six, for example, that the Russia and AFG impact was about CHF130 million to the adjusted PTI of CHF212 million for wealth management. 51:38 And then as you go through the second, third, fourth quarter, we clearly expect and would like to drive reversal from what we've seen over the last 12 months. Namely, a reduction of lending volumes, but also clearly a more proactive approach, generally with respect to some of the transactional revenues that are related to larger transactions for our ultra-high net worth clients. So step-by-step over the next few quarters, we expect to move back to a more normalized return on regulatory capital towards the 18% that we have as a target for 2024. This will not be achieved in the next one or two quarters. But clearly, as we move over the next two years, we are moving towards that 18%, that's clearly our target under the leadership of Francesco and his team and we are fully focused on that. 52:45 Secondly, on your question on M&A. You say it was positive, yes, it was positive, but it's not nearly there where I would like it to be. It was marginally positive in every region. It was mainly positive in Switzerland and in Asia. But -- and also in our external asset management business. But I see substantial more opportunities, particularly also, for example, in the Middle East and in other area. So I have never been a big fan of quarterly NNA, because they are volatile by nature, but this will clearly be the mid-term target of Francesco and his team, both not only for assets under management, but more the entire client business volume, which was always my preferred metric, which includes also assets under custody and especially lending volumes and that's where we want to grow the business and where we see mid-term substantial growth opportunities.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"53:58 I think the only point I'd probably add Magdalena to Thomas’s points, which I agree entirely. It's just, I would say on the interest rate sensitivity, because that is clearly most noted within the Wealth Management division given where we are in the curve, because clearly the US has moved first, and that will be the benefit we should begin to see in the second half of this year and then into 2023. And I just wanted to just note that basically.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"54:26 Thank you very. Thomas, so can I just confirm that your internally driven kinds of client derisking deleveraging that we had kind of seen in wealth, over the last 12 months. It's broadly done. So what we are going to see, and I know very, very gradually, is the -- it's more of an underlying business dynamics as we move forward. Would that be fair?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': '54:53 That is fair. Yes. Absolutely.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa', 'text': '54:56 Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '54:58 Thank you. And we are now taking our next question. And the next question comes from the line from Flora Bocahut from Jefferies. Please ask your question. Your line is now open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Flora Bocahut',\n","    'text': '55:09 Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So the first question I had is regarding the cost guidance that you have provided, you gave us guidance of adjusted cost of CHF17 billion for this year. Indeed, if I annualized the adjusted cost you printed for Q1, this is the run rate we are heading too. The only issue is that the adjusted revenues has been running around CHF18 billion of annualized run rate, in the past two quarters. I understand that part of the cost guidance has to do with variable compensation in the investments that you talked about. I know the environment has been tough the past two quarters. The only issue is, it could remain so for the rest of the year. So the question, I wanted to ask you is, do you stick to the CHF17 billion cost guidance, no matter what the revenues end of being this year, which means you could be hardly profit making on an adjusted basis this year with your core Tier 1 ratio just below the target? 56:15 And the second question is actually on capital whether you could just elaborate please on any capital impact that you think could come for the rest of the year, whether you expect further increase in op risk RWA, further impact from model changes. So any other element you have in mind as of today’s standpoint on capital would be helpful? Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"56:35 Okay. Thank you very much. Let's take the two questions in turn. Look, I think there is limited cost flexibility in 2022 for two primary reasons. Firstly, I think, if we look back at ‘21, our response to Greensill and the Archegos matters was to reduce both the absolute amount of variable compensation, but also to increase the amount of deferrals. And that's what drove our cost down to just over 16 billion last year. That was the right thing to do in the circumstance. But it's not sustainable for long term and it's why I guided when we spoke earlier this year and indeed back at the Investor Day. But we'd expect to see it about 1 billion increase in our expenses. 57:23 Now that's not to say that I'm giving any particular guidance over the economic value, the total value of awards for 2022. It's much too early in this year to make that kind of statement and clearly is, flexibility in terms of that. But I think sitting here at the first quarter, I think it's appropriate to be prudent in terms of what I say about that. I think the second reason is, if we think about what we're doing in terms of risk compliance and the IT to actually support it. I think clearly, those are necessary investments we need to make as we address the issues that caused so much damage in 2021 to our results and everything else. We are obviously executing a substantial strategic cost program. So I mentioned already the outsourcing of procurement to 150 million of cash savings that should generate. We're also putting together all of our operating IT, --- operations and IT functions on Jo, so moving back to the sort of pre-2016 structure. And that should yield very significant savings, but to be clear, majority of that actually flows through in 2023. And ditto, the exit from prime. We will save money from that. 58:41 But at the moment, we're still in the rundown of that particular business. So there is whether we like it or not a significant delivery of short term inflexibility in the cost base for 2022 and I think we've warned about that before in terms of where we are now. It doesn't mean there's no flexibility. But I think that's why I'm sticking to the guidance of around 17 billion for this year. We're working very hard at this. We're considering what we should prioritize, what we should deprioritized, but there are certain things particularly around the risk and control investments that really do have to actually happen. But I think that's all I can really say, at this point early in the year, there is clearly some flexibility around variable compensation, particularly with a much lower level of deferral. You understand that the gearing through to cash is therefore higher. 59:31 I think in terms of capital, I think our medium term ambition was same. We want to have a CET1 ratio of the group of at least 14% before the Bal IV transition in 2024. We've obviously dipped slightly below that this quarter, mainly due to the 600 million increase in litigation provisions, which mathematically just drops you almost exactly by 20 basis points. I think I probably expect the ratio to rain somewhere in the 13.5% to 14% for the next six months, depending on the level of cash generation, other issues we actually deal with and how we actually allocate capital but I'd expect our CET1 ratio there afterwards to actually improve at and above our 14 % medium term target in terms of that. I think you asked specific question in terms of methodology, I think I said, back in February that we expected about 6 billion to 7 billion of methodology changes this year I think that's still the case, but clearly there will be some increase in op risk RWA above and beyond that, as we work through the impact of the litigation provisions that we took two weeks there, but I don't have a particular view at this point in terms of that number and that's something I'd expect to see in the second half of this year not in the second quarter. 60:54 So, I hope that some help. On the cost point, we are super focused on moving to a more flexible structure. But as I said, a lot of this comes through in ‘23, rather than ‘22.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Flora Bocahut',\n","    'text': '61:08 This is very clear.

Thanks very much. Good morning. So just on the trade-off to draw a little bit on that David if I may between the CET1 below target and sort of the risk capacity that the group's put into work. You've got a lot of good franchisees, which I think you've sort of sketched your not gearing with the risk they might normally take at this point. And absolutely understandably in the current circumstances but just whether you'd be happy running below the capital target for longer to put some more money back to work or whether the capital targets more of a constraint you're still a good surplus to requirements, but below your goals? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"62:16 That's a very good question, Alastair. Look, I think the target setting for the 14% is clearly in respect to the inflation we expect to see when we finally get to the B3R transition a couple of years’ time. And we want to make sure that we have sufficient buffer for that and we don't have a rerun of what we saw with the B3 transition a decade ago. But nonetheless, I think we set a medium term ambition of 14%. I've kind of said it could be in the range of 13.5% to 14% for the next six months. I think there is a balance in terms of that, in terms of putting money to work within the Wealth Management lending business in particular, and we obviously like to see that, but I think it is important that we remain prudent in terms of the group CET1 levels that we actually operate at. So that's the balance that I'm thinking about really in terms of how we actually operate. 63:12 I think we have taken some tough decisions in the first quarter, particularly around the litigation provisions, but I think those were the right things to say. And if the cost of that as we dropped to 13.8% then it is where it is, I guess. But I think it is important to really put a dent into this. As Thomas said, we've actually got through the dismissal of more than 80 cases and settled 12. So I think it's finally the right time to draw a line under this issue.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alastair Ryan', 'text': '63:42 Thank you, David.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '63:45 Thank you.

First one on Russia, I don't know, if I missed it, could you just -- did you give us an update on the percent of AUM with Russian clients. I think you previously said 4%, I'm not sure you gave an update here on that number? Then could you just talk a bit about how you're managing those kind of frozen clients, your ability to charge fees and net interest income and generally kind of how you see that going forward? That’s the first question. 64:24 Secondly, you mentioned in the Investment Bank, strong market share performance in EMEA and APAC. I just wonder whether you could talk about the products and geographies where you're below what you see as a normal market share and what it needs to get that back to normal?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"64:45 Okay. So, with respect to the AUM, as you mentioned the 4% that we outlined at the Morgan Stanley Conference, and David mentioned they have broadly been said they actually reduced a little bit, but not much. As you also saw the total AUM have also reduced given market performance and other factors. So, broadly speaking, those top number has marginally reduced, but not too much. The terms of how we deal with Russian clients, now obviously, you have the sanctioned clients and there, you basically can't touch them and basically, it's just sitting there. And then you have the other Russian clients where they are legally not sanctioned, but the fact given the rules in Switzerland and the EU, which are broadly the same is basically that they cannot bring any new assets so, but they can obviously retrieve assets. And that's really the situation that we have at the moment with those non-sanctioned Russian clients of which some of them are living in Russia, some of them are living in the west. So, but they are all subject to the restrictions that we see in the EU and in Switzerland. So that's really how it works and we do not really have any new business with Russian clients at all. 66:31 With respect to the IBCM market shares in EMEA and APAC. Yes, they were marginally up and we had some good transactions, but it's also fair to say that the overall market as you know is down significantly. And we always also see that the U.S. usually is 60% to 70% of the market. So, and we have traditionally a strong leverage finance in ECM and M&A practice and especially, leveraged finance in ECM was down more. And DCM investment grade, capital market is the market where we have lower market share. So that obviously that mix was not helpful in this first quarter. But that was just the first quarter and we'll have to now, hopefully see how capital markets activity will develop over the next couple of quarters.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee', 'text': '67:44 Great.

And we estimate that the adverse revenue impacts about 170 million in the 1Q numbers. I think so far in terms of revenue impact, it's probably similar perhaps less than what we talked about back in November either hasn't been that much of a multiplier impact. And clearly, there was a cost aspect this as well. But realistically those cost savings will only come in late in the year and into 2023 because we obviously need to ensure that our customers are actually dealt with fairly and properly as we actually transition this business. 69:20 I think in terms of Prime Service, and Thomas you may have to comment, but I have a first crack at the leverage finance type point. I think our market share and leverage finance obviously did drop in the fourth quarter of last year. I think we're just outside of the top ten. It's improved to about fifth, I think in the first quarter. I think what we are seeing as a consequence of the volatility and interest rates and to lesser extent credit markets in the first quarter is the market of shifted away from the sponsors business and perhaps more to corporate issuers. So it's slightly adverse market shift for us. But I think you can see in the numbers we've given one of the appendices is that we've got about 7.4 billion of leverage finance pipeline, and that's increased and steadily over the last few quarters. But I think as we commented in the outlook statement, I think, clearly, we are hostess to fortune in terms of the stability of markets to actually how well work and how fast we can actually execute that business.

Please ask your question.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': \"71:41 Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The first question is regarding fixed income sales in trading again. Just trying to understand how we should think about the environment, considering that the first quarter was difficult, but it was not a dislocation. And your revenues declined around 50% year-on-year. And just thinking about the run rate and the potentially impact of higher credit spreads that is having on your credit business, which is mainly a fixed income business? 72:17 And then the second question is related to your return on equity target in the Investment Bank of over 12% by 2024. I think you made clear that 2022 was restructuring year or a transformation year. But your clearly follow off looking at the numbers today and the environment actually has been reasonably good for other players. So I'm just trying to understand the path to 12% in a more difficult revenue environment.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"72:55 Yeah. So if you look at our fixed income sales and trading and the various components, so with securitized products and GTS, then you can clearly see, if you compare the Q1 significant reduction, but if you go more back, let's say the first quarter ‘20 then the -- but basically, we are up in securitized products. We are up about 30% compared to the first quarter ‘20. So had a very decent performance there. In other credit products, as you can remember ‘20 was a very strong quarter in terms of credit trading, there we are down and GTS was, which is mainly driven on the fixed income side by financing on our side as well as by FX and macro businesses, which are clearly much smaller than some of our competitors where we are also down to that comparable quarter. But It is clear that we have not the exposure that others have to certain interest rate trading business with a macro FX or commodities that some of our other peers have where they saw some benefits after dislocation created by the Russia innovation, which we do not have. So we did obviously have the benefit as we actually predicted in our 2020 Investor Day, we said that 2021 will be the year for Credit, and that is exactly what happened in the first quarter, 2021, where we saw an absolute record in our fixed income sales and trading of 1.6 billion compared to the 800 million that we now saw in the first quarter ’22, so we are half, basically of where we were. 75:05 So I don't think that the first quarter ‘22 is necessarily the right basis to look at for where we should be maybe in ’23, ‘24. The first quarter 20 was more in the 1.3 billion area. We are now at 800 million. So there's clearly upside from where we are now, but the same is true for capital markets, whether it's ECM, whether it's leverage finance where we had a very, I would say slow quarter in the first quarter like many of our peers as well. So one thing is the business mix, clearly, we have much more geared towards credit to capital markets, M&A and much less to macro. And the second is that we foresee clear improvement in some of our market shares through the investments we are making, especially around M&A and capital markets.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': \"76:12 And sorry, if I can just very briefly on the accrual of compensation, which clearly, David had highlighted a few times now on this call. The normalization that you talk about is just a year-on-year comparison issue. Going forward, clearly, you will pay higher cash components, so there will be comparable? Is that what you're trying to say?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"76:35 Yeah. I think, well, let me see if I can be helpful here. I think, as I said, the level of compensation into -- I mean response that we decided in response to Archegos and Greensill was to reduce the overall level of variable compensation as you know and we've summarized that in the comp report and the annual report. But what we also did, which we’re also clear about is we actually reduced the amount of cash and increased demand of deferral last year for many reasons, which as you know. 77:04 Now moving into ‘22 that level of deferral was not sustainable. And as you said back in November and again in February, essentially, we want to normalize that. So that's what we've actually done unless we've accrued to in the first quarter. As I said, I'm not making any particular statements around the economic value of awards for compensation this year. I mean, if you want to push me a bit, I think I've used a basis of something similar in both conversation and the strategic delivery award as the plan for the accruals. But clearly, that's at this point in the first quarter just a place market shall we say, but then I'd use that the low deferral levels to actually calculate the cash accrual, which I think is the a prudent thing to do, and I think it's the right thing to do. But clearly as we actually work through this year, we'll have to decide what is the right level for economic value and that's obviously going to depend on our performance and on the conditions in which we actually operate. 78:00 There afterwards if you're asking the question around 2023, you're right, we will then have had that step change and then we move forward basically. I don't think the banks intention necessarily will be to change that deferral plan in ‘23 compared to ‘22. But that'll will be a decision to made at the time. But I think clearly once you actually get into ‘23 then some of the cost pressures that we've seen away from this in ’22 fall away. We have clearly the savings from the integration of the technology function, which will be substantial and we'll discuss that in more detail in the deep dive and later on this quarter. And we'll have some relief elsewhere in terms obviously have the accelerating benefits from procurement outsourcing and some of the other reengineering benefits, and we'll also have the cost savings from the Prime exit, which will help the investment bank numbers. So I think certainly from a cost point of view, I think ‘22 is perhaps the most challenging year to be dealing with, provided that we manage things well going through the period.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein', 'text': '78:59 Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '79:04 Thank you.

So first actually just going back to the redivisionalization and the kind of updated numbers that were released also a few -- I guess few weeks back. It looks also like the redivisionalization was slightly different to what was initially presented at the Investor Day and in terms, some of the business movements. It seems like obviously, the sub-high net worth businesses retained within the Swiss Bank and it seemed like there's a higher IB contribution or revenue contribution than previously anticipated. Just wanted to understand some of those dynamics and whether that changes also some of a divisional kind of aspiration or target? 80:14 And the second question just relates further to restructuring and parent co-capital levels? So just wanted to understand better as well whether or not parent co-capitalization limits your ability to do further restructuring at some of the businesses, if it potentially impacts further participation values? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"80:41 Should I take the second one and then pass back to you Thomas for the PBS change. But I think in terms of the parent, I mean, I think what we've done so far in this -- in the year is pretty much in mind what I said back in February. So, I think you may recall that I was talking about something like 10 billion of dividend recap to dividends and capital repatriation to come out of the subsidiaries and into the parent to basically strengthen the ratio from the 11.4% that we had basically as of the first of January this year. And so for this year, we've moved in about 2 billion from both Switzerland and from CSH USA, and that's obviously increased the ratio to 11.8%. 81:31 And I think if we look forward to the balance this year, I think the other dividends and capital restructuring are on track. They do remain subject to regulatory approval and some of those approvals do have to go through a process that takes several months. So as I said before, I would expect those to come through primarily in the second half of this year rather than the second quarter this year. But I think, so that's really as per our plan. 82:02 I think in terms of your other question, -- which is, the answer is yes, clearly, if you have to reduce the value of those subsidiaries without further capital repatriation that has an adverse impact on the parent ratio. So it does act as some constraint in terms of what we can do basically. But I think equally if we actually think about the bank overall, when we talked about shifting 3 billion of capital from the Investment Bank to the Wealth Management businesses that's a clearly an overall MIS sense. 82:32 But in order to actually accomplish that, given that more of the investment banking business is actually in the subsidiaries compared to the branch shares. We also need to move capital to actually support our Wealth Management ambition, Amit. So I hope that's of some help at least.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"82:49 And as far as your first question is concerned, yes, indeed, we did decide to move the Swiss, private banking business, which is the high net worth as opposed to the ultra-high net worth or the external asset manager business back into the Swiss division. So, out of the three businesses which we originally were planning to move into the global wealth, we moved in indeed two, namely the Swiss Premium Clients business, which is the ultra-high network business and the Global External Asset Management business in Switzerland into Global Wealth. 83:26 But the Swiss high net worth business we decided to leave in the Swiss Bank because the collaboration between both that business and the corporate bank on one side, but secondly also with the retail bank is just too close and is in addition to that, they share, for example, the mortgage centers and they are in all the 109 branches as we have in Switzerland. So for all these reasons, we came to view it's much easier if they stay in the same division, but Serge Fehr, who runs that business, he's also on the Global Wealth Management, Management Committee. And he's very closely also liaising with our global high net worth strategy because some of the successes we've seen now in Switzerland also with CSX, for example, is something that he can also help build out internationally with the Global Wealth Management team, but we are and we'll continue to show our volumes in terms of AUM and net new assets for our Global Wealth Management business including that business going forward as well. 84:43 And in terms of the investment banking revenues. I think they are pretty much in line with what we showed already in November. And obviously, they were – through the finalization of the restatement, we had to finalize the numbers for GTS and for AFG, especially those the AFG is the Asia Finance Group and the split between Wealth Management and Investment Banking and for those two businesses went through a finalization, iteration in the first quarter, but broadly speaking there and absolutely in line with what we had already presented on the 4 of November at our Strategy Day.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Amit Goel',\n","    'text': '85:34 Okay.

So three out of the four divisional CEOs were indeed already there when we presented our presentation and Philipp Wehle, who is now the CFO of Francesco planted the numbers and plans.

But if I speak more generally, then I think it's clear to say that we had some positive developments on a number of the cases, where we have visibility to be able to settle and dismiss or reduce the scale number of those things and that reduced the RPL. 91:27 However, we did have certain adverse developments during the quarter and I think we've talked about those publicly already, but I'm not going to add to what we've said already. And therefore, we have generally reassessed our reasonably possible loss in terms of that. So there's a balance of things going on as you might say, in the RPL disclosure. And I think that's probably all I can say given the live nature of these actions. 91:54 I think more generally, I just would repeat what Thomas has already said, which is we have been making a very determined and proactive effort to seek to resolve dismiss, reduce the scale of these cases. Things such as the RMBS case is clearly date back to pre-2008, which is a very long time. And we managed to get more than 80 dismissed over the last two years. We've settled another 12. So I think we are getting through the lump of this legacy at this particular point. And hopefully, we can continue to actually work through these issues basically. But I think that's all I can really see Anke into terms of given the live nature of the materials.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Anke Reingen',\n","    'text': '92:38 Okay. Thank you very much and all the best.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '92:42 Thank you. And the final question comes from the line of Andrew Lim. Please ask your question. Your line is now open.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Lim',\n","    'text': \"92:52 Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first question is, I’m just wondering how you think about the Investment Bank strategically, whether there's opportunities are further deleveraging. And I asked is, of course, because it's a seasonally strong first quarter have done well and you've made a loss and seems be losing market share across all business lines. I mean it's supposed to be year where it's a transition rather than a big restructuring year. And I wonder just feeding on from Kian’s question, how you think about opportunities for different business lines improving for the remainder of the year? And if not, where actually some businesses could be delevered further. And you’re notably in structured products securitized products and leverage lending and whether you think about these products actually being synergistic with the rest of IB, or even synergistic with Wealth Management and whether these could be delivered? 93:56 My second question is on the CET1 target that you have a 14%. We've discussed this before, but this -- I think it's worth we're revisiting again. It's optically quite high versus peers, especially Swiss peers of yours -- and I wonder whether you think -- whether this could be lowered, perhaps like 13% or whether there's some kind of like steady state where all regulatory changes have been implemented, are other charges can be taken into account and that you feel comfortable bringing that down to a lower level or not?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"94:36 Well, perhaps should I take the second question. Sure, but that's right. So, look, I think, as I said already, I think when we announced our 14% ambition, it was last November. It was very clearly said, on the basis of the Basel 3R transition a couple of years’ time. And I think we got that point correct me anyone here, but to about a 35 billion to 40 billion increase in RWA. And I think we wanted to make sure that there were no questions around the capital ratios in the bank for that particular transition. 95:09 And I think that very much remains our position. I think if we get to 2024, and the impact is less or things have changed, then that's the decision we should make at that point, but it should be driven by a, that regulatory change, and b, let's be clear by the stress calculations we make in terms of our capital needs, and that's what will I think guide the board in terms of their views on that. But I think for this point, nothing has changed materially to justify change in that being where we want to be for that ambition. It doesn't mean we have to be there for the end of the second quarter or the end of third quarter. We're still talking about a change several years away, but couple of years away, but that's been our thinking in terms of the CET1 ratio, is that helpful Andrew.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Lim', 'text': \"95:58 That's great.

Those are the three areas where we are focused on the deleveraging and that hasn't changed. 96:35 We did mentioned some ideas at the Investor Day about some incremental opportunities potentially in other areas, where we -- in principle see ourselves as strong players and market leading franchises.

Welcome and thank you for joining Credit Suisse Group's Second Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call for Analysts and Investors. [Operator Instructions] The conference is recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Kinner Lakhani, Head of Investor Relations and Group Strategy and Development. Please go ahead, Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Alice. Welcome, everyone. Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse second quarter earnings release published this morning. Let me remind you that our second quarter financial report and accompanying financial statements for the period will be published on or around July 29. I will now hand over to Axel Lehmann, our Group Chairman, who will elaborate on the announcements from this morning; followed by Group CEO Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.\\nAxel Lehmann: Thank you, Kinner. And good morning and thank you for joining our analysts call. Today, we announced a series of important changes, most notably a new CEO and a repositioned strategy. Let me spend the next couple of minutes elaborating a little bit more in detail before handing over to Thomas and David for their respective presentation. Credit Suisse is undoubtedly facing a challenging situation both structurally and via the markets in which we operate. The need for change was clear before the second quarter results, but the disappointing performance has added a sense of urgency, as well conviction, for our actions. That is why the Board of Director has decided to take decisive actions to reposition our bank and to strengthen the performance, the reputation and credibility of the bank. With conviction, we are now embarking on measures to speed up our transformation course with a clear direction for the bank and a new leadership. Our goal is to become a stronger, simpler and more efficient bank with sustainable returns. As announced earlier today, the Board of Director accepted the resignation of Thomas Gottstein. Thomas has led the bank through some of its most challenging corporate period; and he has done it with a lot of courage, energy and commitment as well as huge personal integrity. His absolute dedication and commitment to the bank over the past 2 decades are beyond commendable. The Board of Director is grateful to Thomas for the leadership he has provided during the global COVID-19 pandemic as well as in the aftermath of the 2 incidents in 2021. Thank you, Thomas. And yet as the bank embarks on a new course, both Thomas and the Board of Directors agreed that this should be under a new leadership free to steer a new course. Ulrich Körner will oversee the detailed work required as part of the comprehensive strategic review with the full trust and support of the Board of Directors. Ulrich is an experienced transformation leader with excellent judgment and has demonstrated to the Board of Directors that he understands the urgency of the task and the need to build trust across our stakeholder base. Ulrich has significant and highly relevant experience as CFO, COO and a business CEO from his previous 11 years at Credit Suisse, including as an Executive Board member. At UBS, he was also a business CEO and the Group COO as well as a group Executive Board member. Since returning to Credit Suisse, he has rebuilt the Asset Management business with a new strategic direction and a high-performing team. He's one of the few executives in the industry with both front-to-back and back-to-front leadership experience. I personally value him as a strategic thinker with a solution-oriented approach and a clear focus on execution and delivery. He has highly relevant experience in all our core businesses and in structural cost base transformation for corporate functions. You will shortly hear from both Thomas and David on our second quarter results. They clearly do not reflect the strengths and the potential of our global franchise. Our reported pretax loss of CHF 1.2 billion was partially impacted by major litigation provisions as part of our approach to proactively resolve legal cases. At the same time, we had reported an adjusted pretax loss of CHF 0.4 billion. This is disappointing, and we will address that step by step over the coming months and quarters. The Board of Directors, together with senior management, has been conducting a strategic review of the bank's businesses, with the goal to shape a more focused, agile group with a significant lower absolute cost base, capable of delivering sustainable returns for all stakeholders and first-class service to clients. The Board of Directors' strategic review will recommend a new model for Credit Suisse with the following objectives: first, to strengthen the world-class global Wealth Management franchise, leading universal bank in Switzerland and multi-specialist Asset Management business; secondly, to transform the Investment Bank into a capital-light advisory-led banking business and a more focused markets business that complements the growth of the Wealth Management and Swiss Bank franchises; thirdly, to evaluate strategic options for the securitized products business, which may include attracting third-party capital; and fourthly, to reduce the group's absolute cost base to below CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term, executed with prudence while remaining focused on improving risk management and risk culture. In short, the priority of the strategic review will be to enhance our positions in Wealth Management, the Swiss Bank and Asset Management while considering options for fundamentally reshaping the Investment Bank into a highly competitive banking and more sustainable markets business. The development and implementation of the new strategy will be overseen by the full Board of Directors and supported by a [Board-led ad hoc] investment bank strategy committee, with Michael Klein as Chair; and also including Mirko Bianchi, Richard Meddings and Blythe Masters. In closing. We remain focused on improving risk management as well as the risk culture across the group. We remain focused to speed up our transformation and disciplined execution. And I'm absolutely convinced that, under the leadership of our new CEO, Ulrich Körner, and the rest of our strong Executive Board, we have the right leadership team in place to transform and to deliver. We will provide further details on the progress, including specific performance goals, with our third quarter 2022 results. Thanks for your attention. And with this, I would like -- hand over now to Thomas. Thomas?\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, Axel. And thank you for, yes, your kind words. And thank you all for joining our second quarter 2022 results presentation. I will share some personal remarks before the Q&A at the end. We have reported, as we just heard also from Axel, an adjusted pretax loss of CHF 0.4 billion and a reported pretax loss of CHF 1.2 billion. Clearly the broader economic and geopolitical environment remained difficult over the first half of the year. Financial markets entered 2022 dealing with some of the highest inflation rates in the generation, putting strain on household spending and most financial assets. Nonetheless, this is clearly disappointing and does not reflect, as Axel also said, the strength and potential of our world-class franchise. This makes it imperative for us to take further solid actions to turn the bank around. We must and we believe we will restore Credit Suisse to its premium position in global finance. Let's turn to Page 4, please. As you can see on this slide, our adjusted PTI of CHF 0.4 billion was primarily driven by a $0.9 billion adjusted pretax loss in the Investment Bank. And our reported pretax loss of CHF 1.2 billion was further impacted by major litigation provisions, Allfunds-related losses and restructuring charges, totaling CHF 0.7 billion. At the same time, we maintained a strong capital position with a CET1 capital ratio of 13.5%, which is in line with our guidance; a CET1 leverage ratio of 4.3%; and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.1%. I'm also pleased to say that we already achieved our year-end 2022 ambition of releasing more than $3 billion in allocated capital from the Investment Bank by the end of this quarter. We have launched a group-wide comprehensive review with the objective to strengthen our world-class Wealth Management, leading universal bank in Switzerland and multi-specialist Asset Management business. At the same time, our plan is to transform our Investment Bank with the aim of achieving a less-complex, capital-light advisory-led banking business; and a more connected markets business that further supports the growth of our Wealth Management and Swiss Bank divisions. We are also assessing strategic options for our market-leading securitized products business. We think there are exciting opportunities to accelerate growth and to further strengthen its competitiveness by attracting third-party capital. Additionally, we are targeting an absolute cost base for the group of below CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term, supported by a broader cost efficiency and digital transformation. Strengthening risk management and risk culture as well as addressing legacy issues remain an absolute priority. We are also focused on working through our regulatory remediation program, supported by the Strategic Regulatory Remediation Committee chaired by David Wildermuth to oversee delivery of our programs. Next slide, please. For the first half, we reported a group adjusted pretax loss of CHF 0.1 billion, with the robust performance of the Swiss Bank and positive contribution of our Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses offset by a challenged performance from the Investment Bank. The reported pretax loss of CHF 1.6 billion was primarily driven by major litigation expenses of CHF 1.1 billion as part of our approach to proactively resolve legacy cases, as well as a loss on Allfunds of CHF 0.5 billion. Next slide, please. The performance of our Wealth Management division reflected higher net interest income benefiting from rising interest rates, which was more than offset by lower recurring commissions and fees and transaction revenues impacted by the adverse market environment. Our operating expenses in the second quarter were 18% higher due to higher group-wide technology, risk and compliance costs; as well as investments in relationship managers and China. While we attracted inflows in APAC and the Americas in the second quarter, reflecting our franchise strength, we reported moderate net outflows overall mainly due to outflows from Switzerland and the EMEA region. In addition, in the first half, we attracted positive net new assets of CHF 3.4 billion, which included Russia-related outflows of CHF 1.9 billion. Our Investment Bank performance was impacted by substantially lower ECM and leveraged finance market activity as well as leveraged finance mark-to-market losses. At the same time, we delivered higher advisory revenues and strong equity derivatives and macro trading benefiting from increased market volatility. Our Swiss Bank continued to show a resilient performance, with net revenues up 3% across all major line items, partly offset by normalized provisions for credit losses and higher operating expenses. The return on regulatory capital was 12%. Our Asset Management division was impacted by the challenging market environment, with net asset outflows of CHF 6.1 billion driven by outflows across both traditional and alternative investments, only partially offset by inflows from investments and partnerships. David will explain the divisional performance in more detail. Slide 7, please. Let me spend a few minutes on the performance of the Investment Bank. In this context, it is important to remember that our franchise mix, which particularly benefited us in a year like 2021, has been much less supportive in the recent environment given our much more limited exposure to macro and rates as well as commodities. In addition, we still have a very significant negative PTI drag in equities from exiting Prime Services, as we have lost 98% of revenues but still have a large part of the costs. Our strong positions across both ECM and leveraged finance were impacted by the substantial slowdown in market activity. In addition, we also experienced leveraged finance mark-to-market losses of $245 million. However, we saw an increase in advisory revenues of 37% from a year earlier. And we were also involved in 5 of the 6 top IBCM fee events. We have a market-leading franchise in securitized products, and while our financing pipeline is robust, revenues were lower than a year earlier in the context of widening credit spreads. Our second quarter equity derivatives performance was the best in recent history. Next slide, please. In our Wealth Management division, we report an increase in net interest income driven by higher interest rates. In this context, we expect higher rates to add about CHF 800 million to the Wealth Management net interest income by 2024 versus 2021. In the context of challenging markets, our recurring commissions and fees were lower, reflecting weaker AUM and broadly stable margins, while our transaction-based revenues were impacted by the risk-averse client sentiment. We continue to invest in relationship managers, in technology and in risk and compliance. Next slide, please. We are a top 2 global wealth manager outside the United States with CHF 1.2 billion client business volume and strong exposure to higher-growth markets. We have world-class investment bank franchises across, amongst others, IBCM, securitized products and equity derivatives. We are also a leading universal bank in Switzerland with a #1 position in investment banking and in institutional clients and top 2 positions in corporate banking and wealth management. We are also a multi-specialist asset manager with distinct strength. As highlighted before, we are taking strategic actions to further strengthen our Wealth Management, Swiss Bank and Asset Management divisions; and to transform our Investment Bank with the aim of achieving a less-complex, capital-light advisory-led and more connected business that further supports the growth of our Wealth Management and Swiss Bank divisions. Next slide, please. Over the past 7 years, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet and capital ratios. We maintained a resilient capital base with our CET1 ratio at 13.5%, in line with our guidance. And our CET1 leverage ratio stands at 4.3%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.1% is amongst the highest in our peer group, if not the highest. Next one, please. Let me briefly touch on our ongoing digital transformation, led by our Chief Technology and Operations Officer, Joanne Hannaford, which we expect will open up new opportunities and drive and accelerate change across the entire bank. These efforts should contribute, together with our broader cost efficiency program, to reducing group adjusted operating expenses to below CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term, as I previously mentioned. Next page, please. We have come to the conclusion, and as Axel explained before, that we need to consider alternatives to go well beyond last year's strategic review, particularly given the challenging market environment. We are currently conducting a strategic review to evaluate ways to further strengthen our Wealth Management, Swiss Bank and Asset Management divisions; and to extend their leadership positions. We are assessing a further transformation of our Investment Bank into a capital-light advisory-led banking business and a more focused and connected markets business that complements the growth of the Wealth Management and Swiss Bank franchises. We are also evaluating strategic options for our market-leading securitized products, which may include attracting third-party capital into this high-return platform and potentially freeing up additional resources for the bank's growth areas. This highly profitable global franchise, which employs around 20 billion of risk-weighted assets, has significant untapped growth opportunities. And lastly, we have embarked on an ambitious new plan to significantly reduce our absolute cost base to below the CHF 15.5 billion which I mentioned before in the medium term. David will talk more about this plan in his section. And with this, I would like to hand over to David, and I will come back after his presentation. Thank you.\\nDavid Mathers: Thank you, Thomas. And good morning to everybody. I'd like to go through now the key financials and give some more details on our performance at the group and the divisional levels. Quite clearly, as Thomas has summarized, a very difficult macroeconomic environment which has been characterized by the rapid increases in interest rates has resulted in a disappointing quarter for the group. Let me start then with the group numbers. We've achieved an adjusted pretax loss of CHF 442 million for the quarter compared to an adjusted pretax income of CHF 1.31 billion for the same period of last year. At a reported level, the pretax loss was CHF 1.17 billion. I will take you through the walk in more detail on the next slide, but this reported figure includes a further valuation loss of CHF 168 million on our -- on the mark-to-market moves in the publicly listed Allfunds Group as well as major litigation provisions totaling CHF 434 million. These primarily relate to 2 matters: first, to our investigations into record-keeping requirements relating to business communications sent over unapproved devices; and second, in respect of a previously disclosed legacy legal matter. Now if we just focus on the adjusted loss of CHF 442 million. This comprises adjusted net revenues of CHF 3.82 billion and adjusted operating expenses of CHF 4.2 billion. Now to be clear: These adjusted revenues include $245 million of mark-to-market losses in respect of our leveraged finance underwriting book, the majority of which are unrealized. We've also taken CHF 100 million of impairments and charges, nonoperational charges, in our Wealth Management business, all of which are reflected in the adjusted pretax loss number. Provisions for credit losses in the quarter were CHF 64 million compared to a release last year when we were able to write back some of our nonspecific provisions that were taken during the COVID pandemic. Now in terms of our effective tax rate, as you know, we have certain nondeductible items such as funding and litigation costs, together with our constraints on our ability to recognize further deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. That means that we do have an absolute tax charge even when the bank is reporting a loss for the quarter. The overall effect therefore is that our net loss attributable to shareholders for the quarter was CHF 1.59 billion. Next slide, please. What we show here is the impact that our adjusting items had on our underlying performance both in the second quarter and in the context of the first half. Now I'm not going to go into detail on every item, but just going from left to right, [along] the top line representing the second quarter, you can see the impact of the fall in the market value of Allfunds of CHF 168 million, which I've mentioned already; a charge of CHF 13 million relating to some of the ongoing work around Archegos; CHF 80 million of restructuring costs; and most importantly, the CHF 434 million in respect of major litigation provisions. There was a small element of gains from real estate totaling CHF 7 million in the quarter. And we also had a small goodwill impairment relating to the transfer in the second quarter of a portion of AFG to the Investment Bank, which cost us [$23 million]. Now if we look at the reconciliation for the first half, you can see that the reported pretax loss of CHF 1.6 billion translates into an adjusted pretax loss of CHF 1.42 million -- CHF 142 million. The key point I'd make is that, if you take together the major litigation provisions and the valuation loss on our investment in Allfunds, that accounts for more than the total pretax loss. While the loss of more than CHF 0.5 billion on Allfunds is a function of the company's share price portfolio, the provisions for major litigation, though clearly significant, are indicative of the progress that we are making to resolve these issues. Now as Thomas has already summarized in the context of the comprehensive view of our strategy, both the Executive Board and the Board of Directors have concluded that, given the significant change in the operating environment which may well be sustained for some time, our cost base needs to be lowered. We're therefore looking to accelerate our digital transformation program, including a further simplification of our front-to-back processes, reduction of manual data handling and duplication and increased use of scalable cloud-based infrastructure. I'm sure you'll recall that at last month's investor deep dive we identified at least CHF 650 million of savings in the CTOO function. We'll look to build on this. And taking alongside our broader cost efficiency initiatives, we expect this digital transformation program to play a critical part in reducing our adjusting operating expenses to our new target to be below CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term. This program is extensive and far reaching. We've done a lot of work with outside consultants on our benchmarking, and the savings will be significantly larger than those which we summarized back in June. Clearly this will constitute a new cost program, under the SEC rules, but with associated guidance we provided around the expected incremental restructuring costs. And I'll give more details on that when we report our third quarter earnings at the end of October. Now just to be crystal clear: This is our net expense ambition. That is net of investment spend that we continue to allocate to our core businesses. Therefore, the gross ambition that we will give in October is likely to be in excess of the new guidance in reduction in costs of CHF 1 billion to CHF 1.5 billion. Now just in the interim, our adjusted operating expenses in the first half totaled CHF 8.4 billion on an FX-neutral basis. And if you annualize that, that comes out at CHF 16.8 billion, which is clearly in line with our existing guidance of CHF 16.5 billion to CHF 17 billion. And that does include significant incremental investments relating to the implementation of the group strategy as well as increased remediation spend on compliance and infrastructure, which totaled about CHF 331 million in the first half of the year. Let's turn now to client business volume, please. Clearly we have seen a significant sell-off in the markets across most asset classes in the second quarter. And this has accounted for the bulk of the 6% quarter-on-quarter decline in client business volumes to CHF 1.16 trillion. Within this fall, we saw a reduction of CHF 53 billion in assets under management primarily due to market moves; [and also] CHF 4 billion and CHF 18 billion in net loans and custody assets, respectively. Now with regard to net new assets, we saw net asset outflows totaling CHF 1.8 billion across Wealth Management and Private Banking Switzerland in the quarter. These primarily occurred in the EMEA region, largely related to non-sanctioned Russian clients totaling CHF 1.4 billion and certain Middle Eastern clients totaling CHF 2 billion. I'm pleased to note, though, that the Asia Pacific region, having delivered positive inflows in the first quarter, has now continued this momentum in the second quarter. And you may recall that we did comment on deleveraging in Asia Pacific last year. So the total net new asset inflow for the first half was CHF 2.8 billion. Can we turn to the next slide, please? So let me just give some more detail, please, into the impact of the significant upward move on interest rates both in the short term and through the forward curve. I would anticipate that the benefit to Credit Suisse in 2024 will be approximately CHF 1 billion compared to 2021. Now the majority of this, as we said back in June, will flow through the Wealth Management division, as it has the greatest exposure to U.S. dollars, but we'd also expect to see some benefit in this division from the movement in euro rates. One point that I would note is that the benefit that we expect to see from the upward move in the U.S. dollar and euro curves will be partly offset by the move in Swiss franc rates toward 0. I think, as you know, the major Swiss banks have been -- have an exemption threshold which is maintained by the Swiss National Bank, which has given us a benefit of around CHF 400 million per year whilst rates were set at minus 75 basis points. And I think you're aware that similar structures exist with -- in Europe with the ECB, for example. Now what does that mean? It means, as Swiss interest rates converge toward 0, that benefit is being and will continue to be eroded until we start to see a credit when rates move into positive territory. Now one final point just for the sake of completeness. We have seen an increase in the costs of our capital instruments due to the movement in credit spreads in the course of this year. And I would expect this to very partly offset the benefit of the upward trend in interest rates by about CHF 200 million in 2022 against 2021. Next slide, please. Now despite the challenging environment, our capital and leverage ratios remain resilient. As we guided at the beginning of June, our CET1 capital ratio at the end of the second quarter was 30 basis points lower than at the end of the first quarter at 13.5%. Our risk-weighted assets increased by CHF 1 billion to CHF 274 billion. And as you can see from the slide, FX moves was largely offset by a CHF 4 billion reduction in RWA usage across our business lines. Our CET1 leverage ratio and our Tier 1 leverage ratio were both unchanged at 4.3% and 6.1%, respectively. Our leverage exposure overall fell by CHF 15 billion in the quarter primarily due to reductions in business usage across all divisions. The CHF 13 billion reduction in the IB that you see there includes $6 billion from the exit from prime which is now largely complete. Just looking forward, as we've said in our media release today, we'd expect the CET1 ratio to be in the range of 13% to 14% for the balance of the year. Just a brief comment on the Swiss CET1 ratio for Credit Suisse AG, the parent. This was 40 basis points lower quarter-on-quarter at 11.4%, driven both by the net losses but also by adverse FX impacts because we cannot fully neutralize both parent and group through FX moves and particularly the strength in the U.S. dollar. That was partly offset by some continued progress on our capital repatriation program, which included a $1.2 billion capital distribution from the U.K. entity CSSEL, Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited, to Credit Suisse AG. And I'd reiterate what I said about this program at the end of April, which is that we continue to execute our dividend and our capital repatriation plans for '22, although clearly the progress in these plans do remain subject to regulatory approval. And I would expect the bulk of them to materialize, though, in the second half of the year. Now with respect to additional Tier 1 capital, we expect to issue between CHF 2 billion to CHF 4 billion of AT1 capital this year, of which [$1.65 billion] has been issued already. This is both to maintain our Tier 1 ratios but also to prefund AT1 redemptions that are actually scheduled for 2023. Let me now turn to the different business divisions, which we report as usual on an adjusted basis unless stated otherwise. And let me start with wealth. Now the Wealth Management division continued to see a challenging environment in the second quarter, albeit with adjusted pretax income adversely affected by certain asset impairments and nonoperational charges. I'd like to call out 4 factors, please, which are all included, just to be clear, in the adjusted numbers. First, revenues were adversely affected by impairments of CHF 17 million related to certain third-party assets. Second, the ongoing fee waiver program relating to the supply chain finance matters reduced revenues by another CHF 24 million. Third, we saw mark-to-market losses in APAC financing of CHF 21 million. And finally, the cost line was negatively impacted by a CHF 38 million write-off in respect of certain IT-related assets relating to the digital program for the Wealth Management division. We have, as I've noted already, begun to see the significant benefit from the rise in interest rates, which helped net interest income to increase by 4% year-on-year and by 9% quarter-on-quarter to CHF 558 million. The 14% year-on-year reduction in recurring commissions and fees reflected lower assets under management, albeit broadly stable margins. The more cautious sentiments amongst clients, which adversely affected brokerage and structured product fees, contributed to an 11% reduction in transaction-based revenues. And overall, therefore, net revenues for the Wealth Management division declined by 7% to CHF 1.44 billion. With regard to expenses within the Wealth Management division. These increased year-on-year from CHF 1.14 billion to CHF 1.34 billion. This was due to the investments that we're making in business growth, including in China; as well as higher group-wide technology, risk and compliance costs. It also includes, just to be clear, the CHF 38 million [IT-related] impairment. Now adjusted pretax income was therefore 74% lower year-on-year at CHF 114 million. And if you include the valuation loss on our investment in Allfunds, which is booked to this division, the reported figure was a pretax loss of CHF 96 million. As I said already, we saw net asset outflows of CHF 1.4 billion in the division, with net outflows from EMEA and Switzerland partly offset by net inflows in APAC and the Americas. For the first half of the year, net new assets in the division was positive CHF 3.4 billion. Now let me turn now to the Investment Bank. I think quite clearly this was a disappointing quarter for the Investment Bank. This reflects the combination of a mix in business lines, which was partly affected by the heightened market volatility resulting from the move in interest rates, together with significantly lower client activity. I think, as you can see from the slide, this was most notable in capital markets which saw a 96% decline year-on-year to $38 million, but you should note that this figure does include the markdowns of $245 million on our leveraged finance portfolio which I referred earlier. And just to be clear on that point: Those marks are largely unrealized. Our accounting policy is to mark those commitments [to market when] -- as we actually see them. And I think that is the prudent and correct thing to do. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were 32% lower year-on-year at $622 million primarily due to lower emerging markets trading and financing activity; as well as reduced securitized products trading activity, although that does compare to what was a very strong quarter in 2021; as well as reduced credit revenues with lower primary issuance and reduced trading volumes. Now as has been the case in previous quarters, reduced adjusted equity revenues, which were 33% lower at $340 million, was primarily due to the exit [from the most] of our prime service businesses. Taken as a whole, net revenues for the division was 55% lower year-on-year at $1.15 billion. Now just against this weak picture, I would note that we did see higher GTS revenues due to strong equity derivatives and macro trading activity resulting from the increased market volatility, albeit this was partly offset by lower emerging markets trading and financing activity. We also saw a strong performance in advisory, where a significant deal closing grow revenues -- drove revenues 37% higher to $190 million. Operating expenses were flat year-on-year at $1.95 billion, as reduced revenue-related expenses was offset by higher technology, risk and compliance costs. The provision for credit losses of $57 million reflects an increase in both specific and nonspecific provisions compared to a net release of $56 million in the second quarter of last year. [Division] total RWA was down by 8% and leverage was down by 4% quarter-on-quarter. Let me turn now to Asset Management. The Asset Management division's performance was adversely affected by the sell-off in markets in the second quarter and corresponding -- and the corresponding reductions in the market value of assets, but we did also see a reduction in client risk appetite. Net revenues was 25% lower year-on-year at CHF 311 million, primary driver being performance, transaction and placement revenues which were 94% lower at CHF 5 million. The 9% fall in recurring management fees was primarily driven by the 9% year-on-year drop in assets under management, which was due to market and FX effects in large amount. We are disappointed, though, at the level of net asset outflows which totaled CHF 6.1 billion in the second quarter. This was driven by outflows across both traditional and alternative investments, partly offset by inflows from investments and partnerships, but I would note this net new asset performance does in part reflect the roll-off profile of funds within the portfolio as well as the decline in client risk appetite. Operating expenses in the division were CHF 278 million, which was 5% lower year-on-year. The release of certain provisions relating to the supply chain finance funds matter was partly offset by higher technology, risk and compliance costs; as well as increased cash accruals for compensation due to normalized deferral levels. Overall adjusted pretax income was 75% lower year-on-year at CHF 31 million. Now let me just conclude then with a few words on the Swiss Bank. I think it's quite clear that the Swiss Bank has continued to perform well amidst the wider market turbulence. At CHF 1.05 billion, net revenues was higher both sequentially and year-on-year, with a 3% increase compared to the second quarter of 2021. We saw solid improvements in net interest income, recurring commissions and fees and transaction-based revenues with higher deposit income and higher revenues from FX transactions. And we continue to benefit from the post-COVID recovery at Swisscard. As I mentioned before, though, we do expect the net interest income for the third quarter will decrease sequentially due to the Swiss National Bank's decision to increase interest rates from minus 75 basis points to minus 25 basis points. Now our provision for credit losses was higher than a year ago [when we weren't able] to release certain nonspecific provisions taken during the early stages of the pandemic, but they're clearly lower than in the first quarter of the year. And our provisioning does remain at consistently low levels at less than 5 basis points of our net loan total. Now of the CHF 18 million provision that we took in the quarter, about CHF 13 million was in respect of Russia exposure. Operating expenses were 6% higher year-on-year at CHF 627 million. That increase is -- reflects both increased cash accruals for compensation due to normalized deferral levels; as well as higher technology, risk and compliance costs; and additional spending on advertising and marketing campaigns. This increase more than offset the higher revenues, meaning that the Swiss Bank reported an adjusted pretax income of CHF 402 million, about 10% lower year-on-year but 4% higher than in the previous quarter. Our client business volume was 6% lower year-on-year mainly due to decreased assets under management due to market moves. And in terms of net new assets, we did see outflows in the quarter mainly driven by outflows of CHF 1.2 billion from institutional clients and CHF 400 million from our private client business, but I'd just remind you that, for the first half of the year, the division has attracted CHF 4.4 billion of net new assets, again primarily from institutional clients. Now with that, let me hand back to Thomas. And then we can move to Q&A. Thank you very much.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you, David. I would like to close with some personal remarks. As you will have seen by now, it is with regret that I announced my stepping down as CEO after 2.5 years. It has been an absolute privilege and honor to serve Credit Suisse over the past 23 years. Ever since I joined the firm in Investment Banking in London in 1999, my passion always was to serve clients with care and discipline but also with the famous Credit Suisse entrepreneurial spirit which we must preserve and never lose. I'm immensely proud of what we have achieved together since I joined the Executive Board in 2015, initially as the CEO of the SUB division and later as Group CEO. Despite the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the 2 major incidents which Credit Suisse had to face in 2021 and then the Ukraine invasion and market downturn this year, we made significant progress in strengthening our bank, recruiting an excellent leadership team, starting the transformation of our Investment Bank, reducing risk overall and fundamentally improve our risk culture. In the last few weeks, I had several discussions with Chairman Axel Lehmann about the future of the bank in the context of the already mentioned challenges and in light of my own situation. Based both on personal and health-related considerations, I concluded that now would be the right time to step aside, clearing the way for a new leadership to fully embrace a series of game-changing initiatives announced this morning, all of which I wholeheartedly support. I know that our disappointing first half results don't reflect the inherent strength and potential of the powerful global Credit Suisse brand, but I am convinced that we are on the right path to restore Credit Suisse to its premium position in global finance. This is a formidable institution with world-class client franchises in the markets in which we operate. And this is a testament to the quality of our over 50,000 colleagues globally and our exceptional talent pool, many of whom have become friends over the last 23 years and we will stay in touch. I am very happy that Ulrich has agreed to take over the baton as Group CEO and lead the Executive Board at this important juncture in time. He's excellently positioned to take this bank to the next level given his analytical skills, his experience and his knowledge of Credit Suisse from both his most recent engagement but also his previous work at our firm. I will work closely with Ulrich over the coming weeks to ensure a smooth transition. And with that, I would like to hand back to Kinner, who actually has his birthday today.\\nKinner Lakhani: Okay, okay, so we will now begin with the Q&A part of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Alice, it would be great if we could open the line, please. Thank you.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas.\\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you in particular to Thomas. And best wishes for the team taking the group forward from here. I've got 2 questions. One is on the strategy review. I realize we'll need to wait to hear the conclusions, but I wanted to hear about how that review is being framed. And in particular, the cost target you're indicating seems to be a relatively limited change in the scope of the group. It's described more in terms of efficiencies rather than a change in scope, so I just wondered whether you're effectively ruling out significant changes in the shape and the scope of the group as you go into that review. And then my second question is more a numbers question for David, if you could just walk us through -- you talked about the RWA movements, but I wondered if you could talk us through the capital movements because capital reduced quite a lot less than the loss for the quarter. So I just wondered if you could talk us through the moving parts and what helped capital in the quarter.\\nDavid Mathers: Sure. I can probably take the second one, first, which I think, Jeremy -- and I think you probably just need to look at FX moves because there was a notable strengthening in the U.S. dollar in the second quarter. As we hedge forward about 65% of our equity into U.S. dollars, you'll see an appreciation in the capital base. So it's the point I referred to in my script. We neutralized the group CET1 ratio, but as the parent has a different ratio, we can't neutralize both at the same time, so that will boost the underlying group equity. Should I have a start on the first question, Thomas and Axel, and then perhaps [Indiscernible]?\\nUnidentified Company Representative: [Indiscernible].\\nDavid Mathers: I mean I think -- look. I think the cost reduction program is absolute priority for the Board and for executive management. We are perhaps more advanced with this than the other work because we actually started a very extensive benchmarking work in the first quarter. I think therefore, on that basis, we can say 2 or 3 things. Firstly, if we look at the current perimeter, the current -- of the bank, then we believe it is perfectly possible to operate this on the [basis of the analysis] we've done at less than CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term. Clearly we need to do our remediation programs. Those are clearly critical, but on the basis of the current structure of the bank, we think a cost target less than CHF 15.5 billion is perfectly achievable. That clearly does not preclude, and I'll pass back to Axel and Thomas, any changes in the perimeter. Clearly, if we changed the perimeters of the bank, that cost target would actually change. So that's, as you might say, Jeremy, a like-for-like view in terms of what can be achieved.\\nAxel Lehmann: Yes. And maybe -- this is Axel Lehmann. Just to complement on the cost target: Yes, we did that benchmarking. And I think it's quite a notching up from what we said last November as we commit to an absolute cost target based on the current perimeter of the group. And what I said earlier, we are in a strategic review with a clear plan and the objective to make that group even more focused on the core Swiss business, Wealth Management and Asset Management; and a highly focused, highly competitive banking and a better-aligned markets business. And as we go now through the third quarter, we will develop the detailed plan and then give you the details also on the performance targets and or the targets that we will communicate to the market. And Ulrich is now obviously in-charge. Thomas was fantastic helping us to bring us to the point where we are. And now we go into kind of third and in the fourth quarter and speeding up, speeding up our [overall] transformation.\\nJeremy Sigee: That's very helpful. And as I say, best wishes for all the work that's underway.\\nDavid Mathers: Jeremy, one point. You might also want to look at [OCI] moves, although they don't have the same capital relevance but -- just to complete it. Mostly it's FX [there].\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa with Morgan Stanley.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Well, of course, firstly, Thomas, I would also like to extend my thanks to you for the years we all worked together and wish you all the best for the future as well. I've got 2 questions, 1 still on strategy, another 1 on costs. Now on the strategy, I suppose, kind of similarly to the question before, could you just explain to us kind of what sort of options would you consider for the Investment Bank, where you've relooked at that operations very, very carefully kind of last year as well? And maybe in more detail, what are the kind of theoretical options, particularly with that capital option for the securitized product platform? Just so that we get a sense of what type of changes may come. And maybe on costs, and that's particularly on wealth -- and I'm going to kind of concentrate on what's happening kind of currently. Could you run us through kind of what sort of cost pressures you're actually likely to see in the short term, particularly on the compensation side, on the retention side and, of course, on some of the IT investments that are already coming through?\\nThomas Gottstein: So first of all, thank you, Magdalena, for your kind words. I suggest you start, David, with the second question, on costs, the short-term pressures. And then maybe, Axel, he will take the options for the Investment Bank.\\nDavid Mathers: Well, look. I think, as I said before, there's been quite a lot of work that's been put into the cost program and actually very detailed benchmarking at -- in every aspect of the bank to actually support this analysis. I think that has indicated significant potential even absent the strategy review. And I think quite clearly, I mean, Thomas has very much led this. I think you know we actually have outsourced our procurement function. And I think what has been clear from that outsourcing is that there are significant potential in -- for savings in some of our supplier relationships, and that does include some of our managed servicing arrangements. So I guess, brutally, Magdalena, we're paying too much. And I think, as part of the pressure around the procurement function and the outsourcing, we do see savings there. And that will give us the ability to offset to a degree at least, because one has to recognize the inflationary pressures in the system, what we're seeing outside. And it's -- that's -- I guess it's a problem, but in that sense it's an opportunity to actually achieve that. I think the second point -- and Jo Hannaford spoke eloquently about this at the Investor Day back in June. I think we made the right and brave decision to put IT and operations back together as a single function. That's transformational in terms of what it can actually drive us in terms of scale benefits, but I think -- beyond that, I think it brings back centralized IT control, which is the right thing to do, and the ability to actually drive our IT much more effectively, so as you can guess, I'm very supportive about this. And I think it does give us potential, so I'm not decrying the cost pressures we see in the system, but I think we can, I can see 2 large levers there. And when I look at the much more detailed work that we've done across the rest of the bank, I can see how we can drive towards the CHF 1 billion to CHF 1.5 billion total for our current perimeter. And as we've said, I think that really takes us in 2 directions, one, as Axel has and Thomas has said already, in terms of the strategy review. And I think, two, basically we will obviously need to deliver gross savings in excess of that net target in order to allow for our investment plan and [to a degree] to offset the inflationary factors you're referring to, Magdalena.\\nAxel Lehmann: This is Axel speaking, Magdalena. Through the strategy, first of all, we will leverage all the work, the good work, that the group has done last year. We also feel, from a senior executive, also from a Board perspective, encouraged by the progress on strategy implementation and execution. David was reporting that he overachieved already now our targets to shift $3 billion capital from the IB to other businesses, but we clearly came to the conclusion, amongst others, also accentuated by the current market environment but not only that, [and chose] we can execute and that we want to refocus and even speed up our transformation. And we do that not shying away to looking to some businesses that are great businesses, like the SP business, but ultimately not too much connected with the rest of the group. And we want to allow those businesses to get back on a growth path, so we are really fundamentally looking to what are the core strengths in particular we have in our Investment Bank; reshape; offer opportunities for some other parts; and then also go rigorously after the cost base, as that is an issue for the Investment Bank but for the group as a whole.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: So Axel, are we supposed to -- are we kind of -- can we consider even a further shrinkage of the Investment Bank that was communicated last time around with the strategy review, particularly as you talk about the kind of the capital lightness of the model -- of your kind of new model going forward?\\nAxel Lehmann: Well, look what we said. We come up with the datas, details in Q3. We have exited. We have done what we said we are going to do, and yes, we are going to transform. And we are looking and enabling parts of the business to grow and to prosper, and the details will be disclosed with the Q3 results, so bear with me.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs with Citi.\\nAndrew Coombs: A couple of questions. Firstly, just on the structured products business, the plans for that. You talk about seeking third-party capital. Anything you could elaborate there in terms of what partnership or kind of partnerships you are looking for to an extent? How much of this will be an exit of assets versus this is just a third-party participation in this business line? And also, if there's anything you can provide on the revenues and costs of that business as well, that would be appreciated. I think you've given the RWAs and leverage exposure but nothing on the P&L metrics. And then my second question would just be on the outflows. Middle East, Russian sanctioned individuals as well, you flagged out. Do you think that's now run its course? I'm interested to know if you think there's anything more to go. And anything you can say on [July] given what UBS said yesterday?\\nDavid Mathers: Well, perhaps I would take the two questions in order. I think -- look. I think we've given the numbers around the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure for securitized products. I'm not going to go into detailed P&L and cost metrics today. What I would say is this is a business that Credit Suisse has a long track record in. Clearly it's our origins lie in mortgage securitization, but it's expanded well beyond that into asset finance. That is a business that is seeing structural growth, particularly with the growth in private debt. There's a lot of appetite for those types of products. I think our ability to actually finance that in house is -- clearly has limits and notwithstanding the sustained profitability of this business and its high returns. And I think, therefore, it is the right thing to do, to actually consider third-party capital for this to allow us to basically maximize the potential of this franchise and, I think, without basically distorting our overall asset allocation. So we like this business, but there has to be a limit to how much capital you can actually organize. And I think there will be demand for this, and I've already received one e-mail this morning already. I think -- but it does -- it has -- this is a sustainably profitable business which does cover a very broad range of asset financing. I think, just quickly on the Russian-related outflows. Look. I think we've had outflows in -- both in respect of sanctioned clients, which we obviously do treat as a structural change because the money is locked -- and then in terms of non-sanctioned clients, we had about a CHF 1.4 billion outflow. I'm not going to comment. I think clearly it's an evolving situation, obviously, [where it's changing with] geopolitical situation. It's very uncomfortable and very difficult. [I mean just note] that we saw that in terms of those numbers. I mean, yes, I think, in terms of the third quarter -- and look. Brutally, we're only 3 weeks into the third quarter. I'm not going to comment on net new asset outflows 3 weeks into the quarter. We'll see how this quarter develops. Just do note we've had positive inflows for the first half of the year and, I think, clearly in what is a very challenging environment.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Daniele Brupbacher from UBS.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: Thank you and all the best to you, Thomas, as well from my side. Can I ask on capital, first? And I mean, at this point in time, are you ready and able to exclude a capital increase to -- if you go into this strategic review? Or does that really ultimately depend on the measures you'll take and probably also the impact or expected impact on parent bank given that restructurings often result in impairments there? And secondly, just on profitability. Obviously we will all guess how the go-to profile looks like over the next 3 months, but I mean you mentioned the CHF 15.5 billion like-for-like cost base. You had a 10% drop to your target in the past. One could argue that the business will be even more capital light going forward, so it should actually be higher than that. So I mean, taking a 40 billion [TNAV], that would probably imply like a net profit of 4 billion or revenues north of 20 billion, which you probably think could be a sustainable base given the current profile. Is that a fair way of looking at it? Or is there too much assumptions in there?\\nDavid Mathers: Perhaps I'll just kick off on capital and then hand over to Axel and Thomas in terms of the strategic review. I think the first point I'd make is I've been CFO for 12 years. And a 13.5% CET1 is one of the highest CET1 ratios we've actually ever reported, so we are in a strong capital position. And our leverage ratio is equally strong in terms of that, so I think the bank is well funded in terms of that. What I have said in the course of this morning is that I do have continued AT1 plans. I think you may note that I've given guidance of CHF 2 billion to CHF 4 billion of AT1 issuance this year, of which I've only issued [1.65 billion], so clearly we are looking to add to AT1 capital, if that's helpful, Daniele, in terms of your thinking and analysis. I think, in terms of the parent capital ratio, the drop from 11.8% to 11.4% is primarily due to FX. And I'm happy to expand on that, if you like, Daniele, but just quickly: We clearly neutralize for the group. And therefore, moves in the dollar against the Swiss franc in particular do not have an impact on the group ratio, but because the FX weighting of the parent is different from that of the group, that means that a higher dollar tends to reduce the parent capital ratio. So if we had FX rates similar to where they were at the end of the first quarter, it would have been probably closer to [11.6 or 11.7]. And then the balance basically reflects the net losses, but as you note here, I've actually seen about 1.8 billion of capital repatriations and dividends, of which $1.2 billion came from the U.K. entity CSSEL which I've talked about before, Daniele, which you know very well basically. There is an ongoing repatriation request in respect of CSSEL, and that's something we're clearly discussing with regulators. I'm not going to comment on that, but there clearly is excess capital in CSSEL because it is now a nonmaterial legal entity. And you know our plan is to repatriate the bulk of that to CSAG in due course. I think -- in terms of strategy, I think, Axel, there's not much we can really add, but...\\nAxel Lehmann: No. And Daniele, thanks for your question. Look. We will inform you [and] the full market in Q3. I think today, we indicate, yes, it will be bold. It will be deep, far reaching, but it will -- done with prudent, in a reasonable way. And we are really looking to set up parts of the Investment Bank also for growth [on] the banking business. We said we are going to better align the markets business. We give you an example with SP that is somewhat delivered -- guiding also our thinking. And we will now go through 3 months intense, very detailed work; and we will disclose the details of that work with the Q3 result.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann with Autonomous Research.\\nStefan Stalmann: Also from me, all the best for the future, Thomas. And happy birthday, Kinner. I wanted to follow up, please, with one question on the strategic direction. And I appreciate it's all very early, but it seems that the savings that you outlined are indeed largely targeting tech, procurement, efficiency issues. Is it fair to assume that those savings will be spread across the divisions? And how does this cost efficiency drive, help to transform the Investment Bank into a less-complex and more capital-light entity? And also does it come fast enough given that the unit is losing about 1 billion underlying pretax in the first half of this year? And the second question is a numbers question going back to the capital trajectory. You mentioned in the earnings release that there has been a positive CET1 impact from regulatory adjustments of DTAs. Has that been a material factor, please?\\nDavid Mathers: I think -- on the second point, I think that's just completing the CET1 [walk] basically. As I said, there's been a number of moves there in both FX and [OCI]. So that's useful but not material. I mean I think, just on the tax charge, it's clearly not desirable that I have to report a tax charge at the same time as we report a group loss, but that does reflect the tax structure of the group and my limited ability to actually achieve deferred tax offsets at this particular time. So there's a limit to what I can actually do, Stefan, in terms of DTA, I'm afraid. And I think we're taking a prudent approach around tax. I think -- on the first question. Look. I think -- fair points. I think, as we've said, this cost program is an absolute priority for the Board and for the executive management of Credit Suisse. It has to happen. The work on this is advanced, but I think -- and it's -- but I think it's clear, given what Jo said at the Investor Day in June, that's probably most advanced in terms of our technology operations. And I think she gave a very good summary of what can be achieved there in terms of the efficiency of our IT programs, the integration of IT and what [she's] actually bringing to this job. And I think it's got off to a very good start in terms of actually providing very effective and clear leadership. Procurement program, as I said before, is something -- the outsourcing, which something was -- Thomas was very much behind in terms of driving this. And I think that's heading in the right direction. I think it's perhaps a little bit embarrassing. The savings are what they are, but I guess it's an opportunity. But I think we do want to make the point that this cost program is not limited to technology or procurement, which just to answer your question specifically, Stefan, does accrue across the whole group because essentially majority of this is the corporate functions. And it flows out through the allocations, but it is not limited just to those things. It is a complete review of the costs of all divisions and all corporate functions of the bank and will include savings across all of those.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. And if I may add: We did a -- really a benchmarking of cost-income ratios across the businesses and for the whole group. And we have identified cost reduction potential in every single division and in every single corporate function, so this will be broad-based. And as David said, we think we are just at the beginning here and we see significant opportunities.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.\\nKian Abouhossein: Yes. Again I also would like to thank Thomas for dealing with issues not caused by his management and operation but by previous management within the group. And thank you for your open regular communication and dealing with us analysts. I mean clearly over the last 18 months have been very demanding. Questions: First of all, good luck on finding third-party money. Now let's assume that is not going to happen. What is the second alternative in terms of exiting the securitization platform? And then the second question is have you had discussions with FINMA. And how would FINMA see potentially capital going below 13%? And if I could add 1 more quick one, restructuring costs related to the costs saving plan that you're going to be outlining in more detail. Could you give us an idea if 100% of cost savings is roughly the right magnitude as we have seen in past restructurings?\\nThomas Gottstein: Maybe if I start with the SP. So look. We have already started this a couple of weeks ago. And we have reasons to believe that there is tremendous interest in our world-class securitized products business from third-party capital providers, so I'm very confident that this is a business that attracts a lot of interests. On the FINMA, capital side, clearly, yes, as it was said by David, the 13.5% is a very solid capital base. We have a Board of Directors risk appetite of 13% to 14% for the rest of the year, and that's what we are doing. We are obviously always also in contact with FINMA, but this is very consistent with the spirit there. I don't know whether, Axel, you want to add anything.\\nAxel Lehmann: Obviously, with FINMA, we are in very close contact and, I think, have their support on the general strategic direction and our intent. We also informed in the appropriate way the [core college]. So of course, we don't do that in an isolated way. And we are in a constant dialogue, in particular with FINMA.\\nDavid Mathers: I think your point about restructuring costs. Look. I think -- I think we've been clear. We've scoped out the program. We can see the opportunities. We are moving to implementation quickly on this point, but we are only going to provide further details on the new SEC U.S. GAAP restructuring program once we get to the end of the third quarter. And I think that's the time to do the -- I'm not sure I would make the assumption you make about 100%, Kian. I think it is certainly true that there are certain steps that we can take which is -- perhaps impact [contractors versus permanently] differently, but as I said, I think we'll give you further details in due course.\\nKian Abouhossein: And may I just follow up on the third-party platform? If you don't achieve third-party money on the platform, would that mean, as an alternative, an exit of the business?\\nAxel Lehmann: I don't want to speculate at that point about anything. This is a highly profitable, highly success number one business in the marketplace. Trust me. We will do the right steps.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Amit Goel with Barclays.\\nAmit Goel: Again my thanks as well, Thomas, for all the help that you provided. So I've got, I mean, 2 questions; the first one, on the SP business. I think you gave some balance sheet color in terms of RWA and leverage consumption. Can you, firstly, give us a bit of color in terms of the profitability of that business and perhaps how that's evolved in recent periods? And then secondly, just understanding the CET1 target: So I think previously you said that you anticipate being at around 13.5% for the kind of the next 6 months or so. Now the range has kind of widened to 13% to 14%, so just would like to understand, I mean, what's driving that increase in, I guess, volatility for the CET1 ratio.\\nDavid Mathers: Well, I think -- look. I think I did answer a similar question on securitized products before actually, Amit. And I'm not going to give detailed profitability numbers at this point. I think that's not appropriate. I would merely restrict myself to saying that the returns on this business have consistently exceeded the cost of capital over a very extended period of time. So probably should -- we'll stop there in terms of what I say about it. And it's a very strong business that's got excellent leadership and it's got a very good history of entrepreneurship and innovation. I think, in terms of the capital guidance, look: I think we're operating in a volatile environment. I think you've seen the radical move in interest rates, so far. I'm -- I think the whole Russian-Ukrainian situation cannot be described as stable. It's not stable in any sense of the word. I mean I think it does seem prudent to give a range for the guidance for capital. I'm not saying anything beyond that, but I think that's the context in which we've set the 13% to 14%, Amit.\\nAmit Goel: Okay. Just given the first question, I guess, had been partially answered before, just maybe one follow-up just checking in terms of the commentary about the CHF 15.5 billion and that being within the current perimeter. If you were to make further cuts or changes to the IB, then would you then be looking at a number below CHF 15.5 billion?\\nDavid Mathers: Yes.\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. It seems to be logic, isn't it?\\nDavid Mathers: Yes, Amit.\\nAmit Goel: Yes. Just to check.\\nDavid Mathers: Yes.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alastair Ryan from Bank of America.\\nAlastair Ryan: Thank you, Thomas. Just really [Indiscernible] [on the outside] to judge how you're progressing with remediation of the control issues that emerged 1.5 years ago or so, many of which were backward looking but clearly a constraint on how you take risk on a daily basis. And I think, David, you alluded to the [they're quite expensive]. Can you give us any sense of how you're working through those? [At what point is FINMA] kind of giving you a clean bill of health on the things that you highlighted at the Investor Day last month?\\nThomas Gottstein: Yes. I mean maybe I can start off. As I said in my comments, we have made a substantial progress in our remediation program, organization and leadership, under the leadership of David Wildermuth. We have been in very close contact with the [core college], with all 3 regulators across a large regulatory remediation book of work, which we have agreed priorities with them which is roughly a dozen major programs. They include, amongst others, the Archegos read-across. It includes the supply chain fund read-across. It includes FRTB and other projects, so I think we are very well organized now. We have a very constructive dialogue with all 3 regulators. Clearly there's still a lot of work left, but we are moving definitely in the right direction. And under David Wildermuth's competent leadership, I feel that we are moving in the right direction.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Hallam with Goldman Sachs.\\nChris Hallam: And first of all, just to echo everybody's comments, Thomas: I certainly appreciated both your thoughts and perspectives in recent months. 2 quick questions from me. Just first, on compensation costs and head count. They were both up year-over-year in the quarter. And I know you've talked about the deferred comp impact here in 2022, but is it fair to assume that considerations on head counts and on comp costs feed into the CHF 15.5 billion landing points [in] OpEx and also as part of the ongoing pivots in the IB into the more capital-light activities? So that's the first question. And then secondly -- and maybe I missed this in your prepared remarks, David, but just on the [235 million] of mark-to-market losses in the quarter in leveraged finance, would that number be meaningfully different where we are now in late July?\\nDavid Mathers: That's a good question. Thanks, Chris. Just to take the 2 in turn: I mean I think -- in terms of compensation costs, Chris, I think you know that last year, as a consequence of our response particularly to Archegos, we did go for a much higher level of deferral. That was an appropriate decision we made in conjunction with what -- which we made. And clearly, this year, we are actually going back to much more normal levels of deferral, so therefore, the [CVA], the cash component of the awards is substantially higher than before. I think -- in terms of the outlook for compensation costs overall, I think clearly it's a radically different investment banking environment this year than it was last year. I'm not going to prejudge how this year closes out, but I -- it doesn't seem to me like it's going to be as good a year for bonuses in 2022 as it was in 2021 across the industry. So yes, we'll look at it, basically, but the year-on-year change is primarily due to deferral changes. Clearly we have looked at this as part of our program, but it's not the primary driver in terms of what we need to do. We're talking about sustainable improvements in efficiency that we need to achieve that go far beyond compensation changes. I think, your second question, in terms of the mark-to-market on the unrealized, in particular, component of the leveraged finance. Well, it was $245 million. Would it be better in July? Well, look. Yes, you're right in the sense the indices have obviously [rallied] in the first few weeks of July, but I think a lot of wood to chop in terms of market volatility before one can make these comments. And I would be inclined to be still prudent about this. As I've said, we clearly take our marks continuously. It's not just done at the end of a quarter. It's done on a regular basis. And that reflects both deals that have actually funded already where we've exited but also marked to market against future funding commitments. So I think that's a protocol which, I would say, I've followed since 2007; and I think it's the prudent way to think about it. You're right. The indices have narrowed, but just history from the past basically says you can't always judge specific trades by moves in indices basically. So I would still be cautious, Chris, in terms of this. I think there's -- we're still in the course of a very difficult market environment with very radical changes in the interest rates structure. And it clearly has a -- and clearly, Chris, as I said in my prepared remarks, there does have to be a much increased chance of a significant recession at some point in the next 12 months.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen with Royal Bank of Canada.\\nAnke Reingen: Also from me, thank you, Thomas, and all the best. And happy birthday, Kinner. I just had a question on Slide 18, about the interest rate sensitivity, the higher funding costs comment. I assume that's not included in the potential benefit from higher rates. And I was wondering. You give us the CHF 200 million for '22, but given your issuance comments, should that ramp up into '23? And then secondly, just on the strategic changes. I mean I guess I can imagine it must be quite unsettling across your -- a number of divisions of your bank. And I just wonder how you sort of like try to manage that situation and not, yes, impacting staff morale. Or is the view to do this relatively quickly, which might be more costly? Or is it more gradual? I just wonder how you manage your staff through the announced changes.\\nDavid Mathers: Well, just taking the first point, first, in terms of the benefit from higher dollar and euro rates and the offset from the move toward 0 in Switzerland, which is -- as you say is on Page 18. I did think that it was appropriate to give full guidance around this, so we've given the benefit we'd expect from current forward curves. And incidentally, just in terms of my, yes, interest rate and treasury management, I do have the ability to actually term out a significant proportion of this to actually lock in that benefit. And those are trades which my treasury function has actually been conducting, so we are beginning to lock that benefit in. It's not just a forward curve projection, but I did want also to basically disclose that, clearly given the moving credit spreads across the market, across the banks and for Credit Suisse, for that matter, it seemed prudent to basically guide to the adverse impact to funding costs as a consequence, both for those moves and, of course, the increase in the AT1 guidance which I've given this morning. Clearly what the funding costs will be in '23 or '24 will obviously depend critically on what our credit spreads are at the time [we actually issue]. So that's a comment in terms of my issuance plan for '22 and that's all I'd say at this point. It becomes a little bit forward looking there afterwards.\\nAnke Reingen: Okay, so the CHF 1 billion is pre any potential increase in funding costs [Indiscernible] number.\\nDavid Mathers: That's right, but they are separate things because [one is the] exposure to my shareholders' equity, my deposit strategy, my [replication] strategy. The other is the increase in funding costs, which comes largely from our AT1 issuance plan.\\nAnke Reingen: Okay.\\nThomas Gottstein: [Indiscernible] staff morale and attrition is concerned, clear that changes in strategic directions, et cetera always create a certain un-security, but on the other hand, from all my conversations I've had and that Ulrich will continue to have going forward, there is a broad-based recognition and support that we have to take some further actions. There is a lot of frustration around allocated costs, et cetera, so the cost initiatives is broadly supported by everybody. And also we are very focused to come back quickly, i.e., within a quarter, with clarity for everybody. So we are very much focused on this and we are having a lot of support by our direct reports and N-2s across the bank.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe General.\\nAndrew Lim: Best wishes to you, Thomas. And credit to you for managing the bank through challenging times which have arisen through no fault of your own. So on to my questions: First of all, how do you think about the stability of the CET1 ratio at 13.5%? The reason I ask is, number one, had you not had 5 billion of IB deleveraging, you would have been 30 basis points lower. And then number two, how long do the FX hedges stay in place? Do they roll off at some point? So I guess my question is, if you keep on making losses, would you see your CET1 ratio drop lower? So that was my first question. And then my second question is on retention packages that have hit the headlines lately. Could you explain in detail how these are expensed through the P&L? Is it on awarding of these packages [or on vestment]?\\nDavid Mathers: Well, firstly, I think, just in terms of the CET1 ratio, I mean, I think clearly there's clearly a number of moving parts there. Obviously we did reduce our business usage. And that was clearly part of the plan we actually had last year, so I think that's to be expected, primarily in the IB clearly, but I think clearly we also had the leveraged finance losses [Indiscernible] overall performance of the banks and including litigation charges. So there clearly is a number of volatile items within that. I think it seems prudent to give a range of 13% to 14%. I'm not really going to add to it beyond that. As I said, I think it is a very high capital ratio for the bank, certainly compared to historic norms. And indeed we did include a comparison at the back of the deck against many of our peers. So I think that is worth keeping in mind. On the FX point. It's we continuously roll the -- roughly 65% of our CET1 forward, so they don't have an expiry date in terms of that. It's just part of our normal treasury management. We've run it continuously on that basis. That's separate from my term-out strategy for the shareholders' equity which I mentioned before, which I think you may be alluding to, where we have been keeping it relatively short for the last couple of years, typically around 2.5 years. I think [we're weather right to] these sorts of events coming at some point, although they've been clearly much, much more marked than I would have expected. And we have been seeking to -- we have been terming that out in the course of recent months basically, as interest rates have actually moved up, to actually lock that in. And those are typically termed out to somewhere between 4 and 5 years. [Andrew asked that] question, but there are 2 separate things. One is my term-out strategy for the equity. The other is my FX exposure management -- sorry. And you asked a technical question around retention and recognition and -- well, look. I think this -- I don't think I can add too much in terms of details. If I talk about the program we did last year, to give you some idea: Typically speaking, those were 3-year instruments; and they vest roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 basically. So it's a time-weighted basis, so it's -- if they were awarded for 6 months, it would be 1/6, 1/3, 1/3, 1/6, depending on when they're actually awarded. That's how they work.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Piers Brown from HSBC.\\nPiers Brown: I've just got a couple. On litigation. So you put CHF 434 million this quarter. I think, if I'm not mistaken just looking at the quarterly report, the number you gave for the range of [reasonably possible losses] has gone slightly higher. I think you're quoting 1.6 billion versus 1.4 billion last quarter. So if you could just talk to what you're seeing in terms of sort of inflow of new cases into that number versus work out of existing cases. And I guess you've mentioned this quarter the communication, record-keeping issue, which is a new case, I guess, but just the effect of those 2 items. And then secondly, on the securitized products business. I mean, when you think about that business and if we got to a point somewhere down the road where you looked either to do a disposal or some form of exit, do you think there are interlinkages with other parts of the IB that you intend to maintain as -- in their current format? And I guess the reason I ask the question is because we've sort of seen with the exit of Prime Services that there can be unintended consequences for businesses that you retain, in terms of spillover effects. So just how you think about securitized products and how discrete or siloed that business side is in the context of the overall IB franchise.\\nDavid Mathers: We're taking those in turn. Just in terms of litigation, I mean, I think your comments are absolutely correct. I mean the [RPL] did increase to 1.6 billion and notwithstanding the fact that we took major litigation provisions of CHF 434 million in the quarter. Why? I mean, as you say basically, we were not anticipating the $200 million charge in respect of unapproved electronic communications. I think you've obviously seen that across the industry, but I wasn't expecting that at the end of the first quarter, so that was a new case. It had no RPL associated with it and doesn't have any RPL associated now, so unfortunately, I've had to increase my provisions by [200] with no impact on RPL . I think the balance -- I mean I think you know that Markus Diethelm took office as our General Counsel. He's been doing a full review of our legal case. He has made and continues to make substantial progress in resolving a number of these cases, and that really flowed from that review of those cases. There's nothing particularly new that's popped up to drive the RPL number. I think, on the second question, just on SP. I just would guide you against from -- kind of assuming that this is an exit from securitized products. This is a very successful platform. It's been core to the bank for a very long time indeed, firstly, in mortgages, and now in terms of asset financing. There's a lot of potential to actually grow this business, if you had to deploy more capital. We do have some limits on what we can do to actually support it. It's a great team. And that's really what we're looking to actually do here, frankly, so I just want to caution against this is an exit from SP. It's not. This is a business where we do see potential to basically grow and invest in it, albeit with third-party support for this operation. I don't know, Thomas, if you want to comment.\\nThomas Gottstein: No. I think you summarized it well.\\nPiers Brown: Okay. And Thomas, very best wishes for the future.\\nThomas Gottstein: Thank you very much.\\nOperator: Back to Kinner's closing comments. Kinner?\\nKinner Lakhani: Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for your interest. And if you do have any further questions, feel free to contact the IR team. And have a good day.

Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse second quarter earnings release published this morning. Let me remind you that our second quarter financial report and accompanying financial statements for the period will be published on or around July 29. I will now hand over to Axel Lehmann, our Group Chairman, who will elaborate on the announcements from this morning; followed by Group CEO Thomas Gottstein; and our Group CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Axel Lehmann',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Kinner. And good morning and thank you for joining our analysts call. Today, we announced a series of important changes, most notably a new CEO and a repositioned strategy. Let me spend the next couple of minutes elaborating a little bit more in detail before handing over to Thomas and David for their respective presentation. Credit Suisse is undoubtedly facing a challenging situation both structurally and via the markets in which we operate. The need for change was clear before the second quarter results, but the disappointing performance has added a sense of urgency, as well conviction, for our actions. That is why the Board of Director has decided to take decisive actions to reposition our bank and to strengthen the performance, the reputation and credibility of the bank. With conviction, we are now embarking on measures to speed up our transformation course with a clear direction for the bank and a new leadership. Our goal is to become a stronger, simpler and more efficient bank with sustainable returns. As announced earlier today, the Board of Director accepted the resignation of Thomas Gottstein. Thomas has led the bank through some of its most challenging corporate period; and he has done it with a lot of courage, energy and commitment as well as huge personal integrity. His absolute dedication and commitment to the bank over the past 2 decades are beyond commendable. The Board of Director is grateful to Thomas for the leadership he has provided during the global COVID-19 pandemic as well as in the aftermath of the 2 incidents in 2021. Thank you, Thomas. And yet as the bank embarks on a new course, both Thomas and the Board of Directors agreed that this should be under a new leadership free to steer a new course. Ulrich Körner will oversee the detailed work required as part of the comprehensive strategic review with the full trust and support of the Board of Directors. Ulrich is an experienced transformation leader with excellent judgment and has demonstrated to the Board of Directors that he understands the urgency of the task and the need to build trust across our stakeholder base. Ulrich has significant and highly relevant experience as CFO, COO and a business CEO from his previous 11 years at Credit Suisse, including as an Executive Board member. At UBS, he was also a business CEO and the Group COO as well as a group Executive Board member. Since returning to Credit Suisse, he has rebuilt the Asset Management business with a new strategic direction and a high-performing team. He's one of the few executives in the industry with both front-to-back and back-to-front leadership experience. I personally value him as a strategic thinker with a solution-oriented approach and a clear focus on execution and delivery. He has highly relevant experience in all our core businesses and in structural cost base transformation for corporate functions. You will shortly hear from both Thomas and David on our second quarter results. They clearly do not reflect the strengths and the potential of our global franchise. Our reported pretax loss of CHF 1.2 billion was partially impacted by major litigation provisions as part of our approach to proactively resolve legal cases. At the same time, we had reported an adjusted pretax loss of CHF 0.4 billion. This is disappointing, and we will address that step by step over the coming months and quarters. The Board of Directors, together with senior management, has been conducting a strategic review of the bank's businesses, with the goal to shape a more focused, agile group with a significant lower absolute cost base, capable of delivering sustainable returns for all stakeholders and first-class service to clients. The Board of Directors' strategic review will recommend a new model for Credit Suisse with the following objectives: first, to strengthen the world-class global Wealth Management franchise, leading universal bank in Switzerland and multi-specialist Asset Management business; secondly, to transform the Investment Bank into a capital-light advisory-led banking business and a more focused markets business that complements the growth of the Wealth Management and Swiss Bank franchises; thirdly, to evaluate strategic options for the securitized products business, which may include attracting third-party capital; and fourthly, to reduce the group's absolute cost base to below CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term, executed with prudence while remaining focused on improving risk management and risk culture. In short, the priority of the strategic review will be to enhance our positions in Wealth Management, the Swiss Bank and Asset Management while considering options for fundamentally reshaping the Investment Bank into a highly competitive banking and more sustainable markets business. The development and implementation of the new strategy will be overseen by the full Board of Directors and supported by a [Board-led ad hoc] investment bank strategy committee, with Michael Klein as Chair; and also including Mirko Bianchi, Richard Meddings and Blythe Masters. In closing. We remain focused on improving risk management as well as the risk culture across the group. We remain focused to speed up our transformation and disciplined execution. And I'm absolutely convinced that, under the leadership of our new CEO, Ulrich Körner, and the rest of our strong Executive Board, we have the right leadership team in place to transform and to deliver. We will provide further details on the progress, including specific performance goals, with our third quarter 2022 results. Thanks for your attention. And with this, I would like -- hand over now to Thomas. Thomas?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Axel. And thank you for, yes, your kind words. And thank you all for joining our second quarter 2022 results presentation. I will share some personal remarks before the Q&A at the end. We have reported, as we just heard also from Axel, an adjusted pretax loss of CHF 0.4 billion and a reported pretax loss of CHF 1.2 billion. Clearly the broader economic and geopolitical environment remained difficult over the first half of the year. Financial markets entered 2022 dealing with some of the highest inflation rates in the generation, putting strain on household spending and most financial assets. Nonetheless, this is clearly disappointing and does not reflect, as Axel also said, the strength and potential of our world-class franchise. This makes it imperative for us to take further solid actions to turn the bank around. We must and we believe we will restore Credit Suisse to its premium position in global finance. Let's turn to Page 4, please. As you can see on this slide, our adjusted PTI of CHF 0.4 billion was primarily driven by a $0.9 billion adjusted pretax loss in the Investment Bank. And our reported pretax loss of CHF 1.2 billion was further impacted by major litigation provisions, Allfunds-related losses and restructuring charges, totaling CHF 0.7 billion. At the same time, we maintained a strong capital position with a CET1 capital ratio of 13.5%, which is in line with our guidance; a CET1 leverage ratio of 4.3%; and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.1%. I'm also pleased to say that we already achieved our year-end 2022 ambition of releasing more than $3 billion in allocated capital from the Investment Bank by the end of this quarter. We have launched a group-wide comprehensive review with the objective to strengthen our world-class Wealth Management, leading universal bank in Switzerland and multi-specialist Asset Management business. At the same time, our plan is to transform our Investment Bank with the aim of achieving a less-complex, capital-light advisory-led banking business; and a more connected markets business that further supports the growth of our Wealth Management and Swiss Bank divisions. We are also assessing strategic options for our market-leading securitized products business. We think there are exciting opportunities to accelerate growth and to further strengthen its competitiveness by attracting third-party capital. Additionally, we are targeting an absolute cost base for the group of below CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term, supported by a broader cost efficiency and digital transformation. Strengthening risk management and risk culture as well as addressing legacy issues remain an absolute priority. We are also focused on working through our regulatory remediation program, supported by the Strategic Regulatory Remediation Committee chaired by David Wildermuth to oversee delivery of our programs. Next slide, please. For the first half, we reported a group adjusted pretax loss of CHF 0.1 billion, with the robust performance of the Swiss Bank and positive contribution of our Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses offset by a challenged performance from the Investment Bank. The reported pretax loss of CHF 1.6 billion was primarily driven by major litigation expenses of CHF 1.1 billion as part of our approach to proactively resolve legacy cases, as well as a loss on Allfunds of CHF 0.5 billion. Next slide, please. The performance of our Wealth Management division reflected higher net interest income benefiting from rising interest rates, which was more than offset by lower recurring commissions and fees and transaction revenues impacted by the adverse market environment. Our operating expenses in the second quarter were 18% higher due to higher group-wide technology, risk and compliance costs; as well as investments in relationship managers and China. While we attracted inflows in APAC and the Americas in the second quarter, reflecting our franchise strength, we reported moderate net outflows overall mainly due to outflows from Switzerland and the EMEA region. In addition, in the first half, we attracted positive net new assets of CHF 3.4 billion, which included Russia-related outflows of CHF 1.9 billion. Our Investment Bank performance was impacted by substantially lower ECM and leveraged finance market activity as well as leveraged finance mark-to-market losses. At the same time, we delivered higher advisory revenues and strong equity derivatives and macro trading benefiting from increased market volatility. Our Swiss Bank continued to show a resilient performance, with net revenues up 3% across all major line items, partly offset by normalized provisions for credit losses and higher operating expenses. The return on regulatory capital was 12%. Our Asset Management division was impacted by the challenging market environment, with net asset outflows of CHF 6.1 billion driven by outflows across both traditional and alternative investments, only partially offset by inflows from investments and partnerships. David will explain the divisional performance in more detail. Slide 7, please. Let me spend a few minutes on the performance of the Investment Bank. In this context, it is important to remember that our franchise mix, which particularly benefited us in a year like 2021, has been much less supportive in the recent environment given our much more limited exposure to macro and rates as well as commodities. In addition, we still have a very significant negative PTI drag in equities from exiting Prime Services, as we have lost 98% of revenues but still have a large part of the costs. Our strong positions across both ECM and leveraged finance were impacted by the substantial slowdown in market activity. In addition, we also experienced leveraged finance mark-to-market losses of $245 million. However, we saw an increase in advisory revenues of 37% from a year earlier. And we were also involved in 5 of the 6 top IBCM fee events. We have a market-leading franchise in securitized products, and while our financing pipeline is robust, revenues were lower than a year earlier in the context of widening credit spreads. Our second quarter equity derivatives performance was the best in recent history. Next slide, please. In our Wealth Management division, we report an increase in net interest income driven by higher interest rates. In this context, we expect higher rates to add about CHF 800 million to the Wealth Management net interest income by 2024 versus 2021. In the context of challenging markets, our recurring commissions and fees were lower, reflecting weaker AUM and broadly stable margins, while our transaction-based revenues were impacted by the risk-averse client sentiment. We continue to invest in relationship managers, in technology and in risk and compliance. Next slide, please. We are a top 2 global wealth manager outside the United States with CHF 1.2 billion client business volume and strong exposure to higher-growth markets. We have world-class investment bank franchises across, amongst others, IBCM, securitized products and equity derivatives. We are also a leading universal bank in Switzerland with a #1 position in investment banking and in institutional clients and top 2 positions in corporate banking and wealth management. We are also a multi-specialist asset manager with distinct strength. As highlighted before, we are taking strategic actions to further strengthen our Wealth Management, Swiss Bank and Asset Management divisions; and to transform our Investment Bank with the aim of achieving a less-complex, capital-light advisory-led and more connected business that further supports the growth of our Wealth Management and Swiss Bank divisions. Next slide, please. Over the past 7 years, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet and capital ratios. We maintained a resilient capital base with our CET1 ratio at 13.5%, in line with our guidance. And our CET1 leverage ratio stands at 4.3%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.1% is amongst the highest in our peer group, if not the highest. Next one, please. Let me briefly touch on our ongoing digital transformation, led by our Chief Technology and Operations Officer, Joanne Hannaford, which we expect will open up new opportunities and drive and accelerate change across the entire bank. These efforts should contribute, together with our broader cost efficiency program, to reducing group adjusted operating expenses to below CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term, as I previously mentioned. Next page, please. We have come to the conclusion, and as Axel explained before, that we need to consider alternatives to go well beyond last year's strategic review, particularly given the challenging market environment. We are currently conducting a strategic review to evaluate ways to further strengthen our Wealth Management, Swiss Bank and Asset Management divisions; and to extend their leadership positions. We are assessing a further transformation of our Investment Bank into a capital-light advisory-led banking business and a more focused and connected markets business that complements the growth of the Wealth Management and Swiss Bank franchises. We are also evaluating strategic options for our market-leading securitized products, which may include attracting third-party capital into this high-return platform and potentially freeing up additional resources for the bank's growth areas. This highly profitable global franchise, which employs around 20 billion of risk-weighted assets, has significant untapped growth opportunities. And lastly, we have embarked on an ambitious new plan to significantly reduce our absolute cost base to below the CHF 15.5 billion which I mentioned before in the medium term. David will talk more about this plan in his section. And with this, I would like to hand over to David, and I will come back after his presentation. Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Thomas. And good morning to everybody. I'd like to go through now the key financials and give some more details on our performance at the group and the divisional levels. Quite clearly, as Thomas has summarized, a very difficult macroeconomic environment which has been characterized by the rapid increases in interest rates has resulted in a disappointing quarter for the group. Let me start then with the group numbers. We've achieved an adjusted pretax loss of CHF 442 million for the quarter compared to an adjusted pretax income of CHF 1.31 billion for the same period of last year. At a reported level, the pretax loss was CHF 1.17 billion. I will take you through the walk in more detail on the next slide, but this reported figure includes a further valuation loss of CHF 168 million on our -- on the mark-to-market moves in the publicly listed Allfunds Group as well as major litigation provisions totaling CHF 434 million. These primarily relate to 2 matters: first, to our investigations into record-keeping requirements relating to business communications sent over unapproved devices; and second, in respect of a previously disclosed legacy legal matter. Now if we just focus on the adjusted loss of CHF 442 million. This comprises adjusted net revenues of CHF 3.82 billion and adjusted operating expenses of CHF 4.2 billion. Now to be clear: These adjusted revenues include $245 million of mark-to-market losses in respect of our leveraged finance underwriting book, the majority of which are unrealized. We've also taken CHF 100 million of impairments and charges, nonoperational charges, in our Wealth Management business, all of which are reflected in the adjusted pretax loss number. Provisions for credit losses in the quarter were CHF 64 million compared to a release last year when we were able to write back some of our nonspecific provisions that were taken during the COVID pandemic. Now in terms of our effective tax rate, as you know, we have certain nondeductible items such as funding and litigation costs, together with our constraints on our ability to recognize further deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. That means that we do have an absolute tax charge even when the bank is reporting a loss for the quarter. The overall effect therefore is that our net loss attributable to shareholders for the quarter was CHF 1.59 billion. Next slide, please. What we show here is the impact that our adjusting items had on our underlying performance both in the second quarter and in the context of the first half. Now I'm not going to go into detail on every item, but just going from left to right, [along] the top line representing the second quarter, you can see the impact of the fall in the market value of Allfunds of CHF 168 million, which I've mentioned already; a charge of CHF 13 million relating to some of the ongoing work around Archegos; CHF 80 million of restructuring costs; and most importantly, the CHF 434 million in respect of major litigation provisions. There was a small element of gains from real estate totaling CHF 7 million in the quarter. And we also had a small goodwill impairment relating to the transfer in the second quarter of a portion of AFG to the Investment Bank, which cost us [$23 million]. Now if we look at the reconciliation for the first half, you can see that the reported pretax loss of CHF 1.6 billion translates into an adjusted pretax loss of CHF 1.42 million -- CHF 142 million. The key point I'd make is that, if you take together the major litigation provisions and the valuation loss on our investment in Allfunds, that accounts for more than the total pretax loss. While the loss of more than CHF 0.5 billion on Allfunds is a function of the company's share price portfolio, the provisions for major litigation, though clearly significant, are indicative of the progress that we are making to resolve these issues. Now as Thomas has already summarized in the context of the comprehensive view of our strategy, both the Executive Board and the Board of Directors have concluded that, given the significant change in the operating environment which may well be sustained for some time, our cost base needs to be lowered. We're therefore looking to accelerate our digital transformation program, including a further simplification of our front-to-back processes, reduction of manual data handling and duplication and increased use of scalable cloud-based infrastructure. I'm sure you'll recall that at last month's investor deep dive we identified at least CHF 650 million of savings in the CTOO function. We'll look to build on this. And taking alongside our broader cost efficiency initiatives, we expect this digital transformation program to play a critical part in reducing our adjusting operating expenses to our new target to be below CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term. This program is extensive and far reaching. We've done a lot of work with outside consultants on our benchmarking, and the savings will be significantly larger than those which we summarized back in June. Clearly this will constitute a new cost program, under the SEC rules, but with associated guidance we provided around the expected incremental restructuring costs. And I'll give more details on that when we report our third quarter earnings at the end of October. Now just to be crystal clear: This is our net expense ambition. That is net of investment spend that we continue to allocate to our core businesses. Therefore, the gross ambition that we will give in October is likely to be in excess of the new guidance in reduction in costs of CHF 1 billion to CHF 1.5 billion. Now just in the interim, our adjusted operating expenses in the first half totaled CHF 8.4 billion on an FX-neutral basis. And if you annualize that, that comes out at CHF 16.8 billion, which is clearly in line with our existing guidance of CHF 16.5 billion to CHF 17 billion. And that does include significant incremental investments relating to the implementation of the group strategy as well as increased remediation spend on compliance and infrastructure, which totaled about CHF 331 million in the first half of the year. Let's turn now to client business volume, please. Clearly we have seen a significant sell-off in the markets across most asset classes in the second quarter. And this has accounted for the bulk of the 6% quarter-on-quarter decline in client business volumes to CHF 1.16 trillion. Within this fall, we saw a reduction of CHF 53 billion in assets under management primarily due to market moves; [and also] CHF 4 billion and CHF 18 billion in net loans and custody assets, respectively. Now with regard to net new assets, we saw net asset outflows totaling CHF 1.8 billion across Wealth Management and Private Banking Switzerland in the quarter. These primarily occurred in the EMEA region, largely related to non-sanctioned Russian clients totaling CHF 1.4 billion and certain Middle Eastern clients totaling CHF 2 billion. I'm pleased to note, though, that the Asia Pacific region, having delivered positive inflows in the first quarter, has now continued this momentum in the second quarter. And you may recall that we did comment on deleveraging in Asia Pacific last year. So the total net new asset inflow for the first half was CHF 2.8 billion. Can we turn to the next slide, please? So let me just give some more detail, please, into the impact of the significant upward move on interest rates both in the short term and through the forward curve. I would anticipate that the benefit to Credit Suisse in 2024 will be approximately CHF 1 billion compared to 2021. Now the majority of this, as we said back in June, will flow through the Wealth Management division, as it has the greatest exposure to U.S. dollars, but we'd also expect to see some benefit in this division from the movement in euro rates. One point that I would note is that the benefit that we expect to see from the upward move in the U.S. dollar and euro curves will be partly offset by the move in Swiss franc rates toward 0. I think, as you know, the major Swiss banks have been -- have an exemption threshold which is maintained by the Swiss National Bank, which has given us a benefit of around CHF 400 million per year whilst rates were set at minus 75 basis points. And I think you're aware that similar structures exist with -- in Europe with the ECB, for example. Now what does that mean? It means, as Swiss interest rates converge toward 0, that benefit is being and will continue to be eroded until we start to see a credit when rates move into positive territory. Now one final point just for the sake of completeness. We have seen an increase in the costs of our capital instruments due to the movement in credit spreads in the course of this year. And I would expect this to very partly offset the benefit of the upward trend in interest rates by about CHF 200 million in 2022 against 2021. Next slide, please. Now despite the challenging environment, our capital and leverage ratios remain resilient. As we guided at the beginning of June, our CET1 capital ratio at the end of the second quarter was 30 basis points lower than at the end of the first quarter at 13.5%. Our risk-weighted assets increased by CHF 1 billion to CHF 274 billion. And as you can see from the slide, FX moves was largely offset by a CHF 4 billion reduction in RWA usage across our business lines. Our CET1 leverage ratio and our Tier 1 leverage ratio were both unchanged at 4.3% and 6.1%, respectively. Our leverage exposure overall fell by CHF 15 billion in the quarter primarily due to reductions in business usage across all divisions. The CHF 13 billion reduction in the IB that you see there includes $6 billion from the exit from prime which is now largely complete. Just looking forward, as we've said in our media release today, we'd expect the CET1 ratio to be in the range of 13% to 14% for the balance of the year. Just a brief comment on the Swiss CET1 ratio for Credit Suisse AG, the parent. This was 40 basis points lower quarter-on-quarter at 11.4%, driven both by the net losses but also by adverse FX impacts because we cannot fully neutralize both parent and group through FX moves and particularly the strength in the U.S. dollar. That was partly offset by some continued progress on our capital repatriation program, which included a $1.2 billion capital distribution from the U.K. entity CSSEL, Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited, to Credit Suisse AG. And I'd reiterate what I said about this program at the end of April, which is that we continue to execute our dividend and our capital repatriation plans for '22, although clearly the progress in these plans do remain subject to regulatory approval. And I would expect the bulk of them to materialize, though, in the second half of the year. Now with respect to additional Tier 1 capital, we expect to issue between CHF 2 billion to CHF 4 billion of AT1 capital this year, of which [$1.65 billion] has been issued already. This is both to maintain our Tier 1 ratios but also to prefund AT1 redemptions that are actually scheduled for 2023. Let me now turn to the different business divisions, which we report as usual on an adjusted basis unless stated otherwise. And let me start with wealth. Now the Wealth Management division continued to see a challenging environment in the second quarter, albeit with adjusted pretax income adversely affected by certain asset impairments and nonoperational charges. I'd like to call out 4 factors, please, which are all included, just to be clear, in the adjusted numbers. First, revenues were adversely affected by impairments of CHF 17 million related to certain third-party assets. Second, the ongoing fee waiver program relating to the supply chain finance matters reduced revenues by another CHF 24 million. Third, we saw mark-to-market losses in APAC financing of CHF 21 million. And finally, the cost line was negatively impacted by a CHF 38 million write-off in respect of certain IT-related assets relating to the digital program for the Wealth Management division. We have, as I've noted already, begun to see the significant benefit from the rise in interest rates, which helped net interest income to increase by 4% year-on-year and by 9% quarter-on-quarter to CHF 558 million. The 14% year-on-year reduction in recurring commissions and fees reflected lower assets under management, albeit broadly stable margins. The more cautious sentiments amongst clients, which adversely affected brokerage and structured product fees, contributed to an 11% reduction in transaction-based revenues. And overall, therefore, net revenues for the Wealth Management division declined by 7% to CHF 1.44 billion. With regard to expenses within the Wealth Management division. These increased year-on-year from CHF 1.14 billion to CHF 1.34 billion. This was due to the investments that we're making in business growth, including in China; as well as higher group-wide technology, risk and compliance costs. It also includes, just to be clear, the CHF 38 million [IT-related] impairment. Now adjusted pretax income was therefore 74% lower year-on-year at CHF 114 million. And if you include the valuation loss on our investment in Allfunds, which is booked to this division, the reported figure was a pretax loss of CHF 96 million. As I said already, we saw net asset outflows of CHF 1.4 billion in the division, with net outflows from EMEA and Switzerland partly offset by net inflows in APAC and the Americas. For the first half of the year, net new assets in the division was positive CHF 3.4 billion. Now let me turn now to the Investment Bank. I think quite clearly this was a disappointing quarter for the Investment Bank. This reflects the combination of a mix in business lines, which was partly affected by the heightened market volatility resulting from the move in interest rates, together with significantly lower client activity. I think, as you can see from the slide, this was most notable in capital markets which saw a 96% decline year-on-year to $38 million, but you should note that this figure does include the markdowns of $245 million on our leveraged finance portfolio which I referred earlier. And just to be clear on that point: Those marks are largely unrealized. Our accounting policy is to mark those commitments [to market when] -- as we actually see them. And I think that is the prudent and correct thing to do. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were 32% lower year-on-year at $622 million primarily due to lower emerging markets trading and financing activity; as well as reduced securitized products trading activity, although that does compare to what was a very strong quarter in 2021; as well as reduced credit revenues with lower primary issuance and reduced trading volumes. Now as has been the case in previous quarters, reduced adjusted equity revenues, which were 33% lower at $340 million, was primarily due to the exit [from the most] of our prime service businesses. Taken as a whole, net revenues for the division was 55% lower year-on-year at $1.15 billion. Now just against this weak picture, I would note that we did see higher GTS revenues due to strong equity derivatives and macro trading activity resulting from the increased market volatility, albeit this was partly offset by lower emerging markets trading and financing activity. We also saw a strong performance in advisory, where a significant deal closing grow revenues -- drove revenues 37% higher to $190 million. Operating expenses were flat year-on-year at $1.95 billion, as reduced revenue-related expenses was offset by higher technology, risk and compliance costs. The provision for credit losses of $57 million reflects an increase in both specific and nonspecific provisions compared to a net release of $56 million in the second quarter of last year. [Division] total RWA was down by 8% and leverage was down by 4% quarter-on-quarter. Let me turn now to Asset Management. The Asset Management division's performance was adversely affected by the sell-off in markets in the second quarter and corresponding -- and the corresponding reductions in the market value of assets, but we did also see a reduction in client risk appetite. Net revenues was 25% lower year-on-year at CHF 311 million, primary driver being performance, transaction and placement revenues which were 94% lower at CHF 5 million. The 9% fall in recurring management fees was primarily driven by the 9% year-on-year drop in assets under management, which was due to market and FX effects in large amount. We are disappointed, though, at the level of net asset outflows which totaled CHF 6.1 billion in the second quarter. This was driven by outflows across both traditional and alternative investments, partly offset by inflows from investments and partnerships, but I would note this net new asset performance does in part reflect the roll-off profile of funds within the portfolio as well as the decline in client risk appetite. Operating expenses in the division were CHF 278 million, which was 5% lower year-on-year. The release of certain provisions relating to the supply chain finance funds matter was partly offset by higher technology, risk and compliance costs; as well as increased cash accruals for compensation due to normalized deferral levels. Overall adjusted pretax income was 75% lower year-on-year at CHF 31 million. Now let me just conclude then with a few words on the Swiss Bank. I think it's quite clear that the Swiss Bank has continued to perform well amidst the wider market turbulence. At CHF 1.05 billion, net revenues was higher both sequentially and year-on-year, with a 3% increase compared to the second quarter of 2021. We saw solid improvements in net interest income, recurring commissions and fees and transaction-based revenues with higher deposit income and higher revenues from FX transactions. And we continue to benefit from the post-COVID recovery at Swisscard. As I mentioned before, though, we do expect the net interest income for the third quarter will decrease sequentially due to the Swiss National Bank's decision to increase interest rates from minus 75 basis points to minus 25 basis points. Now our provision for credit losses was higher than a year ago [when we weren't able] to release certain nonspecific provisions taken during the early stages of the pandemic, but they're clearly lower than in the first quarter of the year. And our provisioning does remain at consistently low levels at less than 5 basis points of our net loan total. Now of the CHF 18 million provision that we took in the quarter, about CHF 13 million was in respect of Russia exposure. Operating expenses were 6% higher year-on-year at CHF 627 million. That increase is -- reflects both increased cash accruals for compensation due to normalized deferral levels; as well as higher technology, risk and compliance costs; and additional spending on advertising and marketing campaigns. This increase more than offset the higher revenues, meaning that the Swiss Bank reported an adjusted pretax income of CHF 402 million, about 10% lower year-on-year but 4% higher than in the previous quarter. Our client business volume was 6% lower year-on-year mainly due to decreased assets under management due to market moves. And in terms of net new assets, we did see outflows in the quarter mainly driven by outflows of CHF 1.2 billion from institutional clients and CHF 400 million from our private client business, but I'd just remind you that, for the first half of the year, the division has attracted CHF 4.4 billion of net new assets, again primarily from institutional clients. Now with that, let me hand back to Thomas. And then we can move to Q&A. Thank you very much.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Thomas Gottstein',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, David. I would like to close with some personal remarks. As you will have seen by now, it is with regret that I announced my stepping down as CEO after 2.5 years. It has been an absolute privilege and honor to serve Credit Suisse over the past 23 years. Ever since I joined the firm in Investment Banking in London in 1999, my passion always was to serve clients with care and discipline but also with the famous Credit Suisse entrepreneurial spirit which we must preserve and never lose. I'm immensely proud of what we have achieved together since I joined the Executive Board in 2015, initially as the CEO of the SUB division and later as Group CEO. Despite the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the 2 major incidents which Credit Suisse had to face in 2021 and then the Ukraine invasion and market downturn this year, we made significant progress in strengthening our bank, recruiting an excellent leadership team, starting the transformation of our Investment Bank, reducing risk overall and fundamentally improve our risk culture. In the last few weeks, I had several discussions with Chairman Axel Lehmann about the future of the bank in the context of the already mentioned challenges and in light of my own situation. Based both on personal and health-related considerations, I concluded that now would be the right time to step aside, clearing the way for a new leadership to fully embrace a series of game-changing initiatives announced this morning, all of which I wholeheartedly support. I know that our disappointing first half results don't reflect the inherent strength and potential of the powerful global Credit Suisse brand, but I am convinced that we are on the right path to restore Credit Suisse to its premium position in global finance. This is a formidable institution with world-class client franchises in the markets in which we operate. And this is a testament to the quality of our over 50,000 colleagues globally and our exceptional talent pool, many of whom have become friends over the last 23 years and we will stay in touch. I am very happy that Ulrich has agreed to take over the baton as Group CEO and lead the Executive Board at this important juncture in time. He's excellently positioned to take this bank to the next level given his analytical skills, his experience and his knowledge of Credit Suisse from both his most recent engagement but also his previous work at our firm. I will work closely with Ulrich over the coming weeks to ensure a smooth transition. And with that, I would like to hand back to Kinner, who actually has his birthday today.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': 'Okay, okay, so we will now begin with the Q&A part of the conference.

Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee',\n","    'text': \"Thank you in particular to Thomas. And best wishes for the team taking the group forward from here. I've got 2 questions. One is on the strategy review. I realize we'll need to wait to hear the conclusions, but I wanted to hear about how that review is being framed. And in particular, the cost target you're indicating seems to be a relatively limited change in the scope of the group. It's described more in terms of efficiencies rather than a change in scope, so I just wondered whether you're effectively ruling out significant changes in the shape and the scope of the group as you go into that review. And then my second question is more a numbers question for David, if you could just walk us through -- you talked about the RWA movements, but I wondered if you could talk us through the capital movements because capital reduced quite a lot less than the loss for the quarter. So I just wondered if you could talk us through the moving parts and what helped capital in the quarter.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Sure. I can probably take the second one, first, which I think, Jeremy -- and I think you probably just need to look at FX moves because there was a notable strengthening in the U.S. dollar in the second quarter. As we hedge forward about 65% of our equity into U.S. dollars, you'll see an appreciation in the capital base. So it's the point I referred to in my script. We neutralized the group CET1 ratio, but as the parent has a different ratio, we can't neutralize both at the same time, so that will boost the underlying group equity. Should I have a start on the first question, Thomas and Axel, and then perhaps [Indiscernible]?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Unidentified Company Representative',\n","    'text': '[Indiscernible].'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"I mean I think -- look. I think the cost reduction program is absolute priority for the Board and for executive management. We are perhaps more advanced with this than the other work because we actually started a very extensive benchmarking work in the first quarter. I think therefore, on that basis, we can say 2 or 3 things. Firstly, if we look at the current perimeter, the current -- of the bank, then we believe it is perfectly possible to operate this on the [basis of the analysis] we've done at less than CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term. Clearly we need to do our remediation programs. Those are clearly critical, but on the basis of the current structure of the bank, we think a cost target less than CHF 15.5 billion is perfectly achievable. That clearly does not preclude, and I'll pass back to Axel and Thomas, any changes in the perimeter. Clearly, if we changed the perimeters of the bank, that cost target would actually change. So that's, as you might say, Jeremy, a like-for-like view in terms of what can be achieved.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Axel Lehmann',\n","    'text': \"Yes. And maybe -- this is Axel Lehmann. Just to complement on the cost target: Yes, we did that benchmarking.

And what I said earlier, we are in a strategic review with a clear plan and the objective to make that group even more focused on the core Swiss business, Wealth Management and Asset Management; and a highly focused, highly competitive banking and a better-aligned markets business. And as we go now through the third quarter, we will develop the detailed plan and then give you the details also on the performance targets and or the targets that we will communicate to the market.

Now on the strategy, I suppose, kind of similarly to the question before, could you just explain to us kind of what sort of options would you consider for the Investment Bank, where you've relooked at that operations very, very carefully kind of last year as well? And maybe in more detail, what are the kind of theoretical options, particularly with that capital option for the securitized product platform? Just so that we get a sense of what type of changes may come. And maybe on costs, and that's particularly on wealth -- and I'm going to kind of concentrate on what's happening kind of currently.

I think, as I said before, there's been quite a lot of work that's been put into the cost program and actually very detailed benchmarking at -- in every aspect of the bank to actually support this analysis. I think that has indicated significant potential even absent the strategy review. And I think quite clearly, I mean, Thomas has very much led this. I think you know we actually have outsourced our procurement function. And I think what has been clear from that outsourcing is that there are significant potential in -- for savings in some of our supplier relationships, and that does include some of our managed servicing arrangements. So I guess, brutally, Magdalena, we're paying too much. And I think, as part of the pressure around the procurement function and the outsourcing, we do see savings there. And that will give us the ability to offset to a degree at least, because one has to recognize the inflationary pressures in the system, what we're seeing outside. And it's -- that's -- I guess it's a problem, but in that sense it's an opportunity to actually achieve that. I think the second point -- and Jo Hannaford spoke eloquently about this at the Investor Day back in June. I think we made the right and brave decision to put IT and operations back together as a single function. That's transformational in terms of what it can actually drive us in terms of scale benefits, but I think -- beyond that, I think it brings back centralized IT control, which is the right thing to do, and the ability to actually drive our IT much more effectively, so as you can guess, I'm very supportive about this. And I think it does give us potential, so I'm not decrying the cost pressures we see in the system, but I think we can, I can see 2 large levers there. And when I look at the much more detailed work that we've done across the rest of the bank, I can see how we can drive towards the CHF 1 billion to CHF 1.5 billion total for our current perimeter. And as we've said, I think that really takes us in 2 directions, one, as Axel has and Thomas has said already, in terms of the strategy review. And I think, two, basically we will obviously need to deliver gross savings in excess of that net target in order to allow for our investment plan and [to a degree] to offset the inflationary factors you're referring to, Magdalena.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Axel Lehmann',\n","    'text': 'This is Axel speaking, Magdalena.

David was reporting that he overachieved already now our targets to shift $3 billion capital from the IB to other businesses, but we clearly came to the conclusion, amongst others, also accentuated by the current market environment but not only that, [and chose] we can execute and that we want to refocus and even speed up our transformation. And we do that not shying away to looking to some businesses that are great businesses, like the SP business, but ultimately not too much connected with the rest of the group.

Anything you could elaborate there in terms of what partnership or kind of partnerships you are looking for to an extent? How much of this will be an exit of assets versus this is just a third-party participation in this business line? And also, if there's anything you can provide on the revenues and costs of that business as well, that would be appreciated. I think you've given the RWAs and leverage exposure but nothing on the P&L metrics. And then my second question would just be on the outflows. Middle East, Russian sanctioned individuals as well, you flagged out. Do you think that's now run its course? I'm interested to know if you think there's anything more to go. And anything you can say on [July] given what UBS said yesterday?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Well, perhaps I would take the two questions in order. I think -- look. I think we've given the numbers around the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure for securitized products. I'm not going to go into detailed P&L and cost metrics today. What I would say is this is a business that Credit Suisse has a long track record in. Clearly it's our origins lie in mortgage securitization, but it's expanded well beyond that into asset finance. That is a business that is seeing structural growth, particularly with the growth in private debt. There's a lot of appetite for those types of products. I think our ability to actually finance that in house is -- clearly has limits and notwithstanding the sustained profitability of this business and its high returns. And I think, therefore, it is the right thing to do, to actually consider third-party capital for this to allow us to basically maximize the potential of this franchise and, I think, without basically distorting our overall asset allocation. So we like this business, but there has to be a limit to how much capital you can actually organize. And I think there will be demand for this, and I've already received one e-mail this morning already. I think -- but it does -- it has -- this is a sustainably profitable business which does cover a very broad range of asset financing. I think, just quickly on the Russian-related outflows. Look. I think we've had outflows in -- both in respect of sanctioned clients, which we obviously do treat as a structural change because the money is locked -- and then in terms of non-sanctioned clients, we had about a CHF 1.4 billion outflow. I'm not going to comment. I think clearly it's an evolving situation, obviously, [where it's changing with] geopolitical situation. It's very uncomfortable and very difficult. [I mean just note] that we saw that in terms of those numbers. I mean, yes, I think, in terms of the third quarter -- and look. Brutally, we're only 3 weeks into the third quarter. I'm not going to comment on net new asset outflows 3 weeks into the quarter. We'll see how this quarter develops. Just do note we've had positive inflows for the first half of the year and, I think, clearly in what is a very challenging environment.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'The next question comes from Daniele Brupbacher from UBS.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Daniele Brupbacher',\n","    'text': \"Thank you and all the best to you, Thomas, as well from my side. Can I ask on capital, first? And I mean, at this point in time, are you ready and able to exclude a capital increase to -- if you go into this strategic review? Or does that really ultimately depend on the measures you'll take and probably also the impact or expected impact on parent bank given that restructurings often result in impairments there? And secondly, just on profitability. Obviously we will all guess how the go-to profile looks like over the next 3 months, but I mean you mentioned the CHF 15.5 billion like-for-like cost base. You had a 10% drop to your target in the past. One could argue that the business will be even more capital light going forward, so it should actually be higher than that. So I mean, taking a 40 billion [TNAV], that would probably imply like a net profit of 4 billion or revenues north of 20 billion, which you probably think could be a sustainable base given the current profile. Is that a fair way of looking at it? Or is there too much assumptions in there?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Perhaps I'll just kick off on capital and then hand over to Axel and Thomas in terms of the strategic review. I think the first point I'd make is I've been CFO for 12 years. And a 13.5% CET1 is one of the highest CET1 ratios we've actually ever reported, so we are in a strong capital position. And our leverage ratio is equally strong in terms of that, so I think the bank is well funded in terms of that. What I have said in the course of this morning is that I do have continued AT1 plans. I think you may note that I've given guidance of CHF 2 billion to CHF 4 billion of AT1 issuance this year, of which I've only issued [1.65 billion], so clearly we are looking to add to AT1 capital, if that's helpful, Daniele, in terms of your thinking and analysis. I think, in terms of the parent capital ratio, the drop from 11.8% to 11.4% is primarily due to FX. And I'm happy to expand on that, if you like, Daniele, but just quickly: We clearly neutralize for the group. And therefore, moves in the dollar against the Swiss franc in particular do not have an impact on the group ratio, but because the FX weighting of the parent is different from that of the group, that means that a higher dollar tends to reduce the parent capital ratio. So if we had FX rates similar to where they were at the end of the first quarter, it would have been probably closer to [11.6 or 11.7]. And then the balance basically reflects the net losses, but as you note here, I've actually seen about 1.8 billion of capital repatriations and dividends, of which $1.2 billion came from the U.K. entity CSSEL which I've talked about before, Daniele, which you know very well basically. There is an ongoing repatriation request in respect of CSSEL, and that's something we're clearly discussing with regulators. I'm not going to comment on that, but there clearly is excess capital in CSSEL because it is now a nonmaterial legal entity. And you know our plan is to repatriate the bulk of that to CSAG in due course.

And I appreciate it's all very early, but it seems that the savings that you outlined are indeed largely targeting tech, procurement, efficiency issues. Is it fair to assume that those savings will be spread across the divisions? And how does this cost efficiency drive, help to transform the Investment Bank into a less-complex and more capital-light entity? And also does it come fast enough given that the unit is losing about 1 billion underlying pretax in the first half of this year?

I mean I think, just on the tax charge, it's clearly not desirable that I have to report a tax charge at the same time as we report a group loss, but that does reflect the tax structure of the group and my limited ability to actually achieve deferred tax offsets at this particular time. So there's a limit to what I can actually do, Stefan, in terms of DTA, I'm afraid. And I think we're taking a prudent approach around tax. I think -- on the first question. Look. I think -- fair points. I think, as we've said, this cost program is an absolute priority for the Board and for the executive management of Credit Suisse. It has to happen. The work on this is advanced, but I think -- and it's -- but I think it's clear, given what Jo said at the Investor Day in June, that's probably most advanced in terms of our technology operations.

And I think it's got off to a very good start in terms of actually providing very effective and clear leadership. Procurement program, as I said before, is something -- the outsourcing, which something was -- Thomas was very much behind in terms of driving this. And I think that's heading in the right direction. I think it's perhaps a little bit embarrassing. The savings are what they are, but I guess it's an opportunity. But I think we do want to make the point that this cost program is not limited to technology or procurement, which just to answer your question specifically, Stefan, does accrue across the whole group because essentially majority of this is the corporate functions.

Just first, on compensation costs and head count. They were both up year-over-year in the quarter. And I know you've talked about the deferred comp impact here in 2022, but is it fair to assume that considerations on head counts and on comp costs feed into the CHF 15.5 billion landing points [in] OpEx and also as part of the ongoing pivots in the IB into the more capital-light activities? So that's the first question. And then secondly -- and maybe I missed this in your prepared remarks, David, but just on the [235 million] of mark-to-market losses in the quarter in leveraged finance, would that number be meaningfully different where we are now in late July?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"That's a good question. Thanks, Chris. Just to take the 2 in turn: I mean I think -- in terms of compensation costs, Chris, I think you know that last year, as a consequence of our response particularly to Archegos, we did go for a much higher level of deferral. That was an appropriate decision we made in conjunction with what -- which we made. And clearly, this year, we are actually going back to much more normal levels of deferral, so therefore, the [CVA], the cash component of the awards is substantially higher than before. I think -- in terms of the outlook for compensation costs overall, I think clearly it's a radically different investment banking environment this year than it was last year. I'm not going to prejudge how this year closes out, but I -- it doesn't seem to me like it's going to be as good a year for bonuses in 2022 as it was in 2021 across the industry. So yes, we'll look at it, basically, but the year-on-year change is primarily due to deferral changes. Clearly we have looked at this as part of our program, but it's not the primary driver in terms of what we need to do. We're talking about sustainable improvements in efficiency that we need to achieve that go far beyond compensation changes. I think, your second question, in terms of the mark-to-market on the unrealized, in particular, component of the leveraged finance. Well, it was $245 million. Would it be better in July? Well, look. Yes, you're right in the sense the indices have obviously [rallied] in the first few weeks of July, but I think a lot of wood to chop in terms of market volatility before one can make these comments. And I would be inclined to be still prudent about this. As I've said, we clearly take our marks continuously. It's not just done at the end of a quarter. It's done on a regular basis. And that reflects both deals that have actually funded already where we've exited but also marked to market against future funding commitments. So I think that's a protocol which, I would say, I've followed since 2007; and I think it's the prudent way to think about it. You're right. The indices have narrowed, but just history from the past basically says you can't always judge specific trades by moves in indices basically. So I would still be cautious, Chris, in terms of this. I think there's -- we're still in the course of a very difficult market environment with very radical changes in the interest rates structure. And it clearly has a -- and clearly, Chris, as I said in my prepared remarks, there does have to be a much increased chance of a significant recession at some point in the next 12 months.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'The next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen with Royal Bank of Canada.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Anke Reingen',\n","    'text': \"Also from me, thank you, Thomas, and all the best.

The reason I ask is, number one, had you not had 5 billion of IB deleveraging, you would have been 30 basis points lower. And then number two, how long do the FX hedges stay in place? Do they roll off at some point? So I guess my question is, if you keep on making losses, would you see your CET1 ratio drop lower? So that was my first question.

Is it on awarding of these packages [or on vestment]?'},\n","   {'speaker': 'David Mathers',\n","    'text': \"Well, firstly, I think, just in terms of the CET1 ratio, I mean, I think clearly there's clearly a number of moving parts there. Obviously we did reduce our business usage. And that was clearly part of the plan we actually had last year, so I think that's to be expected, primarily in the IB clearly, but I think clearly we also had the leveraged finance losses [Indiscernible] overall performance of the banks and including litigation charges. So there clearly is a number of volatile items within that. I think it seems prudent to give a range of 13% to 14%. I'm not really going to add to it beyond that. As I said, I think it is a very high capital ratio for the bank, certainly compared to historic norms. And indeed we did include a comparison at the back of the deck against many of our peers. So I think that is worth keeping in mind. On the FX point. It's we continuously roll the -- roughly 65% of our CET1 forward, so they don't have an expiry date in terms of that. It's just part of our normal treasury management. We've run it continuously on that basis. That's separate from my term-out strategy for the shareholders' equity which I mentioned before, which I think you may be alluding to, where we have been keeping it relatively short for the last couple of years, typically around 2.5 years. I think [we're weather right to] these sorts of events coming at some point, although they've been clearly much, much more marked than I would have expected. And we have been seeking to -- we have been terming that out in the course of recent months basically, as interest rates have actually moved up, to actually lock that in. And those are typically termed out to somewhere between 4 and 5 years. [Andrew asked that] question, but there are 2 separate things. One is my term-out strategy for the equity. The other is my FX exposure management -- sorry. And you asked a technical question around retention and recognition and -- well, look. I think this -- I don't think I can add too much in terms of details. If I talk about the program we did last year, to give you some idea: Typically speaking, those were 3-year instruments; and they vest roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 basically. So it's a time-weighted basis, so it's -- if they were awarded for 6 months, it would be 1/6, 1/3, 1/3, 1/6, depending on when they're actually awarded.

There's nothing particularly new that's popped up to drive the RPL number. I think, on the second question, just on SP. I just would guide you against from -- kind of assuming that this is an exit from securitized products. This is a very successful platform. It's been core to the bank for a very long time indeed, firstly, in mortgages, and now in terms of asset financing. There's a lot of potential to actually grow this business, if you had to deploy more capital. We do have some limits on what we can do to actually support it. It's a great team. And that's really what we're looking to actually do here, frankly, so I just want to caution against this is an exit from SP. It's not. This is a business where we do see potential to basically grow and invest in it, albeit with third-party support for this operation.

Thank you for joining our Third Quarter 2022 Results Call. So we have a busy schedule ahead of us with our third quarter earnings presentation, followed by the 2022 strategy update presentation, which as you know begins at 9:30 GMT. So please note that this call will very much be focused on earnings and I kindly ask you to respect that in the Q&A that follows. Before we begin, please note all the legal disclaimers in the presentation and let me remind you the important cautionary statements including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse third quarter 2022 earnings release published this morning. Let me remind you that our third quarter financial report and the accompanying financial statements for the period will be published in early November. I will now hand over to our Group CEO, Ulrich Körner; and our Group CFO, Dixit Joshi, who will run through our numbers.\\nUlrich Körner: Thank you very much, Kinner and thank you all for joining today. We appreciate your participation and engagement. For the purpose of this call, we intend to focus on our third quarter performance only, and I will share some brief remarks before handing over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Dixit Joshi. We will discuss the outcomes of our strategic review later today, starting at 9:30 London time. I hope that many of you on this call will be able to join us then. Let me turn to performance. Overall, our results for the third quarter 2022 were significantly impacted by the continued challenging market and macroeconomic conditions. They were also reflective of underperformance compared to peers in certain business lines. And importantly, the effects of some of the strategic decisions that we have announced today. Starting with the headline numbers. Here on Slide 4 of the presentation, we reported a net loss of CHF4 billion in the quarter including a CHF3.7 billion impairment related to the reassessment of deferred tax assets resulting from the strategic review. Our reported pre-tax loss was CHF300 million and included CHF200 million in major litigation provisions, which I will expand on shortly. The adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF100 million, mainly due to an investment banking – a weak investment banking performance, as well as somewhat lower client activity across all our divisions. In terms of our capital position, our CET1 capital ratio for the quarter was 12.6%, down 90 basis points. This was primarily due to the impact of deferred tax assets of approximately 50 basis points relating to the strategic review, together with the pretax loss and increased risk-weighted assets. Today we have announced the capital raise of CHF4 billion, which would increase the pro forma CET1 ratio to 14%. This means that we begin our strategic transformation from a position of capital strengths. Now let me turn to the details on the progress we are making towards resolving legacy litigation issues with the next slide. Total litigation provisions for the quarter were CHF245 million, of which CHF178 million, where major litigation provisions, primarily related to previously disclosed matters as we continue to take a proactive approach to reducing our litigation docket. The two most prominent recent examples of resolutions are: first, the settlement agreement with the New Jersey Attorney General related to a legacy residential mortgage-backed securities case, which was already fully provisioned. This resolved the largest of the bank's remaining exposure in the RMBS docket with transactions going back to before 2008. Second, the successful settlement in the French legacy case announced this week. Those represent major milestones in our efforts to achieve a significant reduction in our outstanding litigation docket and are supported by a quarter-on-quarter reduction in the range of reasonably possible losses of around 19%. Let's look at the breakdown of the third quarter results by division with the next slide. The loss in the quarter was predominantly driven by the weak performance in the Investment Bank which was impacted by higher volatility widened credit spreads and muted primary issuance resulting in an adjusted pre-tax loss of the divisions -- of the division of CHF640 million. The difficult macro environment also impacted the year-on-year performances of our Wealth Management division which posted an adjusted pre-tax income of CHF78 million including a CHF145 million of impairments related to certain IT-related assets. The Swiss Bank and Asset Management divisions both had a solid performance with adjusted pre-tax income of CHF383 million and CHF104 million respectively. With that I hand it over to Dixit who will walk you through the results in more detail. \\nDixit Joshi: Thank you Ulrich and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting my first set of quarterly results at Credit Suisse and look forward to speaking to some of you in person later today. I will now provide some details on our performance at the group and the divisional levels. As you all know challenging conditions continued during the third quarter with heightened market volatility, weak customer flows, and ongoing client deleveraging and our financial performance reflects these challenges. So, let's start with the group numbers. Reported net revenues for the group decreased 30% year-on-year to CHF3.8 billion. The key drivers were substantially lower levels of activity across the industry in equity capital markets and leverage finance which contributed to a weak performance in the Investment Bank and subdued client activity in Wealth Management especially in terms of transaction-based activity. Total reported operating expenses were 10% lower year-on-year at CHF4.13 billion. Ulrich has already mentioned the major litigation provisions of CHF178 million and the progress that we are making with regard to our legacy issues. Overall, our reported pre-tax loss for the quarter was CHF342 million. Adjusted operating expenses were down 6% year-on-year at CHF3.87 billion, mainly driven by lower compensation and benefits expenses. This was partially offset by an impairment of IT-related assets in Wealth Management totaling CHF145 million. On an adjusted basis, we recorded a pre-tax loss of CHF92 million in the third quarter. We also reported an income tax charge of CHF3.7 billion in the quarter of which the majority CHF3.66 billion was an impairment related to a reassessment of deferred tax assets resulting from our strategic review and so is not related to our third quarter operating performance. The net loss attributable to shareholders including the income tax expense totaled CHF4.03 billion for the quarter. Turning now to assets under management on the next slide. Market movements were the main driver of a CHF53 billion decline in assets under management for the group quarter-on-quarter. This includes net asset outflows of CHF12.9 billion. At this point, I would like to provide some additional context and commentary on asset flows at the start of the fourth quarter. We did see a significant level of deposit and AUM outflows during the first two weeks of October. Whilst these outflows have stabilized since this period they've not yet reversed. We have plans to address these matters after 27th of October through amongst other things accessing capital markets and executing the strategic initiatives we have announced today. We would note that the execution of these measures is also expected to generate liquidity and reduce the funding requirements of the group. Let's now turn to costs on the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted operating costs were 6% lower year-on-year at CHF 3.87 billion. This was mainly due to a reduction in our compensation and benefits accruals of CHF 398 million, reflecting our revenue performance and pre-tax loss in the third quarter. The figure also includes a charge of CHF 145 million that I mentioned earlier as we took the decision to impair IT-related assets in Wealth Management following a review of our technology and platform strategy in the division. We continue to make investments in technology and in Wealth Management though the associated costs were partly offset by savings and business exits. Later on today, we will provide details of our strategic plan to reduce costs further over the next three years. The IT impairments taken in the second and third quarters are evidence of our willingness to take action in the short-term for longer-term benefit. Let's now turn to our capital ratios on the next slide. Our quarter-end CET1 ratio was 12.6%, a decrease of 90 basis points compared to the end of the second quarter. Let me take you through the key drivers. First, we saw a 12 basis point reduction from the pre-tax loss for the quarter. Second, certain CET1 capital movements accounted for a further 20 basis point reduction. And third, net increases in RWAs in the quarter accounted for a net reduction of 11 basis points. This takes us to a CET1 ratio of 13.1% before the impacts of today's announcements. Taking these in turn the strategy related deferred tax assets impairment reduces the CET1 ratio for the third quarter by 48 basis points to the reported 12.6%. This is more than offset though by the CHF 4 billion capital raise, which adds around 140 basis points taking us to a pro forma CET1 ratio for the third quarter of 14%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10 basis points lower at 6%, compared to the previous quarter before the strategy impact. The 21 basis point reduction due to the strategy related deferred tax impact is more than offset by an increase of around 45 basis points coming from the capital raise. And this takes the pro forma Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter to 6.5%. A few points on parent capital. As a result of our strategy announcement in particular the capital raise, the Credit Suisse AG Swiss CET1 ratio has reduced significantly due to further participation valuation adjustments. In contrast, the announced capital actions are expected to strengthen the group CET1 ratio. In light of the bank's transformation, FINMA has reduced the size of the capital surcharges for the bank's market share and its size according to the capital adequacy ordinance. This results in a lower total capital requirement for Credit Suisse Group AG and its domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the bank parent company will temporarily use capital buffers until the end of 2025 in line with the capital adequacy ordinance and the regulatory guidance by FINMA. This allows the bank effective and efficient capital management during the transformation period. Let's now turn to our business divisions, which we will discuss as usual on an adjusted basis. And I'll start with Wealth Management. Total net revenues in Wealth Management were CHF 1.36 billion, down 14% year-on-year impacted by lower client activity volumes and recurring revenues. Net interest income improved 20% due to higher deposit revenues, which reflected higher interest rates especially in US dollars. This was more than offset by lower recurring commissions and fees, which down 18% and a reduction in transaction-based revenues of 40%. Looking at the revenue lines in more detail. The decline in recurring commissions and fees reflected lower average assets under management and lower service-driven fees. In terms of transaction-based revenues, clients continue to be cautious especially in our Asia Pacific franchise, which impacted Global Trading Solutions revenues. We also saw further mark-to-market losses on our fair value portfolio of CHF 35 million related to the APAC Financing Group. Operating expenses were 9% higher at CHF 1.27 billion mainly driven by an impairment of IT-related assets of CHF 145 million following a review of the wealth management technology and platform strategy. We continue to simplify our technology state and position Wealth Management for the implementation of our new strategy though the costs associated with this were partly offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses. Overall adjusted pretax income for the division was 80% lower year-on-year at CHF 78 million. There were net outflows of CHF 6.4 billion in the quarter due to a combination of clients deleveraging and proactive derisking.  Let's turn to the Swiss Bank. The Swiss Bank delivered a resilient performance notwithstanding the impact on threshold benefits as Swiss interest rates have risen with total net revenues 9% lower year-on-year at CHF 956 million. Net interest income decreased 11% mainly driven by lower threshold benefits from the Swiss National Bank.  As a reminder this threshold benefit has been worth around CHF 350 million per annum while rates have been at minus 75 basis points. But as Swiss interest rates have moved towards 0 that benefit has eroded the effect of this should bottom out around the middle of 2023. Recurring commissions and fees were down 3% year-on-year due to lower assets under management partly offset by higher fees generated from lending. Transaction-based revenues were 17% lower year-on-year. However, we did see a transition gain relating to IBOR in the third quarter of last year.  If we exclude this, as well as gains on certain equity investments transaction-based revenues were 4% lower year-on-year. Operating expenses were 7% lower year-on-year at CHF 552 million mainly due to reductions in compensation and benefits. This translated into a pretax income of CHF 383 million, 15% lower than the same quarter last year. There were net outflows in the quarter of CHF 1.5 billion with outflows of CHF 1.7 billion from private clients, partly offset by inflows of CHF 200 million from institutional clients. Let's now turn to Asset Management. Revenues here improved compared to the second quarter but were down year-on-year as a result of market uncertainty and reduced client appetite. Overall net revenues were 15% lower year-on-year at CHF 346 million. Management fees declined by 13% year-on-year in line with a 13% decrease in assets under management, mainly the result of market movements and currency effects.  A 47% improvement in investment in partnership income was more than offset by a 56% fall in performance transactions and placement revenues. Operating expenses were 11% lower year-on-year mainly driven by lower expenses related to the supply chain finance fund matter and reduced compensation and benefits. Overall pretax income decreased 21% year-on-year to CHF 104 million. There were net asset outflows of CHF 4.2 billion over the quarter, across both traditional and alternative investments, partly offset by inflows from investments and partnerships.  Let's now turn to the Investment Bank. The Investment Bank faced challenging conditions in the third quarter with higher volatility widened credit spreads and muted primary issuance. As a result, total net revenues were 58% lower year-on-year at $1.14 billion. Within primary our performance this quarter has been broadly comparable with peers in a depressed market, whereas a comparatively weak sales and trading performance is largely reflective of our business mix.  As we have evolved in recent years, we have deemphasized certain business lines such as macro where our peers have been able to benefit from higher volatility. Later this morning, we'll discuss the steps that we're taking to address this including refocusing our markets business. Capital markets revenues were impacted by substantially lower activity in the equity capital leverage finance markets and also include mark-to-market losses of $120 million in leveraged finance. We continue to take steps to de-risk our book and our non-investment-grade underwriting portfolio was down 40% compared to the end of 2021.  Advisory revenues were 39% lower year-on-year with lower deal closings and again this was in line with peers. Equities revenues were down 54% against a strong third quarter in 2021. This was driven by reduced equity derivatives and cash trading revenues and also reflected the exit from Prime Services.  Fixed income revenues were 32% lower year-on-year due to a decline in securitized products and global credit products, partly offset by higher macro revenues as a result of higher volatility. Operating expenses were 12% lower year-on-year, at US$1.78 billion reflecting lower compensation and benefits and revenue-related expenses. This resulted in an adjusted pre-tax loss of US$640 million. Clearly, this is not an acceptable outcome. And again, we will outline the steps we are taking to reshape our business model later on this morning. Risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure were down 10% and 20% respectively year-on-year, reflecting reduced business activity as well as management actions. Let me finish with a look at the Corporate Center. Net revenues were CHF 35 million while operating expenses were 62% lower year-on-year, at CHF 76 million. As a result, the Corporate Center delivered a pre-tax loss of CHF 41 million down from a pre-tax loss of CHF 212 million for the same period last year. The asset resolution unit, which sits within the Corporate Center generated a pre-tax loss of CHF 28 million compared to a pre-tax loss of CHF 73 million in the third quarter of last year. RWAs declined by US$2 billion to US$6 billion and leverage exposure by US$5 billion to US$14 billion over the same period, as we continue to wind down the book. With that, thank you very much and I'll hand over to Kinner. \\nKinner Lakhani: Great. Thank you. So we'll now begin the Q&A part of the conference. I would kindly remind you again to focus on earnings. There will be time for strategy, later this morning. Also given time restriction, if everybody could stick to a maximum of two questions, please. So over to Alice. Thank you. \\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. \\nStefan Stalmann: Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. My two questions are as follows. The first one on your deposits, customer deposits in the group balance sheet. They are down by 5% during the quarter. And I guess on an FX-neutral basis, given the strength of dollar it would be even more. Can you give any color please, on what drove this reduction maybe by business lines geography currency whatever makes sense? And the second question, on your capital situation at the AG. The UK authorities approved a roughly CHF 5 billion capital repatriation in early September. Has that actually been executed please? Thank you very much.\\nUlrich Körner: Thank you for both questions and thank you for joining the call. I'll take the second one, first. The answer is, yes. We did repatriate the CHF 5 billion out of our UK entities and that was supportive of our parent capital ratio in the third quarter. Quite frankly, that follows a legal entity simplification strategy that we've been investing in over the years, that's contributed in the region of about CHF 18 billion of efficiencies to date. We will continue investing in that initiative over the next three years, and we'd expect that to free up more parent capital during that period as well. On the deposit front, what you have seen in the third quarter as we show on Slide 9, is really that a combination of market moves and NNA outflows have led to a reduction in AUM in the third quarter. Net new asset outflows were in the region of CHF 13 billion in the third quarter. As you know, the negative social media news around our name at the beginning of October did lead to outflows across our franchise. It's something that we're looking to address today, through the strategic announcements that we're making, including the CHF 4 billion capital raise and ensuring that we're well capitalized through this transformation period, while we make the transformational announcements and restructuring across our investment bank and other business areas. \\nStefan Stalmann: Thank you very much.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Thank you very much and good morning. I am going to have to follow up on the question about the outflows? Because of course, I think from one perspective I think the market was prepared for them given what you've just kind of discussed in terms of what we have kind of seen in the markets and the media as well. But could you give us a sense of how concentrated those outflows were versus more broad-based. And we've seen the outflows I think, because you've provided us with so much information but there seems to be outflows in APAC and MENA, but for example not in EMEA. Would you be able to kind of give us a sense of kind of what actually happened during the quarter and maybe in the beginning of and maybe in October as well to kind of for us to be able to assess how to look at them going forward.\\nUlrich Körner: Sure. Thanks, Magdalena. So if you look at the Wealth Management situation you've seen the outflows of CHF 6.4 billion for the quarter. And you rightly put it which you then see reflected in the transaction-based income line as well. Our Wealth Management business is very strong as you know in APAC in emerging markets that has impacted that clearly as you said. If you look at the CHF 6.4 billion it's a combination in the third quarter of deleveraging and derisking if you want to so about CHF 3 billion comes from deleveraging another like CHF 2 billion is a proactive call it derisking and then some additional deposit outflows. I think that's the right way to think about everyone. \\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Thank you very much.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \\nKian Abouhossein: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is on advisers and concern around adviser morale clearly but if I look at the numbers they are down quarter-on-quarter in adviser numbers. And I just wanted to see -- is that driven by business exits, or what are you doing to retain advisers, i.e. do you have to write fixed contracts at this point? And how should we think about the trend into the fourth quarter in terms of advisers and in that context this clients do you need to increase deposit rates in order to retain i.e. should we think about NII changes in the Wealth Management business in terms of impact from deposit remuneration that you might have to give. And then the second question is just on funding. Clearly your funding costs have changed quite materially lately. And I just wonder how we should think about financing for this year and going forward if there's any delay in financing from your perspective? \\nUlrich Korner: Okay. Thank you very much. Let me start – excuse me, with the number of relationship managers you're referring to on Page 12 actually there is nothing I would say from my point of view unusual behind as you know we said last year that we would build on that number and enlarge that number over time. Also that is in principle unchanged because we want to grow our business, and therefore also over time enlarge that number. Having said that if you look at this market environment and what it has done not only to us but to all in terms of market performance et cetera it's clear that we slowed that down in line with the overall development of the results. And this is more driven here than by call it natural fluctuations and not being too fast to replace them if not necessary or build them put out I think that's what's behind no more. \\nDixit Joshi : Kinner, I'll take the second two questions. On funding and deposits I guess somewhat interlinked. Funding costs this year we think are up about CHF 160 million year-on-year. That's on a full year basis versus last year. You've seen the uptick in spreads across the entire industry including on our name. And the idiosyncratic effects in October have resulted in wider spreads on our name as well. Look today's announcements that we'll speak about during the Strategy Day, the actions we're taking on the investment bank, the lower leverage and RWA footprint that we will run with, the reduction of our risk profile and exposure through the Securitized Products exit, all of those items I think will be conducive to a tightening of spreads over time, and we think that would allow us to reduce our funding costs as we get through the transformation. In terms of deposit rates, we would be looking to regain our market share and would be competitive as you'd expect us to be. It's not lost on us that look you did see in the US as a result of really liquidity in the system contracting especially from central banks that you did see large reductions in deposits in the United States as well. And I suspect that's something that we might see globally as well. So in that environment we'll remain competitive.\\nKian Abouhossein: And may I just follow-up very briefly on the debt schedule. Can you -- clearly that is changing with your restructuring, can you give us indication of how much debt you still want to refinance this year and next year?\\nDixit Joshi: Yes. Happy to. And you'll see in the fixed income deck that was published as well. We outlined our revised plans for this year. We'd expect to do in the region of around CHF2 billion of further AT1 through the course of the fourth quarter and in the region of CHF4 billion or CHF5 billion of HoldCo debt as well. Look the strategy announcements that we have -- that we'll talk about later result in a freeing up of liquidity. And of course with the lower leverage exposure, we would find efficiencies in our funding through the next two or three years and that should result in not just improved funding costs, but quite frankly just lower funding requirements in the capital market as well.\\nKian Abouhossein: Very helpful. Thank you.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\nJeremy Sigee: Good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up again on the outflows point. You quite deliberately told us about outflows in October after the quarter end. And I just wondered if you could give us a sense of scale, are they a similar run rate to what we had in 3Q, which was CHF6 billion to maybe CHF2 billion in the month, or is it more or less than that? Any sense of scale would be really helpful. Thank you.\\nUlrich Körner: What we have seen and -- thanks for the question. What we have seen in particular at the beginning of October certainly a heightened level of outflows, which was very much based on what you have seen in the media enterprise rumors. And let me say here very clearly to the largest extent possible factual incorrect rumors. But that has affected the overall situation that has come in and down very significantly in the last couple of weeks actually.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Amit Goel with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nAmit Goel: Hi, thank you. I'm not sure if maybe this has been for the strategy presentation. But have you given the P&L contributions for the SPG Group for this quarter and for prior periods in the release I couldn't quite find it. I saw, obviously, overall non-core unit P&L contribution?\\nDixit Joshi: Amit, hi. Was there a second question Amit, you broke up?\\nAmit Goel: I know it was one question. I was just curious if you've given SPG P&L contribution for the Q3 and for prior quarters?\\nDixit Joshi: We haven't broken out the SPG contribution and it's unlikely that we'll be breaking that out as well over the next quarter.\\nAmit Goel: Okay. And just a second related question on that. Have you indicated anywhere any gain or loss on the transaction?\\nDixit Joshi: Amit you'll hear more about that today during our strategy announcement. We make a series of planning announcements -- planning assumptions, any gain or loss would be embedded into those assumptions. But again we'll be more fulsome in our discussion during the strategy day.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Piers Brown with HSBC. Please go ahead.\\nPiers Brown: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to come back to the topic of liquidity, but you did mention in the report that you breached certain legal entity LCR requirements during the quarter. I wonder if you could just elaborate on that and whether you can also give us the balance, the HQLA balance at the end of the quarter? And possibly if you have the number for October as well that would be even better. I think that number at the end of Q2 is CHF 230 billion roundabout. So if you could update on that? Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: Sure. Happy to. Increasingly, we don't think about our liquidity in HQLA terms because it's not the best indicator of our liquidity position as it doesn't provide the full picture. As you know, we're derisking our balance sheet and so NCOs are reducing. And as such, actually we focus on the liquidity coverage ratio. The LCR at the end of the third quarter was around 192%. And so it was pretty strong and probably at the highest end by peer standards. That of course has gone down as we've indicated in our disclosures through the month of October. And that's partly related to the previous question that I got around funding from Kian, which is we will then commence funding subsequent to the announcements today. We had self-selected to be out of the capital markets during the month of October given the strategic announcements that were coming today and we'd be once again commencing funding activities. The second is just what you'll hear about later and you'll see -- and I won't go through all the detail right now is that the leverage exposure reductions and balance sheet reductions that we have as part of our strategic announcements actually reduce our funding needs greatly over the next few years.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: Yeah. Good morning, and thank you. I wanted to ask about this Slide 18 from the second quarter where you showed the potential impact on revenues coming from shift to yield curves based on the forward curve whether you could give us an update there. Obviously, we had major moves for the general update by currency would be super helpful and probably by -- I think you also broke it down by division if I recall correctly? Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: Daniele, hi. Sure, happy to take that question. When we look at -- and we've given previous disclosure around this, but when we look at updated yield curves from most recently on a static balance sheet. We'd expect in the region of around CHF 1 billion net of uplift next year in NII. And I think that's a combination of two effects. The one is elevated rates compared to where we are. And the second is making some adjustments and being prudent around the size of deposit base as well and that would be a CHF 1 billion uplift next year.\\nEnd of Q&A:\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no more questions at this time. Kinner, back to you for closing remarks.\\nKinner Lakhani: Very good. So thanks very much. Look forward to catching up later in the morning. And of course in the meantime, if you have any questions feel free to reach out to us in the IR team.

Here on Slide 4 of the presentation, we reported a net loss of CHF4 billion in the quarter including a CHF3.7 billion impairment related to the reassessment of deferred tax assets resulting from the strategic review. Our reported pre-tax loss was CHF300 million and included CHF200 million in major litigation provisions, which I will expand on shortly. The adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF100 million, mainly due to an investment banking – a weak investment banking performance, as well as somewhat lower client activity across all our divisions. In terms of our capital position, our CET1 capital ratio for the quarter was 12.6%, down 90 basis points. This was primarily due to the impact of deferred tax assets of approximately 50 basis points relating to the strategic review, together with the pretax loss and increased risk-weighted assets. Today we have announced the capital raise of CHF4 billion, which would increase the pro forma CET1 ratio to 14%. This means that we begin our strategic transformation from a position of capital strengths. Now let me turn to the details on the progress we are making towards resolving legacy litigation issues with the next slide. Total litigation provisions for the quarter were CHF245 million, of which CHF178 million, where major litigation provisions, primarily related to previously disclosed matters as we continue to take a proactive approach to reducing our litigation docket. The two most prominent recent examples of resolutions are: first, the settlement agreement with the New Jersey Attorney General related to a legacy residential mortgage-backed securities case, which was already fully provisioned. This resolved the largest of the bank's remaining exposure in the RMBS docket with transactions going back to before 2008. Second, the successful settlement in the French legacy case announced this week. Those represent major milestones in our efforts to achieve a significant reduction in our outstanding litigation docket and are supported by a quarter-on-quarter reduction in the range of reasonably possible losses of around 19%. Let's look at the breakdown of the third quarter results by division with the next slide. The loss in the quarter was predominantly driven by the weak performance in the Investment Bank which was impacted by higher volatility widened credit spreads and muted primary issuance resulting in an adjusted pre-tax loss of the divisions -- of the division of CHF640 million. The difficult macro environment also impacted the year-on-year performances of our Wealth Management division which posted an adjusted pre-tax income of CHF78 million including a CHF145 million of impairments related to certain IT-related assets. The Swiss Bank and Asset Management divisions both had a solid performance with adjusted pre-tax income of CHF383 million and CHF104 million respectively. With that I hand it over to Dixit who will walk you through the results in more detail. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Thank you Ulrich and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting my first set of quarterly results at Credit Suisse and look forward to speaking to some of you in person later today. I will now provide some details on our performance at the group and the divisional levels. As you all know challenging conditions continued during the third quarter with heightened market volatility, weak customer flows, and ongoing client deleveraging and our financial performance reflects these challenges. So, let's start with the group numbers. Reported net revenues for the group decreased 30% year-on-year to CHF3.8 billion. The key drivers were substantially lower levels of activity across the industry in equity capital markets and leverage finance which contributed to a weak performance in the Investment Bank and subdued client activity in Wealth Management especially in terms of transaction-based activity. Total reported operating expenses were 10% lower year-on-year at CHF4.13 billion. Ulrich has already mentioned the major litigation provisions of CHF178 million and the progress that we are making with regard to our legacy issues. Overall, our reported pre-tax loss for the quarter was CHF342 million. Adjusted operating expenses were down 6% year-on-year at CHF3.87 billion, mainly driven by lower compensation and benefits expenses. This was partially offset by an impairment of IT-related assets in Wealth Management totaling CHF145 million. On an adjusted basis, we recorded a pre-tax loss of CHF92 million in the third quarter. We also reported an income tax charge of CHF3.7 billion in the quarter of which the majority CHF3.66 billion was an impairment related to a reassessment of deferred tax assets resulting from our strategic review and so is not related to our third quarter operating performance. The net loss attributable to shareholders including the income tax expense totaled CHF4.03 billion for the quarter. Turning now to assets under management on the next slide. Market movements were the main driver of a CHF53 billion decline in assets under management for the group quarter-on-quarter. This includes net asset outflows of CHF12.9 billion. At this point, I would like to provide some additional context and commentary on asset flows at the start of the fourth quarter. We did see a significant level of deposit and AUM outflows during the first two weeks of October. Whilst these outflows have stabilized since this period they've not yet reversed. We have plans to address these matters after 27th of October through amongst other things accessing capital markets and executing the strategic initiatives we have announced today. We would note that the execution of these measures is also expected to generate liquidity and reduce the funding requirements of the group. Let's now turn to costs on the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted operating costs were 6% lower year-on-year at CHF 3.87 billion. This was mainly due to a reduction in our compensation and benefits accruals of CHF 398 million, reflecting our revenue performance and pre-tax loss in the third quarter. The figure also includes a charge of CHF 145 million that I mentioned earlier as we took the decision to impair IT-related assets in Wealth Management following a review of our technology and platform strategy in the division. We continue to make investments in technology and in Wealth Management though the associated costs were partly offset by savings and business exits. Later on today, we will provide details of our strategic plan to reduce costs further over the next three years. The IT impairments taken in the second and third quarters are evidence of our willingness to take action in the short-term for longer-term benefit. Let's now turn to our capital ratios on the next slide. Our quarter-end CET1 ratio was 12.6%, a decrease of 90 basis points compared to the end of the second quarter. Let me take you through the key drivers. First, we saw a 12 basis point reduction from the pre-tax loss for the quarter. Second, certain CET1 capital movements accounted for a further 20 basis point reduction. And third, net increases in RWAs in the quarter accounted for a net reduction of 11 basis points. This takes us to a CET1 ratio of 13.1% before the impacts of today's announcements. Taking these in turn the strategy related deferred tax assets impairment reduces the CET1 ratio for the third quarter by 48 basis points to the reported 12.6%. This is more than offset though by the CHF 4 billion capital raise, which adds around 140 basis points taking us to a pro forma CET1 ratio for the third quarter of 14%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10 basis points lower at 6%, compared to the previous quarter before the strategy impact. The 21 basis point reduction due to the strategy related deferred tax impact is more than offset by an increase of around 45 basis points coming from the capital raise. And this takes the pro forma Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter to 6.5%. A few points on parent capital. As a result of our strategy announcement in particular the capital raise, the Credit Suisse AG Swiss CET1 ratio has reduced significantly due to further participation valuation adjustments. In contrast, the announced capital actions are expected to strengthen the group CET1 ratio. In light of the bank's transformation, FINMA has reduced the size of the capital surcharges for the bank's market share and its size according to the capital adequacy ordinance. This results in a lower total capital requirement for Credit Suisse Group AG and its domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the bank parent company will temporarily use capital buffers until the end of 2025 in line with the capital adequacy ordinance and the regulatory guidance by FINMA. This allows the bank effective and efficient capital management during the transformation period. Let's now turn to our business divisions, which we will discuss as usual on an adjusted basis. And I'll start with Wealth Management. Total net revenues in Wealth Management were CHF 1.36 billion, down 14% year-on-year impacted by lower client activity volumes and recurring revenues. Net interest income improved 20% due to higher deposit revenues, which reflected higher interest rates especially in US dollars. This was more than offset by lower recurring commissions and fees, which down 18% and a reduction in transaction-based revenues of 40%. Looking at the revenue lines in more detail. The decline in recurring commissions and fees reflected lower average assets under management and lower service-driven fees. In terms of transaction-based revenues, clients continue to be cautious especially in our Asia Pacific franchise, which impacted Global Trading Solutions revenues. We also saw further mark-to-market losses on our fair value portfolio of CHF 35 million related to the APAC Financing Group. Operating expenses were 9% higher at CHF 1.27 billion mainly driven by an impairment of IT-related assets of CHF 145 million following a review of the wealth management technology and platform strategy. We continue to simplify our technology state and position Wealth Management for the implementation of our new strategy though the costs associated with this were partly offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses. Overall adjusted pretax income for the division was 80% lower year-on-year at CHF 78 million. There were net outflows of CHF 6.4 billion in the quarter due to a combination of clients deleveraging and proactive derisking.  Let's turn to the Swiss Bank. The Swiss Bank delivered a resilient performance notwithstanding the impact on threshold benefits as Swiss interest rates have risen with total net revenues 9% lower year-on-year at CHF 956 million. Net interest income decreased 11% mainly driven by lower threshold benefits from the Swiss National Bank.  As a reminder this threshold benefit has been worth around CHF 350 million per annum while rates have been at minus 75 basis points. But as Swiss interest rates have moved towards 0 that benefit has eroded the effect of this should bottom out around the middle of 2023. Recurring commissions and fees were down 3% year-on-year due to lower assets under management partly offset by higher fees generated from lending. Transaction-based revenues were 17% lower year-on-year. However, we did see a transition gain relating to IBOR in the third quarter of last year.  If we exclude this, as well as gains on certain equity investments transaction-based revenues were 4% lower year-on-year. Operating expenses were 7% lower year-on-year at CHF 552 million mainly due to reductions in compensation and benefits. This translated into a pretax income of CHF 383 million, 15% lower than the same quarter last year. There were net outflows in the quarter of CHF 1.5 billion with outflows of CHF 1.7 billion from private clients, partly offset by inflows of CHF 200 million from institutional clients. Let's now turn to Asset Management. Revenues here improved compared to the second quarter but were down year-on-year as a result of market uncertainty and reduced client appetite. Overall net revenues were 15% lower year-on-year at CHF 346 million. Management fees declined by 13% year-on-year in line with a 13% decrease in assets under management, mainly the result of market movements and currency effects.  A 47% improvement in investment in partnership income was more than offset by a 56% fall in performance transactions and placement revenues. Operating expenses were 11% lower year-on-year mainly driven by lower expenses related to the supply chain finance fund matter and reduced compensation and benefits. Overall pretax income decreased 21% year-on-year to CHF 104 million. There were net asset outflows of CHF 4.2 billion over the quarter, across both traditional and alternative investments, partly offset by inflows from investments and partnerships.  Let's now turn to the Investment Bank. The Investment Bank faced challenging conditions in the third quarter with higher volatility widened credit spreads and muted primary issuance. As a result, total net revenues were 58% lower year-on-year at $1.14 billion. Within primary our performance this quarter has been broadly comparable with peers in a depressed market, whereas a comparatively weak sales and trading performance is largely reflective of our business mix.  As we have evolved in recent years, we have deemphasized certain business lines such as macro where our peers have been able to benefit from higher volatility. Later this morning, we'll discuss the steps that we're taking to address this including refocusing our markets business. Capital markets revenues were impacted by substantially lower activity in the equity capital leverage finance markets and also include mark-to-market losses of $120 million in leveraged finance. We continue to take steps to de-risk our book and our non-investment-grade underwriting portfolio was down 40% compared to the end of 2021.  Advisory revenues were 39% lower year-on-year with lower deal closings and again this was in line with peers. Equities revenues were down 54% against a strong third quarter in 2021. This was driven by reduced equity derivatives and cash trading revenues and also reflected the exit from Prime Services.  Fixed income revenues were 32% lower year-on-year due to a decline in securitized products and global credit products, partly offset by higher macro revenues as a result of higher volatility. Operating expenses were 12% lower year-on-year, at US$1.78 billion reflecting lower compensation and benefits and revenue-related expenses. This resulted in an adjusted pre-tax loss of US$640 million. Clearly, this is not an acceptable outcome. And again, we will outline the steps we are taking to reshape our business model later on this morning. Risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure were down 10% and 20% respectively year-on-year, reflecting reduced business activity as well as management actions. Let me finish with a look at the Corporate Center. Net revenues were CHF 35 million while operating expenses were 62% lower year-on-year, at CHF 76 million. As a result, the Corporate Center delivered a pre-tax loss of CHF 41 million down from a pre-tax loss of CHF 212 million for the same period last year. The asset resolution unit, which sits within the Corporate Center generated a pre-tax loss of CHF 28 million compared to a pre-tax loss of CHF 73 million in the third quarter of last year. RWAs declined by US$2 billion to US$6 billion and leverage exposure by US$5 billion to US$14 billion over the same period, as we continue to wind down the book. With that, thank you very much and I'll hand over to Kinner. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': \"Great. Thank you. So we'll now begin the Q&A part of the conference. I would kindly remind you again to focus on earnings. There will be time for strategy, later this morning. Also given time restriction, if everybody could stick to a maximum of two questions, please. So over to Alice. Thank you. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Stefan Stalmann',\n","    'text': 'Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. My two questions are as follows. The first one on your deposits, customer deposits in the group balance sheet. They are down by 5% during the quarter. And I guess on an FX-neutral basis, given the strength of dollar it would be even more. Can you give any color please, on what drove this reduction maybe by business lines geography currency whatever makes sense? And the second question, on your capital situation at the AG. The UK authorities approved a roughly CHF 5 billion capital repatriation in early September. Has that actually been executed please? Thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Ulrich Körner',\n","    'text': \"Thank you for both questions and thank you for joining the call. I'll take the second one, first. The answer is, yes. We did repatriate the CHF 5 billion out of our UK entities and that was supportive of our parent capital ratio in the third quarter. Quite frankly, that follows a legal entity simplification strategy that we've been investing in over the years, that's contributed in the region of about CHF 18 billion of efficiencies to date. We will continue investing in that initiative over the next three years, and we'd expect that to free up more parent capital during that period as well. On the deposit front, what you have seen in the third quarter as we show on Slide 9, is really that a combination of market moves and NNA outflows have led to a reduction in AUM in the third quarter. Net new asset outflows were in the region of CHF 13 billion in the third quarter. As you know, the negative social media news around our name at the beginning of October did lead to outflows across our franchise. It's something that we're looking to address today, through the strategic announcements that we're making, including the CHF 4 billion capital raise and ensuring that we're well capitalized through this transformation period, while we make the transformational announcements and restructuring across our investment bank and other business areas. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Stefan Stalmann', 'text': 'Thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'The next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much and good morning. I am going to have to follow up on the question about the outflows? Because of course, I think from one perspective I think the market was prepared for them given what you've just kind of discussed in terms of what we have kind of seen in the markets and the media as well. But could you give us a sense of how concentrated those outflows were versus more broad-based. And we've seen the outflows I think, because you've provided us with so much information but there seems to be outflows in APAC and MENA, but for example not in EMEA. Would you be able to kind of give us a sense of kind of what actually happened during the quarter and maybe in the beginning of and maybe in October as well to kind of for us to be able to assess how to look at them going forward.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Ulrich Körner',\n","    'text': \"Sure. Thanks, Magdalena. So if you look at the Wealth Management situation you've seen the outflows of CHF 6.4 billion for the quarter. And you rightly put it which you then see reflected in the transaction-based income line as well. Our Wealth Management business is very strong as you know in APAC in emerging markets that has impacted that clearly as you said. If you look at the CHF 6.4 billion it's a combination in the third quarter of deleveraging and derisking if you want to so about CHF 3 billion comes from deleveraging another like CHF 2 billion is a proactive call it derisking and then some additional deposit outflows. I think that's the right way to think about everyone. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa', 'text': 'Thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'The next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.

First question is on advisers and concern around adviser morale clearly but if I look at the numbers they are down quarter-on-quarter in adviser numbers. And I just wanted to see -- is that driven by business exits, or what are you doing to retain advisers, i.e. do you have to write fixed contracts at this point? And how should we think about the trend into the fourth quarter in terms of advisers and in that context this clients do you need to increase deposit rates in order to retain i.e. should we think about NII changes in the Wealth Management business in terms of impact from deposit remuneration that you might have to give. And then the second question is just on funding. Clearly your funding costs have changed quite materially lately. And I just wonder how we should think about financing for this year and going forward if there's any delay in financing from your perspective? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Ulrich Korner',\n","    'text': \"Okay. Thank you very much. Let me start – excuse me, with the number of relationship managers you're referring to on Page 12 actually there is nothing I would say from my point of view unusual behind as you know we said last year that we would build on that number and enlarge that number over time. Also that is in principle unchanged because we want to grow our business, and therefore also over time enlarge that number. Having said that if you look at this market environment and what it has done not only to us but to all in terms of market performance et cetera it's clear that we slowed that down in line with the overall development of the results. And this is more driven here than by call it natural fluctuations and not being too fast to replace them if not necessary or build them put out I think that's what's behind no more. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi ',\n","    'text': \"Kinner, I'll take the second two questions. On funding and deposits I guess somewhat interlinked. Funding costs this year we think are up about CHF 160 million year-on-year. That's on a full year basis versus last year. You've seen the uptick in spreads across the entire industry including on our name. And the idiosyncratic effects in October have resulted in wider spreads on our name as well. Look today's announcements that we'll speak about during the Strategy Day, the actions we're taking on the investment bank, the lower leverage and RWA footprint that we will run with, the reduction of our risk profile and exposure through the Securitized Products exit, all of those items I think will be conducive to a tightening of spreads over time, and we think that would allow us to reduce our funding costs as we get through the transformation. In terms of deposit rates, we would be looking to regain our market share and would be competitive as you'd expect us to be. It's not lost on us that look you did see in the US as a result of really liquidity in the system contracting especially from central banks that you did see large reductions in deposits in the United States as well. And I suspect that's something that we might see globally as well. So in that environment we'll remain competitive.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': 'And may I just follow-up very briefly on the debt schedule.

Happy to. And you'll see in the fixed income deck that was published as well. We outlined our revised plans for this year. We'd expect to do in the region of around CHF2 billion of further AT1 through the course of the fourth quarter and in the region of CHF4 billion or CHF5 billion of HoldCo debt as well. Look the strategy announcements that we have -- that we'll talk about later result in a freeing up of liquidity. And of course with the lower leverage exposure, we would find efficiencies in our funding through the next two or three years and that should result in not just improved funding costs, but quite frankly just lower funding requirements in the capital market as well.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein', 'text': 'Very helpful.

Sorry to come back to the topic of liquidity, but you did mention in the report that you breached certain legal entity LCR requirements during the quarter. I wonder if you could just elaborate on that and whether you can also give us the balance, the HQLA balance at the end of the quarter? And possibly if you have the number for October as well that would be even better. I think that number at the end of Q2 is CHF 230 billion roundabout. So if you could update on that? Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Sure. Happy to. Increasingly, we don't think about our liquidity in HQLA terms because it's not the best indicator of our liquidity position as it doesn't provide the full picture. As you know, we're derisking our balance sheet and so NCOs are reducing. And as such, actually we focus on the liquidity coverage ratio. The LCR at the end of the third quarter was around 192%. And so it was pretty strong and probably at the highest end by peer standards. That of course has gone down as we've indicated in our disclosures through the month of October. And that's partly related to the previous question that I got around funding from Kian, which is we will then commence funding subsequent to the announcements today. We had self-selected to be out of the capital markets during the month of October given the strategic announcements that were coming today and we'd be once again commencing funding activities. The second is just what you'll hear about later and you'll see -- and I won't go through all the detail right now is that the leverage exposure reductions and balance sheet reductions that we have as part of our strategic announcements actually reduce our funding needs greatly over the next few years.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'The next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher with UBS.

This is the conference operator. Welcome, and thank you for joining Credit Suisse Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results Conference Call for Analysts and Investors. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and the conference is recorded. You will have the opportunity to ask questions after the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Kinner Lakhani, Head of Investor Relations and Group Strategy and Development. Please go ahead, Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, Alice. Good morning. Welcome, everyone. Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures. For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings release that was published this morning. Let me remind you that our 2022 annual report and audited financial statements for the year will be published on or around March 9, 2023. So, I will now hand over to our Group CEO, Ulrich Koerner; followed by our Group CFO, Dixit Joshi, who will run through the numbers.\\nUlrich Koerner: Thank you, Kinner. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for joining today. We greatly appreciate your participation and engagement. Let me begin with some opening remarks. 2022 was an extremely challenging year for Credit Suisse with the group posting a net loss of CHF7.3 billion. Nonetheless, it was also a year which marked the beginning of the important and necessary transformation for our organization. On October 27th, we presented a targeted plan to create the new Credit Suisse, a simpler, more focused bank built around client needs. And, today, we reaffirm all of the targets we announced in October. We are building the new Credit Suisse around our Wealth Management and Swiss Bank franchises complemented by our leading and differentiated capabilities and Asset Management and Markets. We continue to execute our transformation at an accelerated pace and in a determined manner. I will share some details of our progress over the course of the presentation. In line with the update provided on November 23rd, we reported a pre-tax loss of CHF1.3 billion and an adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF1 billion for the fourth quarter. We have a robust balance sheet, and we are executing on our transformation from a position of strengths. We reported a year-end CET1 ratio of 14.1% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.7%. Our liquidity position also improved following the impact of the events of October. The average liquidity coverage ratio was at 144% at the end of the fourth quarter, with further improvements this year. At these levels, our capital and liquidity ratios compare favorably to our peers. The Board will propose a cash dividend of CHF0.05 per share for the financial year 2022, subject to AGM approval. This is consistent with our intention to pay a nominal dividend throughout the transformation period. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy and have made progress in restructuring our Investment Bank, the creation of CS First Boston, and the acceleration of our cost transformation program. We are confident that our fundamental reshaping of the bank will create value for all our stakeholders. Over the next three years, we will continue to execute at pace, building on our respective global franchise and delivering exceptional service to our clients. Let me turn to the fourth quarter results. The group reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF1 billion for the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting an adjusted pre-tax loss of $1.3 billion in the Investment Bank. Challenging market conditions and lower client activity had a significant impact on our Capital Markets and Advisory businesses, while the strategic actions to de-risk and exit certain business lines resulted in lower sales and trading revenues. Now, turning to Wealth Management. The division reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF155 million. During the quarter, we put in place an extensive client outreach program and are already seeing the benefits of our initiatives. We are also taking proactive steps to reduce the cost base as part of the group-wide cost transformation program. The Swiss Bank division reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of CHF259 million for the quarter. This demonstrates our resilience and leadership position in our home market. Overall, the group reported a pre-tax loss of CHF1.3 billion. This result includes several adjusting items, the largest of which were restructuring expenses related to our cost transformation program as well as real estate gains. Our new executive board remains fully focused on the successful execution of our strategic transformation and the actions we have taken so far strengthen our business momentum in 2023 and beyond. Now, let me be clear, our teams continue to work relentlessly on serving our clients. Since October, we have proactively engaged with more than 10,000 Wealth Management clients and over 50,000 clients in the Swiss Bank. As previously mentioned, we are seeing the first positive signs from our comprehensive global initiatives to regain deposits as well as assets under management. In January, we saw deposit inflows at group level in Wealth Management and in APAC, as well as net new asset in APAC and in Swiss Bank. Importantly, clients remain overwhelmingly supportive and we remain very thankful for that. To remind you of the strengths of our Wealth Management business, we are the number two wealth manager outside the U.S. with a deep client franchise balanced between ultra and high net worth clients. We have a very clear plan to restore the Wealth Management division to profitability. We are focused on growing a more stable high net worth business. We increased our focus on recurring revenues and regaining client wallet share among ultra-high net worth clients. And we are undertaking steps to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Let me now update you on what we have achieved since October 27th. We have made significant progress in the transformation and restructuring of the Investment Bank. Since the end of the third quarter, we have achieved about two-thirds of our Securitized Products Group asset reduction target. In the fourth quarter, we've reduced risk-weighted assets and leveraged exposure by about $5 billion and around $15 billion, respectively, reflecting proactive deleveraging and derisking measures in the non-core unit, that's ahead of the target run rate we set in October. As announced, our goal is to carve out CS First Boston as a distinct leading independent Capital Markets and Advisory net business, and we are pleased with the acquisition of the Investment Banking business of M. Klein & Company. This is a significant step forward in realizing CS First Boston's growth potential and creating value for our shareholders. Since our strategy announcement in October, we have strengthened our capital position by raising around CHF4 billion of equity and we have completed around CHF10 billion of debt issuances, while it's making tangible progress in deleveraging and derisking the group further. This should reduce our funding needs in the future. Our cost transformation is well underway. As previously disclosed, action initiated in the fourth quarter represent approximately 80% of our 2023 cost base reduction target of about CHF1.2 billion. I want to make it absolutely clear that me and my management team are relentless in driving our cost base lower. We have made significant progress on our exit from the Securitized Products. We completed the first closing of our transaction with Apollo. That, along with other actions taken, contributed to an overall reduction in Securitized Products' assets by around $35 billion, since the end of the third quarter. This is approximately two-thirds of our targeted reduction of $55 billion. So, we are on track to close the full transaction in the first half of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals. This transaction, together with the potential sale of other portfolio assets, is expected to reduce risk-weighted assets, leverage exposure and other risk metrics over time. These actions are consistent with our strategy to significantly reduce the size of the Investment Bank and release liquidity and capital to support the bank's core businesses. Turning to the non-core unit. As you can see on the slide, we are running ahead of schedule on both risk-weighted assets reductions and leverage exposure. Dixit will cover the important progress we have made in more detail. CS First Boston is an attractive value proposition for Credit Suisse shareholders and its carve out is an important step in our strategic transformation. We are creating a global independent capital markets and advisory led bank with distinctive capabilities and a unique market position. It will be headquartered in the US with leadership positions in Europe, Asia and selected emerging markets. We are confident that our history of innovation, market leadership and the years of experience of our core teams, together with a simpler operating and regulatory model, will provide a clear competitive advantage. Our execution plan is already underway. We have announced the acquisition of M. Klein & Company, which will further strengthen CS First Boston's advisory capabilities and we are right-sizing the business to reduce capital needs and release low-returning capital. In short, CS First Boston will be efficient, agile and have a comprehensive product offering designed around client needs. Importantly, the new Credit Suisse will maintain a long-term strategic partnership with CS First Boston, leveraging our leading market platform, whilst ensuring the close connectivity to our Wealth Management and Swiss Bank businesses. And we have a strong management team under the leadership of Michael Klein. Michael has an established track record in building leading capital markets and advisory led businesses as well as four decades of investment banking experience. The acquisition of M. Klein & Company adds to Credit Suisse's advisory capabilities and accelerates the creation of an advisory-led CS First Boston. At the same time, it creates significant revenue opportunities for Credit Suisse. The transaction is that a single digit price-to-earnings multiple and is expected to be earnings accretive with an anticipated impact on the CET1 ratio of less than 10 basis points. In October, we made a very clear commitment to simplify the group and to reduce our cost base. We intend to cut the total headcount from around 52,000 in 2022 to 43,000 over the next three years. We have already achieved a 4% reduction in the fourth quarter 2022 and we intend to continue to reduce third-party costs, including spending on contractors and consultants in a targeted and decisive manner. We are determined to deliver on our cost reduction target of CHF1.2 billion in 2023 and CHF2.5 billion by 2025. These targets on a like-for-like basis and exclude the impact of business exits. We are making progress on our cost transformation, and we will be relentless in identifying opportunities to move further and faster. Rest assured, our cost initiatives will not impact the investments in risk management and technology, including digitalization as well as our targeted business growth. To sum up, we are well advanced on our journey to deliver a new simpler, more focused Credit Suisse built around client needs. We have a new executive board with relevant experience and a strong track record of execution in similar situations. We are building a unified culture from the top of the organization with a strong focus on risk management, collaboration and accountability. We remain disciplined on strategic execution, strengthening and reallocating capital, delivery on our cost ambitions, and, most importantly, supporting our clients globally. As I mentioned, we have acted decisively to address the impact of the outflows experienced in the fourth quarter and we have seen deposits inflows at the group level in Wealth Management and APAC, as well as net new assets in APAC and the Swiss Bank. We are also making progress with the carve out of CS First Boston and are creating a more focused markets business that will deliver innovative solutions and products for our Wealth Management and our institutional clients. In short, we are determined to make this transformation a success, restore trust with all stakeholders, and ultimately create sustainable value for our shareholders. With that, I hand it over to Dixit.\\nDixit Joshi: Thank you, Ulrich, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start today with the financial overview for the fourth quarter and the full year, and then provide some details on assets under management given the outflows that we saw in the quarter. After that, I'll go through the divisional performances before setting out some of the key themes for the group. Before I begin, I'd point out that this is the last time we will be discussing our results under our current financial reporting structure. As of the first quarter of 2023, we will be publishing our earnings under the new structure that we outlined in October comprising the four key business divisions and the Corporate Center, plus the Capital Release Unit. We will provide a restated time series at the beginning of April, along with other relevant information and, of course, we plan to provide regular updates detailing our progress as we execute on our strategy. Please note that unless I state otherwise, for example with the Investment Bank, you can assume that whenever I give a currency figure it's in Swiss francs. So, let's start with the group overview. The group took clear strides forward, despite the challenging fourth quarter. We delivered the strategy update alongside our third quarter earnings and started immediately on implementation. We made good progress reducing non-core related exposures, on cost reduction measures and on balance sheet reductions relating to the Capital Release Unit. We proactively managed our liquidity position following the outflows in the fourth quarter. We executed a successful series of capital and funding measures, including raising around CHF4 billion in equity and completing around CHF6 billion of debt issuance in the fourth quarter. We strengthened our CET1 ratio to 14.1%, and we remained resolutely focused on execution and on supporting our clients. As you can see from this morning's announcements regarding the acquisition of the Investment Banking business of M. Klein & Company and the completion of the first closing of our Securitized Products transaction with Apollo, we are executing rapidly on the strategy and we're ahead of plan. In terms of our financial performance, the net asset and deposit outflows in the fourth quarter reduced our net interest income and recurring revenues, notably in Wealth Management. The Investment Bank experienced another tough quarter with lower client activity, the impact of our strategic actions, as well as the events of the fourth quarter, all contributing to the reduced revenues in sales and trading. Revenues in our Capital Markets and Advisory businesses were also lower and more in line with the industry-wide slowdown. Overall, fourth quarter reported net revenues for the group were 33% lower year-on-year at CHF3.1 billion and reported operating expenses were 31% lower at CHF4.3 billion. Provisions for credit losses amounted to 6 basis points of net loans at the year-end, mainly relating to specific provisions taken in the Swiss Bank and the Investment Bank. This resulted in a reported pre-tax loss for the quarter for the group of CHF1.3 billion, in line with the guidance that we gave at the end of November of a loss of up to CHF1.5 billion. Our reported results include a number of adjusting items with a cumulative net impact on our fourth quarter results of CHF300 million. A detailed breakdown can be found in the earnings release. However, notable adjusting revenue items included CHF191 million of real estate gains and a CHF75 million loss relating to the disposal of our remaining stake in Allfunds. In total, adjusted net revenues for the fourth quarter were 32% lower year-on-year at CHF3 billion. Reported operating expenses for the quarter included CHF352 million of restructuring expenses, broadly in line with our guidance of CHF300 million and CHF34 million of major litigation provisions. We continue to make good progress in resolving our outstanding legacy issues. Adjusting for these items, operating expenses were 3% lower year-on-year at CHF3.9 billion, resulting in an adjusted pre-tax loss for the quarter of CHF1 billion. The income tax expense for the fourth quarter was CHF82 million, resulting in a net loss attributable to shareholders of CHF1.4 billion. The reason we have a tax charge for the quarter, despite the overall reported pre-tax loss, is driven by the fact that we earn taxable income in legal entities, which cannot be offset by tax losses elsewhere in the group. We expect this to continue to be the case in 2023 as we execute on our transformation program. I'd like briefly to mention the Corporate Center, which booked an adjusted pre-tax income of CHF104 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of CHF172 million in the same period last year. This was largely driven by treasury results. Turning back to the group, for the full year, reported revenues were 34% lower compared to 2021 at CHF14.9 billion, reported operating expenses were 5% lower at CHF18.2 billion, leading to a reported pre-tax loss for the year of CHF3.3 billion. The third quarter deferred tax impairment of CHF3.7 billion resulted in a reported net loss of CHF7.3 billion for 2022. Let me make a brief comment on compensation, which for the full year was down 2%. The fourth quarter total for the group decreased by 4% year-on-year, however it was 8% higher compared to the third quarter. This was a function of structural changes we've made to compensation over the course of the last year. As a result, some of the division show increases in the compensation line for the fourth quarter. Compensation is one of our key levers for controlling costs and I'd note that the total variable compensation pool for 2022 was 50% lower than in 2021, as we took actions commensurate with the decline in the group performance. Now, before we turn to the performance of our business divisions, which I will discuss as usual on an adjusted basis, I'll touch on the impact of the client asset outflows during the fourth quarter on Slide 15. Our assets under management were impacted by significant net asset outflows early in the quarter, which affected both our revenues and our liquidity position for the fourth quarter. Approximately, two-thirds of the net asset outflows in the fourth quarter occurred in October and they've reduced considerably in November and December. Group assets under management were around 8% lower quarter-on-quarter at CHF1.3 trillion, largely reflecting net asset outflows of CHF111 billion. Deposit outflows made up around 60% of Wealth Management and Swiss Bank net asset outflows in the quarter. In total, net asset outflows represented 8% of assets under management at the end of September. Since the start of the fourth quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet, including through the capital raises to set the group on a stronger trajectory. We're now three months into our transformation journey and we saw the first signs of the benefits of these and other proactive initiatives in January with positive deposit inflows at the group level and specifically in Wealth Management. Net asset flows in the Swiss Bank were positive and the net asset outflows in Wealth Management in January where at a reduced level compared to December with net asset inflows in Asia Pacific. Moving on to the divisional overviews, we'll start with Wealth Management. Lower assets under management and deposits as well as subdued client activity resulted in lower revenues. This led to a loss in Wealth Management as we had indicated in our outlook statement in November. Net interest income declined 17% year-on-year with lower loan income and higher funding costs offsetting the benefit of rising interest rates on deposit income, albeit on lower deposit volumes. Similarly, lower average assets under management resulted in a 17% year-on-year fall in recurring commissions and fees. Transaction based revenues were 20% lower, reflecting reduced levels of client activity and mark-to-market losses of CHF31 million on financing exposures. Total net revenues were down 18% year-on-year. Operating expenses were 5% higher, mainly due to higher general and administrative expenses, reflecting higher allocated corporate function costs. I would note that a number of the measures that we took in the fourth quarter should reduce costs for the division in 2023. Overall, the division delivered an adjusted pre-tax loss for the quarter of CHF155 million. While we expect the division to report a loss for the first quarter, we are determined to return Wealth Management to profitability and Ulrich has highlighted some of the specific actions that we're taking to achieve this. Let's turn to the Swiss Bank on Slide 17. Swiss Bank had a resilient fourth quarter. Net revenues were 10% lower year-on-year, but quarter-on-quarter revenues held up well, 3% lower. Net asset outflows were CHF8.3 billion, primarily from private clients. The reduction in the threshold benefit from the Swiss National Bank, given rising interest rates in Switzerland, negatively impacted net interest income, so this was partially offset by higher deposit income. NII was 11% lower year-on-year and flat compared to the third quarter. As a reminder, the loss of the SNB threshold benefits is now in the quarterly run rate and we expect the year-on-year impact, which was CHF78 million in the fourth quarter, to bottom out by the middle of this year. Recurring commissions and fees were 10% lower year-on-year, mainly due to lower average assets under management. These were flat compared to the end of the third quarter and 12% lower year-on-year, primarily the result of declining markets. Transaction-based revenues were 18% lower year-on-year, mainly driven by the impact of equity investments. Excluding these, lower client activity accounted for an 8% reduction. A 6% year-on-year increase in operating expenses mainly reflected the structural changes to compensation that I referred to earlier. Provisions for credit losses were CHF28 million compared to a release of CHF4 million in the fourth quarter last year, equivalent to 7 basis points of net loans. Overall, the division reported a pre-tax income of CHF259 million, 41% lower year-on-year. Turning to Asset Management. Market conditions in the fourth quarter were challenging for the Asset Management division. Net revenues were down 28% year-on-year, driven primarily by lower performance, transaction and placement fees, as well as reduced management fees. Management fees were 19% lower, reflecting a decline in assets under management of CHF74 billion, CHF50 billion of which was due to FX and market effects. Net asset outflows in the quarter were CHF11.7 billion, across both traditional and alternative investments as well as outflows from investments and partnerships. Operating expenses were 3% lower year-on-year, primarily due to lower costs relating to the supply chain finance funds matter and reduced commission expenses, partly offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses. In total, the division booked an adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF15 million for the quarter. Let's now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 19. Clearly, this was not a normal quarter for the group and in particular for the Investment Bank, where revenues were down 74% year-on-year. Revenues were directly impacted by: first, our restructuring actions, including the steps taken to de-risk and exit certain business lines; second, actions we took in response to the group's deposit outflows in the fourth quarter; and third, reduced client activity as capital market conditions remained challenging. Operating expenses were 15% lower year-on-year, mainly reflecting lower compensation and benefits, resulting in an adjusted pre-tax loss for the quarter of $1.3 billion. Our sales and trading businesses were impacted both by our restructuring and lower client activity, resulting in an 89% year-on-year decline in revenues. We estimate that the impact of the accelerated deleveraging, including that linked to our strategic actions, accounted for around 40% of the year-on-year decline. Our continued strength in macro was offset by a substantial decline in Securitized Products and Global Credit Products, largely due to our strategic actions and, consequently, fixed income revenues were 84% lower year-on-year. Equity sales and trading revenues were affected by the impact of our strategic actions, reduced client activity and less favorable market conditions on the equity derivatives business. The exit of Prime Services also had a year-on-year effect on cash equities. Overall, equities revenues were 96% lower year-on-year. For those business lines less directly impacted by our restructuring, the performance was more resilient with Capital Markets and Advisory revenues 59% lower year-on-year, in line with the reduced industry fee pools. The reported pre-tax loss of $1.5 billion included restructuring expenses of $214 million for the fourth quarter, part of which was related to the headcount reduction program. We also booked major litigation expenses of $43 million. Looking forward, our strategic actions and the ongoing challenging market backdrop mean we would also expect the Investment Bank to report a loss in the first quarter of 2023. However, we have taken decisive action on the structure of the division and these measures are important steps in the creation of the new Credit Suisse. I'll now take you through our progress on some of our key financial metrics starting with capital on Slide 20. We ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.1%, up around 150 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Our successful capital increases added 147 basis points, underpinning our capital strength as we continue to execute on our strategic transformation. Business RWA reductions benefited the CET1 ratio by 80 basis points, partially offset by 53 basis points attributable to the net loss for the quarter and by 24 basis points due to other CET1 movements, including FX and model and parameter updates. Overall, RWAs declined by CHF23 billion quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the reductions in the Investment Bank of around CHF5 billion and around CHF9 billion in Wealth Management and Swiss Bank, with a further CHF10 billion due to FX. Our parent capital ratio was around 250 basis points higher compared to the end of September at 12.2%. I should also note that as we reduce RMBS exposures and activity as part of our announced strategy towards a managed exit from the Securitized Products business and to de-risk the bank, we anticipate, based on ongoing regulatory discussions, that operational risk RWAs associated with historical RMBS activity will decrease. Turning to leverage. For the fourth quarter, we reported a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.7% compared to 6% in the prior quarter. Clearly, this ratio was higher than the level we'd normally expect to maintain, primarily because of the reduced size of the balance sheet which resulted from the events early in the fourth quarter. Reductions in high-quality liquid assets, mainly from the deposit outflows, and business deleveraging contributed 102 basis points and 59 basis points, respectively, with the capital raises contributing 47 basis points. This was partly offset by 17 basis point impact resulting from the reported net loss for the fourth quarter. Leverage exposure was CHF186 billion lower quarter-on-quarter at CHF651 billion, primarily driven by CHF118 billion drop in HQLA as well as deleveraging, notably in the Investment Bank. Let's now look at these deleveraging and derisking measures in more detail on Slide 22. As part of our strategic transformation announced in October, on the 1st of January, we established the Capital Release Unit, which includes the non-core for non-strategic assets. The CRU will be a separate reporting division and we will provide a more detailed breakdown when we publish our restated financials in early April. We've made a strong start in the fourth quarter in advance of the formal establishment of the CRU. Proactive deleveraging, derisking, and market moves reduced RWAs by around $5 billion and leverage exposure by around $15 billion, excluding the impact from reductions in HQLA allocations. We're running ahead of schedule, and I'd add that de-risking also generated an estimated $10 billion of liquidity in the fourth quarter. We intend to continue to execute on the run down of assets to release capital and liquidity, as well as targeting cost reductions. As you can see, we're well on track to reach our RWA and leverage exposure targets of around $25 billion and around $92 billion, respectively, by the end of this year. Moving on to our liquidity coverage ratio. Although, the group's liquidity position was impacted by deposit outflows in the fourth quarter, our average liquidity coverage ratio at the end of December stood at 144%, well above the group's minimum regulatory requirements and comparing favorably with our peer group. This represents an improvement from the lower levels in the quarter. It was a result of a series of proactive measures, including the capital raises, debt issuances and deleveraging. We have continued to see the improvement in the ratio, since the start of the year and we remain focused on maintaining our LCR at a prudent level. The disciplined execution of our strategy, including our simplification program, should lead to further liquidity improvements and more efficient liquidity management across the group. Moving now to funding on Slide 24. A major consequence of our strategic transformation is that the group's future funding needs and related costs should reduce considerably over time due to the simplification of our business model. This should result in a more efficient group balance sheet. You can see that in 2023, as a result of the balance sheet deleveraging driven by our strategic actions, redemptions should exceed our estimated debt issuance plan for the year. This reverses the situation of recent years, and I would expect this trend to continue over the next three years. Our issuance plan for the current financial year is around CHF17 billion, less than the expected redemptions of CHF22 billion. Reduced HoldCo funding needs means we expect issuance of around CHF2 billion and AT1 issuance of around CHF4 billion. In January, we completed nearly half of our planned CHF9 billion OpCo issuance for the year and around a quarter of the overall full year funding plan. Let's move on to net interest income sensitivity and guidance for funding costs. I would expect the cumulative revenue benefit based on current forward curves to be around CHF900 million for the next three years versus year-end 2022 with the largest benefit coming from higher US dollar rates. To be clear, our forward net interest income assumptions are based on the static balance sheet at the end of the year. The benefit going forward will be a function of actual loan and deposit balances. Now, turning to funding costs. The widening of our credit spreads over the course of 2022 has resulted in an increase in the cost of our funding and I would expect this to continue to be the case, partially offsetting the benefit of higher interest rates over the next three years. For 2023, I expect that increase to be in the region of CHF500 million compared to 2022. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect our funding needs and costs to reduce as we progress our transformation. Turning now to costs. Adjusted operating expenses for the year was CHF16.2 billion, broadly flat compared to 2021 and below our previous guidance of around CHF16.5 billion to CHF17 billion, reflecting our disciplined approach to costs, including compensation, which I touched on earlier. Looking forward, our ambition to reduce the cost base to no more than CHF15.8 billion in 2023 and to around CHF14.5 billion by 2025 on a constant perimeter basis remains unchanged. What I mean by this is that as we complete the Securitized Products transaction and execute on other disposals, we'll adjust our cost and headcount targets downwards accordingly. We are on track to deliver on our cost ambitions and, as we've previously disclosed, the actions that we have already initiated in the fourth quarter are expected to represent 80% of the savings required to achieve our 2023 cost target. We will, of course, be looking for additional opportunities to eliminate duplication and drive operating efficiencies across the group. In terms of restructuring costs, for the fourth quarter, we booked CHF352 million, and I would reiterate our previous guidance for restructuring costs of CHF1.6 billion and CHF1 billion for 2023 and 2024, respectively. Touching briefly on headcount, our overall target is to reduce this by 9,000 to around 43,000 by the end of 2025 on a constant perimeter basis. And actions that we've taken in the last three months have enabled us to achieve around a 4% headcount reduction since the end of September. To summarize, our financial performance for the fourth quarter reflects the decisive actions we have taken against a difficult market backdrop. Looking forward, we expect that the strategic actions taken to reduce the group's risk profile and the challenging market conditions will continue to be reflected in our financial results. I would expect the group to report a loss before taxes in 2023 given the adverse revenue impact of the exit from non-core businesses and exposures and, of course, the restructuring charges related to our transformation. We are now well into the execution phase of our strategic transformation and have clear priorities for the weeks and months ahead as we work towards achieving the financial targets that we set out on October 27th. Let me remind you what they are. On group-wide costs, we expect to reduce our cost base on a constant perimeter basis to no more than CHF15.8 billion in 2023 and to around CHF14.5 billion by the end of 2025. With regard to the group CET1 ratio, we expect this to be at least 13% throughout the transformation period and above 13.5% at the end of 2025 pre-Basel III reforms. And by 2025, we are targeting a core return on tangible equity that is excluding the Capital Release Unit of greater than 8% and around 6% for the group, as a whole. Thank you very much. And, with that, I'll hand back to Kinner.\\nKinner Lakhani: Thank you, Dixit. We will now begin the Q&A part of the conference. May I ask everybody to stick to two questions, please. Alice, let's open the line, please.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs with Citi. Please go ahead.\\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. I guess my first question, I'd just like to come back to your commentary around being proactive on flows and winning back some of the client money. Thank you for the comments on January about Asia Pacific and Swiss Bank. I guess my question would be more broadly, as part of your proactive approach, could you provide any kind of color on what you're doing in terms of pricing? Are you putting through cuts to fees? Are you offering higher rates on the deposits? How are you going about winning back that business? So that would be my first question. My second question is on what's left of your fixed income and equities business post the SPG divestment? What is the plan for that business overall? How much is expected to be moved in with CSFB versus how much of that Markets business is to be retained by the broader CS Group? And I'd just like an idea of any thoughts on what the revenue contribution of that Markets franchise could be. You've obviously given the CHF2.5 billion number for CSFB, but presumably, that's mainly around origination and advisory retail. Any thoughts on the Markets franchise going forward? Thank you.\\nUlrich Koerner: Thank you, Andrew. Let me start with the first question. So, as we were alluding to, and I'd like to reiterate that because it's really, I think, important for where we are now, where we are going throughout the year, so this client outreach program, which I was talking about, is really unprecedented. That is at least what the colleagues here in the firm tell me being here longer than 30 years. So -- and I think it has shown and has developed very good momentum and, hence, the figures I gave for January. You asked concretely about pricing. So, we try to be competitive, call it, like many of our competitors as well, so to be in the game, but we are not buying assets, just to be clear, because that would not be very smart going forward as well. So, what is also the fact, and I think that is something which all my colleagues in the bank and myself felt and the many, many clients interactions which we had nearly on a daily basis, I would say is that the client support which we get from them is really overwhelming. And I mean this something which is absolutely, for me and my colleagues, is absolutely fantastic. So, the clients, in other words, the clients want us to be successful, and that is something which we can feel and, therefore, we are so focused on delivery.\\nDixit Joshi: Andrew, I'll take the second, and thank you for joining the call. The SPG transaction, as you know from our previous announcements, part of our strategy to reshape and rightsize the Investment Bank. That portfolio had in the region of around CHF75 billion approximately of assets at the end of September. We've derisked two-thirds of that portfolio overall through a combination of transactions with Apollo and the first close yesterday and other third parties in the market. And so, we're making rapid progress in reshaping the Investment Bank starting with the SPG portfolio. And we'll continue to enforce capital efficiency and balance sheet efficiency in the Investment Bank. The other leg of that stool is, of course, the Capital Release Unit, which, as I mentioned in my remarks, came into being on the 1st of January. We've moved with pace in advance of that in the fourth quarter to derisk as well. Regarding your question on First Boston -- CS First Boston, CS First Boston, we are reshaping that business as we speak to be capital-light, balance sheet efficient, as well as rightsizing headcount, as Ulrich had mentioned as well. And so, to the extent that we have synergistic businesses, they, of course, will fit well in Credit Suisse First Boston, but I would use those criteria at the outset, which is looking at cost efficiency and balance sheet efficiency as two main criteria for which businesses would fall into SPG -- into Credit Suisse First Boston. The second point I'd make is that with our macro and our markets businesses, we have rightsized those businesses. We've refocused them and, of course, aligned them towards our Wealth Management and our Swiss Bank franchise, which is a key pillar of our strategy at the outset. We will, of course, reflect our restated financials once we set up the CRU, so you'll have a better idea at that stage of the relative splits and what our new segmentation looks like. That should be in April. I hope that's helpful.\\nAndrew Coombs: Yes, I look forward to seeing the new splits. Thank you, both.\\nDixit Joshi: Thank you.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Thank you very much, and good morning. I'm going to go back to the Wealth Management and to the flow situation. And I have to say, you're commenting on a clear plan to restore Wealth through profitability. So, could we just hear what's in your business plan flow-wise for 2023? But like broader, from a customer business perspective, when we look at kind of flows, deposits, custody assets, loans, how do you see those developing, let's just say, over the next 12 months on top of what you told us on APAC and kind of year-to-date numbers? So that's question number one. And question number two really is about the mix of your cost savings in 2023 as well. You've given us kind of very -- you've given us points on a slide, I think, 11 -- let me just go back there, on Slide 11 from the perspective what your priorities are. But could you give us a sense which of those points that you have detailed there actually have the biggest impact on that cost base reduction so that at least we get a sense kind of where to look at? Because, for example, on the professional services side, you've already did a lot. On the contractor side kind of workforce mix, you've already done a lot in the fourth quarter. Thanks very much.\\nUlrich Koerner: Magdalena, thanks for the question. So, I would say, with respect to your Wealth Management question, what is important, that's why we gave these indications from January, the group overall, as I said, is positive on deposits; Wealth Management, globally, positive on deposits; Asia Pac, positive on deposits. And I'm reiterating that because, as you are fully aware of, the deposits are these kind of assets, so to say, which leave first and have the fungibility to reenter first. So -- and I think that is important to bear in mind. As you immediately understand, Magdalena, we do not give you business plan figures. But you can assume that in the Wealth Management plan is a fair chunk of rewinning lost volumes, lost business with our clients. And important to note here is as well that we hardly lost any client. I think that is also important. That shows you something about what I said before in terms of the relationship which we may have with our clients. Seems to be, for me, very important. In terms of the cost and, Dixit, you might add, a couple of points from my side. With respect to the CHF1.2 billion target, which we stick to, as you are aware of, for 2023, 80% of this cost reduction has been initiated and this in execution already in the fourth quarter. So, I think that is something very positive, which you need to bear in mind. So, you will see the effects coming in, obviously, quarter-by-quarter as we speak in 2023. To better understand, I would say, the overall program, I mean we are doing in forcefully, as I said, everything which we would do in that situation to reduce the cost with the more, call it, classical measures like as we were alluding to getting more efficient, therefore, leading in less headcount, reducing contractors, consultant spend, and there is room to go. This is absolutely no question, we are looking at the usual things which you apply, like how many levels in the organization, how many direct reports, all these kind of things we are working on. Having said that, and I'm saying that because this is what I would think is, call it, the first phase to get into new Credit Suisse. And then, obviously, and we are working in parallel on that one, is that we are asking ourselves and developing our new operating model for new Credit Suisse, and that needs some more work over the next few months. But I think that is important for the second phase of cost reduction, because the new operating model in itself must be designed in a way that is much more agile and much more simpler. That's why we talked about that in connection with new Credit Suisse several times.\\nDixit Joshi: Ulrich, just to add, I mean, on those -- and Magdalena, good questions. I think as we reduce complexity and as we simplify the company as part of the move towards the new Credit Suisse, I think that creates larger efficiencies for us, of course, that we need to crystallize. The second point I'd make is we will keep focusing on optimizing our legal entity structure, which also has upside for our cost base. And the third point I'd make is that I mentioned in my remarks that our cost targets are very much on a constant perimeter basis. And so, for example, as we progress towards the final close of the Securitized Products transaction, we will, of course, once that's closed, also then adjust our targets accordingly. So, I think what you're going to see from us as a management team is that we will leave no stone unturned. We have levers at our disposal to drive cost, and we're, hence, confident, as you can hear from myself and Ulrich's remarks, that we're confident on delivering on the cost target.\\nMagdalena Stoklosa: Thank you very much.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.\\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you very much. Good morning. Can I just kind of clarify further the outflow and the flow situation? And sort of two questions very specifically on that. You said that the 4Q outflows were two-thirds in October. Could you give us an idea of the remaining one-third, how was that split between November and December? Was it sort of even across both of those months? That's my first question. And then, the second question, you said -- again, it's on a similar topic. You said that you'd had further outflows in Wealth Management in January, but at a reduced level. I just wondered how we should interpret what you mean by reduced level. Is that relative to 15% in 4Q or relative to where you were in December? That would be very helpful just to understand what you mean by a reduced level of outflows.\\nUlrich Koerner: Thank you very much for the questions, both very good questions. First one, we said like two-third in October. If you look into October and November together, it's more than 85% of the outflows stemming from these two months, and that was exactly the reason. And you are aware of, before our strategy update end of October, we are not in a situation to communicate. That made it so hard in October. And that's why we started immediately at October 27, literally, our client outreach program, which travels with us -- traveled with us throughout the whole year and travels with us right now and as we speak. So, it has not stopped. So, more than 85% from October and November, which tells you now how the development was also in the last quarter. With respect to your second question, net new assets, in particular, we said we are positive, which is very good, because that's a very proactive region, growth region. We are positive in APAC with a good number for January also in comparison to other years. We are positive in Switzerland, also with a good number overall here. We are positive in a couple of smaller other geographies, but we are also still having some outflows in other regions. And that's why we gave this guidance to say, look, it's not at the moment the case yet that we can say we are all over and in every market and in every region already positive on net new assets. That's how you should read it. But again, as I said, in my eyes, the situation has completely changed from last year.\\nJeremy Sigee: Great. Thank you very much.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alastair Ryan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nAlastair Ryan: Yes. Thank you and good morning. So, Slides 24 and 31, if I could, please. So, Slide 31, you've now this very, very large surplus to your going and gone concern capital requirements. And as you said, Dixit, there's 30 basis points uplift in CET1 from Securitized Products and then there's this operational risk RWA reduction. So, it seems that you'll have really quite striking surpluses and, in particular, in the debt and the subordinated debt stack. So, going back to Slide 24, I can very much see why you might under-issue. Is there a possibility you might under-issue by more if you're able to execute on the deleveraging plan that you've laid out? Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: Alastair, thank you for the question. And I'm glad you've noted that because it is a change from, as you can see on the chart from the previous years, certainly the last two years where we've had a greater issuance requirement than we've had redemptions. As we simplify the balance sheet and as we execute on our strategy, and I hope you're seeing that now in the fourth quarter, certainly, as we've taken the size of the balance sheet down, the intentional pieces where we've delevered the SPG transaction, the early start of the noncore unit, you're starting to now see some of those funding efficiencies come through, and that's now reflected in this issuance plan. We set out, we said, up to CHF17 billion. Of course, the funding plan is dependent on the evolution of the balance sheet through the year, and one has to be somewhat responsive and nimble as you get through the year. But at CHF17 billion of indicated issuance versus a CHF22 billion redemption, we're starting to now really turn the corner and start setting ourselves up on a trajectory to eventually reduce our funding costs through time. A couple of things I'd highlight. In response to what you've just said around Slide 31, it does lead to the reduced HoldCo issuance, which is, at CHF2 billion, much less than our expectations would have been, let's say, at some point during last year for this year. And again, that's a reflection of the strategic actions that we're taking. On OpCo, we'll be opportunistic, as you'd expect, through the course of this year, but we've already issued CHF4 billion of an indicated CHF9 billion. And then, of the overall issuance plan, we've come out of the gates quite fast with an issuance of around 25% of the entire full year plan in January. So, we'll be responsive, but what you're going to see is a much more efficient balance sheet over time as a result of the strategic intended actions that we're taking. I hope that's helpful.\\nAlastair Ryan: Yes. Thank you. Can I just -- as a sort of supplemental, so I appreciate you'd expect to grow the balance sheet somewhat as you get deposits and inflows back. But those very large buffers that you've ended up with perhaps through shrinking faster than you'd expected, is it fair to assume that if you can execute, you wouldn't need buffers that big so that the sort of capital requirement goes down, but also some of those buffers that you've ended up with, in particular, that sort of 900 basis point buffer in HoldCo debt might be able to come down?\\nDixit Joshi: An important observation. I mean what I'd say is if you look at the comments that I made on operational risk, as a result of setting out the strategy and then beginning to execute on it and then demonstrating that we're able to derisk, especially in the mortgage-related portfolios, as you can see, I'm giving fairly clear guidance there that in dialogue with our regulators, we would expect a lower OR requirement. Now, when it comes to really AT1 and HoldCo, of course, this is in the list of our regulators. That said, we will continue transforming the balance sheet in a manner that I think would be conducive towards lower issuance needs. But of course, that's in the hands of our regulators as well. It will be an active dialogue that we will continue having. But I think what's in our hands right now is to continue to drive the balance sheet efficiency that puts us in a position to be able to have that dialogue.\\nAlastair Ryan: Thank you.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\\nKian Abouhossein: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on Wealth Management again, but maybe slightly differently, could you talk about the RM decline of 5% quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year by region and also how you see RM development through 2023? And in that context, could you talk about the cost as well, which clearly has continuously increased in WM? And how you see cost development on an absolute level within the Wealth Management business? And then, the second question is on SPG is, can you give us a little bit of an idea of our modeling, how we should think about the revenues and the costs that are coming out of the disposal of SPG?\\nUlrich Koerner: Okay. Let me start with the first question. You mentioned the RM decline. We had certainly -- if you look into last year's somewhat heightened attrition, that's right, as you say. Nevertheless, part of that is also to be seen in the light of increasing productivity, goes without saying. So, looking ahead, I would say, very much depending on how we develop step by step to coming back into Wealth Management profitability and, most importantly, into growth, which we will, I think that might then turn around and we might add again on the RM side to the equation into Wealth Management. Let me also clearly say, we have -- I must say, we have no issues to hire, be it on the AM side, be it on other very significant and important positions. If we feel we need to hire, we have no issues to hire. A lot of people also outside from Credit Suisse are strongly buying into that story of new Credit Suisse and where we are going. And I think that is important and helpful. In terms of cost, the overall development, which you are alluding to in 2022, certainly not where it should go. I was also saying before, we have reduced headcount by like 4% already in the fourth quarter. And the cost program, which we are running within Wealth Management, is obviously an important part of the overall cost transformation program. So, if you look into 2023 and beyond, certainly 2023, you can expect lower costs in Wealth Management, both if it comes to direct costs, but also when it comes to allocated costs from Corporate Center functions.\\nDixit Joshi: Kian, if I may address the second question on SPG and specifically your question on cost and modeling, I think it's part of a whole host of associated benefits for the firm. And it should be put in light of the wider derisking as well as the repositioning of the Investment Bank and resizing of the Investment Bank. So SPG, of course, is one part of, call it, capital release and business repositioning. The other is the non-core unit as well. And on both those counts, we will be giving you clearly more visibility as we do the restatements and, in the case of SPG, once we get to the final close of the transaction, which we're anticipating in the second quarter of this year. We've given some highlights on the elements that we're able to. The first one being the capital benefit yesterday as a result of the gain on sale, which approximately is in the region of 30 basis points. The second is the OR reductions with, as I mentioned, some clear guidance on the forward trajectory without being able to give you the magnitude as at the state, given that would be an active regulatory dialogue. But we have, as I mentioned, strong expectation on the direction there. The third benefit would be liquidity and funding efficiencies. And you've already seen that come through over the last quarter as we've been de-risking in the SPG portfolio, and there'll be some further efficiencies through the course of the next quarter. And then lastly, I'd mention that the, really, the reduction or the impact on our financial plan from the exit of the SPG business was built into the RoTE target that we had set out on October 27 last year. And so -- and I would also mention that our cost targets will get amended accordingly as we progress towards the final close on the transaction. So, a number of moving pieces that we will give you more clarity on as we get to the close and as we complete the transaction.\\nKian Abouhossein: Thanks, Dixit. Just one more quick one. You mentioned the losses from the non-core in the IB. I missed that. Could you just repeat how it breaks down within the IB?\\nDixit Joshi: Sure, Kian. We -- as we haven't re-segmented, of course, it's been IB reporting for Q4 under the old segment. The non-core, of course, will be split out when you see the results in April in that time series, but also, we'll be reporting Q1 in our new market structure. We, of course, did in advance of the non-core unit taking shape on the 1st of January. We have been disciplined on executing on our exits of products or exposures to free up capital in a manner that will benefit the shareholder, and you're seeing that come through in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, that's about...\\nKian Abouhossein: Sorry, I'm referring to the P&L. Can you -- just a simple question, can you give me the breakdown of the losses in the P&L within the IB?\\nDixit Joshi: No, not yet, Kian. As I said, once you get the restatement, once we restate in the new segment, then we'll be able to provide more visibility around that. Of course, in the Q4, as you point out, of course, in the Q4 in the IB segment, we have losses related to intentional de-risking and especially accelerated de-risking that we've absorbed in the fourth quarter, which is what you're seeing coming through in the results as well.\\nKian Abouhossein: Thank you.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Daniele Brupbacher with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: Yes, good morning, and thank you. I wanted to ask about the liquidity coverage ratio of 144%, which is a three-month average. Can you tell us where spot levels were year-end or probably now? And historically, that was closer to 200%. There was probably some reasons behind that. How should we think about it? Whether you can also structurally change some of the funding, bearing in mind legal entity constraints? So, that's one. And then, secondly, also on the capital situation, I mean I guess the U.S. business was running at 24% CET1, Q3. I don't know where it was in Q4, but how do you think about the capital distribution within the group and things you can optimize in that regard? How are you going to do that in the context of the carve-out of CSFB? Are you going to use that legal entity? And what's the possibility to repatriate some of that capital to then really have a benefit at the parent or the group level? That would be interesting. Thank you.\\nUlrich Koerner: Thanks, Daniele. With respect to LCR, 144% at the end of last year, as you said. So, what we do not do is giving spot rates here. But that's why we said, and that's how you should think about it, that's why we said it has improved since then. And if you put that all together, what I said about the overall flow situation and so on should be pretty clear, and what we are, and hence, a good question. So, assume throughout this year, we are rebuilding further the LCR ratio to an extent different levels, which is obviously, as it's immediately clear to you, driven by the whole derisking, deleveraging, which we are doing and Dixit was talking about. What we have not yet fully defined, so to say, what should be with respect to new Credit Suisse an adequate and sensible target ratio for the long term, this is certainly something which we will do once, but not yet, too early in this year because as you also immediately understand, it has a lot of questions tied into legal entity structure and so on where we are also working on. And once we are more progressed on this kind of topics, then we will be certainly in a position to say, look, and very sensible, very comfortable target for LCR should be X or should be Y. I think that's the current situation. So, we are rebuilding further.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: Okay. Got it.\\nDixit Joshi: And Daniele, on capital, I'm glad you brought that up because if you look at the U.S. entities, in particular that you mentioned, with the exit of the SPG business and the work that we're doing towards a carve-out of Credit Suisse First Boston, our legal entity structure, our legal entity balance sheet will look quite different in places like the United States. And it's not just the U.S., but it's elsewhere as well. As we look at simplifying the organization, the derisking and simplification will lead to further opportunities for capital repatriation and efficiency. You've seen that, for example, in the U.K. entities over the last few years where we've created much capital efficiency as we execute on our legal entity simplification program. The other is I'd point you to the parent capital ratio, which as you saw was at 12.2%, partly as a function of some of the simplification benefits we've seen over the years. So, it's something that we're highly focused on and that we're going to continue driving efficiencies on.\\nDaniele Brupbacher: It's super helpful. Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: Pleasure.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Amit Goel with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nAmit Goel: Hi, thank you. I've got two main questions. One, I think, obviously you mentioned in 2023, you anticipate a fairly substantial loss. Just I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts, and obviously, there's a lot of things to be seen for the year. But I mean, is there any chance you can give us a bit more of a sense of how substantial? Is that largely centered in the IB, but just some sort of order of magnitude there? And then, secondly, there have been a number of articles about various changes to compensation plans, different incentives being put in place. I just wanted to get a sense of how all these things add up. And also, how do they get expensed? So, are they generally being expensed in 2023 or in future years and basically have some of these things work? Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: Amit, hi. Yes, on 2023, I mean I'll try to give you some of the building blocks, again, not in a position to give you full guidance for '23 in detail, but I'll point you to a couple of important data points. One is that the Capital Release Unit has targets for this year to deliver on our RWA and leverage efficiency and free up capital. And as you know, we built de-risking costs in respect of that into our plan. So, I would say that's the first item. The second is for businesses that we buy, the discontinued exit, as you know, as is the nature of Capital Release Units that we've seen before at our firm and elsewhere is what you have is revenues dissipate quite quickly and then you attack the cost base and that takes more time, but it's effectively a drag on PTI, which is also what we indicated to you in October with some estimates of PTI out to 2025. And so that would be the second drag we expect. And then, the third is just broader restructuring. We'd indicated that we would try and front load to an extent the restructuring expenses. You saw CHF300 million, just north of CHF300 million in the fourth quarter. This year, we've estimated around CHF1.6 billion. That was the guidance we gave in October for this year. And for next year, it's about CHF1 billion. So, you'll see the P&L absorbing those restructuring expenses as well through the course of this year. Again, we'll give a further update as we begin -- as we get through the rest of the year, but we're really three months into the execution of our strategy. And really, so when we say we'll be loss-making for this year, it's to absorb all of those costs. You asked specifically, is it the IB? It's a combination, actually, for example, our cost reduction program, it really goes horizontally across the organization. So, it really affects all of our business units and all our infrastructure areas.\\nUlrich Koerner: Amit, with respect to compensation question, as you have seen, variable compensation 2022 was reduced by 50% compared to the last year, but even more significantly to previous year, so to say. And you are alluding to, I guess, to what we call the transformation award. That is an award which goes to, call it, a pretty selected, relatively small group of people in the firm. These are colleagues which, independently of hierarchy, and this is also important, independently of hierarchy, who have -- if you want additional important tasks to support our transformation and to help us with the transformation. And overall, this is not an -- in my eyes, very material amount. And the award has on top of it -- and this is also to bear in mind for you, has on top of it a strong cliff vesting element in it, which kicks in if everything gets done as we laid out. And we are convinced of that, this kicks in after 2025. So, overall, if you look through '23, '24, '25, that will not disturb your model in any meaningful way.\\nAmit Goel: Okay. Thank you.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Stefan Stalmann with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\\nStefan Stalmann: Yes, good morning. I wanted to follow up on liquidity, please. In one of your recent disclosures, you did point to some liquidity breaches in some of your subsidiaries. And I was wondering if those breaches have been resolved since then. And the second question relates to your funding cost guidance, the CHF0.5 billion increase that you mentioned for 2023. Is that relating, in a relatively narrow sense, to wholesale funding only? Or are you also allowing for some adverse pricing effects on deposits, either by trying to get them back or by having to offer more to your existing depositors? Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: Stefan, yes, happy to take both of those. On liquidity, as we said in October, pretty exceptional month for the company at that point, and glad that it's now behind us. As Ulrich mentioned, more than two-thirds of the flows occurred in October and more than 85% in October and November. And in our disclosures, we were pretty fulsome in October around some temporary breaches that we had. So, I'd highlight the word temporary because, as you say, were they resolved? Yes, absolutely. As you know, when we're operating multi-legal entity construct, we would try and retain the appropriate level of liquidity in each of the entities, but not necessarily excesses at the entity level. We would retain those excesses in the group. And then, our group treasury would rebalance in the normal course of business on a daily basis depending on flows. And so, you make an instances where you have a momentary need in an entity and then that gets cured within a day or two or three. And so, pretty comfortable with how that was dealt with, and we're in a pretty good position right now, as you're seeing from the turnaround through the quarter as well as in January. On the second point, on funding costs, and perhaps I'll address it through your deposit point first, which is that we have seen the central banks have pulled back on liquidity through the last year. We have seen a more competitive environment for deposits more generally across the industry. And so, we're also competitive in that respect on pricing. We've also wanted to rebuild our deposit base. And so, we will flex our pricing accordingly, very comfortable with the pricing levels that our RMs and our teams are going out with. And the other is, look, just once again, a recognition that deposit funding is still, on a relative basis, our cheapest source of funding and will remain so. We're pleased that we've been able to reduce, as a result of the actions that we're taking on the balance sheet, as a result of our strategy, we've been pleased that we've been able to reduce the quantum of capital market funding that we have. But as you can see, it's CHF17 billion out of a much larger balance sheet. And so, we're pretty comfortable that we're setting ourselves on a path to reduce our funding costs through time as our balance sheet evolves.\\nAmit Goel: Great. Thank you very much.\\nDixit Joshi: My pleasure.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Hallam with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nChris Hallam: Yes. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my questions. The first is essentially a bit of a follow-up to Magdalena and Kian's question earlier. One of the key pillars on the strategic update at Q3 was the pivoting of the business back to profitable core. And at the time, you mentioned the Wealth Management franchise is sort of an 18% to 20% RoTE business within those 2025 targets. But given the reduction in AUMs, and you've highlighted the business is expected to be loss-making in the first quarter, is there now a sort of a strategic decision to be made as to whether to either sort of, a, run the business as a profitable franchise at current AUM levels; or b, to try and regain assets and deliver the level of absolute profit contribution, which was embedded in that strategic plan? I appreciate the comments you made earlier on this topic, but I just wondered whether those two options are essentially mutually exclusive from a cost perspective. So that's my first question. And then, the second one is just on the strategic update, you had the objective of around $3 billion of revenues in the Markets business. And I just wonder whether that's still an objective now.\\nUlrich Koerner: Okay. Chris, let me start with the first one. Thanks for the questions. So, we laid out very clearly, as part of the transformation, three main blocks of actions by the end of October, as you might remember. The first one, as you put it, the radical restructuring of the Investment Bank, and we talked about some various important elements over the last few minutes here. The second one is the cost transformation program with very, very clear guidance on the cost reduction targets, again, as Dixit was saying, excluding exits and all these kind of things that comes on top of it. And that's important to bear in mind. And the last one, which we very clearly said is we want to do that transformation out of a position of capital strength, hence, the capital raise, which was successfully -- and other measures, which was successfully concluded in November, as you are fully aware. So -- and we are executing currently against all of these main blocks of measures and, as we said, very focused, very decisively. And you see that we are in many, many aspects, if you go through the presentation, we are ahead of our plan. Second point to make here is, and that is something, as I was alluding to at least, something we are also in parallel working on is to really fill these new Credit Suisse, how we put it, bank, which will evolve here over the next couple of years with content and then, obviously, doing the same with CS First Boston on the other side. And this is something which we owe you, so to say, but it needs a bit more time as we are traveling through 2023. And once we are there, we will update you in terms of what it means then really going forward. Having said that, and that's intuitively clear to you, if new Credit Suisse is based on our Wealth Management business, our very strong businesses in Switzerland, complemented by Asset Management and by the Markets business in a resized form, I think it's intuitively clear where this business, if it runs, so to say, in the way we want to run it going forward, will end up in terms of shareholder returns. So, there must be a very, very attractive proposition for our shareholders. Wealth Management, I think it's -- if I understood the question correctly, it's not -- it's a tricky question, I would say, if you allow me. So, it's not the idea to say, okay, we lost these assets and then we take what we have and, therefore, resized the Wealth Management firm to make it reasonably profitable again. I think we do two things. We do all what is necessary on the cost side, and there is room, as I said before. On the other hand, Wealth Management is the growth engine or one of the growth engines of today's Credit Suisse, but also of the new Credit Suisse. And that is why I said we have a relatively clear plan, the client outreach initiative which we started is part of that certainly in the short term, i.e., last year and 2023. And I said it has started to create good momentum. So we want to win back all the assets, and if not more, which we lost, that goes without saying. Secondly, the growth focus in Wealth Management, strategically spoken, is very clearly on the stable high net worth business; secondly, recurring revenues, and there is enough room for us to improve, goes without saying; and then last but not least, and you know that we have super strong positions in different geographies of the world here, also regaining the ultra-high net worth wallet share. So, I think that's the overall package we are working on. And that's the way how we push back Wealth Management into profitability and into growth mode.\\nDixit Joshi: Chris, if I could just answer the second question that you mentioned around the Markets business, I would say, look, not to look really at the fourth quarter, given that was an exceptional quarter for the company with all of the challenges that were there, together with the intentional repositioning and restructuring-related actions that we undertook in the fourth quarter. The Markets business is an important alignment to our Wealth Management franchise. As a management team, we're moving pretty quickly to take the actions that were necessary to restore that, the bottom-line in that business. And we're confident in the actions that we've begun taking in that franchise.\\nChris Hallam: Okay. Thank you very much. That's very clear.\\nDixit Joshi: Sure.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen with RBC. Please go ahead.\\nAnke Reingen: Yes. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on your -- on the benefit of higher interest rates. If I remember correctly, at the strategic update, you said around half of the 5 percentage point uplift in the RoTE is coming from higher interest rates. And I think that would imply a higher number than you show us today on the CHF900 million prefunding costs. So, I just wondered how this squares. And then on -- following up on Amit's question on the substantial loss in '23. Is it fair to assume that you also think there's a loss at the underlying level? And I think you made some comments on the news wires about 2024, if you can please clarify?\\nDixit Joshi: Anke, sure. I'll -- let me run through the first. On higher NII, on October 27, when we indicated, I think we said in the region of around CHF900 million to CHF1 billion for 2025 as a result of the current term structure and market implies at the time. I think interest rates right now are slightly higher than where we were on October 27. But of course, we have a lower deposit base as a result of the events in October. On balance, it comes out roughly to a wash with around -- still around CHF900 million for the three-year period. And that's very much what was embedded into our RoTE walk as well. On the second point, on the loss for '23, as I said, look, we're focused on really restructuring our businesses. We want to take as many of the actions that we need to create the new Credit Suisse early on in our transition path. We're three months into the restructuring. We've already started, as you can see, in the fourth quarter results as well, largely premeditated intentional actions to execute on our strategy, and you're seeing that come through in the results. We'll, of course, be doing that during the course of the year in a way that is sensitive and capital accretive as possible or economically responsible for our shareholders. But we do want to move as quickly as we can on repositioning and restructuring the firm. Ulrich, if you wanted to add?\\nUlrich Koerner: No, I think that's all right.\\nAnke Reingen: On 2024, I think you said you expect to be profitable, is that correct? And is that at the reported level? Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: That's correct. That's right. As we look to '24 with the planning assumptions that we've made, that's our current assumption.\\nAnke Reingen: Thank you.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.\\nAndrew Lim: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, on the core Markets business that you're mapping out there, you've talked about a net revenue expectation of CHF3 billion. But how do you expect the costs to develop for this division? You've talked about cost reductions across the whole group, but I'm just trying to zero in on the Markets division here and seeing what the core profitability might be if you take into account the cost expectations? And then CSFB, obviously, a lot of work to be done here to carve it out. Is your expectation as you carve it out to -- what's your anticipation of the net CET1 ratio impact as you complete that carve-out?\\nDixit Joshi: Andrew, hi. Look, on the first on really Markets and your question on the cost base, as I mentioned before, the initiatives that we're undertaking as part of our cost transformation program are really across the horizontals. And so, of course, at the one level, we have the strategic repositioning that we've done with the exit of the SPG business. We'll have the carve-out of the Credit Suisse First Boston business. So, we have a simpler mix, and we'll exit cost along that journey. But then, we have really all of the horizontal initiatives that we've been driving for cost reduction, which will also impact the Investment Bank. So, I think what you'll see, as you're starting to see through from last year, is you're starting to see the efficiencies slowly come through, because the headcount reductions that we've undertaken in the fourth quarter will feed through into the bottom-line and going to the cost base as the quarters go along, but won't be visible in the immediate quarter necessarily. What I would say is that, look, we're committed to taking the actions that we needed to, as you're seeing, and to move with speed on those to rightsize the businesses as well in response to the revenue environment that we've seen as well. On the second point, on CS First Boston, we can't give you a specific capital impact today. Suffice to say, one of the pillars of the strategic reasoning here is very much capital efficiency as well as to generate and free up capital for the organization and for the shareholder. And that's certainly the path we're on as we work towards the carve-out and an eventual IPO for that business. Step one for us was to ensure that we commence on the initial planning for the carve-out, which we're now doing and is underway. Step two, as we've announced, was the acquisition of M. Klein & Company, which we announced this morning as well, which was an important pillar on this part of the carve-out, and we'd love to give you more details as we progress on this journey.\\nAndrew Lim: Great. Thank you very much.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tom Hallett with KBW. Please go ahead.\\nTom Hallett: Good morning, guys. So, I was just wondering if you could kind of bucket the discussions around flows of client. You have over CHF90 billion of outflows in Wealth Management. What do you see as a realistic number to come back? And what is unlikely to and what is somewhere in the middle? And I guess what I'm trying to get to is, what clients are open to returning based upon what they see in terms of progression around your restructuring plan? Or others are interested in things like fee reductions, an increase in deposit rates or something like that and others that are probably unlikely to return? That's it for me. Thanks.\\nUlrich Koerner: Okay. Tom, let me take that. So, as we said -- or as I said earlier, we feel that the declines are overwhelmingly supportive. What we have observed, I would say, since October, in particular, and then early November on all these client meetings, at least where I was participating and doing, as I said, typically several a day, I would say there are three groups of clients. The one group which we started to come back very quickly already last year, so after a successful capital raise, they came back, they brought money back and so on. A second group, which I tend to believe is a very large group, at the end of the day, which was a bit more careful, so I look -- let's look at that, let's look at how you are doing, how you are executing and so on, which will come back over time, I'm not saying in a run, but over time. And there's a third group, I would think relatively smaller group, which says, look, we stick with you with what we have now. After reductions, we like you, but we want to observe you a little bit longer than just, let's say, the next, whatever, a few months. So, I think that's what I felt at least from client meetings. So, to your concrete question, how much is coming back, I would like to know that as well, as you can imagine. As I said, the Wealth Management colleagues are pretty hopeful that we bring a fair part of the outflows back already in 2023, and the rest will come later. And as I said also earlier, obviously, our target is to bring all and everything back and then go beyond that.\\nAndrew Lim: Okay. Thank you.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Adam Terelak with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\\nAdam Terelak: Good morning. Thank you for the questions. Lots of questions on flows. I want to see more detail on deposits. Clearly, they're down more than a third Q-on-Q. Can you give us any sort of color around that by division, that by term versus site deposits; and then, the assumption around deposit costs in the NII guide through 2025 and what that might mean particularly for Wealth Management, NII quarter-on-quarter into the beginning of this year, given the repricing outreach program that is ongoing? And then, secondly, back to credit. The language around the AT1 seems to indicate that the preference will be to kind of call and reissue this year's first call date. Is that the right way of reading it? Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: Adam, hi, sure. We wouldn't traditionally break down deposits necessarily within term, site, et cetera. I mean what I'd say is, look, we're looking at deposit efficiency, of course, on our balance sheet. So, step one for us was really ensuring that we'll restore confidence with our clients and customers, and you're starting to see, per Ulrich's remarks, you're starting to see that come through. A core part of that was to ensure that we tapped the capital markets, undertook private transactions, restored CET1 to a higher level, all of the actions that I mentioned that we did in the fourth quarter, and that's now starting to come back. I would point you to the LCR ratio. Look, that's ultimately a combination of both deposits and other measures lead to us managing the LCR ratio. And the LCR ratio, as you see, is up from the lows in the quarter to an average of 144% for the quarter and, as we've indicated, has improved in January as well. So, we're three months into the restructuring. We're taking all the necessary steps. And we're starting to see, as you can see, positive momentum on deposits in January. The second question was really on really deposit costs. And I would say in the NII guide in the first quarter, it's partly why we've guided to a loss in the first quarter for Wealth Management as well is we have a reduced deposit base compared to what we had in September. You see that impacting the NII, of course, in Q4 as well, and that will also have a knock-on impact into Q1 as well. That said, the evolution from here will depend, of course, on both factors, both volume of deposits, but the other is also the evolution of interest rates through the course of this year. The corollary to this is also funding cost where, as I've indicated, we're working hard on optimizing the balance sheet and ensuring that we can squeeze as much as we can out of it and reduce our funding cost. And step one on that path was to derisk in order to reduce our funding needs and then to be able to issue less in the capital markets, which you're now seeing through our issuance plan as well. So, a combination of all of those would lead to NII efficiency.\\nAdam Terelak: Just a quick follow-up. The guide for NII is on a static balance sheet. The deposits you're bringing on board January to date, does that increase or decrease the NII guidance?\\nDixit Joshi: We would -- look, depending on the NII evolution, we'd always amend our modeling and our calculations. That's normally what we do. In fact, in October, we've made assumptions, forward assumptions on the reduced balance sheet given the events in the first three weeks in October, which effectively reduced even from the static balance sheet that we had at the end of September, obviously, reduced the NII, which in the numbers that I've given you in October really factored in a reduced balance sheet as well. Today, when we remodel our balance sheet, we have lower balances, actual balances at the end of the year, but rates are slightly higher and the net outcome is roughly the same at around CHF900 million for NII uplift. But look, as we evolve our balance sheet, we'll give you further updates and guidance on that.\\nAdam Terelak: But no comment on the January cost of deposits?\\nDixit Joshi: No, on deposits, as Ulrich mentioned, we're -- it's still our cheaper source of funding. We're competitive. As we've said, there's been more competition from deposits from the rest of the industry as well through the course of last year. And as always, it's an important part of our funding mix. We'll continue to remain as competitive as we need to be there.\\nAdam Terelak: Brilliant. Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: Sure.\\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Piers Brown with HSBC. Please go ahead.\\nPiers Brown: Good morning. My question is actually on short-term wholesale funding. We've talked a lot on the call about the long-term debt issuance plan and also the positive developments in terms of deposit flows. But if I look at the quarterly report, you've got some quite negative wording around the impact of the November credit rating downgrades on your access to short-term funding. And I wonder if you could just address that in terms of what you're seeing more recently on access and cost of short-term funding and the impact on the IB financing derivatives businesses. Thanks.\\nDixit Joshi: Sure, Piers, and I'm glad you brought that up. Look, we've been reducing our reliance on short-term funding through the course of the last year. And most importantly, the few initiatives that we've launched around restructuring the Investment Bank, derisking in the Capital Release Unit, getting the SPG transaction done, which, as you can see, we've moved really, really quickly on and with -- we're around two-thirds of the target reductions already having happened, all of those reduce our reliance on short-term wholesale funding and create more funding efficiencies as well. There's no question, of course, as we're transparent about that with the credit rating downgrade, certain facilities would have been affected. But that said, we have other tools at our disposal. We're able to do private placements and other bilateral financing as well. And ultimately, what you should look to is the LCR ratio which we're managing to, which is effectively an amalgam on a stress basis of short-term and other medium-term measures in the calculation. Hope that's helpful.\\nAdam Terelak: That's great. Thank you.\\nDixit Joshi: Sure.\\nOperator: I now hand back to Kinner Lakhani for closing remarks. Kinner?\\nKinner Lakhani: Great.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for joining today. We greatly appreciate your participation and engagement. Let me begin with some opening remarks. 2022 was an extremely challenging year for Credit Suisse with the group posting a net loss of CHF7.3 billion. Nonetheless, it was also a year which marked the beginning of the important and necessary transformation for our organization. On October 27th, we presented a targeted plan to create the new Credit Suisse, a simpler, more focused bank built around client needs. And, today, we reaffirm all of the targets we announced in October. We are building the new Credit Suisse around our Wealth Management and Swiss Bank franchises complemented by our leading and differentiated capabilities and Asset Management and Markets. We continue to execute our transformation at an accelerated pace and in a determined manner. I will share some details of our progress over the course of the presentation. In line with the update provided on November 23rd, we reported a pre-tax loss of CHF1.3 billion and an adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF1 billion for the fourth quarter. We have a robust balance sheet, and we are executing on our transformation from a position of strengths. We reported a year-end CET1 ratio of 14.1% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.7%. Our liquidity position also improved following the impact of the events of October. The average liquidity coverage ratio was at 144% at the end of the fourth quarter, with further improvements this year. At these levels, our capital and liquidity ratios compare favorably to our peers. The Board will propose a cash dividend of CHF0.05 per share for the financial year 2022, subject to AGM approval. This is consistent with our intention to pay a nominal dividend throughout the transformation period. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy and have made progress in restructuring our Investment Bank, the creation of CS First Boston, and the acceleration of our cost transformation program. We are confident that our fundamental reshaping of the bank will create value for all our stakeholders. Over the next three years, we will continue to execute at pace, building on our respective global franchise and delivering exceptional service to our clients. Let me turn to the fourth quarter results. The group reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF1 billion for the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting an adjusted pre-tax loss of $1.3 billion in the Investment Bank. Challenging market conditions and lower client activity had a significant impact on our Capital Markets and Advisory businesses, while the strategic actions to de-risk and exit certain business lines resulted in lower sales and trading revenues. Now, turning to Wealth Management. The division reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF155 million. During the quarter, we put in place an extensive client outreach program and are already seeing the benefits of our initiatives. We are also taking proactive steps to reduce the cost base as part of the group-wide cost transformation program. The Swiss Bank division reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of CHF259 million for the quarter. This demonstrates our resilience and leadership position in our home market. Overall, the group reported a pre-tax loss of CHF1.3 billion. This result includes several adjusting items, the largest of which were restructuring expenses related to our cost transformation program as well as real estate gains. Our new executive board remains fully focused on the successful execution of our strategic transformation and the actions we have taken so far strengthen our business momentum in 2023 and beyond. Now, let me be clear, our teams continue to work relentlessly on serving our clients. Since October, we have proactively engaged with more than 10,000 Wealth Management clients and over 50,000 clients in the Swiss Bank. As previously mentioned, we are seeing the first positive signs from our comprehensive global initiatives to regain deposits as well as assets under management. In January, we saw deposit inflows at group level in Wealth Management and in APAC, as well as net new asset in APAC and in Swiss Bank. Importantly, clients remain overwhelmingly supportive and we remain very thankful for that. To remind you of the strengths of our Wealth Management business, we are the number two wealth manager outside the U.S. with a deep client franchise balanced between ultra and high net worth clients. We have a very clear plan to restore the Wealth Management division to profitability. We are focused on growing a more stable high net worth business. We increased our focus on recurring revenues and regaining client wallet share among ultra-high net worth clients. And we are undertaking steps to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Let me now update you on what we have achieved since October 27th. We have made significant progress in the transformation and restructuring of the Investment Bank. Since the end of the third quarter, we have achieved about two-thirds of our Securitized Products Group asset reduction target. In the fourth quarter, we've reduced risk-weighted assets and leveraged exposure by about $5 billion and around $15 billion, respectively, reflecting proactive deleveraging and derisking measures in the non-core unit, that's ahead of the target run rate we set in October. As announced, our goal is to carve out CS First Boston as a distinct leading independent Capital Markets and Advisory net business, and we are pleased with the acquisition of the Investment Banking business of M. Klein & Company. This is a significant step forward in realizing CS First Boston's growth potential and creating value for our shareholders. Since our strategy announcement in October, we have strengthened our capital position by raising around CHF4 billion of equity and we have completed around CHF10 billion of debt issuances, while it's making tangible progress in deleveraging and derisking the group further. This should reduce our funding needs in the future. Our cost transformation is well underway. As previously disclosed, action initiated in the fourth quarter represent approximately 80% of our 2023 cost base reduction target of about CHF1.2 billion. I want to make it absolutely clear that me and my management team are relentless in driving our cost base lower. We have made significant progress on our exit from the Securitized Products. We completed the first closing of our transaction with Apollo. That, along with other actions taken, contributed to an overall reduction in Securitized Products' assets by around $35 billion, since the end of the third quarter. This is approximately two-thirds of our targeted reduction of $55 billion. So, we are on track to close the full transaction in the first half of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals. This transaction, together with the potential sale of other portfolio assets, is expected to reduce risk-weighted assets, leverage exposure and other risk metrics over time. These actions are consistent with our strategy to significantly reduce the size of the Investment Bank and release liquidity and capital to support the bank's core businesses. Turning to the non-core unit. As you can see on the slide, we are running ahead of schedule on both risk-weighted assets reductions and leverage exposure. Dixit will cover the important progress we have made in more detail. CS First Boston is an attractive value proposition for Credit Suisse shareholders and its carve out is an important step in our strategic transformation. We are creating a global independent capital markets and advisory led bank with distinctive capabilities and a unique market position. It will be headquartered in the US with leadership positions in Europe, Asia and selected emerging markets. We are confident that our history of innovation, market leadership and the years of experience of our core teams, together with a simpler operating and regulatory model, will provide a clear competitive advantage. Our execution plan is already underway. We have announced the acquisition of M. Klein & Company, which will further strengthen CS First Boston's advisory capabilities and we are right-sizing the business to reduce capital needs and release low-returning capital. In short, CS First Boston will be efficient, agile and have a comprehensive product offering designed around client needs. Importantly, the new Credit Suisse will maintain a long-term strategic partnership with CS First Boston, leveraging our leading market platform, whilst ensuring the close connectivity to our Wealth Management and Swiss Bank businesses. And we have a strong management team under the leadership of Michael Klein. Michael has an established track record in building leading capital markets and advisory led businesses as well as four decades of investment banking experience. The acquisition of M. Klein & Company adds to Credit Suisse's advisory capabilities and accelerates the creation of an advisory-led CS First Boston. At the same time, it creates significant revenue opportunities for Credit Suisse. The transaction is that a single digit price-to-earnings multiple and is expected to be earnings accretive with an anticipated impact on the CET1 ratio of less than 10 basis points. In October, we made a very clear commitment to simplify the group and to reduce our cost base. We intend to cut the total headcount from around 52,000 in 2022 to 43,000 over the next three years. We have already achieved a 4% reduction in the fourth quarter 2022 and we intend to continue to reduce third-party costs, including spending on contractors and consultants in a targeted and decisive manner. We are determined to deliver on our cost reduction target of CHF1.2 billion in 2023 and CHF2.5 billion by 2025. These targets on a like-for-like basis and exclude the impact of business exits. We are making progress on our cost transformation, and we will be relentless in identifying opportunities to move further and faster. Rest assured, our cost initiatives will not impact the investments in risk management and technology, including digitalization as well as our targeted business growth. To sum up, we are well advanced on our journey to deliver a new simpler, more focused Credit Suisse built around client needs. We have a new executive board with relevant experience and a strong track record of execution in similar situations. We are building a unified culture from the top of the organization with a strong focus on risk management, collaboration and accountability. We remain disciplined on strategic execution, strengthening and reallocating capital, delivery on our cost ambitions, and, most importantly, supporting our clients globally. As I mentioned, we have acted decisively to address the impact of the outflows experienced in the fourth quarter and we have seen deposits inflows at the group level in Wealth Management and APAC, as well as net new assets in APAC and the Swiss Bank. We are also making progress with the carve out of CS First Boston and are creating a more focused markets business that will deliver innovative solutions and products for our Wealth Management and our institutional clients. In short, we are determined to make this transformation a success, restore trust with all stakeholders, and ultimately create sustainable value for our shareholders. With that, I hand it over to Dixit.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Ulrich, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start today with the financial overview for the fourth quarter and the full year, and then provide some details on assets under management given the outflows that we saw in the quarter. After that, I'll go through the divisional performances before setting out some of the key themes for the group. Before I begin, I'd point out that this is the last time we will be discussing our results under our current financial reporting structure. As of the first quarter of 2023, we will be publishing our earnings under the new structure that we outlined in October comprising the four key business divisions and the Corporate Center, plus the Capital Release Unit. We will provide a restated time series at the beginning of April, along with other relevant information and, of course, we plan to provide regular updates detailing our progress as we execute on our strategy. Please note that unless I state otherwise, for example with the Investment Bank, you can assume that whenever I give a currency figure it's in Swiss francs. So, let's start with the group overview. The group took clear strides forward, despite the challenging fourth quarter. We delivered the strategy update alongside our third quarter earnings and started immediately on implementation. We made good progress reducing non-core related exposures, on cost reduction measures and on balance sheet reductions relating to the Capital Release Unit. We proactively managed our liquidity position following the outflows in the fourth quarter. We executed a successful series of capital and funding measures, including raising around CHF4 billion in equity and completing around CHF6 billion of debt issuance in the fourth quarter. We strengthened our CET1 ratio to 14.1%, and we remained resolutely focused on execution and on supporting our clients. As you can see from this morning's announcements regarding the acquisition of the Investment Banking business of M. Klein & Company and the completion of the first closing of our Securitized Products transaction with Apollo, we are executing rapidly on the strategy and we're ahead of plan. In terms of our financial performance, the net asset and deposit outflows in the fourth quarter reduced our net interest income and recurring revenues, notably in Wealth Management. The Investment Bank experienced another tough quarter with lower client activity, the impact of our strategic actions, as well as the events of the fourth quarter, all contributing to the reduced revenues in sales and trading. Revenues in our Capital Markets and Advisory businesses were also lower and more in line with the industry-wide slowdown. Overall, fourth quarter reported net revenues for the group were 33% lower year-on-year at CHF3.1 billion and reported operating expenses were 31% lower at CHF4.3 billion. Provisions for credit losses amounted to 6 basis points of net loans at the year-end, mainly relating to specific provisions taken in the Swiss Bank and the Investment Bank. This resulted in a reported pre-tax loss for the quarter for the group of CHF1.3 billion, in line with the guidance that we gave at the end of November of a loss of up to CHF1.5 billion. Our reported results include a number of adjusting items with a cumulative net impact on our fourth quarter results of CHF300 million. A detailed breakdown can be found in the earnings release. However, notable adjusting revenue items included CHF191 million of real estate gains and a CHF75 million loss relating to the disposal of our remaining stake in Allfunds. In total, adjusted net revenues for the fourth quarter were 32% lower year-on-year at CHF3 billion. Reported operating expenses for the quarter included CHF352 million of restructuring expenses, broadly in line with our guidance of CHF300 million and CHF34 million of major litigation provisions. We continue to make good progress in resolving our outstanding legacy issues. Adjusting for these items, operating expenses were 3% lower year-on-year at CHF3.9 billion, resulting in an adjusted pre-tax loss for the quarter of CHF1 billion. The income tax expense for the fourth quarter was CHF82 million, resulting in a net loss attributable to shareholders of CHF1.4 billion. The reason we have a tax charge for the quarter, despite the overall reported pre-tax loss, is driven by the fact that we earn taxable income in legal entities, which cannot be offset by tax losses elsewhere in the group. We expect this to continue to be the case in 2023 as we execute on our transformation program. I'd like briefly to mention the Corporate Center, which booked an adjusted pre-tax income of CHF104 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of CHF172 million in the same period last year. This was largely driven by treasury results. Turning back to the group, for the full year, reported revenues were 34% lower compared to 2021 at CHF14.9 billion, reported operating expenses were 5% lower at CHF18.2 billion, leading to a reported pre-tax loss for the year of CHF3.3 billion. The third quarter deferred tax impairment of CHF3.7 billion resulted in a reported net loss of CHF7.3 billion for 2022. Let me make a brief comment on compensation, which for the full year was down 2%. The fourth quarter total for the group decreased by 4% year-on-year, however it was 8% higher compared to the third quarter. This was a function of structural changes we've made to compensation over the course of the last year. As a result, some of the division show increases in the compensation line for the fourth quarter. Compensation is one of our key levers for controlling costs and I'd note that the total variable compensation pool for 2022 was 50% lower than in 2021, as we took actions commensurate with the decline in the group performance. Now, before we turn to the performance of our business divisions, which I will discuss as usual on an adjusted basis, I'll touch on the impact of the client asset outflows during the fourth quarter on Slide 15. Our assets under management were impacted by significant net asset outflows early in the quarter, which affected both our revenues and our liquidity position for the fourth quarter. Approximately, two-thirds of the net asset outflows in the fourth quarter occurred in October and they've reduced considerably in November and December. Group assets under management were around 8% lower quarter-on-quarter at CHF1.3 trillion, largely reflecting net asset outflows of CHF111 billion. Deposit outflows made up around 60% of Wealth Management and Swiss Bank net asset outflows in the quarter. In total, net asset outflows represented 8% of assets under management at the end of September. Since the start of the fourth quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet, including through the capital raises to set the group on a stronger trajectory. We're now three months into our transformation journey and we saw the first signs of the benefits of these and other proactive initiatives in January with positive deposit inflows at the group level and specifically in Wealth Management. Net asset flows in the Swiss Bank were positive and the net asset outflows in Wealth Management in January where at a reduced level compared to December with net asset inflows in Asia Pacific. Moving on to the divisional overviews, we'll start with Wealth Management. Lower assets under management and deposits as well as subdued client activity resulted in lower revenues. This led to a loss in Wealth Management as we had indicated in our outlook statement in November. Net interest income declined 17% year-on-year with lower loan income and higher funding costs offsetting the benefit of rising interest rates on deposit income, albeit on lower deposit volumes. Similarly, lower average assets under management resulted in a 17% year-on-year fall in recurring commissions and fees. Transaction based revenues were 20% lower, reflecting reduced levels of client activity and mark-to-market losses of CHF31 million on financing exposures. Total net revenues were down 18% year-on-year. Operating expenses were 5% higher, mainly due to higher general and administrative expenses, reflecting higher allocated corporate function costs. I would note that a number of the measures that we took in the fourth quarter should reduce costs for the division in 2023. Overall, the division delivered an adjusted pre-tax loss for the quarter of CHF155 million. While we expect the division to report a loss for the first quarter, we are determined to return Wealth Management to profitability and Ulrich has highlighted some of the specific actions that we're taking to achieve this. Let's turn to the Swiss Bank on Slide 17. Swiss Bank had a resilient fourth quarter. Net revenues were 10% lower year-on-year, but quarter-on-quarter revenues held up well, 3% lower. Net asset outflows were CHF8.3 billion, primarily from private clients. The reduction in the threshold benefit from the Swiss National Bank, given rising interest rates in Switzerland, negatively impacted net interest income, so this was partially offset by higher deposit income. NII was 11% lower year-on-year and flat compared to the third quarter. As a reminder, the loss of the SNB threshold benefits is now in the quarterly run rate and we expect the year-on-year impact, which was CHF78 million in the fourth quarter, to bottom out by the middle of this year. Recurring commissions and fees were 10% lower year-on-year, mainly due to lower average assets under management. These were flat compared to the end of the third quarter and 12% lower year-on-year, primarily the result of declining markets. Transaction-based revenues were 18% lower year-on-year, mainly driven by the impact of equity investments. Excluding these, lower client activity accounted for an 8% reduction. A 6% year-on-year increase in operating expenses mainly reflected the structural changes to compensation that I referred to earlier. Provisions for credit losses were CHF28 million compared to a release of CHF4 million in the fourth quarter last year, equivalent to 7 basis points of net loans. Overall, the division reported a pre-tax income of CHF259 million, 41% lower year-on-year. Turning to Asset Management. Market conditions in the fourth quarter were challenging for the Asset Management division. Net revenues were down 28% year-on-year, driven primarily by lower performance, transaction and placement fees, as well as reduced management fees. Management fees were 19% lower, reflecting a decline in assets under management of CHF74 billion, CHF50 billion of which was due to FX and market effects. Net asset outflows in the quarter were CHF11.7 billion, across both traditional and alternative investments as well as outflows from investments and partnerships. Operating expenses were 3% lower year-on-year, primarily due to lower costs relating to the supply chain finance funds matter and reduced commission expenses, partly offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses. In total, the division booked an adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF15 million for the quarter. Let's now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 19. Clearly, this was not a normal quarter for the group and in particular for the Investment Bank, where revenues were down 74% year-on-year. Revenues were directly impacted by: first, our restructuring actions, including the steps taken to de-risk and exit certain business lines; second, actions we took in response to the group's deposit outflows in the fourth quarter; and third, reduced client activity as capital market conditions remained challenging. Operating expenses were 15% lower year-on-year, mainly reflecting lower compensation and benefits, resulting in an adjusted pre-tax loss for the quarter of $1.3 billion. Our sales and trading businesses were impacted both by our restructuring and lower client activity, resulting in an 89% year-on-year decline in revenues. We estimate that the impact of the accelerated deleveraging, including that linked to our strategic actions, accounted for around 40% of the year-on-year decline. Our continued strength in macro was offset by a substantial decline in Securitized Products and Global Credit Products, largely due to our strategic actions and, consequently, fixed income revenues were 84% lower year-on-year. Equity sales and trading revenues were affected by the impact of our strategic actions, reduced client activity and less favorable market conditions on the equity derivatives business. The exit of Prime Services also had a year-on-year effect on cash equities. Overall, equities revenues were 96% lower year-on-year. For those business lines less directly impacted by our restructuring, the performance was more resilient with Capital Markets and Advisory revenues 59% lower year-on-year, in line with the reduced industry fee pools. The reported pre-tax loss of $1.5 billion included restructuring expenses of $214 million for the fourth quarter, part of which was related to the headcount reduction program. We also booked major litigation expenses of $43 million. Looking forward, our strategic actions and the ongoing challenging market backdrop mean we would also expect the Investment Bank to report a loss in the first quarter of 2023. However, we have taken decisive action on the structure of the division and these measures are important steps in the creation of the new Credit Suisse. I'll now take you through our progress on some of our key financial metrics starting with capital on Slide 20. We ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.1%, up around 150 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Our successful capital increases added 147 basis points, underpinning our capital strength as we continue to execute on our strategic transformation. Business RWA reductions benefited the CET1 ratio by 80 basis points, partially offset by 53 basis points attributable to the net loss for the quarter and by 24 basis points due to other CET1 movements, including FX and model and parameter updates. Overall, RWAs declined by CHF23 billion quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the reductions in the Investment Bank of around CHF5 billion and around CHF9 billion in Wealth Management and Swiss Bank, with a further CHF10 billion due to FX. Our parent capital ratio was around 250 basis points higher compared to the end of September at 12.2%. I should also note that as we reduce RMBS exposures and activity as part of our announced strategy towards a managed exit from the Securitized Products business and to de-risk the bank, we anticipate, based on ongoing regulatory discussions, that operational risk RWAs associated with historical RMBS activity will decrease. Turning to leverage. For the fourth quarter, we reported a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.7% compared to 6% in the prior quarter. Clearly, this ratio was higher than the level we'd normally expect to maintain, primarily because of the reduced size of the balance sheet which resulted from the events early in the fourth quarter. Reductions in high-quality liquid assets, mainly from the deposit outflows, and business deleveraging contributed 102 basis points and 59 basis points, respectively, with the capital raises contributing 47 basis points. This was partly offset by 17 basis point impact resulting from the reported net loss for the fourth quarter. Leverage exposure was CHF186 billion lower quarter-on-quarter at CHF651 billion, primarily driven by CHF118 billion drop in HQLA as well as deleveraging, notably in the Investment Bank. Let's now look at these deleveraging and derisking measures in more detail on Slide 22. As part of our strategic transformation announced in October, on the 1st of January, we established the Capital Release Unit, which includes the non-core for non-strategic assets. The CRU will be a separate reporting division and we will provide a more detailed breakdown when we publish our restated financials in early April. We've made a strong start in the fourth quarter in advance of the formal establishment of the CRU. Proactive deleveraging, derisking, and market moves reduced RWAs by around $5 billion and leverage exposure by around $15 billion, excluding the impact from reductions in HQLA allocations. We're running ahead of schedule, and I'd add that de-risking also generated an estimated $10 billion of liquidity in the fourth quarter. We intend to continue to execute on the run down of assets to release capital and liquidity, as well as targeting cost reductions. As you can see, we're well on track to reach our RWA and leverage exposure targets of around $25 billion and around $92 billion, respectively, by the end of this year. Moving on to our liquidity coverage ratio. Although, the group's liquidity position was impacted by deposit outflows in the fourth quarter, our average liquidity coverage ratio at the end of December stood at 144%, well above the group's minimum regulatory requirements and comparing favorably with our peer group. This represents an improvement from the lower levels in the quarter. It was a result of a series of proactive measures, including the capital raises, debt issuances and deleveraging. We have continued to see the improvement in the ratio, since the start of the year and we remain focused on maintaining our LCR at a prudent level. The disciplined execution of our strategy, including our simplification program, should lead to further liquidity improvements and more efficient liquidity management across the group. Moving now to funding on Slide 24. A major consequence of our strategic transformation is that the group's future funding needs and related costs should reduce considerably over time due to the simplification of our business model. This should result in a more efficient group balance sheet. You can see that in 2023, as a result of the balance sheet deleveraging driven by our strategic actions, redemptions should exceed our estimated debt issuance plan for the year. This reverses the situation of recent years, and I would expect this trend to continue over the next three years. Our issuance plan for the current financial year is around CHF17 billion, less than the expected redemptions of CHF22 billion. Reduced HoldCo funding needs means we expect issuance of around CHF2 billion and AT1 issuance of around CHF4 billion. In January, we completed nearly half of our planned CHF9 billion OpCo issuance for the year and around a quarter of the overall full year funding plan. Let's move on to net interest income sensitivity and guidance for funding costs. I would expect the cumulative revenue benefit based on current forward curves to be around CHF900 million for the next three years versus year-end 2022 with the largest benefit coming from higher US dollar rates. To be clear, our forward net interest income assumptions are based on the static balance sheet at the end of the year. The benefit going forward will be a function of actual loan and deposit balances. Now, turning to funding costs. The widening of our credit spreads over the course of 2022 has resulted in an increase in the cost of our funding and I would expect this to continue to be the case, partially offsetting the benefit of higher interest rates over the next three years. For 2023, I expect that increase to be in the region of CHF500 million compared to 2022. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect our funding needs and costs to reduce as we progress our transformation. Turning now to costs. Adjusted operating expenses for the year was CHF16.2 billion, broadly flat compared to 2021 and below our previous guidance of around CHF16.5 billion to CHF17 billion, reflecting our disciplined approach to costs, including compensation, which I touched on earlier. Looking forward, our ambition to reduce the cost base to no more than CHF15.8 billion in 2023 and to around CHF14.5 billion by 2025 on a constant perimeter basis remains unchanged. What I mean by this is that as we complete the Securitized Products transaction and execute on other disposals, we'll adjust our cost and headcount targets downwards accordingly. We are on track to deliver on our cost ambitions and, as we've previously disclosed, the actions that we have already initiated in the fourth quarter are expected to represent 80% of the savings required to achieve our 2023 cost target. We will, of course, be looking for additional opportunities to eliminate duplication and drive operating efficiencies across the group. In terms of restructuring costs, for the fourth quarter, we booked CHF352 million, and I would reiterate our previous guidance for restructuring costs of CHF1.6 billion and CHF1 billion for 2023 and 2024, respectively. Touching briefly on headcount, our overall target is to reduce this by 9,000 to around 43,000 by the end of 2025 on a constant perimeter basis. And actions that we've taken in the last three months have enabled us to achieve around a 4% headcount reduction since the end of September. To summarize, our financial performance for the fourth quarter reflects the decisive actions we have taken against a difficult market backdrop. Looking forward, we expect that the strategic actions taken to reduce the group's risk profile and the challenging market conditions will continue to be reflected in our financial results. I would expect the group to report a loss before taxes in 2023 given the adverse revenue impact of the exit from non-core businesses and exposures and, of course, the restructuring charges related to our transformation. We are now well into the execution phase of our strategic transformation and have clear priorities for the weeks and months ahead as we work towards achieving the financial targets that we set out on October 27th. Let me remind you what they are. On group-wide costs, we expect to reduce our cost base on a constant perimeter basis to no more than CHF15.8 billion in 2023 and to around CHF14.5 billion by the end of 2025. With regard to the group CET1 ratio, we expect this to be at least 13% throughout the transformation period and above 13.5% at the end of 2025 pre-Basel III reforms. And by 2025, we are targeting a core return on tangible equity that is excluding the Capital Release Unit of greater than 8% and around 6% for the group, as a whole. Thank you very much. And, with that, I'll hand back to Kinner.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kinner Lakhani',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Dixit. We will now begin the Q&A part of the conference.

Please go ahead.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': \"Good morning. I guess my first question, I'd just like to come back to your commentary around being proactive on flows and winning back some of the client money. Thank you for the comments on January about Asia Pacific and Swiss Bank. I guess my question would be more broadly, as part of your proactive approach, could you provide any kind of color on what you're doing in terms of pricing? Are you putting through cuts to fees? Are you offering higher rates on the deposits? How are you going about winning back that business? So that would be my first question. My second question is on what's left of your fixed income and equities business post the SPG divestment? What is the plan for that business overall? How much is expected to be moved in with CSFB versus how much of that Markets business is to be retained by the broader CS Group? And I'd just like an idea of any thoughts on what the revenue contribution of that Markets franchise could be. You've obviously given the CHF2.5 billion number for CSFB, but presumably, that's mainly around origination and advisory retail. Any thoughts on the Markets franchise going forward? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Ulrich Koerner',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Andrew. Let me start with the first question. So, as we were alluding to, and I'd like to reiterate that because it's really, I think, important for where we are now, where we are going throughout the year, so this client outreach program, which I was talking about, is really unprecedented. That is at least what the colleagues here in the firm tell me being here longer than 30 years. So -- and I think it has shown and has developed very good momentum and, hence, the figures I gave for January. You asked concretely about pricing. So, we try to be competitive, call it, like many of our competitors as well, so to be in the game, but we are not buying assets, just to be clear, because that would not be very smart going forward as well. So, what is also the fact, and I think that is something which all my colleagues in the bank and myself felt and the many, many clients interactions which we had nearly on a daily basis, I would say is that the client support which we get from them is really overwhelming. And I mean this something which is absolutely, for me and my colleagues, is absolutely fantastic. So, the clients, in other words, the clients want us to be successful, and that is something which we can feel and, therefore, we are so focused on delivery.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Andrew, I'll take the second, and thank you for joining the call. The SPG transaction, as you know from our previous announcements, part of our strategy to reshape and rightsize the Investment Bank. That portfolio had in the region of around CHF75 billion approximately of assets at the end of September. We've derisked two-thirds of that portfolio overall through a combination of transactions with Apollo and the first close yesterday and other third parties in the market. And so, we're making rapid progress in reshaping the Investment Bank starting with the SPG portfolio. And we'll continue to enforce capital efficiency and balance sheet efficiency in the Investment Bank. The other leg of that stool is, of course, the Capital Release Unit, which, as I mentioned in my remarks, came into being on the 1st of January. We've moved with pace in advance of that in the fourth quarter to derisk as well. Regarding your question on First Boston -- CS First Boston, CS First Boston, we are reshaping that business as we speak to be capital-light, balance sheet efficient, as well as rightsizing headcount, as Ulrich had mentioned as well. And so, to the extent that we have synergistic businesses, they, of course, will fit well in Credit Suisse First Boston, but I would use those criteria at the outset, which is looking at cost efficiency and balance sheet efficiency as two main criteria for which businesses would fall into SPG -- into Credit Suisse First Boston. The second point I'd make is that with our macro and our markets businesses, we have rightsized those businesses. We've refocused them and, of course, aligned them towards our Wealth Management and our Swiss Bank franchise, which is a key pillar of our strategy at the outset. We will, of course, reflect our restated financials once we set up the CRU, so you'll have a better idea at that stage of the relative splits and what our new segmentation looks like. That should be in April. I hope that's helpful.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Coombs',\n","    'text': 'Yes, I look forward to seeing the new splits.

And I have to say, you're commenting on a clear plan to restore Wealth through profitability. So, could we just hear what's in your business plan flow-wise for 2023? But like broader, from a customer business perspective, when we look at kind of flows, deposits, custody assets, loans, how do you see those developing, let's just say, over the next 12 months on top of what you told us on APAC and kind of year-to-date numbers? So that's question number one. And question number two really is about the mix of your cost savings in 2023 as well. You've given us kind of very -- you've given us points on a slide, I think, 11 -- let me just go back there, on Slide 11 from the perspective what your priorities are. But could you give us a sense which of those points that you have detailed there actually have the biggest impact on that cost base reduction so that at least we get a sense kind of where to look at? Because, for example, on the professional services side, you've already did a lot. On the contractor side kind of workforce mix, you've already done a lot in the fourth quarter. Thanks very much.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Ulrich Koerner',\n","    'text': \"Magdalena, thanks for the question. So, I would say, with respect to your Wealth Management question, what is important, that's why we gave these indications from January, the group overall, as I said, is positive on deposits; Wealth Management, globally, positive on deposits; Asia Pac, positive on deposits. And I'm reiterating that because, as you are fully aware of, the deposits are these kind of assets, so to say, which leave first and have the fungibility to reenter first. So -- and I think that is important to bear in mind. As you immediately understand, Magdalena, we do not give you business plan figures. But you can assume that in the Wealth Management plan is a fair chunk of rewinning lost volumes, lost business with our clients. And important to note here is as well that we hardly lost any client. I think that is also important. That shows you something about what I said before in terms of the relationship which we may have with our clients. Seems to be, for me, very important. In terms of the cost and, Dixit, you might add, a couple of points from my side. With respect to the CHF1.2 billion target, which we stick to, as you are aware of, for 2023, 80% of this cost reduction has been initiated and this in execution already in the fourth quarter. So, I think that is something very positive, which you need to bear in mind. So, you will see the effects coming in, obviously, quarter-by-quarter as we speak in 2023. To better understand, I would say, the overall program, I mean we are doing in forcefully, as I said, everything which we would do in that situation to reduce the cost with the more, call it, classical measures like as we were alluding to getting more efficient, therefore, leading in less headcount, reducing contractors, consultant spend, and there is room to go. This is absolutely no question, we are looking at the usual things which you apply, like how many levels in the organization, how many direct reports, all these kind of things we are working on. Having said that, and I'm saying that because this is what I would think is, call it, the first phase to get into new Credit Suisse. And then, obviously, and we are working in parallel on that one, is that we are asking ourselves and developing our new operating model for new Credit Suisse, and that needs some more work over the next few months. But I think that is important for the second phase of cost reduction, because the new operating model in itself must be designed in a way that is much more agile and much more simpler. That's why we talked about that in connection with new Credit Suisse several times.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Ulrich, just to add, I mean, on those -- and Magdalena, good questions. I think as we reduce complexity and as we simplify the company as part of the move towards the new Credit Suisse, I think that creates larger efficiencies for us, of course, that we need to crystallize. The second point I'd make is we will keep focusing on optimizing our legal entity structure, which also has upside for our cost base. And the third point I'd make is that I mentioned in my remarks that our cost targets are very much on a constant perimeter basis. And so, for example, as we progress towards the final close of the Securitized Products transaction, we will, of course, once that's closed, also then adjust our targets accordingly. So, I think what you're going to see from us as a management team is that we will leave no stone unturned. We have levers at our disposal to drive cost, and we're, hence, confident, as you can hear from myself and Ulrich's remarks, that we're confident on delivering on the cost target.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Magdalena Stoklosa', 'text': 'Thank you very much.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'The next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas Exane.

Could you give us an idea of the remaining one-third, how was that split between November and December? Was it sort of even across both of those months? That's my first question. And then, the second question, you said -- again, it's on a similar topic. You said that you'd had further outflows in Wealth Management in January, but at a reduced level. I just wondered how we should interpret what you mean by reduced level. Is that relative to 15% in 4Q or relative to where you were in December? That would be very helpful just to understand what you mean by a reduced level of outflows.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Ulrich Koerner',\n","    'text': \"Thank you very much for the questions, both very good questions. First one, we said like two-third in October. If you look into October and November together, it's more than 85% of the outflows stemming from these two months, and that was exactly the reason. And you are aware of, before our strategy update end of October, we are not in a situation to communicate. That made it so hard in October. And that's why we started immediately at October 27, literally, our client outreach program, which travels with us -- traveled with us throughout the whole year and travels with us right now and as we speak. So, it has not stopped. So, more than 85% from October and November, which tells you now how the development was also in the last quarter. With respect to your second question, net new assets, in particular, we said we are positive, which is very good, because that's a very proactive region, growth region. We are positive in APAC with a good number for January also in comparison to other years. We are positive in Switzerland, also with a good number overall here. We are positive in a couple of smaller other geographies, but we are also still having some outflows in other regions. And that's why we gave this guidance to say, look, it's not at the moment the case yet that we can say we are all over and in every market and in every region already positive on net new assets. That's how you should read it. But again, as I said, in my eyes, the situation has completely changed from last year.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Jeremy Sigee', 'text': 'Great.

So, it seems that you'll have really quite striking surpluses and, in particular, in the debt and the subordinated debt stack. So, going back to Slide 24, I can very much see why you might under-issue. Is there a possibility you might under-issue by more if you're able to execute on the deleveraging plan that you've laid out? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Alastair, thank you for the question. And I'm glad you've noted that because it is a change from, as you can see on the chart from the previous years, certainly the last two years where we've had a greater issuance requirement than we've had redemptions. As we simplify the balance sheet and as we execute on our strategy, and I hope you're seeing that now in the fourth quarter, certainly, as we've taken the size of the balance sheet down, the intentional pieces where we've delevered the SPG transaction, the early start of the noncore unit, you're starting to now see some of those funding efficiencies come through, and that's now reflected in this issuance plan. We set out, we said, up to CHF17 billion. Of course, the funding plan is dependent on the evolution of the balance sheet through the year, and one has to be somewhat responsive and nimble as you get through the year. But at CHF17 billion of indicated issuance versus a CHF22 billion redemption, we're starting to now really turn the corner and start setting ourselves up on a trajectory to eventually reduce our funding costs through time. A couple of things I'd highlight. In response to what you've just said around Slide 31, it does lead to the reduced HoldCo issuance, which is, at CHF2 billion, much less than our expectations would have been, let's say, at some point during last year for this year. And again, that's a reflection of the strategic actions that we're taking. On OpCo, we'll be opportunistic, as you'd expect, through the course of this year, but we've already issued CHF4 billion of an indicated CHF9 billion. And then, of the overall issuance plan, we've come out of the gates quite fast with an issuance of around 25% of the entire full year plan in January. So, we'll be responsive, but what you're going to see is a much more efficient balance sheet over time as a result of the strategic intended actions that we're taking.

Now, when it comes to really AT1 and HoldCo, of course, this is in the list of our regulators. That said, we will continue transforming the balance sheet in a manner that I think would be conducive towards lower issuance needs. But of course, that's in the hands of our regulators as well. It will be an active dialogue that we will continue having. But I think what's in our hands right now is to continue to drive the balance sheet efficiency that puts us in a position to be able to have that dialogue.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alastair Ryan', 'text': 'Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'The next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with J.P.

The first one is on Wealth Management again, but maybe slightly differently, could you talk about the RM decline of 5% quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year by region and also how you see RM development through 2023? And in that context, could you talk about the cost as well, which clearly has continuously increased in WM? And how you see cost development on an absolute level within the Wealth Management business?

Let me start with the first question. You mentioned the RM decline. We had certainly -- if you look into last year's somewhat heightened attrition, that's right, as you say. Nevertheless, part of that is also to be seen in the light of increasing productivity, goes without saying. So, looking ahead, I would say, very much depending on how we develop step by step to coming back into Wealth Management profitability and, most importantly, into growth, which we will, I think that might then turn around and we might add again on the RM side to the equation into Wealth Management. Let me also clearly say, we have -- I must say, we have no issues to hire, be it on the AM side, be it on other very significant and important positions. If we feel we need to hire, we have no issues to hire. A lot of people also outside from Credit Suisse are strongly buying into that story of new Credit Suisse and where we are going. And I think that is important and helpful. In terms of cost, the overall development, which you are alluding to in 2022, certainly not where it should go. I was also saying before, we have reduced headcount by like 4% already in the fourth quarter. And the cost program, which we are running within Wealth Management, is obviously an important part of the overall cost transformation program. So, if you look into 2023 and beyond, certainly 2023, you can expect lower costs in Wealth Management, both if it comes to direct costs, but also when it comes to allocated costs from Corporate Center functions.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Kian, if I may address the second question on SPG and specifically your question on cost and modeling, I think it's part of a whole host of associated benefits for the firm. And it should be put in light of the wider derisking as well as the repositioning of the Investment Bank and resizing of the Investment Bank. So SPG, of course, is one part of, call it, capital release and business repositioning. The other is the non-core unit as well. And on both those counts, we will be giving you clearly more visibility as we do the restatements and, in the case of SPG, once we get to the final close of the transaction, which we're anticipating in the second quarter of this year. We've given some highlights on the elements that we're able to. The first one being the capital benefit yesterday as a result of the gain on sale, which approximately is in the region of 30 basis points. The second is the OR reductions with, as I mentioned, some clear guidance on the forward trajectory without being able to give you the magnitude as at the state, given that would be an active regulatory dialogue. But we have, as I mentioned, strong expectation on the direction there. The third benefit would be liquidity and funding efficiencies. And you've already seen that come through over the last quarter as we've been de-risking in the SPG portfolio, and there'll be some further efficiencies through the course of the next quarter. And then lastly, I'd mention that the, really, the reduction or the impact on our financial plan from the exit of the SPG business was built into the RoTE target that we had set out on October 27 last year. And so -- and I would also mention that our cost targets will get amended accordingly as we progress towards the final close on the transaction. So, a number of moving pieces that we will give you more clarity on as we get to the close and as we complete the transaction.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Kian Abouhossein',\n","    'text': 'Thanks, Dixit.

There was probably some reasons behind that. How should we think about it? Whether you can also structurally change some of the funding, bearing in mind legal entity constraints? So, that's one. And then, secondly, also on the capital situation, I mean I guess the U.S. business was running at 24% CET1, Q3. I don't know where it was in Q4, but how do you think about the capital distribution within the group and things you can optimize in that regard? How are you going to do that in the context of the carve-out of CSFB? Are you going to use that legal entity?

And if you put that all together, what I said about the overall flow situation and so on should be pretty clear, and what we are, and hence, a good question. So, assume throughout this year, we are rebuilding further the LCR ratio to an extent different levels, which is obviously, as it's immediately clear to you, driven by the whole derisking, deleveraging, which we are doing and Dixit was talking about. What we have not yet fully defined, so to say, what should be with respect to new Credit Suisse an adequate and sensible target ratio for the long term, this is certainly something which we will do once, but not yet, too early in this year because as you also immediately understand, it has a lot of questions tied into legal entity structure and so on where we are also working on. And once we are more progressed on this kind of topics, then we will be certainly in a position to say, look, and very sensible, very comfortable target for LCR should be X or should be Y.

And it's not just the U.S., but it's elsewhere as well. As we look at simplifying the organization, the derisking and simplification will lead to further opportunities for capital repatriation and efficiency. You've seen that, for example, in the U.K. entities over the last few years where we've created much capital efficiency as we execute on our legal entity simplification program. The other is I'd point you to the parent capital ratio, which as you saw was at 12.2%, partly as a function of some of the simplification benefits we've seen over the years. So, it's something that we're highly focused on and that we're going to continue driving efficiencies on.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Daniele Brupbacher', 'text': \"It's super helpful.

One, I think, obviously you mentioned in 2023, you anticipate a fairly substantial loss. Just I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts, and obviously, there's a lot of things to be seen for the year. But I mean, is there any chance you can give us a bit more of a sense of how substantial? Is that largely centered in the IB, but just some sort of order of magnitude there? And then, secondly, there have been a number of articles about various changes to compensation plans, different incentives being put in place. I just wanted to get a sense of how all these things add up. And also, how do they get expensed? So, are they generally being expensed in 2023 or in future years and basically have some of these things work? Thank you.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Amit, hi. Yes, on 2023, I mean I'll try to give you some of the building blocks, again, not in a position to give you full guidance for '23 in detail, but I'll point you to a couple of important data points. One is that the Capital Release Unit has targets for this year to deliver on our RWA and leverage efficiency and free up capital. And as you know, we built de-risking costs in respect of that into our plan. So, I would say that's the first item. The second is for businesses that we buy, the discontinued exit, as you know, as is the nature of Capital Release Units that we've seen before at our firm and elsewhere is what you have is revenues dissipate quite quickly and then you attack the cost base and that takes more time, but it's effectively a drag on PTI, which is also what we indicated to you in October with some estimates of PTI out to 2025. And so that would be the second drag we expect. And then, the third is just broader restructuring. We'd indicated that we would try and front load to an extent the restructuring expenses. You saw CHF300 million, just north of CHF300 million in the fourth quarter. This year, we've estimated around CHF1.6 billion. That was the guidance we gave in October for this year. And for next year, it's about CHF1 billion. So, you'll see the P&L absorbing those restructuring expenses as well through the course of this year. Again, we'll give a further update as we begin -- as we get through the rest of the year, but we're really three months into the execution of our strategy. And really, so when we say we'll be loss-making for this year, it's to absorb all of those costs. You asked specifically, is it the IB? It's a combination, actually, for example, our cost reduction program, it really goes horizontally across the organization. So, it really affects all of our business units and all our infrastructure areas.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Ulrich Koerner',\n","    'text': \"Amit, with respect to compensation question, as you have seen, variable compensation 2022 was reduced by 50% compared to the last year, but even more significantly to previous year, so to say. And you are alluding to, I guess, to what we call the transformation award. That is an award which goes to, call it, a pretty selected, relatively small group of people in the firm. These are colleagues which, independently of hierarchy, and this is also important, independently of hierarchy, who have -- if you want additional important tasks to support our transformation and to help us with the transformation. And overall, this is not an -- in my eyes, very material amount. And the award has on top of it -- and this is also to bear in mind for you, has on top of it a strong cliff vesting element in it, which kicks in if everything gets done as we laid out. And we are convinced of that, this kicks in after 2025. So, overall, if you look through '23, '24, '25, that will not disturb your model in any meaningful way.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Amit Goel', 'text': 'Okay.

In one of your recent disclosures, you did point to some liquidity breaches in some of your subsidiaries. And I was wondering if those breaches have been resolved since then. And the second question relates to your funding cost guidance, the CHF0.5 billion increase that you mentioned for 2023. Is that relating, in a relatively narrow sense, to wholesale funding only? Or are you also allowing for some adverse pricing effects on deposits, either by trying to get them back or by having to offer more to your existing depositors? Thank you.'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Stefan, yes, happy to take both of those. On liquidity, as we said in October, pretty exceptional month for the company at that point, and glad that it's now behind us. As Ulrich mentioned, more than two-thirds of the flows occurred in October and more than 85% in October and November. And in our disclosures, we were pretty fulsome in October around some temporary breaches that we had. So, I'd highlight the word temporary because, as you say, were they resolved? Yes, absolutely. As you know, when we're operating multi-legal entity construct, we would try and retain the appropriate level of liquidity in each of the entities, but not necessarily excesses at the entity level. We would retain those excesses in the group. And then, our group treasury would rebalance in the normal course of business on a daily basis depending on flows. And so, you make an instances where you have a momentary need in an entity and then that gets cured within a day or two or three. And so, pretty comfortable with how that was dealt with, and we're in a pretty good position right now, as you're seeing from the turnaround through the quarter as well as in January. On the second point, on funding costs, and perhaps I'll address it through your deposit point first, which is that we have seen the central banks have pulled back on liquidity through the last year. We have seen a more competitive environment for deposits more generally across the industry. And so, we're also competitive in that respect on pricing. We've also wanted to rebuild our deposit base. And so, we will flex our pricing accordingly, very comfortable with the pricing levels that our RMs and our teams are going out with. And the other is, look, just once again, a recognition that deposit funding is still, on a relative basis, our cheapest source of funding and will remain so. We're pleased that we've been able to reduce, as a result of the actions that we're taking on the balance sheet, as a result of our strategy, we've been pleased that we've been able to reduce the quantum of capital market funding that we have. But as you can see, it's CHF17 billion out of a much larger balance sheet. And so, we're pretty comfortable that we're setting ourselves on a path to reduce our funding costs through time as our balance sheet evolves.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Amit Goel', 'text': 'Great.

The first is essentially a bit of a follow-up to Magdalena and Kian's question earlier. One of the key pillars on the strategic update at Q3 was the pivoting of the business back to profitable core. And at the time, you mentioned the Wealth Management franchise is sort of an 18% to 20% RoTE business within those 2025 targets. But given the reduction in AUMs, and you've highlighted the business is expected to be loss-making in the first quarter, is there now a sort of a strategic decision to be made as to whether to either sort of, a, run the business as a profitable franchise at current AUM levels; or b, to try and regain assets and deliver the level of absolute profit contribution, which was embedded in that strategic plan? I appreciate the comments you made earlier on this topic, but I just wondered whether those two options are essentially mutually exclusive from a cost perspective. So that's my first question. And then, the second one is just on the strategic update, you had the objective of around $3 billion of revenues in the Markets business. And I just wonder whether that's still an objective now.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Ulrich Koerner',\n","    'text': \"Okay. Chris, let me start with the first one. Thanks for the questions. So, we laid out very clearly, as part of the transformation, three main blocks of actions by the end of October, as you might remember. The first one, as you put it, the radical restructuring of the Investment Bank, and we talked about some various important elements over the last few minutes here. The second one is the cost transformation program with very, very clear guidance on the cost reduction targets, again, as Dixit was saying, excluding exits and all these kind of things that comes on top of it. And that's important to bear in mind. And the last one, which we very clearly said is we want to do that transformation out of a position of capital strength, hence, the capital raise, which was successfully -- and other measures, which was successfully concluded in November, as you are fully aware. So -- and we are executing currently against all of these main blocks of measures and, as we said, very focused, very decisively. And you see that we are in many, many aspects, if you go through the presentation, we are ahead of our plan. Second point to make here is, and that is something, as I was alluding to at least, something we are also in parallel working on is to really fill these new Credit Suisse, how we put it, bank, which will evolve here over the next couple of years with content and then, obviously, doing the same with CS First Boston on the other side. And this is something which we owe you, so to say, but it needs a bit more time as we are traveling through 2023. And once we are there, we will update you in terms of what it means then really going forward. Having said that, and that's intuitively clear to you, if new Credit Suisse is based on our Wealth Management business, our very strong businesses in Switzerland, complemented by Asset Management and by the Markets business in a resized form, I think it's intuitively clear where this business, if it runs, so to say, in the way we want to run it going forward, will end up in terms of shareholder returns. So, there must be a very, very attractive proposition for our shareholders. Wealth Management, I think it's -- if I understood the question correctly, it's not -- it's a tricky question, I would say, if you allow me. So, it's not the idea to say, okay, we lost these assets and then we take what we have and, therefore, resized the Wealth Management firm to make it reasonably profitable again. I think we do two things. We do all what is necessary on the cost side, and there is room, as I said before. On the other hand, Wealth Management is the growth engine or one of the growth engines of today's Credit Suisse, but also of the new Credit Suisse. And that is why I said we have a relatively clear plan, the client outreach initiative which we started is part of that certainly in the short term, i.e., last year and 2023. And I said it has started to create good momentum. So we want to win back all the assets, and if not more, which we lost, that goes without saying. Secondly, the growth focus in Wealth Management, strategically spoken, is very clearly on the stable high net worth business; secondly, recurring revenues, and there is enough room for us to improve, goes without saying; and then last but not least, and you know that we have super strong positions in different geographies of the world here, also regaining the ultra-high net worth wallet share. So, I think that's the overall package we are working on. And that's the way how we push back Wealth Management into profitability and into growth mode.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Chris, if I could just answer the second question that you mentioned around the Markets business, I would say, look, not to look really at the fourth quarter, given that was an exceptional quarter for the company with all of the challenges that were there, together with the intentional repositioning and restructuring-related actions that we undertook in the fourth quarter. The Markets business is an important alignment to our Wealth Management franchise. As a management team, we're moving pretty quickly to take the actions that were necessary to restore that, the bottom-line in that business. And we're confident in the actions that we've begun taking in that franchise.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Chris Hallam',\n","    'text': \"Okay. Thank you very much.

I just wanted to follow up on your -- on the benefit of higher interest rates. If I remember correctly, at the strategic update, you said around half of the 5 percentage point uplift in the RoTE is coming from higher interest rates. And I think that would imply a higher number than you show us today on the CHF900 million prefunding costs. So, I just wondered how this squares. And then on -- following up on Amit's question on the substantial loss in '23. Is it fair to assume that you also think there's a loss at the underlying level? And I think you made some comments on the news wires about 2024, if you can please clarify?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Anke, sure. I'll -- let me run through the first. On higher NII, on October 27, when we indicated, I think we said in the region of around CHF900 million to CHF1 billion for 2025 as a result of the current term structure and market implies at the time. I think interest rates right now are slightly higher than where we were on October 27. But of course, we have a lower deposit base as a result of the events in October. On balance, it comes out roughly to a wash with around -- still around CHF900 million for the three-year period. And that's very much what was embedded into our RoTE walk as well. On the second point, on the loss for '23, as I said, look, we're focused on really restructuring our businesses. We want to take as many of the actions that we need to create the new Credit Suisse early on in our transition path. We're three months into the restructuring. We've already started, as you can see, in the fourth quarter results as well, largely premeditated intentional actions to execute on our strategy, and you're seeing that come through in the results. We'll, of course, be doing that during the course of the year in a way that is sensitive and capital accretive as possible or economically responsible for our shareholders.

Firstly, on the core Markets business that you're mapping out there, you've talked about a net revenue expectation of CHF3 billion. But how do you expect the costs to develop for this division? You've talked about cost reductions across the whole group, but I'm just trying to zero in on the Markets division here and seeing what the core profitability might be if you take into account the cost expectations? And then CSFB, obviously, a lot of work to be done here to carve it out. Is your expectation as you carve it out to -- what's your anticipation of the net CET1 ratio impact as you complete that carve-out?\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Dixit Joshi',\n","    'text': \"Andrew, hi. Look, on the first on really Markets and your question on the cost base, as I mentioned before, the initiatives that we're undertaking as part of our cost transformation program are really across the horizontals. And so, of course, at the one level, we have the strategic repositioning that we've done with the exit of the SPG business. We'll have the carve-out of the Credit Suisse First Boston business. So, we have a simpler mix, and we'll exit cost along that journey. But then, we have really all of the horizontal initiatives that we've been driving for cost reduction, which will also impact the Investment Bank. So, I think what you'll see, as you're starting to see through from last year, is you're starting to see the efficiencies slowly come through, because the headcount reductions that we've undertaken in the fourth quarter will feed through into the bottom-line and going to the cost base as the quarters go along, but won't be visible in the immediate quarter necessarily. What I would say is that, look, we're committed to taking the actions that we needed to, as you're seeing, and to move with speed on those to rightsize the businesses as well in response to the revenue environment that we've seen as well. On the second point, on CS First Boston, we can't give you a specific capital impact today. Suffice to say, one of the pillars of the strategic reasoning here is very much capital efficiency as well as to generate and free up capital for the organization and for the shareholder. And that's certainly the path we're on as we work towards the carve-out and an eventual IPO for that business. Step one for us was to ensure that we commence on the initial planning for the carve-out, which we're now doing and is underway. Step two, as we've announced, was the acquisition of M. Klein & Company, which we announced this morning as well, which was an important pillar on this part of the carve-out, and we'd love to give you more details as we progress on this journey.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Lim', 'text': 'Great.

And I guess what I'm trying to get to is, what clients are open to returning based upon what they see in terms of progression around your restructuring plan?

Thanks.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Ulrich Koerner',\n","    'text': \"Okay. Tom, let me take that. So, as we said -- or as I said earlier, we feel that the declines are overwhelmingly supportive. What we have observed, I would say, since October, in particular, and then early November on all these client meetings, at least where I was participating and doing, as I said, typically several a day, I would say there are three groups of clients. The one group which we started to come back very quickly already last year, so after a successful capital raise, they came back, they brought money back and so on. A second group, which I tend to believe is a very large group, at the end of the day, which was a bit more careful, so I look -- let's look at that, let's look at how you are doing, how you are executing and so on, which will come back over time, I'm not saying in a run, but over time. And there's a third group, I would think relatively smaller group, which says, look, we stick with you with what we have now. After reductions, we like you, but we want to observe you a little bit longer than just, let's say, the next, whatever, a few months. So, I think that's what I felt at least from client meetings. So, to your concrete question, how much is coming back, I would like to know that as well, as you can imagine. As I said, the Wealth Management colleagues are pretty hopeful that we bring a fair part of the outflows back already in 2023, and the rest will come later. And as I said also earlier, obviously, our target is to bring all and everything back and then go beyond that.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Lim', 'text': 'Okay.

We wouldn't traditionally break down deposits necessarily within term, site, et cetera. I mean what I'd say is, look, we're looking at deposit efficiency, of course, on our balance sheet. So, step one for us was really ensuring that we'll restore confidence with our clients and customers, and you're starting to see, per Ulrich's remarks, you're starting to see that come through. A core part of that was to ensure that we tapped the capital markets, undertook private transactions, restored CET1 to a higher level, all of the actions that I mentioned that we did in the fourth quarter, and that's now starting to come back. I would point you to the LCR ratio. Look, that's ultimately a combination of both deposits and other measures lead to us managing the LCR ratio. And the LCR ratio, as you see, is up from the lows in the quarter to an average of 144% for the quarter and, as we've indicated, has improved in January as well. So, we're three months into the restructuring. We're taking all the necessary steps. And we're starting to see, as you can see, positive momentum on deposits in January. The second question was really on really deposit costs. And I would say in the NII guide in the first quarter, it's partly why we've guided to a loss in the first quarter for Wealth Management as well is we have a reduced deposit base compared to what we had in September. You see that impacting the NII, of course, in Q4 as well, and that will also have a knock-on impact into Q1 as well. That said, the evolution from here will depend, of course, on both factors, both volume of deposits, but the other is also the evolution of interest rates through the course of this year. The corollary to this is also funding cost where, as I've indicated, we're working hard on optimizing the balance sheet and ensuring that we can squeeze as much as we can out of it and reduce our funding cost. And step one on that path was to derisk in order to reduce our funding needs and then to be able to issue less in the capital markets, which you're now seeing through our issuance plan as well. So, a combination of all of those would lead to NII efficiency.\"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Adam Terelak',\n","    'text': \"Just a quick follow-up. The guide for NII is on a static balance sheet.

Today, when we remodel our balance sheet, we have lower balances, actual balances at the end of the year, but rates are slightly higher and the net outcome is roughly the same at around CHF900 million for NII uplift.

In today\\'s call, our Group CFO, Alban de Mailly Nesle, will cover 2 topics. In addition to commenting on the activity indicators for the first 3 months of \\'23, Alban will also review the highlights of 2022 financial information restated under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 that we also published this morning.\\n In order to enable you to better assess the group\\'s earnings trajectory under the new accounting standards, we\\'re also providing on an exceptional basis and underlying earnings target for \\'23. This outlook is unaudited and subject to several key assumptions. Please review the disclaimer slide of the presentation for important qualifying information. After the presentation, our Group Chief Accounting and Reporting Officer, Grégoire de Montchalin, will join Alban to take your questions.\\n And with that, let me hand over to Alban. \\nAlban Nesle: Many thanks, Anu, and good morning to all of you. Thank you for joining the call today. So as you see, it\\'s slightly different from our usual quarterly calls. Because as Anu said, we will cover 2 topics to today. And therefore, we prepared a small presentation, and we will spend a bit more time so that you have enough time for your questions at the end of the call.\\n So let\\'s start with Q1 2023. What are the key highlights of our results. First thing to say that we performed well in the third quarter, and the headline growth is 1%. But in fact, it masks a very strong growth in our technical lines and in particular, P&C, where we\\'re off for a very good start in 2023. That was partly offset by the rightsizing of nonprioritized businesses and some weaker revenues in Unit-Linked Asset Management that reflects the more challenging environment.\\n When we look at our life and business -- Life & Health business, in particular, our priority is the quality of our business and the focus we have on capital-light products. And that\\'s what we\\'ve seen in this quarter. And that\\'s thanks to the very strong efforts of our distribution networks, in particular, the proprietary ones. \\n A word on balance sheet, but we\\'ll come back to that later. You see that our solvency ratio stands at 217%, 2 points higher than at the end of \\'22. And that\\'s supported notably by a very strong normalized capital generation of 7 points this quarter. And there again, I will come back to that later.\\n We have, as shown on the slide, all confidence on our asset mix, which is a high quality, which is what you want in this volatile and uncertain times. As Anu said, we are giving exceptionally guidance for the underlying earnings of this year. We believe they will be above EUR 7.5 billion under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, which is obviously our new framework, but I\\'ll come back to that in the second part of this presentation.\\n So moving to the next slide and looking at our growth momentum. Again, I think the important message is that we are growing where we want to grow. So we\\'re growing in P&C at 6%. First, Commercial lines. Commercial lines, we grew at 7%. On the insurance side, we see that XL had a good growth of 4%. We have clear signs of pricing reacceleration across the portfolio except for North America Professional lines. When you look at our renewal prices at XL Insurance, excluding North America Professional lines, we are up 8%. So that\\'s better than the end of last year.\\n On Personal lines, there again, we have good growth at 4% with a specific focus on Motor with plus 6%. That\\'s obviously due to the pricing efforts that we make to offset the inflation on claims cost. And non-Motor is up 2%. So both reflect there, again, an improving environment.\\n On Health, so Health, that we canceled or not renewed 2 large contracts that we had written at AXA France and for which the experience was not in line with our expectations. If you exclude those 2 contracts, we have good organic growth at plus 7% and both individual and group health and in all our geographies.\\n And finally, Protection, which is also one of the technical lines that we want to grow is up 2%. Notably, thanks to Japan and Switzerland. So that\\'s on the technical lines. And you see that we are growing on those front in line with our strategy.\\n Now coming to Savings. You know that our focus for Savings is Unit-Linked and capital light G/A, and in particular, G/A at maturity. So we -- our revenues on the Unit-Linked were suddenly a bit lower than expected in the fourth quarter, mainly due to, again, the volatile environment. But what we want to highlight here is the fact that we want to work on those 2 legs, Unit-Linked on the one hand and products with guarantee at maturity such as [indiscernible] that we have in France. And when you look at the French business, in particular, you see that the net of those 2 is a positive, plus 5% because in times where it\\'s more difficult to sell Unit-Linked, customers are happy to have products that give guarantees that maturity while allowing them to invest in slightly more risky assets than traditional general account.\\n So last point I want to highlight is the businesses that we don\\'t prioritize, XL Re, you know that we are reducing our property CAT exposure. In volumes, that\\'s minus 35% exposure. That\\'s offset partially by price increases. They were strong in Q1 in property CAT reinsurance. But we also had good growth in other lines at XL Re, notably casualty, mostly coming from prices. And the other one, as I said, is traditional general account savings capital heavy. To the same extent, we do in-force transactions, like the German Bund, that you are very familiar with. We are not unhappy to see that our net flows in traditional G/A savings is negative.\\n So all this leads to a very good high-quality mix for Q1, focus on our technical lines and obviously very consistent with strategy, and we want to carry on growing on that basis.\\n So if we move to the next slide on pricing, which obviously is an important topic these days. What do we see? As I said, for XL, both insurance and Reinsurance, we see good pricing dynamic. The price increases on renewal, as I said, 6%, but 8% excluding North America Professional lines. And we do see reacceleration in most lines. Property is up 9%. Casualty is up 9%. Property in the U.S. is up 18%. So that\\'s very good numbers.\\n We showed the good dynamic that we have at XL Insurance and the same on Reinsurance, but that was expected, and we discussed that already in February.\\n In Commercial lines, excluding AXA XL, so you saw in the previous slide that we had a 7% growth overall in France and Europe. And that mostly comes from pricing at plus 5%. Keep in mind that in Q1, the weight of Switzerland is higher than for the whole year because notably on Commercial lines, contracts are renewed at 1/1. And you know that in Switzerland, there is very low inflation, if any, and therefore, hardly any price increases.\\n So that\\'s somewhat underestimates the overall price increases that we see. Same on Personal lines. You see 5% here. In fact, excluding Switzerland, we are at 7% overall. And again, and I\\'m sure you will have questions on this. Again, that is sufficient or more than sufficient to offset claims inflation. So you see that be it Commercial lines, all Personal lines and in whatever geographies, we managed to have price increases over and above inflation, which is obviously supportive for our technical margins.\\n Let\\'s move to the next slide. So this is our presentation of new business with PVEP and NBV. Obviously, with the changes in interest rates, there is a strong impact coming from interest rates in the minus 17% that you have, for instance, on PVEP. So it\\'s -- it doesn\\'t -- and the same on NBV was minus 11%. What matters for us here is that the NBV margin, which once again shows the quality of our business is up by 0.4 point at 5.6%. The fact that we decreased our PVEP or NBV because of interest rates It\\'s not an issue because what it means, notably when it comes to new business, CSM, is that the unwind of that in the CSM will be done at a higher rate and therefore, it\\'s positive.\\n And you will also have in mind, obviously, that when it comes to our Strategic lines, which are Protection & Health, the impact of higher interest rates is obviously higher than for traditional general account. That\\'s why there again, the impact on our PVEP can look significant at minus 17%, but nothing to be concerned with.\\n If we move now to our Solvency II ratio, so as I said at the beginning, it\\'s plus 2 points compared to the end of last year. That\\'s on the basis of several positive items. The first one is the operating return. But the operating return is 7 points, and that\\'s better than what we had in the past. And we believe that\\'s a recurring change, which leads us to change our guidance. We believe that this year, in particular, our normalized capital generation should be between 25 and 30 points. And this is due to the fact that in P&C earnings, part of our earnings in the past was made of the release of excess reserves. Those excess reserves were already in our Solvency II capital base, and therefore, the release did not generate more solvency.\\n Now under IFRS 17, our P&C earnings are made of PYDs coming from mid of current year profitability, obviously, but also PYDs coming from our best estimate liabilities. And therefore, they directly go entirely to solvency creation. So that\\'s the first point.\\n The second point is the fact that we have higher interest rates also means that we have a higher discount and therefore, a better combined ratio and profitability, which there again enhances our solvency capital generation.\\n And the last item that explains that 7 points capital generation is purely mechanical. Last year, notably thanks to higher interest rates our SCR went down, and therefore, there is a pure denominator impact in our capital generation. So the message is good capital generation overall and better alignment between Solvency II earnings and IFRS 17 earnings, so to speak.\\n On the other impacts that you see on the screen, accrued dividend minus 4%. That\\'s simply last year\\'s dividend divided by 4, as we usually do. No impact from market overall. Obviously, there were some pluses and minuses, minuses in the -- on the interest rates, but pluses in equity and volatility, net is 0. Management actions, I want to spend 1 minute on this, so it\\'s very positive, 5 points.\\n We took advantage of higher interest rates in this first quarter to further reduce our duration gap. By further reducing it, we reduced our SCR, but -- and therefore, improve our solvency. But we also reduced a bit the sensitivity of our solvency to interest rates. And so that\\'s positive also for the future.\\n And last, minus 6 points from regulatory and model changes, you had in mind what we had discussed in February and last year, the minus 9 points that we\\'re losing from IBOR transition and the change to EIOPA reference portfolio, that was partly offset by some other model changes. So that\\'s how we come to minus 6 and the 217% that we have here.\\n So overall, when I look at Q1, we see high-quality revenue mix. We see a very good pricing momentum, notably in P&C. And good business profile overall in the current and certain macroeconomic context and a strong balance sheet in addition to that. So that\\'s why we are confident in our ability this year to produce attractive results and that\\'s -- I\\'m going to give details on in a second as we move to IFRS 17.\\n If you allow me one second to have a bit of water. So let\\'s move to IFRS 17. And one of the main messages that we want to give here, as I said, I think in February is, what matters for us is full year \\'22 under IFRS 4. Don\\'t look too long at full year \\'22 under IFRS 17 because there are a number of elements that distort this number. And that\\'s why we wanted to give you, again, exceptionally that guidance for 2023. So that we would all have in mind the same profit expectations for this year.\\n So what do we say on these lines? We simply reiterate the messages that Grégoire and I gave you last November, which are the following: one, the fact that our earnings power under IFRS 17 is not different from the one that we had under IFRS 4. And that\\'s why we have that guidance of EUR 7.5 billion, which is net of the FX headwind of minus EUR 0.1 billion, coming obviously from the weakness of the U.S. dollar. So EUR 7.6 billion, if you adjust for that and therefore, 5% growth over the IFRS 4 numbers. So that\\'s an important message.\\n And as we saw with the numbers we just discussed on solvency, our accounting change does not have any bearing on our solvency. You saw that we are 217% in Q1. No will that accounting change have any consequence on the cash remitted by our entities. And that\\'s why overall, with that guidance, we are happy to reaffirm once more, the fact that we will meet our key financial targets of this plan, and we will exceed the UEPS CAGR target of 7% that we had given ourselves and the cash remittance target of EUR 14 billion that we had also set ourselves. So no news on this, but we are reaffirming that.\\n So now let\\'s move to the next slide with a bit more detail on that guidance. And again, I will give even further details as we move to P&C, Life & Health in the coming slides. So the underlying earnings this year should be above EUR 7.5 billion. Again, net of the EUR 0.1 billion FX headwind, which is mostly P&C. The EUR 4.7 billion target on -- for P&C is with obviously normalized nat cat. You know that our CAT load is 4 points of combined ratio. So that guidance is based with -- on this assumption.\\n And overall, it comes with improved technical results compared to \\'22, and we\\'ll go into more details. But lower financial results and notably because of higher unwind on the P&C side.\\n Life & Health, and I insist that it\\'s Life & Health and not Life & Savings because there could be some confusion. And here, we tend to report Life & Health together. It\\'s EUR 3.3 billion. It should be EUR 3.3 billion this year, slightly above what we had under IFRS 4 in \\'22.\\n Asset Management and others, a slight deterioration by minus 100 million coming from higher interest rate expenses at holdco level and also the fact that we will have lower revenues in Asset Management. Simply, as you saw, because we had a slightly lower average assets under management in Q1. So that\\'s what I wanted to say on this slide.\\n Now let\\'s look at more details on \\'22. So on the left-hand side of this slide, you have our combined ratio, the actual combined ratio in IFRS 4 and in IFRS 17. So you will recognize the 94.6% combined ratio under IFRS 4.\\n Under IFRS 17, in \\'22, and you have a one-off impact, which is the following. You see that we had PYDs of minus 2.9% under IFRS 4, but these PYDs were made of the release of excess reserves. And you know because we discussed that in the past, that it was on purpose because those excess reserves disappear with IFRS 17. And so we wanted to create those PYDs out of those excess reserves. And so you have them under IFRS 4. You don\\'t have them under IFRS 17 precisely because you don\\'t have excess reserves, I mean, official excess reserves under IFRS 17. And when you just remove the EUR 2.1 billion of excess reserve release that we had, you move from minus 2.9% to plus 1.7%. So that\\'s very specific to 2022. That\\'s not something that will happen again in the future, and I insist on this because, again, we don\\'t have those excess reserves any longer in IFRS 17, and there will not be that distortion anymore.\\n That\\'s why we wanted to provide you with what would be a normalized combined ratio in \\'22. And there, we normalize for 2 things. We normalize for nat cat, which, as I say, should be around 4 points of combined ratio, and we normalize for PYDs. So on this, our new guidance for PYD is that we\\'ve said in the past that it would be in line with long-term experience, now we are a bit more precise. And we\\'re saying they should be between 0.5 points of combined ratio and 2 points of combined ratio.\\n So for illustrative purposes and illustrative purposes only here, we put 1.25% of combined ratio, which is simply the midpoint of that range. And you see that with that normalization of nat cat, the loss ratio that you know, the discount that you now have under IFRS 17 and the PYDs, the comparable combined ratio for -- under IFRS 17 for \\'22, would have been 93.7%.\\n I draw your attention to the fact that we have only normalized nat cat and PYDs. We didn\\'t normalize anything. For instance, the Ukraine loss is still in that number. So that\\'s for the technical part.\\n On the investment income part -- sorry, the financial result. The financial result is made of 2 components: one, the investment income, which is very much in line under IFRS 17 with what it was under IFRS 4, but there is a certain component, which is the unwind of discount. And that unwind cost us in \\'22, EUR 500 million of earnings pretax.\\n So our financial results under IFRS 17 in \\'22 is lower by EUR 400 million than where it was under IFRS 4. So the global picture, which is true in \\'22 and which will be true in the future, is that you have obviously a better combined ratio under IFRS 17, but you will have a lower financial result because of the mechanics that we have just seen.\\n Now if we move to the next slide, so that\\'s where we go into the reasons where we believe that our P&C earnings in \\'23 should be at least equal to EUR 4.7 billion. So we -- first, we believe we\\'ll see an improvement in our technical result. You saw the numbers for Q1 in terms of pricing. And the -- this is supportive for our technical results and our loss ratio.\\n Second point nat cat load of around 4 points, so less than what we had under IFRS 4 in \\'22. Obviously, this is an assumption, but you may have seen in our press release that to date, our CAT experience is in line with expectations.\\n Third, assumption underlying that number is, as I said, the fact that PYD release should be within the range of 0.5 to 2 points.\\n Fourth, hopefully, we -- I mean, we had the loss coming from the Ukraine war last year. And hopefully, we will not have a similar loss in \\'23.\\n And finally, the discounting of current year claims reserves at a higher rate in \\'23 than in \\'22. So that will support our technical result. Conversely, as far as the financial result, is concerned. The unwind of the reserve discount will be higher in \\'23 than it was in \\'22, simply because we accumulate reserves and -- discounted reserves at a higher rate year after year. So the unwind is by construction higher.\\n There is a second effect, which has nothing to do with accounting, which is simply that last year, we had an elevated level of funds distribution, notably private equity and in \\'23, that amount will be lower. And all in all, as I said EUR 4.7 billion.\\n Now moving to Life on the next slide. So this is the 2022 earnings. As you could -- as you know, our Life & Health earnings are mostly driven by CSM release. You see that out of EUR 2.9 billion of earnings that we had in \\'22, EUR 2.5 billion come from the CSM release.\\n In addition to that, we have slightly negative long-term technical results. What you -- what will you find there? It\\'s the fact that it\\'s mostly the experience, and it\\'s also the nonattributable expenses. In \\'22 we had a positive experience variance, which reflected our prudent approach to reserving. We think that it will be -- that\\'s why it came as an offset to the nonattributable expenses at minus EUR 0.1 billion.\\n Short-term technical results in Life, that\\'s mostly our protection business in France, which is accounted for under PAA and not VFA. That\\'s why it comes here as short-term technical result. And you add to that the non-VFA financial result, which is there, again, the investment income that we have minus the unwind of the discount on nonparticipating business.\\n And there, in \\'22, like in P&C, we had -- we have benefited from a high level of fund distribution, and therefore, the -- our investment income in \\'22 is higher -- was higher than what we can expect in \\'23. And so overall, we have EUR 2.9 billion of underlying earnings in \\'22 as opposed to EUR 2.6 billion in IFRS 4. As you know, the mechanics are different, so we can compare the numbers, but we cannot really compare the various components. But what you should have in mind is that there is no accounting distortion on the Life side as opposed to what we saw on the P&C side. But our Life earnings were probably at a high level, given some positive one-offs that we had on the actuarial side and the fund distribution that we also enjoyed in \\'22.\\n Moving to the next slide on the stock of CSM. So here, I think the important part is what is in the box and what we call recurring items. The way to think about CSM and CSM release and new business CSM is the following. New business CSM is built on a risk-neutral basis. So it will come and increase the stock of CSM. But in addition to that, year after year, you will also have the unwind of the stock of CSM at the risk-free rate plus the fact that you have investment income in excess of that risk free rate. And that comes from risk premium on the equity side that comes from spread on bonds and so on and so forth. So that\\'s a natural component of the CSM increase.\\n And then you have the CSM release. And you see that when you take those 3 elements, we are neutral. The first 2 offsetting the third one, which, as you know, is released on a real-world basis, and that\\'s why the new business CSM and the CSM release are not directly comparable. You need to add in addition to that, the unwind and the excess investment income. Then if I move to the other components, you -- we had some economic variance which was down -- which was minus EUR 0.6 billion in \\'22. This is the same economic variance that we saw last year in our solvency. So nothing new on this. And there again, it\\'s quite comforting to see that solvency and accounting are more aligned than before. So you know that we last year benefited from higher interest rates, but we also had higher volatility, lower equity and so net-net, it was a negative, but there again, very much in line with our solvency.\\n And we had a positive operating variance of EUR 1.3 billion, and that\\'s mainly coming from one-off model changes. So that\\'s the dynamic of our stock of CSM in \\'22. And in total, it increased from EUR 24.6 million to EUR 25.5 billion.\\n Now if we move to the next slide on Health. So that\\'s very much the same mechanic as the one we had for Life, so I will be shorter. There again, our Health profits come mainly from CSM release. The only thing I want to comment here in addition to that is the fact that the long-term technical experience, which you see here as a negative, that\\'s the COVID claims that we had in Japan last year that we told you about. That\\'s something that should not repeat in \\'23.\\n And the short-term technical results, so that\\'s EUR 0.2 billion. That comes from our Health businesses that are short tail, such as, for instance, the U.K. And last year, it was impacted from those 2 famous international contracts that we had in France and that we did not renew and that had a negative impact on our Health earnings in \\'22. But overall, underlying earnings on the Health side, very much in line with what we had under IFRS 4.\\n So on the next slide, if I do the same exercise of going through the CSM stock on the Health side, the same box. We have the new business, CSM, we have the underlying return earning source. We have the CSM release. You see that on a net basis, that\\'s very balanced.\\n And the new business, CSM and the underlying return offsets the CSM release. Economic variance. So here, it\\'s more negative than on the Life side, and that\\'s completely normal. Health is, first and foremost, a technical margin business as opposed to a financial margin one. And so as you discount at a higher rate, those technical margins in the future, that will have more significant consequence for Health business than for Savings business. That\\'s why you have a minus EUR 1 billion here.\\n But there again, it\\'s not bad news as such. It\\'s like the comment I made earlier on our PVEP and new business this year as it just means that the unwind will be done at a higher rate in the future. And you know that be it for Life or Health, the message we gave you in November is that the amount of CSM release should be very stable even if we have some ups and downs in the stock of CSM.\\n So moving now to the 2023 target that we have for Life & Health, that it\\'s a slight increase, EUR 3.3 billion compared to EUR 3.2 billion under IFRS 4. Again, we have a lot of visibility on those 2 businesses, thanks to the CSM mechanism. And so we have a good view on the CSM release.\\n We -- in addition to that, we will not have the health claims that we had last year in Japan and France, but we also had some positive model changes in Japan on the Life side last year. That will not review themselves in \\'23.\\n And on the financial results, exactly like in P&C, we will have an unwind of our reserve discount, which will be done at a higher rate, and we will not have the same level of funds distribution. So same mechanism, same impact as on the P&C side, good level of technical results, driven by CSM for Life & Health, but lower financial results for the reasons I explained.\\n Quick word on net income. So I will not comment the impacts directly related to the lower underlying earnings. You know that we took the options as far as equities are concerned, not to have the volatility of equity in our P&L. And it will be booked through shareholders\\' equity. But it doesn\\'t mean that capital gains on equities disappear. They simply go directly to retained earnings without going to P&L. And when I comment our realized gains on equities and our shareholders\\' equity in a few seconds, you will recognize that amount. So no equity capital gains in an IFRS 17 P&L. So what will you see in the future? You will see capital gains coming mostly from real estate.\\n We could have occasionally capital gains and losses coming from fixed income, but you know that it\\'s not a practice to realize fixed income gains and losses simply because of ALM constraints. So that\\'s the main impact. The last one on the other is simply because it comes from assets that were no longer eligible for mark-to-market in OCI and that go to P&L.\\n A word on shareholders\\' equity. So you have side by side, the movement in shareholders\\' equity under IFRS 17 and under IFRS 4, the main difference and by far, is naturally the change in OCI. That was minus EUR 27 billion under IFRS 4 because of higher interest rates mainly. You see that it\\'s only minus EUR 5.4 billion under IFRS 17, simply because most of the changes that we had on the asset side because of interest rates, was offset by the same impact of interest rates on the liability side under IFRS 17.\\n And so you see that our OCI and therefore, more globally, our shareholders\\' equity is much more stable under IFRS 17 than it was under IFRS 4. The other 2 differences: one, the realized gains on equities, what I\\'ve mentioned a second ago that you see here now directly in retained earnings.\\n And the other one is the change in pension benefits. It\\'s simply because part of the positive impact that we had under IFRS 4 was already taken into account in our opening balance sheet at [ 11, \\'22 ] and therefore, did not go to the change in shareholders\\' fund in IFRS 17. That\\'s the overall impact, but you see that  in total, our shareholders\\' equity at the end of \\'22 was very similar to what it was under IFRS 4.\\n And as a conclusion before we go to your questions, so you see that bit on the P&C side or on the Life side, we are very confident in 2023 underlying earnings target. That is thanks to -- well, first, the quality of our business, the fact that it\\'s extremely resilient in this environment. The fact that we have good pricing dynamic in the first quarter.\\n And finally, on Life & Health, the fact that we have good visibility on the CSM. Shareholders\\' equity, as I said, broadly stable versus IFRS 4. And I reiterate the fact that I think you all know this, that those accounting changes have absolutely no bearing on our cash remittance and our Solvency II ratio.\\n And that\\'s why we reiterate again the fact that we will either meet or exceed our driving progress \\'23 key financial targets, as we explained before. We will exceed too that concern, the UEPS CAGR and the cumulative cash remittance. I stop here. \\nAnu Venkataraman: Operator, we\\'re ready to take questions. \\nOperator: The first question is from Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America. \\nAndrew Sinclair: Thank you, and everyone, and thanks for the new disclosure of the new financial disclosure supplement is really good. For me, please, first, I just wanted to understand a little bit more about account  budgets for the year. I know it\\'s 4 percentage points at group level. But what\\'s the budget for XL for the year for nat cats? And at both XL and Group level. How much seasonality should I think about when you\\'re saying you\\'re in line with expectations for Q1? That\\'s my first question. Second, I was just looking at the discounting impact on the combined ratio in 2022. When I was going through the [ CAT ]  quickly this morning, it looks like you\\'re getting about double the discounting benefit in France compared to broader Europe, 3.6 percentage points compared to 1.9. What\\'s the driver of that? And similarly, why did XL get less discounting benefits, say, than France? I might have thought XL might be a bit longer to tail and maybe get more U.S.-focused higher yields than elsewhere. So just keen to understand that. And third was just on capital. The reduced duration gap, you mentioned some lower sensitivities. Just wondered if you can put any numbers around that, how they would look today? \\nAlban Nesle: So thank you, Andrew, for your questions. The -- generally, the way to think about our CAT load is to say that P&C in France, in Europe and XL Insurance, that\\'s roughly the same cat load, around 0.6%, 3.6%, 4.7%. And the difference is made with XL Re, which, by definition, has a higher CAT load given the nature of the business. And that\\'s how you get to the 4% overall. \\n On the discounting impact, so when you compare France and Europe, bear in mind that in Europe, you have Switzerland. And Switzerland obviously has lower interest rates and therefore, the discount and the unwind is made at a lower level. And on the XL -- one second -- yes. So on the XL\\'s rate for that, you should -- have in mind that XL is a business which is more heavily reinsured than the rest of our P&C business. \\n And therefore, the unwind applied to lower reserves and therefore, as such, is lower than what you would see typically in France and Europe. And on your last point on the reduced duration gap. So the sad thing is that we have not put it officially in our Q1 numbers, I can\\'t disclose it. I don\\'t want to risk a selective disclosure here. So it is a reduction. It\\'s not massive, but it goes in the right direction. \\nAndrew Sinclair: The first question I get it but -- just to confirm, what is the CAT budget and percentage points for XL for the full year? Is that -- that\\'s more than 4 percentage points that you have at a group level. And just seasonality, I mean, should we be thinking we\\'re around about that 3.6% points for most of the units and 4%  points overall for Q1 or is it a bit less because of that seasonality? \\nAlban Nesle: So I don\\'t have the number for XL in total because that\\'s not the way I think about it. Again, I think about it as insurance versus reinsurance. That\\'s why I gave you the 3.6%, 3.7% for XL insurance from which you can deduct by having the sum and the fact that it\\'s 4% for the whole group, what it is for XL Re. And in terms of seasonality, obviously, you have probably given our portfolio, a higher level of CAT losses in Q3 because of hurricanes in the U.S. Now you saw that in Q1, we had a significant earthquake in Turkey.\\n And despite that, and there is obviously no seasonality on for earthquakes, despite that, we had a good quarter. \\nOperator: Next question is from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. \\nPeter Eliot: First one, just to follow up actually on that duration gap. I mean given you said the sensitivities hadn\\'t come down massively, I\\'m just -- suggest there\\'s more you can do there. So I\\'m just wondering if you could comment on that. And sorry if I missed it, but are you able to tell us what the duration gap is at this stage? Second one on capital management. I\\'m just wondering if you can share your latest thoughts on capital management.\\n And I\\'m thinking there the lower SCR gives you opportunities especially going forward? Or whether you\\'ve updated your thoughts on the appropriate debt gearing at all. And maybe on that one, any thoughts -- any discussions you\\'ve had with the ratings agencies as to how they will think about their definition might be helpful. And then finally, likewise from me as well, thank you very much for the concise and clear financial supplement. I think I\\'m right that you\\'ve given us analysis by line of business and by geography, but not the sort of the granular detail of P&C lines of business.\\n So for example, I don\\'t think we have French commercial, so it\\'s great to have a concise and reduce things up, but I guess the downside is that it makes it difficult to build a bottom-up model that simultaneously forecast both line of business and geography. So I guess the question is there, can we assume maybe that going forward, your focus might be a bit more on liner business? So we maybe don\\'t have to worry so much about forecasting geography. Just any thoughts or help you give there would be helpful. \\nAlban Nesle: Okay. Thank you very much for your questions, Peter. So on the duration gap, it was 0.5% at the end of last year, it\\'s 0.3% now. But what you should have in mind is the way we think about duration gap is the economic one between our assets and liabilities. What we don\\'t hedge, what we don\\'t take into account in that duration gap is the management of the risk margin or the fact that some of our SCR and parts of our SCR are sensitive to interest rates. And so because we want to have an economic hedging of our interest rate risk, we don\\'t take the risk margin. Therefore, even with such a low duration gap like 0.3%, you still have a sensitivity coming from the variation of the risk margin in our solvency or that if our SCR.\\n I hope that explains the difference, which also means by the word that, at some point, we could move to a duration gap where assets would be longer than liabilities, which is not the case today, which, to some extent, would cover also the sensitivities that I just mentioned from risk margin. But today, our assets are slightly shorter than our liabilities. \\n So on capital management -- and I\\'ll start with debt gearing. On that one, you saw the range that we gave. That\\'s until the end of the year. In early next year, we will give you our next plan. I don\\'t think the debt gearing should change as a target, but we will give you more on this next year. I think we\\'re comfortable with the level of gearing that we have today. On the lower SCR, I\\'m not sure exactly what your question was. \\nPeter Eliot: No. It\\'s just whether that gives you more flexibility and maybe where the scope for it to reduce it a further in the future. I guess it was an open question, but just if there was anything you could add, then they will not be. \\nAlban Nesle: I mean not really. I think the lower SCR is the combination of the fact that, as I said, we had lower interest rates and the fact that our growth in our technical lines does not necessitate more capital and also because we reduced our SCR by reducing our exposure to capital light G/A account. So that\\'s the dynamic at stake. On rating agencies, it\\'s a discussion which is taking place because they are adapting their models to the new accounting framework and that has not yet -- this is not yet finalized. And finally on the detail, effectively, we wanted to give you clarity on quite a few numbers, but we will not go into the details of, say, commercial lines in France or personal line in Germany, we will not do that. \\nOperator: Next question is from Will Hardcastle from UBS. \\nWilliam Hardcastle: The first one is just whether you can update on lapsed experience in the quarter, any geographies or distribution channels? Any comments there would be helpful. Second one, look, there\\'s a fair bit of distortion on that P&C pricing from the mix. You mentioned pricing is generally ahead of inflation when we\\'re talking about Personal Motor. Is there any geographies where this isn\\'t the case or where it\\'s not being passed through by the market? And any update you can say on inflationary trends and whether they\\'re sort of remaining stubbornly high or easing in any geographies quicker than others? \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you. So the lapsed experience, the general answer is no change to our lapsed experience, but for two small pockets, one that\\'s in France some corporate business that we have. So it\\'s not corporate pension, to be clear. It is the fact that in the past, we used to have some corporates generally family holding companies that would simply invest their cash into insurance policies.\\n And so they are pretty sensitive to the interest rate that we can offer and as they can find better rates elsewhere, there were higher lapses there. But it\\'s a small business and the remaining reserves on this are EUR 3 billion. So you see that it\\'s not an issue. The other place where you had higher lapse rates that was in Italy, in some of the business coming from BMPS for somewhat identical reasons. In other words, the customers of BMPS, like of other banks are offered Italian government bonds that have a yield higher than what we can offer. And there again, you saw some increase, but nothing alarming. And at the end of the day, it\\'s a rather small business for us. \\n In general, we don\\'t see, as I said, an increase and that\\'s mainly for two reasons. One is the focus that we\\'ve had over the years is on long-term business for our customers. They are saving for their pension generally. And therefore, their insurance policy is not like a bank deposit, and they would not move every time there is up and down on the interest rate. And very often, they also have a unit-linked policy with that.\\n And the second aspect is that most of our business is done through preparatory distribution. When I look at France, for instance, 80% of it comes from proprietary distribution. And there, we are able to give advice to our customers and they see the value of that advice. They see the value of having an insurance policy, notably with tax benefits and so on. But that\\'s why we haven\\'t seen changes in our business. Now in P&C pricing, so the first part of the answer, which is simple, is that everywhere we have seen price increases that were sufficient to offset or more than offset inflation. The only exception to that is North America professional lines where there, there is a significant competition and prices are down.\\n That being said, the line is still very profitable even with that kind of price pressure. So let me now take you through something I also gave you in the other times we talked about inflation, which is a comparison between the claims inflation that we had in Motor and the pricing measures that we have taken.\\n So what you see in Q1 \\'23 is claims inflation growth of any element, any actions we take to offset it, which is around 7%. It\\'s 7% in France. It\\'s probably 6% in Germany. It\\'s 8% in the U.K. In Switzerland, it\\'s less than 2%. But if I take the example of France, so you have that clear installation of 7%. As I told you the other times, we take some measures like procurement, orientation and so on, which allow us to reduce the cost of that inflation by 2% points. So we\\'re left with 5%. Frequency in France is relatively neutral. It is a headwind in Germany. It\\'s a tailwind in Belgium. But overall, in Europe, it\\'s neutral.\\n But coming back to France, you have those 5% points of claims inflation. You have minus 1% point coming from business mix. And then are price increases that represent 4% points. So all in all, we maintain our margin in France. I gave you France, the same is true for Germany, for Switzerland, for Belgium. The -- obviously, the country which is remarkable is the U.K. for many reasons. But on that one, because price increases are very high.\\n We\\'re talking about north of 25% year-on-year, which means that today, I believe our -- the business that we write today is profitable on an underwriting basis which was not the case last year. \\nWilliam Hardcastle: Thanks Alban, very helpful. I\\'ll say as a compliment that we\\'re remarkable. \\nOperator: Okay, next question is from Farooq Hanif from JPMorgan. \\nFarooq Hanif: Firstly, going back to operational capital generation. So you\\'ve talked about how there are various impacts that have raised you to 25 to 30 points, one of which is the SCR, but the others are obviously kind of own funds related. So can I just confirm that what you\\'re saying is that your operational capital generation in nominal terms in euro amount is actually also increasing. But could you just talk about that? Second point is, again, going back to the comment you just made to Will on pricing with inflation. I mean, you gave the impact of France is broadly neutral. Do you think your combined ratio overall at the group level is going to expand in \\'23 and \\'24 due to pricing versus inflation. So do you see a positive margin impact in 2023? And then two very quick questions, really sorry. But the discount rate effect in P&C, how sensitive is that in \\'23, we\\'ve seen yields come down. How should we think about that? And lastly, the CSM release is 9%. So it\\'s the lower end of your range. Should we also think that there\\'s upside there going forward? How does that work? \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Farooq. So operational capital generation. So yes, in nominal terms, there is an increase. I think if we say that we are at 25 points over the year, that\\'s -- which is the low end of our range, that\\'s 5 to 6 points above the previous range.\\n And I would say 1 to 2 points comes from the fact that the SCI is lower and the rest comes from the simple fact that we generate more capital in absolute terms. On the combined room.\\n So as I said when I talked about the guidance, I think the pricing environment is supportive. And so overall, I believe that, yes, there is room for improvement in our combined ratio. I\\'m talking undiscounted combined ratio, everything else being equal, and leaving aside obviously, CAT volatility and so on, so yes, I think it is supportive.\\n Third, on the discount rate impact, so I\\'ll give you two things. The first thing is the fact that we use rates on a quarterly basis in one quarter in advance, i.e., at the end of December of any given year, you will know the rate at which we will discount Q1 and so you have those rates in our documents that we gave you for Q1 and Q2. So that already gives you half of the year for -- as far as discount is concerned. Then I will give you my own rule of thumb on how I approximate discount. Fundamentally, so the discount applies to the net claims of the year.\\n So if you start with a hundred of premiums, you have 55% of net claims at AXA in P&C. And the discount applies to the part, which is nonpaid.\\n And the part which is nonpaid is another 55% of those 55%. So that\\'s the basis to which you should apply the discount. And then the duration of those claims is around 4 years. So with that, I think between the rates, the duration and the basis you have everything that you need to approximate the discount impact on any given year. To be clear, that\\'s my rule of thumb. It\\'s not the precise calculations, but that\\'s reasonable enough. And on CSM release, the -- as we said, what is stable and growing, obviously, is the amount of the CSM release.\\n And that\\'s because it\\'s done on a real-world basis. So if you have a higher stock of CSM, then probably the release ratio will be lower and if you have a lower stock, then the release ratio would be higher. And what matters, obviously, is the new business contribution year after year. That\\'s what will drive in the end, the amount of CSM that you will be able to release. I hope I was clear on all those technical issues. \\nOperator: Next question is from William Hawkins from KBW. \\nAlban Nesle: William, we don\\'t hear you. \\nOperator: Maybe apparently William is having problems to get connected. \\nWilliam Hawkins: Sorry, can you hear me? \\nAlban Nesle: Yes, we can. \\nWilliam Hawkins: Apologies for connection. Can you just -- the 217% solvency ratio, what were the numerator and the denominator for that, please? And also within the roll forward, what\\'s the new [ margin ] behind the 0 percentage point from financial markets because I know the net is 0. I am a bit confused on what\\'s happening top and bottom. I think you already gave some... \\nOperator: William, we can\\'t hear you. \\nAlban Nesle: But I will -- I hope you can hear me, and I will answer the first question that we have heard on solvency. So the 217%, the denominator of EUR 27.4 billion, which is slightly above what it was in full year \\'22, EUR 27.2 billion and the numerator is EUR 59.6 billion. And I understand your other question was on the market impact, which was Zero overall.\\n So it\\'s minus 2% from interest rates, minus 2% from spreads net of VA, plus 2% from equity markets, plus 1% from implied volatility, plus 1% from ForEx, so 0 overall. I hope you could hear me. \\nOperator: Next question is from Henry Heathfield from Morningstar. \\nHenry Heathfield: Just going back actually to slightly on Farooq\\'s question on the discount rate and the unwind seems to have quite a big impact on your earnings in P&C. And so I was wondering if there is like a long-term rate that you might be using in kind of strategic planning, whether that has any bearing or impact or whether the change is just put through to adjust profitability somehow and no impact on long-term planning. \\n And then you mentioned as well that there\\'s a higher discounting impact on technical business, this with regard to the health business, first is discounting impact on the savings business. I was wondering if you just might be obviously illuminate me a little bit on that. And then finally, on capital generation, just on the nominal [ man ]. Would it be fair to assume a number of around EUR 6.5 billion annualized, give or take a couple of EUR 100 million? \\nAlban Nesle: So on the first one, the discount and the unwind, the way we think about it, the unwind will increase as we will pilot, so to speak, generations of different discount rates year after year. And given the trend in interest rates, that will increase. That being said, it should be offset by the increase in the investment income because we will also invest at higher investment income. \\n There is a specific effect in \\'23 that I mentioned quite a few times on private equity funds distribution, but that has nothing to do with the fact that our investment in fixed income also done at a higher rate year after year. On the discount impact, this is obviously a very sensitive assumption in our business. There will be some volatility. Now there is -- there are other aspects of the P&L. I\\'m thinking of PYDs, for which there can also be some volatility up or down. And so I don\\'t think that overall, we should have too much volatility in our earnings. And very clearly, our aim is to provide our shareholders with regularly growing earnings and cash generation. So that\\'s the philosophy of our strat planning. \\n On the technical margin -- on the technical margins versus savings. So on technical, the combined ratio that I have on health is independent from interest rates. And so for a given level of combined ratio that will be projected, the earnings will be discounted at a higher rate and therefore, will be worth less. Now when -- interest rates are higher for Savings business.\\n You know that the discount rate in a risk-neutral environment is the same as the investment rate. And therefore, what you have is a better yield, better theoretical yield on your assets with higher investment rates, which, in particular, means that the value of your options and guarantees goes down. And therefore, in many instances, for savings business, the higher interest rates will be -- will have a positive impact. So it\\'s more positive for savings than it is for protection and health. I hope it\\'s reasonably clear.\\n And your third question, sorry, I\\'m not sure I got it. \\nHenry Heathfield: Sorry. Just on the third question, I was wondering whether -- just on the capital generation, whether around a EUR 6.5 billion annualized -- normalized annualized figure, people will take a couple of EUR 100 million would be a decent ballpark number to be thinking about? \\nAlban Nesle: I think the best way to think about it is the 25 to 30 points of capital generation applied to our SCI. That\\'s the way to get to the right level. \\nOperator: Okay. Next question is from Michael Huttner from Berenberg. \\nMichael Huttner: On the -- you\\'re talking about pricing in France, I didn\\'t -- I\\'m looking at your press release. The figure, I see in personal lines is not 4%, it\\'s 1.9%. So I\\'m guessing I\\'m reading something wrong. Maybe you can explain the mix of your businesses in France and how that -- how you see that?\\n And the second is on the operating capital generation. So we\\'ve spoken a lot about that. So you\\'re kind of saying it\\'s now beginning to convert with earnings, which is I think what [ Jamie ] was saying, what you are saying maybe we\\'re getting close to EUR 7 billion and EUR 7.5 billion. But within that, I had a question. The feeling I have, and this was from the previous conference call today, is that in a period of rising interest rates, you do have -- because the discounting comes before the unwind of the discount, which interest rates were higher than last year. However, that you do have earnings which is slightly above the normal run rate. Would that -- is that roughly fair? Will that explain the difference between the underlying earnings and the operating capital generation?\\n And then the -- I had one silly question and one even silier question. So the silly question is the deals. I\\'m not sure if you can speak about that, but 217% sounds you\\'ve got plenty to look at such and I just wondered if you can give an update on what\\'s happening there? And then the final question, and here is really [ it\\'s the annual planning ] means that is a really simple company to understand that.\\n Thank you very much. And -- but does it mean that machines can do it. I was speaking with somebody and they said that the LSE has a program of building models automatically. And I was thinking \" Oh, that means that  I don\\'t really have a job anymore.\". How do you see that? \\nAlban Nesle: Okay. Thank you, Michael. On the first one, no, I understand your question on the reconciliation of numbers. The 4%, I mentioned is the number you mentioned on the price increase divided by the loss ratio. In other words, what it\\'s -- as if you dedicate the full amount of price increases in France to claims. And why do we do that? Simply because the expenses are addressed separately and we put a lot of pressure on expenses so that they do not increase with inflation. So that\\'s -- that approach is specific to France, not for the other countries. But that\\'s the reason why we say it\\'s the 4% price increase in France because that\\'s the part that goes to claims.\\n On the convergence with earnings, so there is a slight impact coming from the higher discount and that\\'s what I highlighted as well. So I agree with you. But the main impact in our greater capital generation comes from the fact that underlying earnings, notably on the P&C side, are extremely close now to solvency capital generation and they were not in the past because of that distortion coming from excess reserve release. On the 217%, I guess, you were alluding to some potential capital management initiatives on this as we said in February, the Board looks at our capital management, in particular, at share buybacks once a year. And so don\\'t expect another share buyback this year except the one to offset the dilution coming from our German Inforce transaction. And on the fourth one, I\\'m not completely sure what you meant. \\nMichael Huttner: It\\'s a really silly question, but we now have a really very simple framework. If I were a generalist, I would be selling lots of chocolates  on you. I mean, tons of chocolates. I know [indiscernible]  Because you really can build a model very, very simply now but it doesn\\'t mean that you don\\'t need analysts anymore. And I just wonder how -- this is a really silly question, but if you [ certainly ], just press buttons. \\nAlban Nesle: That\\'s your modestly speaking. I\\'m pretty sure that generalist, though we try to make it simpler and clearer will need your help to understand IFRS 17, the link with Solvency II and so on. You still have good days of work with your clients. \\nOperator: All right. Next question is from Andrew Crean from Autonomous Research. \\nAndrew Crean: In my age, I\\'m not as worried as Michael is that being supplanted by a machine, never mind. A few quick numerical questions then a slightly more fundamental question. So numerical questions, what was the rate decrease in North American professional lines? And secondly, in Euros, millions or billions, what was the impact of elevated fund distributions, both in the P&C and Life businesses last year? So did you get that right for this year. Thirdly, I just want to see, obviously, people\\'s Solvency II coverage ratios are going to go up. You obviously beat in the first quarter, and now you\\'re looking at higher levels of operating capital generation. Does that flow through to higher levels of cash remittances to group level so that we can then have a look at the amount of buyback, which is annually possible.\\n And finally, I\\'ll reiterate what Michael said. I think it\\'s fabulous. You\\'ve got this thing, the financial spent down to 23 pages. And one bit that I would like to see or a couple of bits I\\'d love to see is, one, a reconciliation between underlying earnings and operating capital generation by both, I understand what you said I just meant to get that you\\'re very much aligned on the P&C, will be good to have that. And secondly, whether or not you\\'re going to continue with net flows analysis. \\nAlban Nesle: Okay. Thank you, Andrew. So we don\\'t communicate on the rate decrease in North American professional. It\\'s -- how should I qualify it. It\\'s important, but not to the point that line is not profitable any longer or that overall, our pricing would not be above loss trend. And it was really very profitable in the past. So I don\\'t see that as an issue. On the fund distribution, I think what you should have in mind is a couple of EUR 100 million difference between \\'22 and \\'23.\\n On cash remittance, the -- obviously, the fact that on the P&C side, our earnings are made of best estimate PYDs, gives us comfort on the fact that the remittance can grow and you know that we said it will grow. So we have full confidence in this year to be at the upper end of the range we had given you, which was EUR 5 billion to EUR 6 billion cash remittance for \\'23. And we believe that it can grow further in the following years because we grow earnings because of what we\\'ve just said. And because, as you know, we are working on the couple of entities that were not yet at the right level of remittance. And Anu, do want to take the one on the reconciliation? \\nAnu Venkataraman: So Andrew, we will take on Board your suggestion to reconcile UE and OCG. But you will see that when you map our Solvency II capital generation and match it with UE, it should be very similar, but we will provide that.\\n On the net flow, we do provide Life & Savings net flows, were you thinking more account value roll forward? \\nAndrew Crean: No, I was just flicking through the supplement and couldn\\'t see the old reconciliation we used to have between start year and end year life reserves. \\nAnu Venkataraman: Yes. No, Yes, I think, but that\\'s actually a function of IFRS 17. We are in BFA and BBA contracts are sort of -- which cover both GA as well as UL reported through CSM. We\\'re showing the CSM roll forward, and we show PVFCF, but we are not showing the reserve roll forward. But we are giving your net flows on a quarterly basis in the activity indicators. \\nAlban Nesle: And a qualitative comment on the reconciliation between earnings and capital generation. I mean obviously, you would know that, Andrew. But just for the benefit of everyone, on the P&C side, it will be very close, as we said. On the Life side, the difference is the following. What creates solvency is new business and unwind of discount and additional investment income in excess of risk-free rate, whereas what creates earnings is the release of the CSM. It so happens, as you saw in our numbers, that they are reasonably similar, if not equal, so there is not a big difference. But there is a difference in the way a solvency is created versus earnings. \\nOperator: All right. Last question is from Dominic O\\'Mahony from BNP Exane. \\nDominic O\\'\\'mahony: Just two left, if that\\'s all right. So on the cap gen from this, is the end of the releases from the potential margin. Could you give us a sense of which geographies this effect is most pronounced? I\\'m trying to work out whether this is something that\\'s going on mainly in the Solvency II jurisdictions or for instance, in the Bermuda jurisdictions. And by implication, whether it actually has a tangible impact at the local level or whether this is really about the way the group reporting works. And then the second question is just on the duration gap. Just wondering why you\\'re closing it now? And I guess the context is that when I talk to folks about managing lapse risk, one of the things that I\\'ve been told is that you want to sort of structurally remain a bit short in order to sort of manage that risk. It sounds like that just isn\\'t a problem at the moment. But why closing the duration gap now given where we are on the rate curve? \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Dominic. On your first question, so if I understood it well, the difference between \\'22 and \\'23 come from the release of excess reserves or not. And we had no such excess reserves or almost in AXA XL. So effectively, it will be more the European entities for which there will be a difference in terms of capital generation coming from the better alignment between earnings and Solvency XL that will be very, very similar. On the duration gap, for us, there are two different things.\\n The first one is the duration gap as such, which is an ALM issue, and we thought that the level of rates that we reached in the first quarter was such that it would be interesting to take benefit of that and lengthen the duration of our assets. Overall, I believe that the neutral position that an insurance company should have is to have slightly longer assets than liabilities because that\\'s the one thing you would benefit from in case of market crash because you gain money on the interest rate side, while you will lose on equities and other assets.\\n So that\\'s my belief. And today, we\\'re not there yet, but we wanted to close further the duration gap. And then there is another aspect, which is liquidity and how you manage potential surrenders and lapses. So on this, we have a very strict liquidity framework. And the first source of liquidity is obviously the incoming premiums, the coupons, the maturities from your bonds. And that\\'s already a very significant source of liquidity. And then we take measures regularly to make sure that even in stress scenarios, we would have the ability to cater for additional surrenders or lapses without triggering capital losses. \\nOperator: Okay. We have one more question from Benoit Valleaux from ODDO. \\nBenoit Valleaux: One short question on my side on France and more specifically on your combined ratio. When I look at your Page 8 of your financial supplement,  you are adopting [ 105%] common ratio in \\'22 and IFRS 17. So there is a huge gap versus the 89% reported under IFRS 4. And when you take your reserve releases, it was a 6.5 percentage point last year. So I just wanted to understand why do you -- about it should grab you to change your best estimate last year in France. For example, and maybe linked to this, I know that you don\\'t provide any guidance in terms of combined ratio going forward. But do you see any reason why combined ratio in French should be higher than the combined ratio in Europe? \\nAlban Nesle: So thank you for your question. what do you see for France is what I described in one of the slides on IFRS 17, when I showed that overall, in \\'22, we released excess reserves and those excess reserves do not exist under IFRS 17. And that\\'s why at group level, we had a higher combined ratio, and that\\'s why you see it as well in France. \\n And when I combine that with a previous question on the fact that those excess reserves were not at XL, but mostly in Europe, it\\'s normal that France and some other European entities, may be more impacted. But again, it is a one-off in \\'22. We wanted to release PYDs from excess reserves in \\'22 because precisely did disappear under IFRS 17, and we will have PYDs in the future coming from best estimate liabilities and in the range of 0.5% to 2% for the whole group. On your second question on France versus Europe, France is one of our largest markets with very good profitability and there\\'s no reason far from it, why its combined ratio should be higher than others. Obviously, we want a good combined ratio, and we have it in France. \\nAnu Venkataraman: Operator, do we have any more questions? \\nOperator: No more questions on our side. \\nAnu Venkataraman: Okay, then I thank everyone for joining the call this morning. If you have any follow-ups, then don\\'t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Have a good day. \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you very much. Have a good day.',\n","  'transcript_split': [{'speaker': 'Anu Venkataraman',\n","    'text': \"Good morning, and welcome to AXA's First Quarter Analyst and Investor Call. In today's call, our Group CFO, Alban de Mailly Nesle, will cover 2 topics. In addition to commenting on the activity indicators for the first 3 months of '23, Alban will also review the highlights of 2022 financial information restated under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 that we also published this morning.  In order to enable you to better assess the group's earnings trajectory under the new accounting standards, we're also providing on an exceptional basis and underlying earnings target for '23. This outlook is unaudited and subject to several key assumptions. Please review the disclaimer slide of the presentation for important qualifying information. After the presentation, our Group Chief Accounting and Reporting Officer, Grégoire de Montchalin, will join Alban to take your questions.  And with that, let me hand over to Alban. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Many thanks, Anu, and good morning to all of you. Thank you for joining the call today. So as you see, it's slightly different from our usual quarterly calls. Because as Anu said, we will cover 2 topics to today. And therefore, we prepared a small presentation, and we will spend a bit more time so that you have enough time for your questions at the end of the call.  So let's start with Q1 2023. What are the key highlights of our results. First thing to say that we performed well in the third quarter, and the headline growth is 1%. But in fact, it masks a very strong growth in our technical lines and in particular, P&C, where we're off for a very good start in 2023. That was partly offset by the rightsizing of nonprioritized businesses and some weaker revenues in Unit-Linked Asset Management that reflects the more challenging environment.  When we look at our life and business -- Life & Health business, in particular, our priority is the quality of our business and the focus we have on capital-light products. And that's what we've seen in this quarter. And that's thanks to the very strong efforts of our distribution networks, in particular, the proprietary ones.   A word on balance sheet, but we'll come back to that later. You see that our solvency ratio stands at 217%, 2 points higher than at the end of '22. And that's supported notably by a very strong normalized capital generation of 7 points this quarter. And there again, I will come back to that later.  We have, as shown on the slide, all confidence on our asset mix, which is a high quality, which is what you want in this volatile and uncertain times. As Anu said, we are giving exceptionally guidance for the underlying earnings of this year. We believe they will be above EUR 7.5 billion under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, which is obviously our new framework, but I'll come back to that in the second part of this presentation.  So moving to the next slide and looking at our growth momentum. Again, I think the important message is that we are growing where we want to grow. So we're growing in P&C at 6%. First, Commercial lines. Commercial lines, we grew at 7%. On the insurance side, we see that XL had a good growth of 4%. We have clear signs of pricing reacceleration across the portfolio except for North America Professional lines. When you look at our renewal prices at XL Insurance, excluding North America Professional lines, we are up 8%. So that's better than the end of last year.  On Personal lines, there again, we have good growth at 4% with a specific focus on Motor with plus 6%. That's obviously due to the pricing efforts that we make to offset the inflation on claims cost. And non-Motor is up 2%. So both reflect there, again, an improving environment.  On Health, so Health, that we canceled or not renewed 2 large contracts that we had written at AXA France and for which the experience was not in line with our expectations. If you exclude those 2 contracts, we have good organic growth at plus 7% and both individual and group health and in all our geographies.  And finally, Protection, which is also one of the technical lines that we want to grow is up 2%. Notably, thanks to Japan and Switzerland. So that's on the technical lines. And you see that we are growing on those front in line with our strategy.  Now coming to Savings. You know that our focus for Savings is Unit-Linked and capital light G/A, and in particular, G/A at maturity. So we -- our revenues on the Unit-Linked were suddenly a bit lower than expected in the fourth quarter, mainly due to, again, the volatile environment. But what we want to highlight here is the fact that we want to work on those 2 legs, Unit-Linked on the one hand and products with guarantee at maturity such as [indiscernible] that we have in France. And when you look at the French business, in particular, you see that the net of those 2 is a positive, plus 5% because in times where it's more difficult to sell Unit-Linked, customers are happy to have products that give guarantees that maturity while allowing them to invest in slightly more risky assets than traditional general account.  So last point I want to highlight is the businesses that we don't prioritize, XL Re, you know that we are reducing our property CAT exposure. In volumes, that's minus 35% exposure. That's offset partially by price increases. They were strong in Q1 in property CAT reinsurance. But we also had good growth in other lines at XL Re, notably casualty, mostly coming from prices. And the other one, as I said, is traditional general account savings capital heavy. To the same extent, we do in-force transactions, like the German Bund, that you are very familiar with. We are not unhappy to see that our net flows in traditional G/A savings is negative.  So all this leads to a very good high-quality mix for Q1, focus on our technical lines and obviously very consistent with strategy, and we want to carry on growing on that basis.  So if we move to the next slide on pricing, which obviously is an important topic these days. What do we see? As I said, for XL, both insurance and Reinsurance, we see good pricing dynamic. The price increases on renewal, as I said, 6%, but 8% excluding North America Professional lines. And we do see reacceleration in most lines. Property is up 9%. Casualty is up 9%. Property in the U.S. is up 18%. So that's very good numbers.  We showed the good dynamic that we have at XL Insurance and the same on Reinsurance, but that was expected, and we discussed that already in February.  In Commercial lines, excluding AXA XL, so you saw in the previous slide that we had a 7% growth overall in France and Europe. And that mostly comes from pricing at plus 5%. Keep in mind that in Q1, the weight of Switzerland is higher than for the whole year because notably on Commercial lines, contracts are renewed at 1/1. And you know that in Switzerland, there is very low inflation, if any, and therefore, hardly any price increases.  So that's somewhat underestimates the overall price increases that we see. Same on Personal lines. You see 5% here. In fact, excluding Switzerland, we are at 7% overall. And again, and I'm sure you will have questions on this. Again, that is sufficient or more than sufficient to offset claims inflation. So you see that be it Commercial lines, all Personal lines and in whatever geographies, we managed to have price increases over and above inflation, which is obviously supportive for our technical margins.  Let's move to the next slide. So this is our presentation of new business with PVEP and NBV. Obviously, with the changes in interest rates, there is a strong impact coming from interest rates in the minus 17% that you have, for instance, on PVEP. So it's -- it doesn't -- and the same on NBV was minus 11%. What matters for us here is that the NBV margin, which once again shows the quality of our business is up by 0.4 point at 5.6%. The fact that we decreased our PVEP or NBV because of interest rates It's not an issue because what it means, notably when it comes to new business, CSM, is that the unwind of that in the CSM will be done at a higher rate and therefore, it's positive.  And you will also have in mind, obviously, that when it comes to our Strategic lines, which are Protection & Health, the impact of higher interest rates is obviously higher than for traditional general account. That's why there again, the impact on our PVEP can look significant at minus 17%, but nothing to be concerned with.  If we move now to our Solvency II ratio, so as I said at the beginning, it's plus 2 points compared to the end of last year. That's on the basis of several positive items. The first one is the operating return. But the operating return is 7 points, and that's better than what we had in the past. And we believe that's a recurring change, which leads us to change our guidance. We believe that this year, in particular, our normalized capital generation should be between 25 and 30 points. And this is due to the fact that in P&C earnings, part of our earnings in the past was made of the release of excess reserves. Those excess reserves were already in our Solvency II capital base, and therefore, the release did not generate more solvency.  Now under IFRS 17, our P&C earnings are made of PYDs coming from mid of current year profitability, obviously, but also PYDs coming from our best estimate liabilities. And therefore, they directly go entirely to solvency creation. So that's the first point.  The second point is the fact that we have higher interest rates also means that we have a higher discount and therefore, a better combined ratio and profitability, which there again enhances our solvency capital generation.  And the last item that explains that 7 points capital generation is purely mechanical. Last year, notably thanks to higher interest rates our SCR went down, and therefore, there is a pure denominator impact in our capital generation. So the message is good capital generation overall and better alignment between Solvency II earnings and IFRS 17 earnings, so to speak.  On the other impacts that you see on the screen, accrued dividend minus 4%. That's simply last year's dividend divided by 4, as we usually do. No impact from market overall. Obviously, there were some pluses and minuses, minuses in the -- on the interest rates, but pluses in equity and volatility, net is 0. Management actions, I want to spend 1 minute on this, so it's very positive, 5 points.  We took advantage of higher interest rates in this first quarter to further reduce our duration gap. By further reducing it, we reduced our SCR, but -- and therefore, improve our solvency. But we also reduced a bit the sensitivity of our solvency to interest rates. And so that's positive also for the future.  And last, minus 6 points from regulatory and model changes, you had in mind what we had discussed in February and last year, the minus 9 points that we're losing from IBOR transition and the change to EIOPA reference portfolio, that was partly offset by some other model changes. So that's how we come to minus 6 and the 217% that we have here.  So overall, when I look at Q1, we see high-quality revenue mix. We see a very good pricing momentum, notably in P&C. And good business profile overall in the current and certain macroeconomic context and a strong balance sheet in addition to that. So that's why we are confident in our ability this year to produce attractive results and that's -- I'm going to give details on in a second as we move to IFRS 17.  If you allow me one second to have a bit of water. So let's move to IFRS 17. And one of the main messages that we want to give here, as I said, I think in February is, what matters for us is full year '22 under IFRS 4. Don't look too long at full year '22 under IFRS 17 because there are a number of elements that distort this number. And that's why we wanted to give you, again, exceptionally that guidance for 2023. So that we would all have in mind the same profit expectations for this year.\"},\n","   {'speaker': ' So what do we say on these lines? We simply reiterate the messages that Grégoire and I gave you last November, which are the following',\n","    'text': \"one, the fact that our earnings power under IFRS 17 is not different from the one that we had under IFRS 4. And that's why we have that guidance of EUR 7.5 billion, which is net of the FX headwind of minus EUR 0.1 billion, coming obviously from the weakness of the U.S. dollar. So EUR 7.6 billion, if you adjust for that and therefore, 5% growth over the IFRS 4 numbers. So that's an important message.  And as we saw with the numbers we just discussed on solvency, our accounting change does not have any bearing on our solvency. You saw that we are 217% in Q1. No will that accounting change have any consequence on the cash remitted by our entities. And that's why overall, with that guidance, we are happy to reaffirm once more, the fact that we will meet our key financial targets of this plan, and we will exceed the UEPS CAGR target of 7% that we had given ourselves and the cash remittance target of EUR 14 billion that we had also set ourselves. So no news on this, but we are reaffirming that.  So now let's move to the next slide with a bit more detail on that guidance. And again, I will give even further details as we move to P&C, Life & Health in the coming slides. So the underlying earnings this year should be above EUR 7.5 billion. Again, net of the EUR 0.1 billion FX headwind, which is mostly P&C. The EUR 4.7 billion target on -- for P&C is with obviously normalized nat cat. You know that our CAT load is 4 points of combined ratio. So that guidance is based with -- on this assumption.  And overall, it comes with improved technical results compared to '22, and we'll go into more details. But lower financial results and notably because of higher unwind on the P&C side.  Life & Health, and I insist that it's Life & Health and not Life & Savings because there could be some confusion. And here, we tend to report Life & Health together. It's EUR 3.3 billion. It should be EUR 3.3 billion this year, slightly above what we had under IFRS 4 in '22.  Asset Management and others, a slight deterioration by minus 100 million coming from higher interest rate expenses at holdco level and also the fact that we will have lower revenues in Asset Management. Simply, as you saw, because we had a slightly lower average assets under management in Q1. So that's what I wanted to say on this slide.  Now let's look at more details on '22. So on the left-hand side of this slide, you have our combined ratio, the actual combined ratio in IFRS 4 and in IFRS 17. So you will recognize the 94.6% combined ratio under IFRS 4.  Under IFRS 17, in '22, and you have a one-off impact, which is the following. You see that we had PYDs of minus 2.9% under IFRS 4, but these PYDs were made of the release of excess reserves. And you know because we discussed that in the past, that it was on purpose because those excess reserves disappear with IFRS 17. And so we wanted to create those PYDs out of those excess reserves. And so you have them under IFRS 4. You don't have them under IFRS 17 precisely because you don't have excess reserves, I mean, official excess reserves under IFRS 17. And when you just remove the EUR 2.1 billion of excess reserve release that we had, you move from minus 2.9% to plus 1.7%. So that's very specific to 2022. That's not something that will happen again in the future, and I insist on this because, again, we don't have those excess reserves any longer in IFRS 17, and there will not be that distortion anymore.  That's why we wanted to provide you with what would be a normalized combined ratio in '22. And there, we normalize for 2 things. We normalize for nat cat, which, as I say, should be around 4 points of combined ratio, and we normalize for PYDs. So on this, our new guidance for PYD is that we've said in the past that it would be in line with long-term experience, now we are a bit more precise. And we're saying they should be between 0.5 points of combined ratio and 2 points of combined ratio.  So for illustrative purposes and illustrative purposes only here, we put 1.25% of combined ratio, which is simply the midpoint of that range. And you see that with that normalization of nat cat, the loss ratio that you know, the discount that you now have under IFRS 17 and the PYDs, the comparable combined ratio for -- under IFRS 17 for '22, would have been 93.7%.  I draw your attention to the fact that we have only normalized nat cat and PYDs. We didn't normalize anything. For instance, the Ukraine loss is still in that number. So that's for the technical part.\"},\n","   {'speaker': ' On the investment income part -- sorry, the financial result. The financial result is made of 2 components',\n","    'text': \"one, the investment income, which is very much in line under IFRS 17 with what it was under IFRS 4, but there is a certain component, which is the unwind of discount. And that unwind cost us in '22, EUR 500 million of earnings pretax.  So our financial results under IFRS 17 in '22 is lower by EUR 400 million than where it was under IFRS 4. So the global picture, which is true in '22 and which will be true in the future, is that you have obviously a better combined ratio under IFRS 17, but you will have a lower financial result because of the mechanics that we have just seen.  Now if we move to the next slide, so that's where we go into the reasons where we believe that our P&C earnings in '23 should be at least equal to EUR 4.7 billion. So we -- first, we believe we'll see an improvement in our technical result. You saw the numbers for Q1 in terms of pricing. And the -- this is supportive for our technical results and our loss ratio.  Second point nat cat load of around 4 points, so less than what we had under IFRS 4 in '22. Obviously, this is an assumption, but you may have seen in our press release that to date, our CAT experience is in line with expectations.  Third, assumption underlying that number is, as I said, the fact that PYD release should be within the range of 0.5 to 2 points.  Fourth, hopefully, we -- I mean, we had the loss coming from the Ukraine war last year. And hopefully, we will not have a similar loss in '23.  And finally, the discounting of current year claims reserves at a higher rate in '23 than in '22. So that will support our technical result. Conversely, as far as the financial result, is concerned. The unwind of the reserve discount will be higher in '23 than it was in '22, simply because we accumulate reserves and -- discounted reserves at a higher rate year after year. So the unwind is by construction higher.  There is a second effect, which has nothing to do with accounting, which is simply that last year, we had an elevated level of funds distribution, notably private equity and in '23, that amount will be lower. And all in all, as I said EUR 4.7 billion.  Now moving to Life on the next slide. So this is the 2022 earnings. As you could -- as you know, our Life & Health earnings are mostly driven by CSM release. You see that out of EUR 2.9 billion of earnings that we had in '22, EUR 2.5 billion come from the CSM release.  In addition to that, we have slightly negative long-term technical results. What you -- what will you find there? It's the fact that it's mostly the experience, and it's also the nonattributable expenses. In '22 we had a positive experience variance, which reflected our prudent approach to reserving. We think that it will be -- that's why it came as an offset to the nonattributable expenses at minus EUR 0.1 billion.  Short-term technical results in Life, that's mostly our protection business in France, which is accounted for under PAA and not VFA. That's why it comes here as short-term technical result. And you add to that the non-VFA financial result, which is there, again, the investment income that we have minus the unwind of the discount on nonparticipating business.  And there, in '22, like in P&C, we had -- we have benefited from a high level of fund distribution, and therefore, the -- our investment income in '22 is higher -- was higher than what we can expect in '23. And so overall, we have EUR 2.9 billion of underlying earnings in '22 as opposed to EUR 2.6 billion in IFRS 4. As you know, the mechanics are different, so we can compare the numbers, but we cannot really compare the various components. But what you should have in mind is that there is no accounting distortion on the Life side as opposed to what we saw on the P&C side. But our Life earnings were probably at a high level, given some positive one-offs that we had on the actuarial side and the fund distribution that we also enjoyed in '22.  Moving to the next slide on the stock of CSM. So here, I think the important part is what is in the box and what we call recurring items. The way to think about CSM and CSM release and new business CSM is the following. New business CSM is built on a risk-neutral basis. So it will come and increase the stock of CSM. But in addition to that, year after year, you will also have the unwind of the stock of CSM at the risk-free rate plus the fact that you have investment income in excess of that risk free rate. And that comes from risk premium on the equity side that comes from spread on bonds and so on and so forth. So that's a natural component of the CSM increase.  And then you have the CSM release. And you see that when you take those 3 elements, we are neutral. The first 2 offsetting the third one, which, as you know, is released on a real-world basis, and that's why the new business CSM and the CSM release are not directly comparable. You need to add in addition to that, the unwind and the excess investment income. Then if I move to the other components, you -- we had some economic variance which was down -- which was minus EUR 0.6 billion in '22. This is the same economic variance that we saw last year in our solvency. So nothing new on this. And there again, it's quite comforting to see that solvency and accounting are more aligned than before. So you know that we last year benefited from higher interest rates, but we also had higher volatility, lower equity and so net-net, it was a negative, but there again, very much in line with our solvency.  And we had a positive operating variance of EUR 1.3 billion, and that's mainly coming from one-off model changes. So that's the dynamic of our stock of CSM in '22. And in total, it increased from EUR 24.6 million to EUR 25.5 billion.  Now if we move to the next slide on Health. So that's very much the same mechanic as the one we had for Life, so I will be shorter. There again, our Health profits come mainly from CSM release. The only thing I want to comment here in addition to that is the fact that the long-term technical experience, which you see here as a negative, that's the COVID claims that we had in Japan last year that we told you about. That's something that should not repeat in '23.  And the short-term technical results, so that's EUR 0.2 billion. That comes from our Health businesses that are short tail, such as, for instance, the U.K. And last year, it was impacted from those 2 famous international contracts that we had in France and that we did not renew and that had a negative impact on our Health earnings in '22. But overall, underlying earnings on the Health side, very much in line with what we had under IFRS 4.  So on the next slide, if I do the same exercise of going through the CSM stock on the Health side, the same box. We have the new business, CSM, we have the underlying return earning source. We have the CSM release. You see that on a net basis, that's very balanced.  And the new business, CSM and the underlying return offsets the CSM release. Economic variance. So here, it's more negative than on the Life side, and that's completely normal. Health is, first and foremost, a technical margin business as opposed to a financial margin one. And so as you discount at a higher rate, those technical margins in the future, that will have more significant consequence for Health business than for Savings business. That's why you have a minus EUR 1 billion here.  But there again, it's not bad news as such. It's like the comment I made earlier on our PVEP and new business this year as it just means that the unwind will be done at a higher rate in the future. And you know that be it for Life or Health, the message we gave you in November is that the amount of CSM release should be very stable even if we have some ups and downs in the stock of CSM.  So moving now to the 2023 target that we have for Life & Health, that it's a slight increase, EUR 3.3 billion compared to EUR 3.2 billion under IFRS 4. Again, we have a lot of visibility on those 2 businesses, thanks to the CSM mechanism. And so we have a good view on the CSM release.  We -- in addition to that, we will not have the health claims that we had last year in Japan and France, but we also had some positive model changes in Japan on the Life side last year. That will not review themselves in '23.  And on the financial results, exactly like in P&C, we will have an unwind of our reserve discount, which will be done at a higher rate, and we will not have the same level of funds distribution. So same mechanism, same impact as on the P&C side, good level of technical results, driven by CSM for Life & Health, but lower financial results for the reasons I explained.  Quick word on net income. So I will not comment the impacts directly related to the lower underlying earnings. You know that we took the options as far as equities are concerned, not to have the volatility of equity in our P&L. And it will be booked through shareholders' equity. But it doesn't mean that capital gains on equities disappear. They simply go directly to retained earnings without going to P&L. And when I comment our realized gains on equities and our shareholders' equity in a few seconds, you will recognize that amount. So no equity capital gains in an IFRS 17 P&L. So what will you see in the future? You will see capital gains coming mostly from real estate.  We could have occasionally capital gains and losses coming from fixed income, but you know that it's not a practice to realize fixed income gains and losses simply because of ALM constraints. So that's the main impact. The last one on the other is simply because it comes from assets that were no longer eligible for mark-to-market in OCI and that go to P&L.  A word on shareholders' equity. So you have side by side, the movement in shareholders' equity under IFRS 17 and under IFRS 4, the main difference and by far, is naturally the change in OCI. That was minus EUR 27 billion under IFRS 4 because of higher interest rates mainly. You see that it's only minus EUR 5.4 billion under IFRS 17, simply because most of the changes that we had on the asset side because of interest rates, was offset by the same impact of interest rates on the liability side under IFRS 17.\"},\n","   {'speaker': \" And so you see that our OCI and therefore, more globally, our shareholders' equity is much more stable under IFRS 17 than it was under IFRS 4. The other 2 differences\",\n","    'text': \"one, the realized gains on equities, what I've mentioned a second ago that you see here now directly in retained earnings.  And the other one is the change in pension benefits. It's simply because part of the positive impact that we had under IFRS 4 was already taken into account in our opening balance sheet at [ 11, '22 ] and therefore, did not go to the change in shareholders' fund in IFRS 17. That's the overall impact, but you see that  in total, our shareholders' equity at the end of '22 was very similar to what it was under IFRS 4.  And as a conclusion before we go to your questions, so you see that bit on the P&C side or on the Life side, we are very confident in 2023 underlying earnings target. That is thanks to -- well, first, the quality of our business, the fact that it's extremely resilient in this environment. The fact that we have good pricing dynamic in the first quarter.  And finally, on Life & Health, the fact that we have good visibility on the CSM. Shareholders' equity, as I said, broadly stable versus IFRS 4. And I reiterate the fact that I think you all know this, that those accounting changes have absolutely no bearing on our cash remittance and our Solvency II ratio.

We will exceed too that concern, the UEPS CAGR and the cumulative cash remittance.

'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Sinclair',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, and everyone, and thanks for the new disclosure of the new financial disclosure supplement is really good. For me, please, first, I just wanted to understand a little bit more about account  budgets for the year. I know it's 4 percentage points at group level. But what's the budget for XL for the year for nat cats? And at both XL and Group level. How much seasonality should I think about when you're saying you're in line with expectations for Q1? That's my first question. Second, I was just looking at the discounting impact on the combined ratio in 2022. When I was going through the [ CAT ]  quickly this morning, it looks like you're getting about double the discounting benefit in France compared to broader Europe, 3.6 percentage points compared to 1.9. What's the driver of that? And similarly, why did XL get less discounting benefits, say, than France? I might have thought XL might be a bit longer to tail and maybe get more U.S.-focused higher yields than elsewhere. So just keen to understand that. And third was just on capital. The reduced duration gap, you mentioned some lower sensitivities. Just wondered if you can put any numbers around that, how they would look today? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"So thank you, Andrew, for your questions. The -- generally, the way to think about our CAT load is to say that P&C in France, in Europe and XL Insurance, that's roughly the same cat load, around 0.6%, 3.6%, 4.7%. And the difference is made with XL Re, which, by definition, has a higher CAT load given the nature of the business. And that's how you get to the 4% overall.   On the discounting impact, so when you compare France and Europe, bear in mind that in Europe, you have Switzerland. And Switzerland obviously has lower interest rates and therefore, the discount and the unwind is made at a lower level. And on the XL -- one second -- yes. So on the XL's rate for that, you should -- have in mind that XL is a business which is more heavily reinsured than the rest of our P&C business.   And therefore, the unwind applied to lower reserves and therefore, as such, is lower than what you would see typically in France and Europe. And on your last point on the reduced duration gap. So the sad thing is that we have not put it officially in our Q1 numbers, I can't disclose it. I don't want to risk a selective disclosure here. So it is a reduction. It's not massive, but it goes in the right direction. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Sinclair',\n","    'text': \"The first question I get it but -- just to confirm, what is the CAT budget and percentage points for XL for the full year? Is that -- that's more than 4 percentage points that you have at a group level. And just seasonality, I mean, should we be thinking we're around about that 3.6% points for most of the units and 4%  points overall for Q1 or is it a bit less because of that seasonality? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"So I don't have the number for XL in total because that's not the way I think about it. Again, I think about it as insurance versus reinsurance. That's why I gave you the 3.6%, 3.7% for XL insurance from which you can deduct by having the sum and the fact that it's 4% for the whole group, what it is for XL Re. And in terms of seasonality, obviously, you have probably given our portfolio, a higher level of CAT losses in Q3 because of hurricanes in the U.S. Now you saw that in Q1, we had a significant earthquake in Turkey.  And despite that, and there is obviously no seasonality on for earthquakes, despite that, we had a good quarter. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Next question is from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Peter Eliot',\n","    'text': \"First one, just to follow up actually on that duration gap. I mean given you said the sensitivities hadn't come down massively, I'm just -- suggest there's more you can do there. So I'm just wondering if you could comment on that. And sorry if I missed it, but are you able to tell us what the duration gap is at this stage? Second one on capital management. I'm just wondering if you can share your latest thoughts on capital management.  And I'm thinking there the lower SCR gives you opportunities especially going forward? Or whether you've updated your thoughts on the appropriate debt gearing at all. And maybe on that one, any thoughts -- any discussions you've had with the ratings agencies as to how they will think about their definition might be helpful. And then finally, likewise from me as well, thank you very much for the concise and clear financial supplement. I think I'm right that you've given us analysis by line of business and by geography, but not the sort of the granular detail of P&C lines of business.  So for example, I don't think we have French commercial, so it's great to have a concise and reduce things up, but I guess the downside is that it makes it difficult to build a bottom-up model that simultaneously forecast both line of business and geography. So I guess the question is there, can we assume maybe that going forward, your focus might be a bit more on liner business? So we maybe don't have to worry so much about forecasting geography. Just any thoughts or help you give there would be helpful. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Okay. Thank you very much for your questions, Peter. So on the duration gap, it was 0.5% at the end of last year, it's 0.3% now. But what you should have in mind is the way we think about duration gap is the economic one between our assets and liabilities. What we don't hedge, what we don't take into account in that duration gap is the management of the risk margin or the fact that some of our SCR and parts of our SCR are sensitive to interest rates. And so because we want to have an economic hedging of our interest rate risk, we don't take the risk margin. Therefore, even with such a low duration gap like 0.3%, you still have a sensitivity coming from the variation of the risk margin in our solvency or that if our SCR.  I hope that explains the difference, which also means by the word that, at some point, we could move to a duration gap where assets would be longer than liabilities, which is not the case today, which, to some extent, would cover also the sensitivities that I just mentioned from risk margin. But today, our assets are slightly shorter than our liabilities.   So on capital management -- and I'll start with debt gearing. On that one, you saw the range that we gave. That's until the end of the year. In early next year, we will give you our next plan. I don't think the debt gearing should change as a target, but we will give you more on this next year. I think we're comfortable with the level of gearing that we have today. On the lower SCR, I'm not sure exactly what your question was. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Peter Eliot',\n","    'text': \"No. It's just whether that gives you more flexibility and maybe where the scope for it to reduce it a further in the future. I guess it was an open question, but just if there was anything you could add, then they will not be. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"I mean not really. I think the lower SCR is the combination of the fact that, as I said, we had lower interest rates and the fact that our growth in our technical lines does not necessitate more capital and also because we reduced our SCR by reducing our exposure to capital light G/A account. So that's the dynamic at stake. On rating agencies, it's a discussion which is taking place because they are adapting their models to the new accounting framework and that has not yet -- this is not yet finalized. And finally on the detail, effectively, we wanted to give you clarity on quite a few numbers, but we will not go into the details of, say, commercial lines in France or personal line in Germany, we will not do that. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Next question is from Will Hardcastle from UBS. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'William Hardcastle',\n","    'text': \"The first one is just whether you can update on lapsed experience in the quarter, any geographies or distribution channels? Any comments there would be helpful. Second one, look, there's a fair bit of distortion on that P&C pricing from the mix. You mentioned pricing is generally ahead of inflation when we're talking about Personal Motor. Is there any geographies where this isn't the case or where it's not being passed through by the market? And any update you can say on inflationary trends and whether they're sort of remaining stubbornly high or easing in any geographies quicker than others? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you. So the lapsed experience, the general answer is no change to our lapsed experience, but for two small pockets, one that's in France some corporate business that we have. So it's not corporate pension, to be clear. It is the fact that in the past, we used to have some corporates generally family holding companies that would simply invest their cash into insurance policies.  And so they are pretty sensitive to the interest rate that we can offer and as they can find better rates elsewhere, there were higher lapses there. But it's a small business and the remaining reserves on this are EUR 3 billion. So you see that it's not an issue. The other place where you had higher lapse rates that was in Italy, in some of the business coming from BMPS for somewhat identical reasons. In other words, the customers of BMPS, like of other banks are offered Italian government bonds that have a yield higher than what we can offer. And there again, you saw some increase, but nothing alarming. And at the end of the day, it's a rather small business for us.   In general, we don't see, as I said, an increase and that's mainly for two reasons. One is the focus that we've had over the years is on long-term business for our customers. They are saving for their pension generally. And therefore, their insurance policy is not like a bank deposit, and they would not move every time there is up and down on the interest rate. And very often, they also have a unit-linked policy with that.  And the second aspect is that most of our business is done through preparatory distribution. When I look at France, for instance, 80% of it comes from proprietary distribution. And there, we are able to give advice to our customers and they see the value of that advice. They see the value of having an insurance policy, notably with tax benefits and so on. But that's why we haven't seen changes in our business. Now in P&C pricing, so the first part of the answer, which is simple, is that everywhere we have seen price increases that were sufficient to offset or more than offset inflation. The only exception to that is North America professional lines where there, there is a significant competition and prices are down.  That being said, the line is still very profitable even with that kind of price pressure. So let me now take you through something I also gave you in the other times we talked about inflation, which is a comparison between the claims inflation that we had in Motor and the pricing measures that we have taken.  So what you see in Q1 '23 is claims inflation growth of any element, any actions we take to offset it, which is around 7%. It's 7% in France. It's probably 6% in Germany. It's 8% in the U.K. In Switzerland, it's less than 2%. But if I take the example of France, so you have that clear installation of 7%. As I told you the other times, we take some measures like procurement, orientation and so on, which allow us to reduce the cost of that inflation by 2% points. So we're left with 5%. Frequency in France is relatively neutral. It is a headwind in Germany. It's a tailwind in Belgium. But overall, in Europe, it's neutral.  But coming back to France, you have those 5% points of claims inflation. You have minus 1% point coming from business mix. And then are price increases that represent 4% points. So all in all, we maintain our margin in France. I gave you France, the same is true for Germany, for Switzerland, for Belgium. The -- obviously, the country which is remarkable is the U.K. for many reasons. But on that one, because price increases are very high.  We're talking about north of 25% year-on-year, which means that today, I believe our -- the business that we write today is profitable on an underwriting basis which was not the case last year. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'William Hardcastle',\n","    'text': \"Thanks Alban, very helpful. I'll say as a compliment that we're remarkable. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Okay, next question is from Farooq Hanif from JPMorgan. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Farooq Hanif',\n","    'text': \"Firstly, going back to operational capital generation. So you've talked about how there are various impacts that have raised you to 25 to 30 points, one of which is the SCR, but the others are obviously kind of own funds related. So can I just confirm that what you're saying is that your operational capital generation in nominal terms in euro amount is actually also increasing. But could you just talk about that? Second point is, again, going back to the comment you just made to Will on pricing with inflation. I mean, you gave the impact of France is broadly neutral. Do you think your combined ratio overall at the group level is going to expand in '23 and '24 due to pricing versus inflation. So do you see a positive margin impact in 2023? And then two very quick questions, really sorry. But the discount rate effect in P&C, how sensitive is that in '23, we've seen yields come down. How should we think about that? And lastly, the CSM release is 9%. So it's the lower end of your range. Should we also think that there's upside there going forward? How does that work? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Farooq. So operational capital generation. So yes, in nominal terms, there is an increase. I think if we say that we are at 25 points over the year, that's -- which is the low end of our range, that's 5 to 6 points above the previous range.  And I would say 1 to 2 points comes from the fact that the SCI is lower and the rest comes from the simple fact that we generate more capital in absolute terms. On the combined room.  So as I said when I talked about the guidance, I think the pricing environment is supportive. And so overall, I believe that, yes, there is room for improvement in our combined ratio. I'm talking undiscounted combined ratio, everything else being equal, and leaving aside obviously, CAT volatility and so on, so yes, I think it is supportive.  Third, on the discount rate impact, so I'll give you two things. The first thing is the fact that we use rates on a quarterly basis in one quarter in advance, i.e., at the end of December of any given year, you will know the rate at which we will discount Q1 and so you have those rates in our documents that we gave you for Q1 and Q2. So that already gives you half of the year for -- as far as discount is concerned. Then I will give you my own rule of thumb on how I approximate discount. Fundamentally, so the discount applies to the net claims of the year.  So if you start with a hundred of premiums, you have 55% of net claims at AXA in P&C. And the discount applies to the part, which is nonpaid.  And the part which is nonpaid is another 55% of those 55%. So that's the basis to which you should apply the discount. And then the duration of those claims is around 4 years. So with that, I think between the rates, the duration and the basis you have everything that you need to approximate the discount impact on any given year. To be clear, that's my rule of thumb. It's not the precise calculations, but that's reasonable enough. And on CSM release, the -- as we said, what is stable and growing, obviously, is the amount of the CSM release.  And that's because it's done on a real-world basis. So if you have a higher stock of CSM, then probably the release ratio will be lower and if you have a lower stock, then the release ratio would be higher. And what matters, obviously, is the new business contribution year after year. That's what will drive in the end, the amount of CSM that you will be able to release. I hope I was clear on all those technical issues. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Next question is from William Hawkins from KBW.

And so I was wondering if there is like a long-term rate that you might be using in kind of strategic planning, whether that has any bearing or impact or whether the change is just put through to adjust profitability somehow and no impact on long-term planning.   And then you mentioned as well that there's a higher discounting impact on technical business, this with regard to the health business, first is discounting impact on the savings business. I was wondering if you just might be obviously illuminate me a little bit on that. And then finally, on capital generation, just on the nominal [ man ]. Would it be fair to assume a number of around EUR 6.5 billion annualized, give or take a couple of EUR 100 million? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"So on the first one, the discount and the unwind, the way we think about it, the unwind will increase as we will pilot, so to speak, generations of different discount rates year after year. And given the trend in interest rates, that will increase. That being said, it should be offset by the increase in the investment income because we will also invest at higher investment income.   There is a specific effect in '23 that I mentioned quite a few times on private equity funds distribution, but that has nothing to do with the fact that our investment in fixed income also done at a higher rate year after year. On the discount impact, this is obviously a very sensitive assumption in our business. There will be some volatility. Now there is -- there are other aspects of the P&L. I'm thinking of PYDs, for which there can also be some volatility up or down. And so I don't think that overall, we should have too much volatility in our earnings. And very clearly, our aim is to provide our shareholders with regularly growing earnings and cash generation. So that's the philosophy of our strat planning.   On the technical margin -- on the technical margins versus savings. So on technical, the combined ratio that I have on health is independent from interest rates. And so for a given level of combined ratio that will be projected, the earnings will be discounted at a higher rate and therefore, will be worth less. Now when -- interest rates are higher for Savings business.  You know that the discount rate in a risk-neutral environment is the same as the investment rate. And therefore, what you have is a better yield, better theoretical yield on your assets with higher investment rates, which, in particular, means that the value of your options and guarantees goes down. And therefore, in many instances, for savings business, the higher interest rates will be -- will have a positive impact. So it's more positive for savings than it is for protection and health.

'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Michael Huttner',\n","    'text': 'On the -- you\\'re talking about pricing in France, I didn\\'t -- I\\'m looking at your press release. The figure, I see in personal lines is not 4%, it\\'s 1.9%. So I\\'m guessing I\\'m reading something wrong. Maybe you can explain the mix of your businesses in France and how that -- how you see that?  And the second is on the operating capital generation. So we\\'ve spoken a lot about that. So you\\'re kind of saying it\\'s now beginning to convert with earnings, which is I think what [ Jamie ] was saying, what you are saying maybe we\\'re getting close to EUR 7 billion and EUR 7.5 billion. But within that, I had a question. The feeling I have, and this was from the previous conference call today, is that in a period of rising interest rates, you do have -- because the discounting comes before the unwind of the discount, which interest rates were higher than last year. However, that you do have earnings which is slightly above the normal run rate. Would that -- is that roughly fair? Will that explain the difference between the underlying earnings and the operating capital generation?  And then the -- I had one silly question and one even silier question. So the silly question is the deals. I\\'m not sure if you can speak about that, but 217% sounds you\\'ve got plenty to look at such and I just wondered if you can give an update on what\\'s happening there? And then the final question, and here is really [ it\\'s the annual planning ] means that is a really simple company to understand that.  Thank you very much. And -- but does it mean that machines can do it. I was speaking with somebody and they said that the LSE has a program of building models automatically.

On the first one, no, I understand your question on the reconciliation of numbers. The 4%, I mentioned is the number you mentioned on the price increase divided by the loss ratio. In other words, what it's -- as if you dedicate the full amount of price increases in France to claims. And why do we do that? Simply because the expenses are addressed separately and we put a lot of pressure on expenses so that they do not increase with inflation. So that's -- that approach is specific to France, not for the other countries. But that's the reason why we say it's the 4% price increase in France because that's the part that goes to claims.  On the convergence with earnings, so there is a slight impact coming from the higher discount and that's what I highlighted as well. So I agree with you. But the main impact in our greater capital generation comes from the fact that underlying earnings, notably on the P&C side, are extremely close now to solvency capital generation and they were not in the past because of that distortion coming from excess reserve release. On the 217%, I guess, you were alluding to some potential capital management initiatives on this as we said in February, the Board looks at our capital management, in particular, at share buybacks once a year. And so don't expect another share buyback this year except the one to offset the dilution coming from our German Inforce transaction.

A few quick numerical questions then a slightly more fundamental question. So numerical questions, what was the rate decrease in North American professional lines?

Thirdly, I just want to see, obviously, people's Solvency II coverage ratios are going to go up. You obviously beat in the first quarter, and now you're looking at higher levels of operating capital generation. Does that flow through to higher levels of cash remittances to group level so that we can then have a look at the amount of buyback, which is annually possible.

And one bit that I would like to see or a couple of bits I'd love to see is, one, a reconciliation between underlying earnings and operating capital generation by both, I understand what you said I just meant to get that you're very much aligned on the P&C, will be good to have that.

So I don't see that as an issue. On the fund distribution, I think what you should have in mind is a couple of EUR 100 million difference between '22 and '23.  On cash remittance, the -- obviously, the fact that on the P&C side, our earnings are made of best estimate PYDs, gives us comfort on the fact that the remittance can grow and you know that we said it will grow. So we have full confidence in this year to be at the upper end of the range we had given you, which was EUR 5 billion to EUR 6 billion cash remittance for '23.

But why closing the duration gap now given where we are on the rate curve? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Dominic. On your first question, so if I understood it well, the difference between '22 and '23 come from the release of excess reserves or not. And we had no such excess reserves or almost in AXA XL. So effectively, it will be more the European entities for which there will be a difference in terms of capital generation coming from the better alignment between earnings and Solvency XL that will be very, very similar. On the duration gap, for us, there are two different things.  The first one is the duration gap as such, which is an ALM issue, and we thought that the level of rates that we reached in the first quarter was such that it would be interesting to take benefit of that and lengthen the duration of our assets. Overall, I believe that the neutral position that an insurance company should have is to have slightly longer assets than liabilities because that's the one thing you would benefit from in case of market crash because you gain money on the interest rate side, while you will lose on equities and other assets.  So that's my belief. And today, we're not there yet, but we wanted to close further the duration gap. And then there is another aspect, which is liquidity and how you manage potential surrenders and lapses. So on this, we have a very strict liquidity framework. And the first source of liquidity is obviously the incoming premiums, the coupons, the maturities from your bonds. And that's already a very significant source of liquidity. And then we take measures regularly to make sure that even in stress scenarios, we would have the ability to cater for additional surrenders or lapses without triggering capital losses. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'Okay. We have one more question from Benoit Valleaux from ODDO. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Benoit Valleaux',\n","    'text': \"One short question on my side on France and more specifically on your combined ratio. When I look at your Page 8 of your financial supplement,  you are adopting [ 105%] common ratio in '22 and IFRS 17. So there is a huge gap versus the 89% reported under IFRS 4. And when you take your reserve releases, it was a 6.5 percentage point last year. So I just wanted to understand why do you -- about it should grab you to change your best estimate last year in France. For example, and maybe linked to this, I know that you don't provide any guidance in terms of combined ratio going forward. But do you see any reason why combined ratio in French should be higher than the combined ratio in Europe? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"So thank you for your question. what do you see for France is what I described in one of the slides on IFRS 17, when I showed that overall, in '22, we released excess reserves and those excess reserves do not exist under IFRS 17. And that's why at group level, we had a higher combined ratio, and that's why you see it as well in France.   And when I combine that with a previous question on the fact that those excess reserves were not at XL, but mostly in Europe, it's normal that France and some other European entities, may be more impacted. But again, it is a one-off in '22. We wanted to release PYDs from excess reserves in '22 because precisely did disappear under IFRS 17, and we will have PYDs in the future coming from best estimate liabilities and in the range of 0.5% to 2% for the whole group. On your second question on France versus Europe, France is one of our largest markets with very good profitability and there's no reason far from it, why its combined ratio should be higher than others. Obviously, we want a good combined ratio, and we have it in France. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Anu Venkataraman',\n","    'text': 'Operator, do we have any more questions?

Welcome to the AXA 9 months 2023 Activity Indicators call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anu Venkataraman. Please go ahead. \\nAnu Venkataraman: Good morning, and welcome to AXA's 9 months 2023 Activity Indicators Call. This morning, our Group CFO of Alban de Mailly Nesle, we'll go through briefly the highlights of last night's press release, after which we'll be ready to take your questions. Alban? \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Anu. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining the call today. So I'll start with the key highlights of our 9 months '23 results.\\n AXA continued to deliver high-quality revenue growth, very much in line -- very much in line with our strategy and consistent with the trends that you see in the first half. We continue to see strong momentum across our technical lines, in particular, in P&C, plus 7%; and protection, plus 3%. And growth in Health remains also strong, up 7% if you adjust for the nonrenewal of 2 large international group contracts.\\n This has been partly offset by actions taken to rightsize businesses that has been deprioritized and that you know well, that's reinsurance property cat and traditional general account, and this should be completed by year-end.\\n Overall, our total revenues increased by 2% to EUR 79 billion. Our balance sheet remains very strong with the Solvency II ratio of 230%, driven by strong organic capital generation, and we are very pleased with this level. We also remain confident in delivering our in-force management target of EUR 30 billion to EUR 50 billion by year-end. And apart from those results, we've also recently announced 2 transactions.\\n The first one is the closing of the acquisition of Laya, the leading health insurer in Ireland with 28% market share. And second is the agreement to dispose of our live joint venture with Bharti in India. So these are in line with our strategy, which is to focus our footprint on our core markets where we have leading positions, while we exit -- sorry, noncore markets.\\n So going back to 9 months '23, let me now go through the key numbers of the press release, starting with P&C. P&C revenues were up 7% overall, with growth in both Commercial and Personal Lines. In commercial lines insurance, which excludes AXA XL Re, we saw a very good growth of 9%. This was driven by both price increases and volume. And at AXA XL Insurance, prices were up 4% on renewable or 7% excluding North America Professional lines where conditions remained challenging. This was mainly driven by favorable price effects in short tail lines with notably North America property, up 19%.\\n Overall, price increases remained above loss trends, in 9 months '23. And we remain very disciplined on pricing, and we have tools to manage the cycle. In France and Europe, we continue to see favorable price effects at 5% and 4%,  respectively. On volume, customer demand remained strong, notably at AXA XL Insurance in Property and Specialty lines and in Europe.\\n Moving to Personal Lines. Revenues were up 5% with growth both in personal motor and personal non-motor, up 7% and 3%, respectively. In Motor, price increases accelerated further in the third quarter in Europe, except in Switzerland. Overall, we believe the price increases in retail are sufficient to offset claims severities. But you know we are also vigilant on the frequency side, which is higher than expected in Germany and Ireland, which we had flagged at half year. And in those countries, we are taking further pricing actions.\\n And finally, in reinsurance, as you know, we've reduced our nat cat exposure again this year by circa 35% and in line with our strategy, and that was offset by price increases in Casualty, Property and Specialty so that overall revenues in reinsurance were down by only 3%. One last point on P&C regarding nat cat. In the first half, we had a relatively benign nat cat experience with 3 points impact on our combined ratio. That's below our 4 points load.\\n In the third quarter, we experienced several storms across Europe and the U.S. And despite this, at the end of September, we were still on track to be within our 4 points nat cat budget for the year. We currently estimate losses for -- from Hurricane Otis that made landfall in Mexico in October to be around EUR 0.2 billion before tax and net of reinsurance. And obviously, we need to see how the rest of the year plays out.\\n Let me now move to Life & Health. In Life, we see once again a positive trend in protection, up 3% and from higher sales in protection with unit-linked in Japan and sales to Mainland Chinese visitors in Hong Kong. Unit-linked premiums were down 13% reflecting volatile market conditions, albeit with some recovery observed in the third quarter. And this was largely offset by good performance of capital-light general account, up 12%, which was driven by the continued success of our general account at maturity product EuroCroissance in France. In France deal, which is our main Life carrier given this capital-light proposition of EuroCroissance and our Unit-Linked performance. Overall, we are up 10% on the savings side.\\n Once again, our strategy around this complimentary offer has proved its relevance, especially in these conditions. And lastly, traditional generic on premiums were down 13% and in line with our strategy to reduce our exposure in this business. So overall, Life revenues over the first 9 months were stable.\\n On Health, premiums were down 7% and that's largely from the renewal of 2 large international group contracts in France that you know well. Excluding those contracts, we had organic growth of plus 7%, and that's across all geographies and this reflected notably favorable price effects, again, across most geographies.\\n So next, on the net flows. So we see continued outflows in traditional general savings -- general account savings which is in line with our group strategy, and that's partly offset by strong flows in Protection & Health.\\n Moving to new business. So Life & Health, PVEP and NBV were down 8% and 4%, respectively. This was largely attributable to the increase in interest rates, which will reverse positively with a higher unwind over time. NBV margin, which is what matters to us, was up 0.2 point. New business CSM was up by 2%, reflecting a better portfolio mix, notably with a higher contribution from EuroCroissance. Overall, our business mix in Life and Health remains of high quality, and we will continue to grow from there. \\n And finally, in Asset Management. So average assets under management decreased by 5%, but that reflects unfavorable market conditions because net flows were flat. We have, as you saw, strong inflows from third-party funds, both in our core and our OGS platforms. And specifically in real estate, where we've had good momentum. And this was offset by net outflows from AXA insurance companies, which is obviously linked to the negative flows in general account that I had mentioned earlier.\\n Revenues in Asset Management were down 2%, driven by lower recurring fees from the reduction in average assets under management. \\n Moving on to Solvency II. So our Solvency II ratio was 230% at the end of September, and that's down 5 points from the first half. And this was mainly due to a combination of different factors. First one is minus 4 points from the early redemption of subordinated debt, which we had decided not -- which we have decided not to refinance in line of our strong cash and capital position, minus 3 points from unfavorable market effects, driven by lower equity markets and higher implied volatility and plus 7 points of normalized capital generation, minus obviously, 4 points of accrued foreseeable dividends. So at the end of the first 9 months, our normalized capital generation was plus 23 points. And as you see, we are well on track to achieve the 25 to 30-point guidance we gave this year.\\n Overall, we're happy with our strong Solvency II ratio. It reflects our more capital-efficient business model, and that allows us to grow without the need for more capital. So one word on our full year '23 outlook. We are on track to deliver our earnings outlook of above EUR 7.5 billion underlying earnings in '23. A few things to also keep in mind for the second half.\\n As you know, we always report more than 50% of our earnings in the first half because we have higher investment income in the first half, and there is also a small seasonality in discount. And we expect several headwinds in the second half which should already been known to you. So that's the higher health claims frequency in the U.K. We have still elevated lapses in Italy. And as you saw, we have higher Q3 nat cat losses. So as a conclusion, I think fundamentally, the group is in good shape. We are disciplined in our execution of our strategy, and that will continue to deliver strong results.\\n We have a balance sheet which remains strong with a high level of Solvency II ratio at 230%. And therefore, we are well placed for our next plan, which, as you may have seen, will be announced on March 11 next year. I'm now happy to take your questions. \\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will now take the first question coming from the line of Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America. \\nAndrew Sinclair: Three for me as usual, please. First was just on the nat cat budget. Could you remind me how you allocate that by quarter? Is it just straight a quarter in the budget for each quarter. I'm just trying to think about what's left for Q4? And how much of that is used by Otis and we've got a few storms so far. It feels to me like we could have burned through about half of Q4 budget already. So just any color on what's left to budget for Q4?\\n Second point, sticking on nat cat. Just really wondered if you can give us an update on XL's nat cat performance year-to-date. I know you've said that for the group, in line with budget after the first 9 months. Is that also the case for XL or any color there?\\n And then third and finally was just on North America Professional lines. Like we know there's been weaker pricing there. Just could you remind us how much of your book is in those lines today within XL? And do you think pricing today is adequate on a written basis. \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Andrew, for your questions. So on nat cat budget, as you know, it's 4 points overall. And we think 4 points of combined ratio, obviously. And we think about it across the year. So what we meant when we wrote the press release is that we were at 3 points at the half year. And given the number of small but intense natural events that we had in Q3, we are in line with the 4 points for the full year.\\n Now it's true that with Hurricane Otis, which as you saw, is around EUR 200 million, I would say, that's a bit less than a quarter's budget, it's around 40% of the quarter's budget. On XL, specifically, I mean, we think about our nat cat budget at group level. The Q3 was more -- was rather balanced between Europe and the U.S., XL Re was not particularly affected. And Otis is really AXA Mexico, and that does not effect XL very much, if at all.\\n And on the Professional Lines, I think we -- so we see the same sort of trend. It has not changed in Q3 compared to the first half. And we don't disclose the amount of business coming from North America Professional. But there is no change in trend. And very importantly, it is still a very profitable line. But given the fact that it was extremely profitable for the whole market. And given that there is less business notably because you've seen fewer IPOs, for instance, there is more competition on for a smaller cake, and that's what puts pressure on the business, but it's still very profitable. \\nOperator: We will now take the next question from the line of Farooq Hanif from JPMorgan. \\nFarooq Hanif: When you talk about the headwinds in 3Q, I mean what would you say is different from 1H because the list of items you gave is very similar. I guess nat cat is one thing you could talk about. But what actually do you think we should take into account that could have got worse than what you showed in 1H? That's question one.\\n Question 2, around the disposal target, you've been very confident around the EUR 30 billion to EUR 50 billion. I believe you've done something like EUR 24 billion announced transactions to date. So could you tell us a little bit more about where you think you'll end up within that range? And what kind of things may be on the table to consider?\\n And I guess my last question is coming back on pricing trends. So do you think, generally speaking, if you take North America Professional lines out of the equation, do you think pricing conditions are stable accelerating or decelerating in commercial lines generally? \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Farooq. So on the headwinds, no, there's nothing new on the Health in the U.K. or the level of lapses in Italy. That's very much in line with what we said in the first half. It has not worsened. We wanted to highlight them because that's what we said in the first half. \\n Nat cat, as you saw, clearly, the level of nat cat in Q3 was higher than in the first half. That's the only real difference. On the in-force transactions, so you probably have to wait until, say, mid-December for the announcement. But we are confident that we'll be well within the range with what we will announce we are close to signing on a couple of transactions and we are quite confident.\\n And on North America, on the pricing in commercial lines, when you look at commercial lines for SMEs and mid-markets, so more our European business, it's very stable. And when you look at XL, I would say overall, it's stable. You have some pluses and minuses. You probably have a bit more price in short tail lines, such as property and aerospace, and you have slightly lower prices in casualty. But overall, it's -- I'm not sure it's statistically relevant. But so overall, it's holding up well. \\nOperator: We will now take the next question from the line of Andrew Crean from Autonomous. \\nAndrew Crean: A couple of questions from me. Firstly, I noticed you have not done a debt issuance, so you're not doing your usual EUR 1 billion net debt issuance this year, which will take you to the bottom of your debt leverage range. Is that -- should we expect that to continue next year? Or should we -- will you revert back to raising debt largely in line with your shareholder equity? \\n And then secondly, on the overall revenue growth of 2%, you've called out, as you always do general account savings, those 2 contracts in Health and the XL Re, what is the underlying growth if you strip those 3 elements out? And do you think that is a sustainable level of growth as you go into your next plan? \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Andrew. On net debt issuance, so the reasoning behind the fact that we would not refinance it is that our solvency ratio is at a high level and that we have enough cash at holdco. So those are the 2 reasons, and I can't see why that would change going forward. So we will say more, obviously, in March with the plan, but I think the rationale will still hold. And on the revenue growth, when you strip out the -- what you mentioned, so the large health contracts, general account and nat cat reinsurance, our growth is at 5%, and that's where we would like it to be going forward. \\nOperator: We will now take the next question from the line of Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. \\nPeter Eliot: Firstly, just a quick follow-up on the lapse comment. I guess if you're seeing the same level as earlier in the year. I mean I guess we might have hoped that it might have improved a little bit given the sort of the pressures from Eurovita et cetera, towards the start of the year. So I'm just wondering sort of how it compares to what you're expecting and whether you're seeing -- what sort of momentum you're seeing at the moment? And should we expect that to lead to any sort of review of assumptions behind the CSM.\\n The second one, Asset Management. Revenues in Q3 stand-alone look very strong. Is that all recurring? Or is there any sort of one-off elements in the -- and then maybe thirdly, I just wonder if you can give us any insights into what you're thinking about your own reinsurance cover in this environment. \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Peter. So on lapses, so I will leave aside France because you know that it's small portfolio specific. And on the rest, we see no change compared to last year. In Italy, I think it's not so much Eurovita. Obviously, Eurovita has some impact on the whole market but it's more the competition of BTPs designed for individuals and sold notably through bank branches. It's more that competition that creates that elevated level of lapses and also a reduced level of premiums because people would go more to BTP than to Life insurance.\\n And therefore, I don't see, at this stage, a foreseeable change in that level of lapses given the environment. Will that have an impact on our assumptions and therefore, on our CSM in Italy? Yes, probably because it means that the business will have a shorter duration because we will have -- we have more lapses.\\n Asset Management in Q3, so the -- we -- I think we have with AXA IM Core and AXA IM Alts a very good platform on a number of businesses notably fixed income in core and real estate infrastructure that notably in Alts. And I think what's quite remarkable is that, obviously, the real estate market is not doing that great currently. But nevertheless, you see strong net new money on that front because we are recognized as probably the strongest or one of the strongest platforms in Europe. So we expect good net inflows going forward from third parties.\\n And last on our own reinsurance cover, you know that the way we think about it is outcome driven. In other words, what is our risk appetite and what is the cat load that we would like to see. So you shouldn't expect a significant change in '24 compared to '23 in terms of cat load. We are looking at the way to design our reinsurance program. But what we see is that on a risk-adjusted basis, prices should not move significantly. We are between 0% and 5%, most probably. \\nPeter Eliot: Great. On the Asset Management, I mean, it was actually revenues as well as flows, but I noticed, but thank you for those comments. \\nAlban Nesle: Yes. I mean on revenues, it's obviously -- you know that on the core part, we are more a fixed income business than an equity business. So the fact that interest rates and yields have come down over the last few weeks is obviously a positive for our business. \\nOperator: We will now take the next question from the line of Michael Huttner from Berenberg. \\nMichael Huttner: And I'm always delighted to see delivering despite all these upsets and headwinds and everything. I have 3 questions. First one is the net outflows from the life companies and asset management were, I think, EUR 13 billion. The figure we see for a general account is EUR 6.8 billion, and I think there's just under EUR 1 billion from Unit-Linked. So there seems to be a big gap. And I just wondered what is that?\\n The second is -- and I sort of asked this in half year, but the benefits of discounting less the unwind, full insurers not particularly factor, but it's true for you as well is it's a very, very big benefit this year. I can't remember the figure, but I think at half year, it was about EUR 0.5 billion. So it's probably unfair to annualize it, but it's probably not going to be [ passed ] over to EUR 1 billion for the year. And if you say, well, over EUR 7.5 billion it's a big chunk of the earnings. How are you -- how should one think about managing the drag as this difference between discounting and unwind kind of slows down going forward? \\n And then I was hoping you could give a little bit more on cash because clearly, if you're not refinancing and you've actually spent a little bit of money on layer and stuff. You must be even more cash rich than before. And I just wondered, maybe you could explain where it's coming from or any kind of qualitative would be very helpful.\\n I had a last question on the last -- sorry, MPS, if somebody breaks on contract to a EUR 1 billion, which would, I guess, would be quite nice, what's the likelihood that MPS is sold to a party where you would effectively say well, now there's a break clause? \\nAlban Nesle: Sorry, Michael, can you say the last question again, I'm not sure understood? \\nMichael Huttner: Monte dei Paschi di Siena -- that you have a contract, you are exclusive distributor for Monte dei Paschi di Siena in Italy, understand that if there's a change of control and the break clause is invoked, you have effectively put up some which is less a EUR 1 billion or over a EUR 1 billion. And I just wondered how you see the probability of things developing in Italy in that direction. \\nAlban Nesle: So thank you for your questions. On the first one, which is the reduction of the outflows from AXA IM and that's the EUR 13 million, you wanted to reconcile that, sorry, with our own outflows. So obviously, there is the Life one. There is also the fact that on the P&C side, on a net basis, reserves that's also a bit decreased. And there is always the impact also that the dividend we pay because the dividend we paid made of the dividends paid by the entities, and therefore, it's also a bit of assets that is withdrawn from AXA IM.\\n On the discount and unwind, you know that it's not exactly the way we look at it. We look at unwind versus investment income because those 2 should evolve in parallel. I think going forward, you will see more investment income. You will see also more unwind. The net was still probably a net negative going forward, but something that we'll be able to manage overall.\\n And there, again, we'll give you more in March with the plan. But don't forget the investment income part because that's a very useful component these days with higher interest rates.\\n On cash well, I think we will have to wait until February before I can give you more. But effectively, and that's what I also said to Andrew, we have the right amount of cash at holdco and by the level of solvency and therefore, no need to increase our debt. And On MPS, well, look, we are looking at what's happening. We -- our preference, obviously, is to keep the good distribution agreement that we have with the MPS but it's not entirely in our hands. And as you well said, we have, I think, a contract which protects us well. But again, our preference would be not to use that close. \\nOperator: We will now take the next question from the line of William Hawkins from KBW. \\nWilliam Hawkins: First one, please, what was the contribution of required capital changes to the plus 7% and minus 3 percentage points capital generation and market movements in the solvency roll forward you gave?\\n Secondly, you've repeated the cap budget of around 4 points. Could I just press you that's a reasonably wide range optically. It could be 3.5, it could be 4.4. And there are a few companies that are now starting to squeeze that. So they're talking about 4.49 or something like that. So I apologize that it's an exercise in pedantry, but how do you think about where your cat load is going to be at the end of the year around 4. My guessing is that it's definitely above 4 rather than below 4. But if you could comment on that, that would be helpful. \\n And then lastly, please. We've seen this acceleration in rate increases in a number of European personal lines in the third quarter, which is good. Does that automatically imply improved combined ratios from the moment it's happening? Or is there actually a risk that your loss picks could still be trending upwards, and it's the rate increases that are sort of responding to inflation that we're having to adjust for. So if you get my point on that, it's nice to see the acceleration of rate increases in personal lines, but is there a risk that, that's indicating higher loss picks before it gets better at some point in the future? \\nAlban Nesle: William? \\nWilliam Hawkins: Sorry, can you hear me? \\nAlban Nesle: Yes. I don't know if we were disconnected or you, but we -- I didn't hear the end of your third question. You were speaking of the accelerated rate increases in personal lines and then the line was cut. \\nWilliam Hawkins: I do apologize if it was my side. So yes, accelerating rate increases in personal lines in the third quarter. Does that imply immediately improving combined ratios? Or is there the risk that your combined ratio is actually deteriorate because there's a process of adjusting loss picks first and then you get the benefit of these rates increases in the future. Just wanted to think about how we get the timing of that accelerating rate increase? \\nAlban Nesle: Okay. So on the question first question of the capital requirement, very much like the first half, there was no additional capital requirement. So the 7% is growth equals net, if you see what I mean.\\n On the nat cat, well, at this stage, it's a bit difficult to say because the quarter and the year are not over. And that's a bit the question at the very beginning. We had the Hurricane Otis. We have the storm in Europe, both in France, the U.K. and now in Italy.\\n We'll need to see how it plays out. I'm really not able to say whether it would be 4% plus or 4% minus. We shall see what -- how the end of the year develops. And on the rate increases in personal lines, I think what we see is what we told you at the end of the first semester, which is that overall, in terms of severity, we were not surprised in any country.\\n In terms of frequency, we were surprised in 2 countries, Germany and Ireland, for which we are taking additional measures and those measures will also be taken in the first half, notably in Germany because you know that they book a significant part of it renews at 1/1. So I'd say there is no reason, apart from Germany and Ireland. There is no reason why the loss will come first and the rate increases second. I think here, the price increases are a positive. \\nWilliam Hawkins: And can I just follow up? Sorry, thank you for the answer on the capital generation. But could I also just ask you the market movement of 3 points, how much of that was coming from changes in required capital, please? \\nAlban Nesle: No. So that's really the -- mainly almost exclusively the numerator effect the U.S. \\nOperator: We will now take the next question from the line of Will Hardcastle from UBS. \\nWilliam Hardcastle: I just have one left. Is there any progress on the 3 areas where you've highlighted previously about potential cash unlock in the future? I think there were Japan, Hong Kong and XL? Or is this more meant to be a -- perhaps just a timing aspect of this. Is this more a year-end aspect? Or is this some time in the future, perhaps 18 months down the line? \\nAlban Nesle: So I think the -- it depends on the country, but the impact only material is once a year with the dividend paid by the entity. So that's done, that's over for '23. And so you will see the progress in '24 with the dividends we received from them. And part of it, as you know, if I take Hong Kong -- is the improvement is linked to the change in the local regulatory framework. So you will see that progress when that comes. But when I look at XL, the question was more on the liquidity constraints in the sense of regulatory liquidity constraints, and we've made progress on this, and that should show in the dividend that we received in '24. \\nOperator: We will now take the next question from the line of Dominic O'Mahony from BNP Paribas. \\nDominic O''mahony: Thank you for taking the questions. 3 if that's okay. Just on the Italian lapse topic. Do you like that as I head into earnings. I would have guessed that elevated lapses would be a negative to CSM and so the earnings impact in the period wouldn't be so powerful. Can you just explain to why there is an earnings impact? Is it the contractor [ turning ] owners? And in particular, is this if as you describe, alban, that the trend hasn't changed -- if the trend of center remains roughly stable, should we expect a similar effect in 2024? \\n And the second question, capital generation, 7 points of operating innovation is great. And it's the middle of your -- it's roughly the middle of your range annualized. If I remember correctly at half year, Alban, you said that don't expect quite a strong capital generation in the second half than compared with the first half, but you're still there in the middle of your range. Should I infer that Q4 has a sort of structural headwinds to the capital generation? Or would you expect another 7 points roughly?\\n And then last question, not really to do with the results, but there's a lot of regulatory attention being paid to private assets at the moment within life insurance portfolios globally. This is clearly a part of your portfolio. And private assets are really an obviously important part of your third-party asset management portfolio. So I just thought I'd ask a few reflections on the regulatory attention being paid to this asset class how you feel about your allocations here and indeed whether there might be any adverse impacts on asset management flows, if there is more international pressure on this asset class? \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Dominic, for your questions. So on the Italian lapses, no, you're right. I mean, the impact is mostly or exclusively on the CSM. But you know how it works. You have so-called group of contracts in our Life carriers. Those group of contracts in Italy reflects generally the funds that we have. And it might be then one can turn onerous, but it will -- if that's the case, it will have a nonsignificant impact. The real impact is on the CSM as you pointed out.\\n On capital generation, I think if I remember well, we were at 16 points in the first half, and therefore, above the 25 to 30 points range annualized that we mentioned. So what we just wanted to say was that there is seasonality in our earnings. And therefore, there is also seasonality in our capital generation. You shouldn't expect Q4, everything else being equal to be weaker than Q3 to put it that way.\\n And on private assets, we honestly -- we haven't had much regulatory pressure on this so much regulatory attention. I think regulators across the world are probably a bit more attentive to liquidity, notably on the life side. So private assets are part of that equation. But there is no strong pressure, no particular concern from regulators that we have seen.\\n And you saw that we had good net inflows at AXA IM Alts, notably on real estate. So that shows that investors are still willing to put more money in illiquid assets. Obviously, you have the denominator effect for a number of them which reduces their appetite for illiquid assets. But if you have a good platform, you still can benefit from this. \\nDominic O''mahony: Can I -- sorry, just to clarify on the lapse and the CSM effect. Does that mean that the elevated Italian lapse topic isn't relevant to the underlying earnings? Or is there an impact I'd sort of implied that this is being presented as a potential headwind to the earnings. \\nAlban Nesle: It's -- I mean if there is an impact on earnings, it will be small. Let's put it that way. \\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take the next question from the line of Michael Huttner from Berenberg. \\nMichael Huttner: I just had 2 follow-up questions. One is, I think you probably answered it, but I just want to double check what is the leverage now given you've reduced that by EUR 1.2 billion. And the other question is on Health in the U.K. It's almost like a personal question. I've got a relative saying it's greater thing buying a private insurance contract, basically because people buy it because they want to claim. It's not just in case I will claim. How close are you to managing this given that potentially you have a change in behavior here? \\nAlban Nesle: So on leverage, Michael, you know that our denominator is around EUR 90 billion. So you have directly the impact with a EUR 1 billion nonrenewal of that debt. And on health in the U.K. So we believe it's a fundamental change in the market. And you know that our stance is that over time, it will be positive because it means fundamentally that the NHS will not be able to cover or to give coverage as much as in the past, and therefore, people will go more for private insurance, which also means that we need to design the right products so that they are affordable to a larger portion of the population.\\n But coming back to that change and impact on us short term, part of it will be dealt with pricing, and there's more to come. Very clearly, only a small part of our price increases have taken place in Q3. But part of it is also very much about the claims management and what we call pathways. In other words, how we manage the patients move from GP to specialists to analysis and so on in order both to deliver the best service for our customer and to reduce the cost for us. \\nMichael Huttner: Yes, [indiscernible] sorry. \\nAlban Nesle: And so as we said, it will take us another 12 to 18 months to get back to the right level of profitability in that business. \\nOperator: We will now take the next question from the line of Henry Heathfield from Morningstar. \\nHenry Heathfield: Good morning. Can you hear me? \\nAlban Nesle: Yes. \\nHenry Heathfield: Congratulations on the results. Just one question for me. On the pricing effects within P&C Personal Lines, and apologies if this has already been covered. It's plus 26%, 26.1% in U.K. and Ireland. And I was just wondering if you could perhaps reiterate or outline what line that relates to and whether that is just covering kind of increased severity and frequency or whether there's some other kind of catching up dynamic that's going on in there? \\nAlban Nesle: So Henry, it's -- the vast majority of it is motor. And you know that the profitability in the U.K. motor market, not Ireland, but U.K. motor market was not satisfactory to say the least. And hence, the significant price increases that we had. It's mainly severity because it's cost inflation. And now we are -- as we said at half year, we are writing business at a combined ratio below 100%. \\nHenry Heathfield: Sorry, could I take that as partially that you feel that AXA was slightly below the market? Or has that been in an incorrect read. \\nAlban Nesle: I mean I think when you look at our performance before inflation kicked in -- say, U.K. motor, and again, not Ireland, but U.K. motor, we were in the pack and clearly not leading in terms of profitability. \\nHenry Heathfield: And is there a shift in distribution in the U.K. or not at all, arrangements? \\nAlban Nesle: No, not specifically. The only thing is you may know that we have launched a third direct platform under the brand of Moja to gain scale and to diversify our offer and that's doing pretty well. \\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions. I will now hand back to Anu Venkataraman from closing statements. \\nAnu Venkataraman: Thank you for your interest. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Investor Relations. Have a good day. \\nOperator: That concludes our conference for today. Thank you for participating.

Alban? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Anu. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining the call today. So I'll start with the key highlights of our 9 months '23 results.  AXA continued to deliver high-quality revenue growth, very much in line -- very much in line with our strategy and consistent with the trends that you see in the first half. We continue to see strong momentum across our technical lines, in particular, in P&C, plus 7%; and protection, plus 3%. And growth in Health remains also strong, up 7% if you adjust for the nonrenewal of 2 large international group contracts.  This has been partly offset by actions taken to rightsize businesses that has been deprioritized and that you know well, that's reinsurance property cat and traditional general account, and this should be completed by year-end.  Overall, our total revenues increased by 2% to EUR 79 billion. Our balance sheet remains very strong with the Solvency II ratio of 230%, driven by strong organic capital generation, and we are very pleased with this level. We also remain confident in delivering our in-force management target of EUR 30 billion to EUR 50 billion by year-end. And apart from those results, we've also recently announced 2 transactions.  The first one is the closing of the acquisition of Laya, the leading health insurer in Ireland with 28% market share. And second is the agreement to dispose of our live joint venture with Bharti in India. So these are in line with our strategy, which is to focus our footprint on our core markets where we have leading positions, while we exit -- sorry, noncore markets.  So going back to 9 months '23, let me now go through the key numbers of the press release, starting with P&C. P&C revenues were up 7% overall, with growth in both Commercial and Personal Lines. In commercial lines insurance, which excludes AXA XL Re, we saw a very good growth of 9%. This was driven by both price increases and volume. And at AXA XL Insurance, prices were up 4% on renewable or 7% excluding North America Professional lines where conditions remained challenging. This was mainly driven by favorable price effects in short tail lines with notably North America property, up 19%.  Overall, price increases remained above loss trends, in 9 months '23. And we remain very disciplined on pricing, and we have tools to manage the cycle. In France and Europe, we continue to see favorable price effects at 5% and 4%,  respectively. On volume, customer demand remained strong, notably at AXA XL Insurance in Property and Specialty lines and in Europe.  Moving to Personal Lines. Revenues were up 5% with growth both in personal motor and personal non-motor, up 7% and 3%, respectively. In Motor, price increases accelerated further in the third quarter in Europe, except in Switzerland. Overall, we believe the price increases in retail are sufficient to offset claims severities. But you know we are also vigilant on the frequency side, which is higher than expected in Germany and Ireland, which we had flagged at half year. And in those countries, we are taking further pricing actions.  And finally, in reinsurance, as you know, we've reduced our nat cat exposure again this year by circa 35% and in line with our strategy, and that was offset by price increases in Casualty, Property and Specialty so that overall revenues in reinsurance were down by only 3%. One last point on P&C regarding nat cat. In the first half, we had a relatively benign nat cat experience with 3 points impact on our combined ratio. That's below our 4 points load.  In the third quarter, we experienced several storms across Europe and the U.S. And despite this, at the end of September, we were still on track to be within our 4 points nat cat budget for the year. We currently estimate losses for -- from Hurricane Otis that made landfall in Mexico in October to be around EUR 0.2 billion before tax and net of reinsurance. And obviously, we need to see how the rest of the year plays out.  Let me now move to Life & Health. In Life, we see once again a positive trend in protection, up 3% and from higher sales in protection with unit-linked in Japan and sales to Mainland Chinese visitors in Hong Kong. Unit-linked premiums were down 13% reflecting volatile market conditions, albeit with some recovery observed in the third quarter. And this was largely offset by good performance of capital-light general account, up 12%, which was driven by the continued success of our general account at maturity product EuroCroissance in France. In France deal, which is our main Life carrier given this capital-light proposition of EuroCroissance and our Unit-Linked performance. Overall, we are up 10% on the savings side.  Once again, our strategy around this complimentary offer has proved its relevance, especially in these conditions. And lastly, traditional generic on premiums were down 13% and in line with our strategy to reduce our exposure in this business. So overall, Life revenues over the first 9 months were stable.  On Health, premiums were down 7% and that's largely from the renewal of 2 large international group contracts in France that you know well. Excluding those contracts, we had organic growth of plus 7%, and that's across all geographies and this reflected notably favorable price effects, again, across most geographies.  So next, on the net flows. So we see continued outflows in traditional general savings -- general account savings which is in line with our group strategy, and that's partly offset by strong flows in Protection & Health.  Moving to new business. So Life & Health, PVEP and NBV were down 8% and 4%, respectively. This was largely attributable to the increase in interest rates, which will reverse positively with a higher unwind over time. NBV margin, which is what matters to us, was up 0.2 point. New business CSM was up by 2%, reflecting a better portfolio mix, notably with a higher contribution from EuroCroissance. Overall, our business mix in Life and Health remains of high quality, and we will continue to grow from there.   And finally, in Asset Management. So average assets under management decreased by 5%, but that reflects unfavorable market conditions because net flows were flat. We have, as you saw, strong inflows from third-party funds, both in our core and our OGS platforms. And specifically in real estate, where we've had good momentum. And this was offset by net outflows from AXA insurance companies, which is obviously linked to the negative flows in general account that I had mentioned earlier.  Revenues in Asset Management were down 2%, driven by lower recurring fees from the reduction in average assets under management.   Moving on to Solvency II. So our Solvency II ratio was 230% at the end of September, and that's down 5 points from the first half. And this was mainly due to a combination of different factors. First one is minus 4 points from the early redemption of subordinated debt, which we had decided not -- which we have decided not to refinance in line of our strong cash and capital position, minus 3 points from unfavorable market effects, driven by lower equity markets and higher implied volatility and plus 7 points of normalized capital generation, minus obviously, 4 points of accrued foreseeable dividends. So at the end of the first 9 months, our normalized capital generation was plus 23 points. And as you see, we are well on track to achieve the 25 to 30-point guidance we gave this year.  Overall, we're happy with our strong Solvency II ratio. It reflects our more capital-efficient business model, and that allows us to grow without the need for more capital. So one word on our full year '23 outlook. We are on track to deliver our earnings outlook of above EUR 7.5 billion underlying earnings in '23. A few things to also keep in mind for the second half.  As you know, we always report more than 50% of our earnings in the first half because we have higher investment income in the first half, and there is also a small seasonality in discount. And we expect several headwinds in the second half which should already been known to you. So that's the higher health claims frequency in the U.K. We have still elevated lapses in Italy. And as you saw, we have higher Q3 nat cat losses. So as a conclusion, I think fundamentally, the group is in good shape. We are disciplined in our execution of our strategy, and that will continue to deliver strong results.  We have a balance sheet which remains strong with a high level of Solvency II ratio at 230%. And therefore, we are well placed for our next plan, which, as you may have seen, will be announced on March 11 next year. I'm now happy to take your questions. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '[Operator Instructions]. We will now take the first question coming from the line of Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Sinclair',\n","    'text': \"Three for me as usual, please. First was just on the nat cat budget. Could you remind me how you allocate that by quarter? Is it just straight a quarter in the budget for each quarter. I'm just trying to think about what's left for Q4? And how much of that is used by Otis and we've got a few storms so far. It feels to me like we could have burned through about half of Q4 budget already. So just any color on what's left to budget for Q4?  Second point, sticking on nat cat. Just really wondered if you can give us an update on XL's nat cat performance year-to-date. I know you've said that for the group, in line with budget after the first 9 months. Is that also the case for XL or any color there?  And then third and finally was just on North America Professional lines. Like we know there's been weaker pricing there. Just could you remind us how much of your book is in those lines today within XL? And do you think pricing today is adequate on a written basis. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Andrew, for your questions. So on nat cat budget, as you know, it's 4 points overall. And we think 4 points of combined ratio, obviously. And we think about it across the year. So what we meant when we wrote the press release is that we were at 3 points at the half year. And given the number of small but intense natural events that we had in Q3, we are in line with the 4 points for the full year.  Now it's true that with Hurricane Otis, which as you saw, is around EUR 200 million, I would say, that's a bit less than a quarter's budget, it's around 40% of the quarter's budget. On XL, specifically, I mean, we think about our nat cat budget at group level. The Q3 was more -- was rather balanced between Europe and the U.S., XL Re was not particularly affected. And Otis is really AXA Mexico, and that does not effect XL very much, if at all.  And on the Professional Lines, I think we -- so we see the same sort of trend. It has not changed in Q3 compared to the first half. And we don't disclose the amount of business coming from North America Professional. But there is no change in trend. And very importantly, it is still a very profitable line. But given the fact that it was extremely profitable for the whole market. And given that there is less business notably because you've seen fewer IPOs, for instance, there is more competition on for a smaller cake, and that's what puts pressure on the business, but it's still very profitable. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'We will now take the next question from the line of Farooq Hanif from JPMorgan. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Farooq Hanif',\n","    'text': \"When you talk about the headwinds in 3Q, I mean what would you say is different from 1H because the list of items you gave is very similar. I guess nat cat is one thing you could talk about. But what actually do you think we should take into account that could have got worse than what you showed in 1H? That's question one.  Question 2, around the disposal target, you've been very confident around the EUR 30 billion to EUR 50 billion. I believe you've done something like EUR 24 billion announced transactions to date. So could you tell us a little bit more about where you think you'll end up within that range? And what kind of things may be on the table to consider?  And I guess my last question is coming back on pricing trends. So do you think, generally speaking, if you take North America Professional lines out of the equation, do you think pricing conditions are stable accelerating or decelerating in commercial lines generally? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Farooq. So on the headwinds, no, there's nothing new on the Health in the U.K. or the level of lapses in Italy. That's very much in line with what we said in the first half. It has not worsened. We wanted to highlight them because that's what we said in the first half.   Nat cat, as you saw, clearly, the level of nat cat in Q3 was higher than in the first half. That's the only real difference. On the in-force transactions, so you probably have to wait until, say, mid-December for the announcement. But we are confident that we'll be well within the range with what we will announce we are close to signing on a couple of transactions and we are quite confident.  And on North America, on the pricing in commercial lines, when you look at commercial lines for SMEs and mid-markets, so more our European business, it's very stable. And when you look at XL, I would say overall, it's stable. You have some pluses and minuses. You probably have a bit more price in short tail lines, such as property and aerospace, and you have slightly lower prices in casualty. But overall, it's -- I'm not sure it's statistically relevant. But so overall, it's holding up well. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'We will now take the next question from the line of Andrew Crean from Autonomous. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Crean',\n","    'text': \"A couple of questions from me. Firstly, I noticed you have not done a debt issuance, so you're not doing your usual EUR 1 billion net debt issuance this year, which will take you to the bottom of your debt leverage range. Is that -- should we expect that to continue next year? Or should we -- will you revert back to raising debt largely in line with your shareholder equity?   And then secondly, on the overall revenue growth of 2%, you've called out, as you always do general account savings, those 2 contracts in Health and the XL Re, what is the underlying growth if you strip those 3 elements out? And do you think that is a sustainable level of growth as you go into your next plan? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Andrew. On net debt issuance, so the reasoning behind the fact that we would not refinance it is that our solvency ratio is at a high level and that we have enough cash at holdco. So those are the 2 reasons, and I can't see why that would change going forward. So we will say more, obviously, in March with the plan, but I think the rationale will still hold. And on the revenue growth, when you strip out the -- what you mentioned, so the large health contracts, general account and nat cat reinsurance, our growth is at 5%, and that's where we would like it to be going forward. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'We will now take the next question from the line of Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Peter Eliot',\n","    'text': \"Firstly, just a quick follow-up on the lapse comment. I guess if you're seeing the same level as earlier in the year. I mean I guess we might have hoped that it might have improved a little bit given the sort of the pressures from Eurovita et cetera, towards the start of the year. So I'm just wondering sort of how it compares to what you're expecting and whether you're seeing -- what sort of momentum you're seeing at the moment? And should we expect that to lead to any sort of review of assumptions behind the CSM.  The second one, Asset Management. Revenues in Q3 stand-alone look very strong. Is that all recurring? Or is there any sort of one-off elements in the -- and then maybe thirdly, I just wonder if you can give us any insights into what you're thinking about your own reinsurance cover in this environment. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Peter. So on lapses, so I will leave aside France because you know that it's small portfolio specific. And on the rest, we see no change compared to last year. In Italy, I think it's not so much Eurovita. Obviously, Eurovita has some impact on the whole market but it's more the competition of BTPs designed for individuals and sold notably through bank branches. It's more that competition that creates that elevated level of lapses and also a reduced level of premiums because people would go more to BTP than to Life insurance.  And therefore, I don't see, at this stage, a foreseeable change in that level of lapses given the environment. Will that have an impact on our assumptions and therefore, on our CSM in Italy? Yes, probably because it means that the business will have a shorter duration because we will have -- we have more lapses.  Asset Management in Q3, so the -- we -- I think we have with AXA IM Core and AXA IM Alts a very good platform on a number of businesses notably fixed income in core and real estate infrastructure that notably in Alts. And I think what's quite remarkable is that, obviously, the real estate market is not doing that great currently. But nevertheless, you see strong net new money on that front because we are recognized as probably the strongest or one of the strongest platforms in Europe. So we expect good net inflows going forward from third parties.  And last on our own reinsurance cover, you know that the way we think about it is outcome driven. In other words, what is our risk appetite and what is the cat load that we would like to see. So you shouldn't expect a significant change in '24 compared to '23 in terms of cat load. We are looking at the way to design our reinsurance program. But what we see is that on a risk-adjusted basis, prices should not move significantly. We are between 0% and 5%, most probably. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Peter Eliot',\n","    'text': 'Great. On the Asset Management, I mean, it was actually revenues as well as flows, but I noticed, but thank you for those comments. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Yes. I mean on revenues, it's obviously -- you know that on the core part, we are more a fixed income business than an equity business.

'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Michael Huttner',\n","    'text': \"And I'm always delighted to see delivering despite all these upsets and headwinds and everything. I have 3 questions. First one is the net outflows from the life companies and asset management were, I think, EUR 13 billion. The figure we see for a general account is EUR 6.8 billion, and I think there's just under EUR 1 billion from Unit-Linked. So there seems to be a big gap. And I just wondered what is that?  The second is -- and I sort of asked this in half year, but the benefits of discounting less the unwind, full insurers not particularly factor, but it's true for you as well is it's a very, very big benefit this year. I can't remember the figure, but I think at half year, it was about EUR 0.5 billion. So it's probably unfair to annualize it, but it's probably not going to be [ passed ] over to EUR 1 billion for the year. And if you say, well, over EUR 7.5 billion it's a big chunk of the earnings. How are you -- how should one think about managing the drag as this difference between discounting and unwind kind of slows down going forward?   And then I was hoping you could give a little bit more on cash because clearly, if you're not refinancing and you've actually spent a little bit of money on layer and stuff. You must be even more cash rich than before. And I just wondered, maybe you could explain where it's coming from or any kind of qualitative would be very helpful.  I had a last question on the last -- sorry, MPS, if somebody breaks on contract to a EUR 1 billion, which would, I guess, would be quite nice, what's the likelihood that MPS is sold to a party where you would effectively say well, now there's a break clause? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Sorry, Michael, can you say the last question again, I'm not sure understood? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Michael Huttner',\n","    'text': \"Monte dei Paschi di Siena -- that you have a contract, you are exclusive distributor for Monte dei Paschi di Siena in Italy, understand that if there's a change of control and the break clause is invoked, you have effectively put up some which is less a EUR 1 billion or over a EUR 1 billion. And I just wondered how you see the probability of things developing in Italy in that direction. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"So thank you for your questions. On the first one, which is the reduction of the outflows from AXA IM and that's the EUR 13 million, you wanted to reconcile that, sorry, with our own outflows. So obviously, there is the Life one. There is also the fact that on the P&C side, on a net basis, reserves that's also a bit decreased. And there is always the impact also that the dividend we pay because the dividend we paid made of the dividends paid by the entities, and therefore, it's also a bit of assets that is withdrawn from AXA IM.  On the discount and unwind, you know that it's not exactly the way we look at it. We look at unwind versus investment income because those 2 should evolve in parallel. I think going forward, you will see more investment income. You will see also more unwind. The net was still probably a net negative going forward, but something that we'll be able to manage overall.  And there, again, we'll give you more in March with the plan. But don't forget the investment income part because that's a very useful component these days with higher interest rates.  On cash well, I think we will have to wait until February before I can give you more. But effectively, and that's what I also said to Andrew, we have the right amount of cash at holdco and by the level of solvency and therefore, no need to increase our debt. And On MPS, well, look, we are looking at what's happening. We -- our preference, obviously, is to keep the good distribution agreement that we have with the MPS but it's not entirely in our hands. And as you well said, we have, I think, a contract which protects us well. But again, our preference would be not to use that close. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'We will now take the next question from the line of William Hawkins from KBW. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'William Hawkins',\n","    'text': \"First one, please, what was the contribution of required capital changes to the plus 7% and minus 3 percentage points capital generation and market movements in the solvency roll forward you gave?  Secondly, you've repeated the cap budget of around 4 points. Could I just press you that's a reasonably wide range optically. It could be 3.5, it could be 4.4. And there are a few companies that are now starting to squeeze that. So they're talking about 4.49 or something like that. So I apologize that it's an exercise in pedantry, but how do you think about where your cat load is going to be at the end of the year around 4. My guessing is that it's definitely above 4 rather than below 4. But if you could comment on that, that would be helpful.   And then lastly, please. We've seen this acceleration in rate increases in a number of European personal lines in the third quarter, which is good. Does that automatically imply improved combined ratios from the moment it's happening? Or is there actually a risk that your loss picks could still be trending upwards, and it's the rate increases that are sort of responding to inflation that we're having to adjust for. So if you get my point on that, it's nice to see the acceleration of rate increases in personal lines, but is there a risk that, that's indicating higher loss picks before it gets better at some point in the future? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle', 'text': 'William?

Or is there the risk that your combined ratio is actually deteriorate because there's a process of adjusting loss picks first and then you get the benefit of these rates increases in the future. Just wanted to think about how we get the timing of that accelerating rate increase? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Okay. So on the question first question of the capital requirement, very much like the first half, there was no additional capital requirement. So the 7% is growth equals net, if you see what I mean.  On the nat cat, well, at this stage, it's a bit difficult to say because the quarter and the year are not over. And that's a bit the question at the very beginning. We had the Hurricane Otis. We have the storm in Europe, both in France, the U.K. and now in Italy.  We'll need to see how it plays out. I'm really not able to say whether it would be 4% plus or 4% minus. We shall see what -- how the end of the year develops. And on the rate increases in personal lines, I think what we see is what we told you at the end of the first semester, which is that overall, in terms of severity, we were not surprised in any country.  In terms of frequency, we were surprised in 2 countries, Germany and Ireland, for which we are taking additional measures and those measures will also be taken in the first half, notably in Germany because you know that they book a significant part of it renews at 1/1. So I'd say there is no reason, apart from Germany and Ireland. There is no reason why the loss will come first and the rate increases second. I think here, the price increases are a positive. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'William Hawkins',\n","    'text': 'And can I just follow up? Sorry, thank you for the answer on the capital generation.

So that's done, that's over for '23. And so you will see the progress in '24 with the dividends we received from them. And part of it, as you know, if I take Hong Kong -- is the improvement is linked to the change in the local regulatory framework. So you will see that progress when that comes. But when I look at XL, the question was more on the liquidity constraints in the sense of regulatory liquidity constraints, and we've made progress on this, and that should show in the dividend that we received in '24. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': \"We will now take the next question from the line of Dominic O'Mahony from BNP Paribas. \"},\n","   {'speaker': \"Dominic O''mahony\",\n","    'text': \"Thank you for taking the questions. 3 if that's okay. Just on the Italian lapse topic. Do you like that as I head into earnings. I would have guessed that elevated lapses would be a negative to CSM and so the earnings impact in the period wouldn't be so powerful. Can you just explain to why there is an earnings impact? Is it the contractor [ turning ] owners? And in particular, is this if as you describe, alban, that the trend hasn't changed -- if the trend of center remains roughly stable, should we expect a similar effect in 2024?   And the second question, capital generation, 7 points of operating innovation is great. And it's the middle of your -- it's roughly the middle of your range annualized. If I remember correctly at half year, Alban, you said that don't expect quite a strong capital generation in the second half than compared with the first half, but you're still there in the middle of your range. Should I infer that Q4 has a sort of structural headwinds to the capital generation? Or would you expect another 7 points roughly?  And then last question, not really to do with the results, but there's a lot of regulatory attention being paid to private assets at the moment within life insurance portfolios globally. This is clearly a part of your portfolio. And private assets are really an obviously important part of your third-party asset management portfolio. So I just thought I'd ask a few reflections on the regulatory attention being paid to this asset class how you feel about your allocations here and indeed whether there might be any adverse impacts on asset management flows, if there is more international pressure on this asset class? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Dominic, for your questions. So on the Italian lapses, no, you're right. I mean, the impact is mostly or exclusively on the CSM. But you know how it works. You have so-called group of contracts in our Life carriers. Those group of contracts in Italy reflects generally the funds that we have. And it might be then one can turn onerous, but it will -- if that's the case, it will have a nonsignificant impact. The real impact is on the CSM as you pointed out.  On capital generation, I think if I remember well, we were at 16 points in the first half, and therefore, above the 25 to 30 points range annualized that we mentioned. So what we just wanted to say was that there is seasonality in our earnings. And therefore, there is also seasonality in our capital generation. You shouldn't expect Q4, everything else being equal to be weaker than Q3 to put it that way.  And on private assets, we honestly -- we haven't had much regulatory pressure on this so much regulatory attention. I think regulators across the world are probably a bit more attentive to liquidity, notably on the life side. So private assets are part of that equation. But there is no strong pressure, no particular concern from regulators that we have seen.  And you saw that we had good net inflows at AXA IM Alts, notably on real estate. So that shows that investors are still willing to put more money in illiquid assets. Obviously, you have the denominator effect for a number of them which reduces their appetite for illiquid assets. But if you have a good platform, you still can benefit from this. \"},\n","   {'speaker': \"Dominic O''mahony\",\n","    'text': \"Can I -- sorry, just to clarify on the lapse and the CSM effect.

'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Michael Huttner',\n","    'text': \"I just had 2 follow-up questions. One is, I think you probably answered it, but I just want to double check what is the leverage now given you've reduced that by EUR 1.2 billion. And the other question is on Health in the U.K. It's almost like a personal question. I've got a relative saying it's greater thing buying a private insurance contract, basically because people buy it because they want to claim. It's not just in case I will claim. How close are you to managing this given that potentially you have a change in behavior here? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"So on leverage, Michael, you know that our denominator is around EUR 90 billion. So you have directly the impact with a EUR 1 billion nonrenewal of that debt. And on health in the U.K. So we believe it's a fundamental change in the market. And you know that our stance is that over time, it will be positive because it means fundamentally that the NHS will not be able to cover or to give coverage as much as in the past, and therefore, people will go more for private insurance, which also means that we need to design the right products so that they are affordable to a larger portion of the population.  But coming back to that change and impact on us short term, part of it will be dealt with pricing, and there's more to come. Very clearly, only a small part of our price increases have taken place in Q3. But part of it is also very much about the claims management and what we call pathways. In other words, how we manage the patients move from GP to specialists to analysis and so on in order both to deliver the best service for our customer and to reduce the cost for us. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Michael Huttner', 'text': 'Yes, [indiscernible] sorry.

So let me go through the key highlights of 1Q '24. And I think the sentence that said -- the result is that we have achieved a very good performance in this first quarter. We delivered strong organic growth across all our lines of business. P&C, Life & Savings, Health and Asset Management. And this is obviously very consistent with our new strategic plan, which we presented to you in February. So we are growing all our businesses, leveraging our attractive positioning, in particular in P&C, Commercial lines and employee benefits. And our growth initiatives are starting to contribute.\\n Overall, our total revenues increased by 6% to EUR 34 billion. Our balance sheet remain very robust with a Solvency II ratio at 229%, reflecting our strong capital generation capacity. And we also continue our actions on climate. We have recently strengthened the AXA for Progress Index targets across underwriting, investment and our own operations.\\n So let me now go through the key numbers of the press release, starting with P&C. P&C revenues are up 7% with growth both in Commercial and Personal lines. In Commercial lines, excluding AXA XL Re, we grew by 7%. And this was driven by favorable price effects across all markets as well as higher volumes, notably in Europe and at AXA XL.\\n At AXA XL insurance, in particular, prices were up 3% on renewables, which is a similar growth as last year's. So pricing is holding well. Excluding North America professional lines, pricing including exposure is slightly above loss trend. And as explained in February, there are different dynamics, and we are managing the cycle proactively. We see a continued hard market in short-tail lines, notably North America property, up 15%, while pricing is moderating in long-tail lines with plus 5% in casualty, but this remains above loss trends. And North America Professional lines, pricing remains soft and we remain focused on profitability.\\n In France and Europe, still in Commercial lines, we continue to see favorable pricing at plus 4% and plus 3%, respectively. And we also continue to see good demand from corporates across SMEs, mid-market and large risks. And this is driving growth in volumes. So we are well positioned to capture the structural growth in this market, including through our growth initiatives in white spaces, mid-market and new risk.\\n In Personal lines, revenues were up 6% with growth both in Motor and non-Motor, up 3% and 9%, respectively. Pricing was very strong overall at plus 10% across both Motor and non-Motor. In Motor, pricing continues to accelerate across geographies, notably in France and Europe, except for Switzerland. And this was partly offset by lower volumes and the change in business mix in the U.K. What we did, for the reasons you know, a full portfolio review, and we further strengthened our risk selection in addition to significant pricing actions.\\n Overall, in Personal lines, both frequency and severity are in line with our expectations in the first quarter. And therefore, we are confident in our margin improvement plan, which is, as you know, an important part of our 200 bps target for the improvement of our combined ratio in the plan.\\n Finally, in reinsurance, as you know, the rightsizing of property CAT lines were completed in '23. And in 1Q '24, the revenues were up 9% driven by both favorable price effects in Property & Casualty and higher volumes in Specialty.\\n One last point on nat cat and large losses. Group nat cat experience in the first quarter was below w the prorated annual budget, but we maintain our annual nat cat budget of 4.5 points of combined ratio for the year. And as for the large losses, we expect the potential impact from the Baltimore bridge to be nonmaterial at group level, i.e. less than EUR 100 million before tax.\\n Now moving to Life & Health. In Life, premiums were up 6% with very strong growth in capital-light G/A savings with 19% -- plus 19%, notably in Japan from strong sales of single premium Whole Life products and in Italy from the successful launch of a new product. We had also strong performance in Unit-Linked, plus 8%, driven by successful commercial campaigns across our distribution network and mainly in Italy and in France.\\n We also saw a positive trend in Protection, up 3%, notably from higher sales in Protection with Unit-Linked in Japan and in Europe, mostly from Switzerland. And lastly, in line with our strategy, premiums in traditional G/A savings were down 14%.\\n In Health, premiums increased by 7% to EUR 4.8 billion primarily driven by favorable price effects both in group and individual businesses across our main geographies. In the U.K., we continue to take pricing actions, which will be earned over time. But we are also, very importantly, rigorously implementing the claims pathways to triage claims in order to manage our claims cost. That, as you know, a very important aspect of our plan to improve profitability in our U.K. Health business.\\n On net flows. So we saw strong flows both in Protection and Health. That was particularly -- partly, sorry, offset by continued outflows in traditional G/A savings across most geographies, in line with our strategy. In aggregate, our surrender ratio remains broadly stable versus full year '23 and improved versus 1Q '23.\\n Moving on to new business. Life & Health, PVEP and NBV were up 14% and 6%, respectively. And this was attributable to the favorable impact of lower interest rates and good volume growth, as I just mentioned. New business CSM was up by 1%, impacted by the model changes that we implemented in full year '23. So as you know, we update assumptions only at 1H and full year. At full year '23, we updated assumptions in France, which had an unfavorable effect on the new business CSM. And this effect impacts 1Q numbers -- 1Q '24 numbers, but not the 1Q '23 that we reported. Therefore, the 2 periods are not directly comparable.\\n NBV margin was down 0.4 points, and that reflects the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates and the effect of the model changes I've just mentioned. And overall, our business mix in Life & Health remains at high quality.\\n One word on Inforce Management. As you've seen, the German transaction would not go through. There's been a significant change in market condition since the deal was announced, and that has caused both parties [indiscernible] to reconsider their position. So we have taken advantage of higher interest rates to close the duration gap, and there is now more value to the book today for us. The fact that we have terminated the transaction will have no impact on the targets disclosed by the group as part of its new strategic plan to unlock the future.\\n But you also saw that we announced today -- or yesterday, rather, that AXA Life Europe entered into a reinsurance agreement with New Re, a subsidiary of Munich Re Group, which will cover around EUR 3 billion of variable annuity reserves. This transaction is expected to result in a reduction of underlying earnings of around EUR 20 million per annum from '24 onwards. But as you saw in the press release, this will be compensated earnings per share-wise by a EUR 200 million share buyback.\\n Finally, in Asset Management, average assets under management increased by 2%, reflecting both favorable market effects and positive net flows. Net flows amounted to EUR 6 billion. We had strong inflows from third-party clients in both our core and our Alts platforms, and more particularly in real estate, which reflects AXA IM's superior performance track record in this asset class. Revenues were up 3% mainly driven by higher management fees due to an increase in average assets under management.\\n Last, word on Solvency II. So we continue to operate with a strong Solvency II ratio at 229% at the end of March, up 2 points versus full year '23. So that comes from plus 7 points from normalized capital generation, minus 5 points of accrued foreseeable dividends and annual share buybacks, plus 1 point from sub debt reflecting the issuance of EUR 1.5 billion restricted Tier 1 in January, but partly offset by the repurchase of around EUR 1.2 billion of sub debt through a tender offer. And as you know, we intend to maintain our stock of debt stable over the plan, minus 3 points from expected regulatory changes and plus 2 points from financial markets, mainly higher equity markets. So we're happy with our strong Solvency II ratio that reflects our capital-efficient business model.\\n So to conclude, we are off to a very strong start this year, and that's very consistent with our plan. And therefore, we remain confident in our strategy. We are very focused on the execution and the delivery of the new strategic plan targets. And that's all supported by the attractive and highly diversified business model, which allows to deliver predictable earnings growth.\\n I'm now happy to take your questions. \\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Will Hardcastle of UBS. \\nWilliam Hardcastle: It's tiny one actually, to do with -- if I look at the pricing premium, it looks like there's been volume reductions throughout the Personal lines book, Motor particularly. U.K. is enormous at a 50% price and 2% premium. You mentioned the mix shift there, Alban. I guess, is it -- is there any way that we can get an indication of how much the U.K. Motor volume has reduced? Because obviously, we'd -- you'd be looking in excess of 40%. But I assume that's not right. That would be really helpful. \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Will, for your question. In fact, there are 2 things  or 3, rather. Obviously, there is the very significant price increase that you saw. But it's also the fact that as we focus on the better risks, the average premium is also coming down even though we increased the prices because we let go of the worst risks. And so you have the very significant price increase, reduction in the average premium and a bit of loss of volume. But clearly, not the 40% you mentioned. We're losing significantly less customers than that. Is that clear? \\nWilliam Hardcastle: It is. I guess we're not going to get a -- sort of a 5% to 10%, 15% volume reduction, are we? Is that asking too much? \\nAlban Nesle: That's a bit asking too much, yes. \\nOperator: The next question is from Farooq Hanif of JPMorgan. \\nFarooq Hanif: I just wanted to ask a few questions. I'm sorry if it's more than 2. But can you talk about the cash impact of the new deal you've done with Munich Re on the VA book? So I mean, obviously, you're losing cash-positive that you would have got from the German back book deal, although that would have been obviously offset by buyback. But what's the cash impact of the Re deal?\\n Secondly, can you explain what the market conditions were that made you happy to keep it. I'm presuming it's interest rates. What would it take for you to look again at this back book? So either to sell it or to reinsure it, what would it take for you to sort of strategically change your mind on that?\\n And I just wanted to also ask about the commercial pricing momentum. So it feels like it's still kind of declining even if you take out U.S. professional lines in terms of the kind of the difference between pricing and loss cost trends. Would you kind of agree with that? And then what would you say is your kind of expectation for the rest of the year and also for 2025 in terms of the commercial pricing momentum to deliver your plan? \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you, Farooq. So the cash impact of the transaction on AXA Life Europe is that we'll be able to release EUR 250 million of capital that will be freed up by this transaction.\\n On the German transaction, so as you remember, the transaction was signed in '22. Over '22 and still in '23, interest rates increased, and we had discussions with Athora. We both honestly wanted to do this transaction, but given higher interest rates, there is more value to the book to us. As I also said, we managed to close the duration gap. And so expectations on both sides didn't meet. And at the end of the day, it was better for everyone to call it a day and to say, we're not anymore on the same lines. So let's decide to terminate.\\n So we find with holding the book but all our options are open. If somebody comes with a good price, the -- we wanted to sell 2 years ago, we might sell if we have a good offer. But as I said, given higher interest rates, given the right ALM and closed duration gap, it's not an issue if we keep the book.\\n And third, on the Commercial line pricing at XL, so the -- it's quite similar to the end of last year in the sense that, yes, U.S. professional lines are soft. That's very clear, which means that we are focusing on profitability, we are focusing on our current book of business, and we have increased the retention of our books of business. Because obviously, you have better profitability with your current customers rather than looking for new customers in such a market.\\n But for the rest, for all the lines, we see very good momentum. Bear in mind that at XL, there is obviously a biased to Europe in the first quarter. And the pricing momentum in Europe is good. And you saw it, around 5%, to make it simple. But it's even better in the U.S., where you see property still up 15%, like it was last year. But you also see some places in casualty also up significantly in the U.S. So that's why I said that overall, with that pricing dynamic, excluding North America Professional lines, we are slightly above loss trend still.\\n So what should we expect for '25? I don't see why the market should change abruptly in '25. We are coming to a place where prices increase with loss trend slightly above, could be in line. I don't see competitive pressure that would take the prices down or below loss trend at this stage, then '26 we'll see. And you know that, for the plan, our assumptions is that -- are that we maintain our margins at XL, playing with the various cycles of the various lines of business. \\nOperator: The next question is from Dominic O'Mahony of BNP Paribas Exane. \\nDominic O''mahony: So just 2, one is just to clarify something, Alban. I think you said -- it sounds like the margin recovery in Personal lines is very much on track and that ex financial lines pricing remains above loss cost trend. But should I infer from that including financial lines, pricing probably isn't ahead of loss cost trends? Is that a fair inference from what you're saying?\\n And then I just wanted to invite your thoughts on trends in North America casualty. I mean some of your North American peers seem to be adding to reserves for the more recent vintages, so 2020 onwards. Interested in your thoughts on how experience is running through the XL book on those more recent vintages. \\nAlban Nesle: So on your first point on North America financial lines, it's true that profitability, which -- I sound like a broken record on that one, which was extremely high, is now good on financial lines. And that's what matters to us. And as I said, we will manage this focusing on our customers rather than looking for new business at any price. That's not our sense.\\n So you -- I separate it from the rest because for us, this is a specific line with a specific dynamic. And exactly for your question on casualty, what matters to us is whether we are above loss trend in those other long-tail lines, and we are.\\n And on the casualty reserves, so as you know, we review our reserves twice a year, before half year and before full year. We had seen the change in the trend, I think, earlier than our competitors. And really, what matters for reserve is change in trends. And we have not seen over the last months a change in trends on casualty, and what I mean by that is we haven't seen an acceleration. Now we will do the reserve review in Q2, and we'll be able to tell you more at half year. \\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Crean of Autonomous. \\nAndrew Crean: Can I ask, I suppose 3 areas? One, could you go into a little bit more on -- detail on German motor as to what the severity and frequency trends are there and how that's stacking up? Secondly, could you say -- I know you said nat cats were below your pro rata rate. But if you baked in man-made or large losses in Baltimore bridge, are you basically on trend in the first quarter?\\n And then thirdly, could you talk a little bit about reinvestment rates? You've got quite a headwind, I think, on the sort of discounting amortization. But against that, there should be a decent pickup in the reinvestment rate on the portfolio. If you could talk a bit about that, that would be great. \\nAlban Nesle: Andrew, so on German motor, I think this is -- we are in line with our expectations. So we increased prices by around 17%. And at the same time, we saw no additional drift in frequency. So we -- the price increases that we have implemented allow to correct for the drift that we had last year without additional drift this year. So we are in line with our expectations. And I mentioned frequency because that was the issue last year, but we have no issue on severity here this year.\\n On nat cat and large losses. Large losses, before we had the Baltimore bridge claim, that was also a good quarter. And so nat cat plus large losses is also a good quarter. And on the reinvestment rate, so obviously, it's a mix of many currencies and notably, if we not forget that we can also invest in Japan and Switzerland. We invested at 3.8% overall over the first quarter. And obviously, it's a small positive compared to our expectations.\\n But if I broaden that, I think the way I would characterize the first quarter is that we have a good number of small positives, small positives on the reinvestment rate, notably on the dollar side, and therefore, on the discount rate; small positives in the pricing on retail, which is slightly better than expectations. So it's only Q1, obviously. But nevertheless, I think we -- as I said, we're off to a good start, thanks to all this. \\nAndrew Crean: What was the reinvestment rate in full year '23 against 3.8%? \\nAlban Nesle: It was around 4%, if I remember it well. It's slightly lower the -- for the first quarter. But the currency mix plays a role. And the other reason is that, for specific reasons, we focused for the first quarter on liquid assets. And so we didn't get the additional premium from illiquid assets, but we'll get that later in the year. \\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Sinclair of Bank of America. \\nAndrew Sinclair: First from me just a point of clarity on Baltimore bridge, less than EUR 100 million. Just can you give us a little bit of color in terms of the industry loss expectations for that? And if that industry loss goes higher, on cat rates or are there any other nonlinear elements we should be aware of for Baltimore bridge losses?\\n Second was just -- thanks for the commentary on the drop in contribution from new business, CSM, and the color on that year-on-year. But just looking at in particular in France, on the non-CSM/other new business value in France, that was a really big jump up 41% despite Protection GWP actually been slightly down year-on-year in France. Really surprised me a bit. Just can you take a little bit of color on that big jump in other new business value?\\n And then third for me was just on XL Re. I think the first time exposure seems to have grown in a long time. Is this just Specialty that you're interested in? Or do you have some appetite for growth in any other reinsurance lines as well? \\nAlban Nesle: Well, thank you, Andrew. So on your first question on the Baltimore bridge, so what we said about having a loss of less than EUR 100 million, it's based on the assumption that the industry loss is around $1.4 billion -- $1.5 billion in total. That being said, if the loss was to creep up to, say, $2.5 billion or $3 billion, I estimated that it would still be less than EUR 100 million for us because of the policy limits that we have. The only increase that we would get in our loss is the increase in the Reinsurance reinstatement premium that we would have to pay. So it is, in any case, capped to a low level.\\n On the new business value, this is new business, CSM at AXA France, if I understood correctly your question. A good part of it comes from the health part, which is in the NBV, but not in the NBV, [ ENV ] CSM. And on the NBV part, we have significantly increased prices and therefore margins. And that's probably the main reason why we increased the NBV in France. There's also a bit in Protection in volumes. But that's Health, which is really the issue -- no, not issue, the cause of the improvement.\\n And on the XL Re, I think what we want -- what we don't want to increase significantly is property cat. We want to be cautious on casualty reinsurance in the U.S. because we want to make sure that pricing -- local pricing reflects the profitability and the risks. But on other lines, we're happy to grow. \\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Huttner of Berenberg. \\nMichael Huttner: I'd be really quick because, I compliment all my peers. The questions and the answers are fantastic. It's -- on Health in France, in the U.K., can you give an idea of the speed of the improvement? Will we see it in -- already in H1 in terms of profits or H2? It sounds as if you've done a massive turnaround, but there's always this lag. \\nAlban Nesle: Well, thank you, Michael. Look, it's a transformation. It's not as easy or as quick as the recovery in German motor. Because as you know, it's about pricing, but it's mostly about the change in the way we manage claims, the pathways, the use, so to speak, of GPs. And so you will see some improvement already in wage, but we will be back to normal profitability, as we said, early '25 or by the end of this year. So that would be progressive. \\nMichael Huttner: And can you say how much it is, the swing factor, if you like, from, say, '23 to '25. \\nAlban Nesle: No. I mean what we expect in -- for the whole of '25 is to get back to the profitability we used to have until '22. \\nMichael Huttner: So about EUR 100 million, maybe EUR 200 million? Sorry, I'm pushing, but you're so generous today. I thought I'd try my luck. \\nAlban Nesle: Look, it's, let's say, between -- around EUR 150 million. \\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Eliot of Kepler Chevreux. \\nPeter Eliot: A couple of follow-ups, please, for me first. Firstly, just going back on the German deal. Just one -- sorry, try it a little bit more. Just are there any financial implications of the cancellation of that deal? And secondly, I appreciate the economics are now much better than they were a couple of years ago. Should we assume that the main change really is in the risk profile of the business? Or are the earnings looking a little bit better as well?\\n Then also a follow-up on U.K. Health, if I may. Appreciate how volume, as you said just now, it's not all about pricing. But if I do look at pricing and -- premiums were up 5% for Health Europe. And it doesn't sound like you've had outflows from the U.K. So I just -- it doesn't look like the pricing has been that strong, but I'm just wondering if I'm missing something there.\\n And finally, sorry, it's a little bit off topic, but just given your update on the ADC at the full year results, would you kind of remind us how much income you're currently giving away to Enstar and what your options are on that? \\nAlban Nesle: Sorry, I was writing down your questions. And thank you, Peter. So on the German deal, the financial implications are simply, I mean, compared to today, nothing. I mean we keep the earnings, which are a bit more than EUR 30 million. And we don't do the share buyback that we would have done, and we don't get the cash, which was roughly EUR 400 million. So net-net, we would have gotten EUR 200 million net cash that we're not getting. That's the difference. But we are -- we keep the EUR 30 million, EUR 35 million earnings from the book.\\n Again, if duration matched, it's okay. But if we were -- if we had decided to sell it, that's because it's not fully in line with the nature of the live books that we want to have. So we were happy to sell it for that reason. It's obviously in better shape now than 2 years ago, thanks to higher interest rates. But as I said, if we find a good offer, we could sell it.\\n On the U.K. Health pricing, you will see in H1 that we will have increased prices further because we've done another set of price increases in April. And on the ADC, I don't have the numbers with me. The team is telling me, what, EUR 20 million, it was? EUR 20 million per annum on the ADC. \\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from William Hawkins of KBW. \\nWilliam Hawkins: What is the movement in the SCR that contributes to the 7 points of operating Solvency change in the first quarter, please? And then can you just remind me, to the extent that you emphasized that it was a normalized capital generation figure, is it boosted by the light nat cats that you referred to or not?\\n And then secondly, please, when you were making reference to maintaining the stock of debt through the plan in the context of what you've just done in the first quarter, can you just remind me what your specific intentions are with regards to the grandfathered RT1s? Are you intending over the next couple of years to replace it? Because obviously, you can't replace it with allowable Tier 2? Or are you assuming that your Solvency ratio is so high that it doesn't matter if you allow for some deleveraging with the grandfathered debt drifting down? \\nAlban Nesle: Thank you. So on the SCR, within the plus 7 points, there is a minus 1 point from the impact of the business growth on our SCR. And there was no particular boost from nat cat. Nat cat was, as we said, a bit below the operated number but didn't  have a meaningful impact overall.\\n On our stock of debt, so we plan to maintain our stock of debt, absent M&A. That was clear in February. We plan to manage proactively our stock of grandfathered debt, but it doesn't mean that we will replace one for one, Tier 1 and Tier 2, by Tier 1 and Tier 2. We might use also some senior debt to keep the level of cash that we have and overall our gearing ratio. And that might have a slightly negative impact on our solvency, but we are talking potentially a couple of points. \\nOperator: We have no further questions. I will hand it back to Mr. de Mailly Nesle for any closing statements. \\nAlban Nesle: So thank you very much for joining this morning. As I said at the beginning, we are very happy with our numbers. Obviously, a bit disappointed with the German transaction. But on one hand, it's in good place now. We are open to options, and we are very happy with the transaction that we've done with Munich Re on AXA Life Europe. So we're overall happy with our Q1.\\n Thank you very much, and I'll see you at the latest in August for half year.\",\n","  'transcript_split': [{'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining the call today. So let me go through the key highlights of 1Q '24. And I think the sentence that said -- the result is that we have achieved a very good performance in this first quarter. We delivered strong organic growth across all our lines of business. P&C, Life & Savings, Health and Asset Management. And this is obviously very consistent with our new strategic plan, which we presented to you in February. So we are growing all our businesses, leveraging our attractive positioning, in particular in P&C, Commercial lines and employee benefits. And our growth initiatives are starting to contribute.  Overall, our total revenues increased by 6% to EUR 34 billion. Our balance sheet remain very robust with a Solvency II ratio at 229%, reflecting our strong capital generation capacity. And we also continue our actions on climate. We have recently strengthened the AXA for Progress Index targets across underwriting, investment and our own operations.  So let me now go through the key numbers of the press release, starting with P&C. P&C revenues are up 7% with growth both in Commercial and Personal lines. In Commercial lines, excluding AXA XL Re, we grew by 7%. And this was driven by favorable price effects across all markets as well as higher volumes, notably in Europe and at AXA XL.  At AXA XL insurance, in particular, prices were up 3% on renewables, which is a similar growth as last year's. So pricing is holding well. Excluding North America professional lines, pricing including exposure is slightly above loss trend. And as explained in February, there are different dynamics, and we are managing the cycle proactively. We see a continued hard market in short-tail lines, notably North America property, up 15%, while pricing is moderating in long-tail lines with plus 5% in casualty, but this remains above loss trends. And North America Professional lines, pricing remains soft and we remain focused on profitability.  In France and Europe, still in Commercial lines, we continue to see favorable pricing at plus 4% and plus 3%, respectively. And we also continue to see good demand from corporates across SMEs, mid-market and large risks. And this is driving growth in volumes. So we are well positioned to capture the structural growth in this market, including through our growth initiatives in white spaces, mid-market and new risk.  In Personal lines, revenues were up 6% with growth both in Motor and non-Motor, up 3% and 9%, respectively. Pricing was very strong overall at plus 10% across both Motor and non-Motor. In Motor, pricing continues to accelerate across geographies, notably in France and Europe, except for Switzerland. And this was partly offset by lower volumes and the change in business mix in the U.K. What we did, for the reasons you know, a full portfolio review, and we further strengthened our risk selection in addition to significant pricing actions.  Overall, in Personal lines, both frequency and severity are in line with our expectations in the first quarter. And therefore, we are confident in our margin improvement plan, which is, as you know, an important part of our 200 bps target for the improvement of our combined ratio in the plan.  Finally, in reinsurance, as you know, the rightsizing of property CAT lines were completed in '23. And in 1Q '24, the revenues were up 9% driven by both favorable price effects in Property & Casualty and higher volumes in Specialty.  One last point on nat cat and large losses. Group nat cat experience in the first quarter was below w the prorated annual budget, but we maintain our annual nat cat budget of 4.5 points of combined ratio for the year. And as for the large losses, we expect the potential impact from the Baltimore bridge to be nonmaterial at group level, i.e. less than EUR 100 million before tax.  Now moving to Life & Health. In Life, premiums were up 6% with very strong growth in capital-light G/A savings with 19% -- plus 19%, notably in Japan from strong sales of single premium Whole Life products and in Italy from the successful launch of a new product. We had also strong performance in Unit-Linked, plus 8%, driven by successful commercial campaigns across our distribution network and mainly in Italy and in France.  We also saw a positive trend in Protection, up 3%, notably from higher sales in Protection with Unit-Linked in Japan and in Europe, mostly from Switzerland. And lastly, in line with our strategy, premiums in traditional G/A savings were down 14%.  In Health, premiums increased by 7% to EUR 4.8 billion primarily driven by favorable price effects both in group and individual businesses across our main geographies. In the U.K., we continue to take pricing actions, which will be earned over time. But we are also, very importantly, rigorously implementing the claims pathways to triage claims in order to manage our claims cost. That, as you know, a very important aspect of our plan to improve profitability in our U.K. Health business.  On net flows. So we saw strong flows both in Protection and Health. That was particularly -- partly, sorry, offset by continued outflows in traditional G/A savings across most geographies, in line with our strategy. In aggregate, our surrender ratio remains broadly stable versus full year '23 and improved versus 1Q '23.  Moving on to new business. Life & Health, PVEP and NBV were up 14% and 6%, respectively. And this was attributable to the favorable impact of lower interest rates and good volume growth, as I just mentioned. New business CSM was up by 1%, impacted by the model changes that we implemented in full year '23. So as you know, we update assumptions only at 1H and full year. At full year '23, we updated assumptions in France, which had an unfavorable effect on the new business CSM. And this effect impacts 1Q numbers -- 1Q '24 numbers, but not the 1Q '23 that we reported. Therefore, the 2 periods are not directly comparable.  NBV margin was down 0.4 points, and that reflects the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates and the effect of the model changes I've just mentioned. And overall, our business mix in Life & Health remains at high quality.  One word on Inforce Management. As you've seen, the German transaction would not go through. There's been a significant change in market condition since the deal was announced, and that has caused both parties [indiscernible] to reconsider their position. So we have taken advantage of higher interest rates to close the duration gap, and there is now more value to the book today for us. The fact that we have terminated the transaction will have no impact on the targets disclosed by the group as part of its new strategic plan to unlock the future.  But you also saw that we announced today -- or yesterday, rather, that AXA Life Europe entered into a reinsurance agreement with New Re, a subsidiary of Munich Re Group, which will cover around EUR 3 billion of variable annuity reserves. This transaction is expected to result in a reduction of underlying earnings of around EUR 20 million per annum from '24 onwards. But as you saw in the press release, this will be compensated earnings per share-wise by a EUR 200 million share buyback.  Finally, in Asset Management, average assets under management increased by 2%, reflecting both favorable market effects and positive net flows. Net flows amounted to EUR 6 billion. We had strong inflows from third-party clients in both our core and our Alts platforms, and more particularly in real estate, which reflects AXA IM's superior performance track record in this asset class. Revenues were up 3% mainly driven by higher management fees due to an increase in average assets under management.  Last, word on Solvency II. So we continue to operate with a strong Solvency II ratio at 229% at the end of March, up 2 points versus full year '23. So that comes from plus 7 points from normalized capital generation, minus 5 points of accrued foreseeable dividends and annual share buybacks, plus 1 point from sub debt reflecting the issuance of EUR 1.5 billion restricted Tier 1 in January, but partly offset by the repurchase of around EUR 1.2 billion of sub debt through a tender offer. And as you know, we intend to maintain our stock of debt stable over the plan, minus 3 points from expected regulatory changes and plus 2 points from financial markets, mainly higher equity markets. So we're happy with our strong Solvency II ratio that reflects our capital-efficient business model.  So to conclude, we are off to a very strong start this year, and that's very consistent with our plan. And therefore, we remain confident in our strategy. We are very focused on the execution and the delivery of the new strategic plan targets. And that's all supported by the attractive and highly diversified business model, which allows to deliver predictable earnings growth.  I'm now happy to take your questions. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Will Hardcastle of UBS. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'William Hardcastle',\n","    'text': \"It's tiny one actually, to do with -- if I look at the pricing premium, it looks like there's been volume reductions throughout the Personal lines book, Motor particularly. U.K. is enormous at a 50% price and 2% premium. You mentioned the mix shift there, Alban. I guess, is it -- is there any way that we can get an indication of how much the U.K. Motor volume has reduced? Because obviously, we'd -- you'd be looking in excess of 40%. But I assume that's not right. That would be really helpful. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Will, for your question. In fact, there are 2 things  or 3, rather. Obviously, there is the very significant price increase that you saw. But it's also the fact that as we focus on the better risks, the average premium is also coming down even though we increased the prices because we let go of the worst risks. And so you have the very significant price increase, reduction in the average premium and a bit of loss of volume. But clearly, not the 40% you mentioned. We're losing significantly less customers than that. Is that clear? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'William Hardcastle',\n","    'text': \"It is. I guess we're not going to get a -- sort of a 5% to 10%, 15% volume reduction, are we? Is that asking too much? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle', 'text': \"That's a bit asking too much, yes. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'The next question is from Farooq Hanif of JPMorgan. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'Farooq Hanif',\n","    'text': \"I just wanted to ask a few questions. I'm sorry if it's more than 2. But can you talk about the cash impact of the new deal you've done with Munich Re on the VA book? So I mean, obviously, you're losing cash-positive that you would have got from the German back book deal, although that would have been obviously offset by buyback. But what's the cash impact of the Re deal?  Secondly, can you explain what the market conditions were that made you happy to keep it. I'm presuming it's interest rates. What would it take for you to look again at this back book? So either to sell it or to reinsure it, what would it take for you to sort of strategically change your mind on that?  And I just wanted to also ask about the commercial pricing momentum. So it feels like it's still kind of declining even if you take out U.S. professional lines in terms of the kind of the difference between pricing and loss cost trends. Would you kind of agree with that? And then what would you say is your kind of expectation for the rest of the year and also for 2025 in terms of the commercial pricing momentum to deliver your plan? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you, Farooq. So the cash impact of the transaction on AXA Life Europe is that we'll be able to release EUR 250 million of capital that will be freed up by this transaction.  On the German transaction, so as you remember, the transaction was signed in '22. Over '22 and still in '23, interest rates increased, and we had discussions with Athora. We both honestly wanted to do this transaction, but given higher interest rates, there is more value to the book to us. As I also said, we managed to close the duration gap. And so expectations on both sides didn't meet. And at the end of the day, it was better for everyone to call it a day and to say, we're not anymore on the same lines. So let's decide to terminate.  So we find with holding the book but all our options are open. If somebody comes with a good price, the -- we wanted to sell 2 years ago, we might sell if we have a good offer. But as I said, given higher interest rates, given the right ALM and closed duration gap, it's not an issue if we keep the book.  And third, on the Commercial line pricing at XL, so the -- it's quite similar to the end of last year in the sense that, yes, U.S. professional lines are soft. That's very clear, which means that we are focusing on profitability, we are focusing on our current book of business, and we have increased the retention of our books of business. Because obviously, you have better profitability with your current customers rather than looking for new customers in such a market.  But for the rest, for all the lines, we see very good momentum. Bear in mind that at XL, there is obviously a biased to Europe in the first quarter. And the pricing momentum in Europe is good. And you saw it, around 5%, to make it simple. But it's even better in the U.S., where you see property still up 15%, like it was last year. But you also see some places in casualty also up significantly in the U.S. So that's why I said that overall, with that pricing dynamic, excluding North America Professional lines, we are slightly above loss trend still.  So what should we expect for '25? I don't see why the market should change abruptly in '25. We are coming to a place where prices increase with loss trend slightly above, could be in line. I don't see competitive pressure that would take the prices down or below loss trend at this stage, then '26 we'll see. And you know that, for the plan, our assumptions is that -- are that we maintain our margins at XL, playing with the various cycles of the various lines of business. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': \"The next question is from Dominic O'Mahony of BNP Paribas Exane. \"},\n","   {'speaker': \"Dominic O''mahony\",\n","    'text': \"So just 2, one is just to clarify something, Alban. I think you said -- it sounds like the margin recovery in Personal lines is very much on track and that ex financial lines pricing remains above loss cost trend. But should I infer from that including financial lines, pricing probably isn't ahead of loss cost trends? Is that a fair inference from what you're saying?  And then I just wanted to invite your thoughts on trends in North America casualty. I mean some of your North American peers seem to be adding to reserves for the more recent vintages, so 2020 onwards. Interested in your thoughts on how experience is running through the XL book on those more recent vintages. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"So on your first point on North America financial lines, it's true that profitability, which -- I sound like a broken record on that one, which was extremely high, is now good on financial lines. And that's what matters to us. And as I said, we will manage this focusing on our customers rather than looking for new business at any price. That's not our sense.  So you -- I separate it from the rest because for us, this is a specific line with a specific dynamic. And exactly for your question on casualty, what matters to us is whether we are above loss trend in those other long-tail lines, and we are.  And on the casualty reserves, so as you know, we review our reserves twice a year, before half year and before full year. We had seen the change in the trend, I think, earlier than our competitors. And really, what matters for reserve is change in trends. And we have not seen over the last months a change in trends on casualty, and what I mean by that is we haven't seen an acceleration. Now we will do the reserve review in Q2, and we'll be able to tell you more at half year. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'The next question is from Andrew Crean of Autonomous.

One, could you go into a little bit more on -- detail on German motor as to what the severity and frequency trends are there and how that's stacking up? Secondly, could you say -- I know you said nat cats were below your pro rata rate. But if you baked in man-made or large losses in Baltimore bridge, are you basically on trend in the first quarter?  And then thirdly, could you talk a little bit about reinvestment rates? You've got quite a headwind, I think, on the sort of discounting amortization. But against that, there should be a decent pickup in the reinvestment rate on the portfolio. If you could talk a bit about that, that would be great. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Andrew, so on German motor, I think this is -- we are in line with our expectations. So we increased prices by around 17%. And at the same time, we saw no additional drift in frequency. So we -- the price increases that we have implemented allow to correct for the drift that we had last year without additional drift this year. So we are in line with our expectations. And I mentioned frequency because that was the issue last year, but we have no issue on severity here this year.  On nat cat and large losses. Large losses, before we had the Baltimore bridge claim, that was also a good quarter. And so nat cat plus large losses is also a good quarter. And on the reinvestment rate, so obviously, it's a mix of many currencies and notably, if we not forget that we can also invest in Japan and Switzerland. We invested at 3.8% overall over the first quarter. And obviously, it's a small positive compared to our expectations.  But if I broaden that, I think the way I would characterize the first quarter is that we have a good number of small positives, small positives on the reinvestment rate, notably on the dollar side, and therefore, on the discount rate; small positives in the pricing on retail, which is slightly better than expectations. So it's only Q1, obviously. But nevertheless, I think we -- as I said, we're off to a good start, thanks to all this. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Crean',\n","    'text': \"What was the reinvestment rate in full year '23 against 3.8%? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"It was around 4%, if I remember it well. It's slightly lower the -- for the first quarter. But the currency mix plays a role. And the other reason is that, for specific reasons, we focused for the first quarter on liquid assets.

'},\n","   {'speaker': 'Andrew Sinclair',\n","    'text': \"First from me just a point of clarity on Baltimore bridge, less than EUR 100 million. Just can you give us a little bit of color in terms of the industry loss expectations for that? And if that industry loss goes higher, on cat rates or are there any other nonlinear elements we should be aware of for Baltimore bridge losses?  Second was just -- thanks for the commentary on the drop in contribution from new business, CSM, and the color on that year-on-year. But just looking at in particular in France, on the non-CSM/other new business value in France, that was a really big jump up 41% despite Protection GWP actually been slightly down year-on-year in France. Really surprised me a bit. Just can you take a little bit of color on that big jump in other new business value?  And then third for me was just on XL Re. I think the first time exposure seems to have grown in a long time. Is this just Specialty that you're interested in? Or do you have some appetite for growth in any other reinsurance lines as well? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Well, thank you, Andrew. So on your first question on the Baltimore bridge, so what we said about having a loss of less than EUR 100 million, it's based on the assumption that the industry loss is around $1.4 billion -- $1.5 billion in total. That being said, if the loss was to creep up to, say, $2.5 billion or $3 billion, I estimated that it would still be less than EUR 100 million for us because of the policy limits that we have. The only increase that we would get in our loss is the increase in the Reinsurance reinstatement premium that we would have to pay. So it is, in any case, capped to a low level.  On the new business value, this is new business, CSM at AXA France, if I understood correctly your question. A good part of it comes from the health part, which is in the NBV, but not in the NBV, [ ENV ] CSM. And on the NBV part, we have significantly increased prices and therefore margins. And that's probably the main reason why we increased the NBV in France. There's also a bit in Protection in volumes. But that's Health, which is really the issue -- no, not issue, the cause of the improvement.  And on the XL Re, I think what we want -- what we don't want to increase significantly is property cat. We want to be cautious on casualty reinsurance in the U.S. because we want to make sure that pricing -- local pricing reflects the profitability and the risks.

And thank you, Peter. So on the German deal, the financial implications are simply, I mean, compared to today, nothing. I mean we keep the earnings, which are a bit more than EUR 30 million. And we don't do the share buyback that we would have done, and we don't get the cash, which was roughly EUR 400 million. So net-net, we would have gotten EUR 200 million net cash that we're not getting. That's the difference. But we are -- we keep the EUR 30 million, EUR 35 million earnings from the book.  Again, if duration matched, it's okay. But if we were -- if we had decided to sell it, that's because it's not fully in line with the nature of the live books that we want to have. So we were happy to sell it for that reason. It's obviously in better shape now than 2 years ago, thanks to higher interest rates. But as I said, if we find a good offer, we could sell it.  On the U.K. Health pricing, you will see in H1 that we will have increased prices further because we've done another set of price increases in April. And on the ADC, I don't have the numbers with me. The team is telling me, what, EUR 20 million, it was? EUR 20 million per annum on the ADC. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': '[Operator Instructions] The next question is from William Hawkins of KBW. '},\n","   {'speaker': 'William Hawkins',\n","    'text': \"What is the movement in the SCR that contributes to the 7 points of operating Solvency change in the first quarter, please? And then can you just remind me, to the extent that you emphasized that it was a normalized capital generation figure, is it boosted by the light nat cats that you referred to or not?  And then secondly, please, when you were making reference to maintaining the stock of debt through the plan in the context of what you've just done in the first quarter, can you just remind me what your specific intentions are with regards to the grandfathered RT1s? Are you intending over the next couple of years to replace it? Because obviously, you can't replace it with allowable Tier 2? Or are you assuming that your Solvency ratio is so high that it doesn't matter if you allow for some deleveraging with the grandfathered debt drifting down? \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Alban Nesle',\n","    'text': \"Thank you. So on the SCR, within the plus 7 points, there is a minus 1 point from the impact of the business growth on our SCR. And there was no particular boost from nat cat. Nat cat was, as we said, a bit below the operated number but didn't  have a meaningful impact overall.  On our stock of debt, so we plan to maintain our stock of debt, absent M&A. That was clear in February. We plan to manage proactively our stock of grandfathered debt, but it doesn't mean that we will replace one for one, Tier 1 and Tier 2, by Tier 1 and Tier 2. We might use also some senior debt to keep the level of cash that we have and overall our gearing ratio. And that might have a slightly negative impact on our solvency, but we are talking potentially a couple of points. \"},\n","   {'speaker': 'Operator',\n","    'text': 'We have no further questions.
