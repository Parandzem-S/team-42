So in short, yes to both questions. So yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back 3 quarters is still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth.   Obviously, there's the wildcard of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the SKU and the CECL distribution and so on. And we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So if you guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine. But we're narrowly just saying that, based on the card loan growth, that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year. \",\n          \"It's Christian. Let me start with your questions, and then James can obviously contribute. Look, what makes us confident is, first of all, the overall positioning and foundation, which we have built over the last 4 or 5 years as a Global Hausbank to our clients, the momentum -- the development in all 4 businesses, feedback from clients. To be honest, in all the last 3 or 4 years, we not only met our revenue targets, but even exceeded that in the years really makes me confident that from the offering we have from the positioning we have is actually the right starting point also for the next years. And that feedback, Nicolas, we get continuously back from our clients, be it institutional clients, corporate clients and private clients. And let me also say that, in particular, the geopolitical items which we are facing in this world, in this regard, to be honest, support us, people want our advice. Corporates talk to us on their amended networks. So the mandates we get from the corporate side, from the institutional side, is, again, something which really makes me confident and is on a level which we haven't seen before. Now to the bridge from \\u20ac30.1 billion, to be honest, to \\u20ac32 billion. What makes me confident and how do we see that? I would really kind of divide that in three parts: Number one, it's \\u20ac400 million coming from NII, and that is obviously reflecting the hedging which we have already put in place. This will, in particular, come from the PV and the CV side. And on top of that, we see also the growth in our fixed financing. So that is approximately \\u20ac400 million, which we will see also the good work which we have done on the treasury side with our business. So that is locked in. Now the next thing is, and we always talk about, so to say, the more predictable business we see approximately \\u20ac800 million, if not even a bit more, from the more predictable business. And that, in particular, is the Private Bank, Asset Management and the Corporate Bank. Now in those, you have approximately \\u20ac400 million from the Corporate Bank. That, again, comes from active repricing monetizing our existing clients, scaling the business which we have invested in. If you look into our investment, which we have done in '23 -- in '24, but in particular, looking at the investment plan for '25, a high degree and partially the highest amounts in those years and in particular, in 25% goes into the Corporate Bank to really scale up our offering. And you have seen the overall development of the corporate bank, which is at the core of our franchise. And therefore, I can see at least this \\u20ac400 million of uptick in the year 2025. And again, if I look at the mandates, which we are constantly winning how the year started, I'm very optimistic here. The other \\u20ac400 million is in particular coming from the PB and asset management side. And here, a lot of prework has been done. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about the growth in the assets under management on both sides, the private bank and the asset management side. So obviously, with the fees generated out of that, we will see higher returns. There is no drag on the NII side. I talked about the initial \\u20ac400 million. So therefore, we can clearly see with the increased volume, higher revenues. Last but not least, I also said that in the discussions before, which we had on a quarterly side, there is a lot of momentum also in Germany, actually in the retail bank I think Germany, one of the biggest problems and challenges we have is actually with our pension plans in the next years. And more and more, this is -- these are the discussions, which we have with our clients. And again, then applying that to 15 million Postbank clients now being on our IT platform is a huge opportunity for us and [indiscernible] is banking on that. That brings us those \\u20ac2 billion to \\u20ac1.2 billion. So you are kind of at \\u20ac31.2 million, \\u20ac31.3 billion. Where is the rest coming from? \\u20ac500 milion to \\u20ac600 million, in particular, in the Investment Bank from the O&A business. I think James and I talked a lot about that over the last 18 months. We did on purpose the investments in the middle of 2023, not only Numis, but in particular, also the hirings of senior directors in the Corporate Finance business. I think we could show with the growth rates in 2024 that this started to pay off. I'm really proud what [indiscernible] has done in that business. Look at the Q4 numbers in the O&A business. We clearly outperformed the market. And I can see that this momentum is going on. So we believe that actually in the O&A market, we can increase our market share by approximately 50 basis points to approximately 3 percentage points. And then I also do believe that actually the fee pool, in particular, given what is happening in this world with the growth momentum we see in the U.S. will be higher next year. But the real impact the majority of the \\u20ac500 million to \\u20ac600 million is clearly coming from now that the investments are fully paying off and that we increase our market share. Now that already brings us almost very close to the \\u20ac32 billion. I haven't talked about the FIC business because, obviously, in particular, [indiscernible] is not standing still. We have done significant investments, in particular, in Latin America, but also North America in our business. watch the credit trading business, also with the recent hires, which we have done summer last year and obviously, which we are paying off more and more. And therefore, I do believe that we have also a chance to grow there. So in this regard, that is the bridge for us from \\u20ac30 million to \\u20ac32 billion. Obviously, the confidence level, which James and I have and Fabrizio and Claudio is also sparked by a first good month. Now we know we cannot rest here, 1 month is 1 month. But the overall momentum in this bank to drive this, the feedback from the clients also last week in Davos is clearly telling me this is achievable, and I'm sure we can show you that already at the end of April. Second part on the share buybacks. Look, I do believe that James and I have also -- have always managed this bank in a prudent and conservative way, i.e., in particular, to your question, \\u20ac1 billion to \\u20ac750 million. First of all, I'm really happy with the starting point in which we start into this measurement here of 2025, 13.8% capital ratio gives us actually the ammunition, on the one hand, to grow business and have the right resources. That's all in our plans. But at the same time, obviously, also reward our shareholders. With the \\u20ac750 million, which we announced and we should not forget that the 50% increase in dividends, we actually announced to the market already a distribution of \\u20ac2.1 billion for this year. I think it's a wonderful starting point. And actually, if you move that up, we are now at \\u20ac5.4 billion. If we think about our past, which we gave to the market in particular with regard to growing our distribution and also the dividends and you apply the next increase on the dividends for next year, you are already very, very close to the \\u20ac8 billion. Now I think -- and that's what our approach is. Let us deliver on our business execution in the next month to deliver the 10% return on equity. Of course, we will review our distributions in the course of the year on the basis of our performance as, at the end of the day, we know that we also want to reward the shareholders, but I think it's a good and prudent start into the year. And let me end also with one thing, absolute confidence that we will do that what we promised to you to distribute more than \\u20ac8 billion in the years '21 to '25, including the payouts in '26.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"message_final\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"model_output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1013,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['NII', 'NO LEVEL', 'ACCELERATE', 'ANSWERED', 'Beta', 'NO LEVEL', 'INCREASE', 'ANSWERED', '2.5 billion', 'NO LEVEL', 'STABLE', 'ANSWERED', '87', 'NO LEVEL', 'DECREASE', 'ANSWERED']\",\n          \"['NII', 'NO LEVEL', 'NO TRAJECTORY', 'ANSWERED', 'non-NII', 'NO LEVEL', 'NO TRAJECTORY', 'ANSWERED', 'funding', 'NO LEVEL', 'NO TRAJECTORY', '6%', 'ANSWERED', '9%', 'ANSWERED', 'deposit base', 'NO LEVEL', 'NO TRAJECTORY']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Step 4.3.

So in short, yes to both questions. So yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back 3 quarters is still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth.   Obviously, there's the wildcard of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the SKU and the CECL distribution and so on. And we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So if you guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine. But we're narrowly just saying that, based on the card loan growth, that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year. \",\n          \"It's Christian. Let me start with your questions, and then James can obviously contribute. Look, what makes us confident is, first of all, the overall positioning and foundation, which we have built over the last 4 or 5 years as a Global Hausbank to our clients, the momentum -- the development in all 4 businesses, feedback from clients. To be honest, in all the last 3 or 4 years, we not only met our revenue targets, but even exceeded that in the years really makes me confident that from the offering we have from the positioning we have is actually the right starting point also for the next years. And that feedback, Nicolas, we get continuously back from our clients, be it institutional clients, corporate clients and private clients. And let me also say that, in particular, the geopolitical items which we are facing in this world, in this regard, to be honest, support us, people want our advice. Corporates talk to us on their amended networks. So the mandates we get from the corporate side, from the institutional side, is, again, something which really makes me confident and is on a level which we haven't seen before. Now to the bridge from \\u20ac30.1 billion, to be honest, to \\u20ac32 billion. What makes me confident and how do we see that? I would really kind of divide that in three parts: Number one, it's \\u20ac400 million coming from NII, and that is obviously reflecting the hedging which we have already put in place. This will, in particular, come from the PV and the CV side. And on top of that, we see also the growth in our fixed financing. So that is approximately \\u20ac400 million, which we will see also the good work which we have done on the treasury side with our business. So that is locked in. Now the next thing is, and we always talk about, so to say, the more predictable business we see approximately \\u20ac800 million, if not even a bit more, from the more predictable business. And that, in particular, is the Private Bank, Asset Management and the Corporate Bank. Now in those, you have approximately \\u20ac400 million from the Corporate Bank. That, again, comes from active repricing monetizing our existing clients, scaling the business which we have invested in. If you look into our investment, which we have done in '23 -- in '24, but in particular, looking at the investment plan for '25, a high degree and partially the highest amounts in those years and in particular, in 25% goes into the Corporate Bank to really scale up our offering. And you have seen the overall development of the corporate bank, which is at the core of our franchise. And therefore, I can see at least this \\u20ac400 million of uptick in the year 2025. And again, if I look at the mandates, which we are constantly winning how the year started, I'm very optimistic here. The other \\u20ac400 million is in particular coming from the PB and asset management side. And here, a lot of prework has been done. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about the growth in the assets under management on both sides, the private bank and the asset management side. So obviously, with the fees generated out of that, we will see higher returns. There is no drag on the NII side. I talked about the initial \\u20ac400 million. So therefore, we can clearly see with the increased volume, higher revenues. Last but not least, I also said that in the discussions before, which we had on a quarterly side, there is a lot of momentum also in Germany, actually in the retail bank I think Germany, one of the biggest problems and challenges we have is actually with our pension plans in the next years. And more and more, this is -- these are the discussions, which we have with our clients. And again, then applying that to 15 million Postbank clients now being on our IT platform is a huge opportunity for us and [indiscernible] is banking on that. That brings us those \\u20ac2 billion to \\u20ac1.2 billion. So you are kind of at \\u20ac31.2 million, \\u20ac31.3 billion. Where is the rest coming from? \\u20ac500 milion to \\u20ac600 million, in particular, in the Investment Bank from the O&A business. I think James and I talked a lot about that over the last 18 months. We did on purpose the investments in the middle of 2023, not only Numis, but in particular, also the hirings of senior directors in the Corporate Finance business. I think we could show with the growth rates in 2024 that this started to pay off. I'm really proud what [indiscernible] has done in that business. Look at the Q4 numbers in the O&A business. We clearly outperformed the market. And I can see that this momentum is going on. So we believe that actually in the O&A market, we can increase our market share by approximately 50 basis points to approximately 3 percentage points. And then I also do believe that actually the fee pool, in particular, given what is happening in this world with the growth momentum we see in the U.S. will be higher next year. But the real impact the majority of the \\u20ac500 million to \\u20ac600 million is clearly coming from now that the investments are fully paying off and that we increase our market share. Now that already brings us almost very close to the \\u20ac32 billion. I haven't talked about the FIC business because, obviously, in particular, [indiscernible] is not standing still. We have done significant investments, in particular, in Latin America, but also North America in our business. watch the credit trading business, also with the recent hires, which we have done summer last year and obviously, which we are paying off more and more. And therefore, I do believe that we have also a chance to grow there. So in this regard, that is the bridge for us from \\u20ac30 million to \\u20ac32 billion. Obviously, the confidence level, which James and I have and Fabrizio and Claudio is also sparked by a first good month. Now we know we cannot rest here, 1 month is 1 month. But the overall momentum in this bank to drive this, the feedback from the clients also last week in Davos is clearly telling me this is achievable, and I'm sure we can show you that already at the end of April. Second part on the share buybacks. Look, I do believe that James and I have also -- have always managed this bank in a prudent and conservative way, i.e., in particular, to your question, \\u20ac1 billion to \\u20ac750 million. First of all, I'm really happy with the starting point in which we start into this measurement here of 2025, 13.8% capital ratio gives us actually the ammunition, on the one hand, to grow business and have the right resources. That's all in our plans. But at the same time, obviously, also reward our shareholders. With the \\u20ac750 million, which we announced and we should not forget that the 50% increase in dividends, we actually announced to the market already a distribution of \\u20ac2.1 billion for this year. I think it's a wonderful starting point. And actually, if you move that up, we are now at \\u20ac5.4 billion. If we think about our past, which we gave to the market in particular with regard to growing our distribution and also the dividends and you apply the next increase on the dividends for next year, you are already very, very close to the \\u20ac8 billion. Now I think -- and that's what our approach is. Let us deliver on our business execution in the next month to deliver the 10% return on equity.

And let me end also with one thing, absolute confidence that we will do that what we promised to you to distribute more than \\u20ac8 billion in the years '21 to '25, including the payouts in '26.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"message_final\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"model_output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1013,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['NII', 'NO LEVEL', 'ACCELERATE', 'ANSWERED', 'Beta', 'NO LEVEL', 'INCREASE', 'ANSWERED', '2.5 billion', 'NO LEVEL', 'STABLE', 'ANSWERED', '87', 'NO LEVEL', 'DECREASE', 'ANSWERED']\",\n          \"['NII', 'NO LEVEL', 'NO TRAJECTORY', 'ANSWERED', 'non-NII', 'NO LEVEL', 'NO TRAJECTORY', 'ANSWERED', 'funding', 'NO LEVEL', 'NO TRAJECTORY', '6%', 'ANSWERED', '9%', 'ANSWERED', 'deposit base', 'NO LEVEL', 'NO TRAJECTORY']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":33}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Step 4.3.
