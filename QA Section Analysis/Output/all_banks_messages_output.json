    "text": "Good morning everybody. Congratulations on a great set of numbers. I've got two questions. If we look at Barclays' businesses, clearly, there's been a tailwind from higher interest rates. But also, as you mentioned, there has been a market share and investment story over some time, which does imply that structurally, the RoTE potential has improved. However, the RoTE hurdle is unchanged. So I just wanted an updated thinking from you on that RoTE hurdle. Do you think greater than 10% adequately reflects Barclays' cost of equity? And if not, I was just hoping to explore your thinking on what you think the barriers are to giving a more challenging hurdle? And if you think it does need to be fine-tuned, whether you're considering any Investor Days in the future to do that. And my next question is just on capital generation. So historically, Q1 has been the trough for capital generation. Can I just check, it sounds like that's expected to be the case this year. And are there any specific headwinds on capital that you called out? And conceptually, it does seem that the interim buyback has not been larger than the full-year buyback. Is that something that is applied as a rule? Or is there no particular constraints on what interim buyback can be relative to the full-year? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thanks, Omar. It's Venkat. So let me answer the first question and Anna will take the second one. Look, you're absolutely right that our businesses have delivered strong double-digit returns across the spectrum. And this reflects quality and breadth of performance across the group, which reflects the investments we've made over a number of years. And the 15% RoTE for this first quarter, in my opinion, is a very serious down payment on the target, which is above 10%. So that -- it's above 10% means 10% is a floor. It is not a ceiling. It is not reflecting the extent of our ambition. We -- our view is with this strong start, we are very comfortable and we expect to meet that target of above 10%.",

    "text": "Yes, sure. Omar, you're right. We said that in the past. Typically, it is what we expect that Q1 is a lower point in our capital generation and trajectory for the year just because of seasonality. Obviously, all of that is prior to any distribution or buyback. Equally, we'll come back and consider that buyback when we come back to the half year. That's the cadence that we've established. We don't have hard and fast rules. And we'll look both at our expected capital print at that point in time, but also our expectations of capital generation in the second half when we do so. Thank you. Can we go to the next question, please?",

    "text": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, Anna, it's not enormous within the Group context. But I wondered whether we could explore the loan loss charge in Barclays U.K. for Cards. Stage 1 -- sorry, Stage 2 and 3 balances are down. You talked of the higher degree of transactors in the book. Unemployment hasn't risen. So I just wonder whether there was a preemptive component to that charge? Or is this the sort of run rate before the economy starts to sort of noticeably slow at a headline level? And then secondly, perhaps Venkat, for you. I mean, the Barclays implied cost of equity is above 20%. Some firms in that position have decided to not grow the balance sheet at all, the likes of Unicredit and StanChart, for example, and drive perhaps bigger buybacks. I appreciate it's easier to run a bank where revenues are going up and banking is a fixed cost per volume gain. But I just wonder whether you could sort of simply talk about whether the valuation of the bank affect your attitude to growth. Sort of how much would you expect RWAs to expand given the share price and the market environment that we find themselves in? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thanks, Jason. Our impairment charge in the first quarter, both for the Group and for the individual businesses, is as we expected it to be. And what's really driving that charge, Jason, is two things. The first is that the cards book is 40% lower than it was pre-pandemic. So you need to take that into account when you're comparing this to what I would describe as the historic growth rate for BUK. The second thing is that the credit environment and credit behavior is actually benign. So we're seeing very conservative behavior from our customers. They're repaying at extremely high levels. They're managing their volumes very carefully, and you're seeing that come through in a low impairment print. Clearly, as the economy recovers, we might see that rise. But we would also expect to see credit card income rise at the same time because, obviously, those two things are strongly linked, but not a surprise to us. Venkat?",

And what you see is that we are running our business for the long-term. And when you run that business for the long-term, you obviously hope that the stock price will ultimately recognize the value of those businesses. And so what we are aiming to do is to create a series of a set of businesses, operate them well, run them efficiently, manage our risks well and produce numbers. Some quarters will be better than others, but we hope we could do this kind of thing very steadily. And then that will be recognized and reflected in the stock price. Capital return is an important part of that strategy, just as investment is an important part of our strategy. And we take our capital return very, very seriously, and we will balance it with the investment needs of an ongoing business that we expect to be successful.",

    "text": "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick one. Your Slide 10 on the hedge income is rather interesting because effectively, if you just assume your 375 average Q1 level of swap rates versus the yield, you're looking at somewhere south of about a £7 billion gap. So it's a very big number, considering that the market only expects you to grow your revenues in the U.K. bank by about £300 million, £25 million on 2023. And I wouldn't have thought that assuming rates -- assuming that number stays flat, right, so theoretical, I wouldn't have thought that mortgage pricing and deposit mix shift would have eaten up the bulk of that. So I just wonder your thoughts there because it seems like there's still an incredible amount of momentum behind the hedge repricing, the obvious caveat of where swap rates go, but we're actually sitting here higher today than 375.",

And I think what it highlights is that we have got structural hedge momentum, and we've seen that actually fairly repeatedly over the last few quarters. And you've seen that, particularly in our BUK NIM bridge. And it's one of the reasons that we are calling out that we still expect our BUK NIM to continue to rise in the current environment despite the product dynamics that you call out. And it really underpins the guidance that we've given you already of a greater than 320 NIM. So it's as we expected it to be Joe and fairly consistent over the last few quarters.",

    "text": "Hi, thank you very much. And good morning. I had a couple on CIB revenues and costs, please. Firstly, on CIB revenues. I mean congratulations here on a particularly strong performance. I think that's very commendable given the tough prior-year comps that you had. And I was wondering if I could just ask in terms of the trends on the corporate side in particular. So lending was better quarter-on-quarter, which I presume is just primarily fewer marks. And then Transaction Banking was a little bit weaker quarter-on-quarter. So I was just wondering if you could help us understand firstly, what's happened in the first quarter? And then secondly, how we should think about that -- those two revenue lines for the remainder of the year? And then the second was on costs. You mentioned Q1 is the high point for both CIB and group costs. I think particularly about the CIB. Is that particularly relating to the compensation accrual and maybe the SRF contribution in the first quarter? Or is there something around the phasing of either investment spend or cost savings that we should think about as well as the year progresses? And then I guess the conclusion from sort of both of those is strong revenue performance, but jaws in the CIB was still minus 14% in Q1. How should we think about that for the year as a whole? And more broadly, how are you managing that business in terms of costs and revenues?",

    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Rohith. It felt like there were about 10 questions in there, but I'll try and remember them all. So just on the first one on corporate lending. Remember, there are a few things in there. There's corporate lending itself, then there's the cost of our first loss protection, there's a leverage loan mark, and there's also the cost of the hedges against our leverage pipeline. So the quarter-on-quarter movement that you see is really caused by two of those. You're right, it's the marks. So we've taken no material marks this quarter. The second point, though, is if you recall from the full-year, we said that we managed down our leverage loan pipeline. We've continued to do that again in Q1. And therefore, the scale of those hedges, it's smaller and therefore, the costs are smaller. And that's really what's moving that line. On the Transaction Banking side, the reduction in income is coming from a couple of things largely you'll see that the balances are broadly stable. But remember, during the quarter, actually what happens in Transaction Banking typically as we see corporate dividends being paid in the first quarter. So the average balance tends to dip down and then grow towards the back end of the quarter. And also remember, you've got fewer business days within Q1. So you've got 90 business days versus 92, I think. So that has an impact on any kind of banking income. Taking all of that together and going forward, I think we expect our CIB NIM, which we very rarely talk about, to be broadly flat for the year. And the reason I say that is you've obviously got deposit migration going on within Transaction Banking. But we feel like that's very well progressed. And on the other side, you've got actually quite helpful asset mix going on within corporate because in the current environment, there's slightly higher levels of both trade and sales finance, which are slightly higher margins. So overall, that NIM is pretty stable. And with an expanding franchise, we think that's useful for the future. On the CIB cost point, this is largely a seasonality point. So you're right, we accrued compensation costs in line with revenue and returns on the CIB. So you're seeing a higher level there. You're also seeing the SRS, so the European levy, which is a Q1 event, but is higher year-on-year. And in scale terms is about £90 million. And you're seeing a fairly consistent run rate in terms of investment that's underpinning the growth that Venkat said. So that's why we're saying we expect it to sort of tick down from here. We're very focused on returns in that business. You can see that the cost income ratio at 55% is actually better, I think, than the market expected despite that increase in cost. So it's very deliberate on our part. And of course, we start to deliver positive in this business. But at this point in the cycle, we're in an investment phase. But hopefully, that gives you a bit more color.",

And I guess, there's an argument that you prefunded the instrument that's callable in September in the overall stat at nearly £14 billion, I think is higher than you would ordinarily look to run with. So can you talk a little bit about how you feel with regard to AT1 issuance over the rest of the year and whether specifically you can still call that September instrument without refinancing it? The second question is just on this Barclays U.K. NIM. The 21 basis points drop in the quarter due to product margins. I mean, obviously, the hedge keeps on giving something like 13 basis points every quarter. For the next few quarters, sooner or later, the bank rate elements tend to drop away. So thinking about the balance between these two, it would be helpful if you could give me a sense of how much of that 21 basis points is coming from the component part of mortgage refinancings, deposit migration. And I guess in Q1, whereas an element related to the actual losses deposits as well, that would be helpful. Thank you.",

    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. I'll take both of those. Yes, you're right. We issued AT1 in the first quarter, two very successful AT1s in the U.K. and actually in Singapore. We typically operate with a surplus of AT1 in our capital stack. We do that deliberately in part to give us flexibility -- in part to give us flexibility around, for example, FX volatility that we might encounter, but also because we deploy it flexibly into our markets business, where despite the fact that the cost of that AT1 is higher than the Tier 2. Obviously, the returns in the markets business are sufficiently high to make that a good economic trade for us. So that's why we typically run with a surplus. We have got a call opportunity later in the year. We assess every call in line with the economic circumstances at that point in time. So we'll be looking at that very carefully as we ordinarily would. So no change there. On the Barclays U.K. NIM, 318 in the quarter, up eight basis points. That is as we expected. And the product migration again is as we expected. And as we were talking about at the full-year, we haven't given a split of that by business, Jonathan. But the larger part of it in mortgages. What's happening there is it's just a portfolio effect of the fact that most mortgages that are maturing this year were written in 2021, where asset margins were wider than they are now. We have seen some deposit migration. That's within our expectations. As you can see, we haven't moved our product hedge on the retail side. So that 21 basis points is not a surprise to us. I'll just remind you that as the year progresses, we expect to see continued hedge momentum. We expect that migration to continue, but we also expect to see some modest treasury tailwinds as we called out at the full-year, and it's really taking all of those pieces together. That means that we are confident in our guidance of greater than 320 for the year.",

Could you perhaps elaborate on the dynamics on that book. I would presume the quality of that book is not quite as strong as the rest of your very good quality card portfolio. So can you maybe give us kind of the coverage ratio on that portfolio and how it compares to the rest of the book to help us gauge what stage migration or normalization of these sales might mean for impairments in the coming quarter? And then on costs, thanks for the helpful guidance on Q1 being a high point for the group and for CIB. I presume that struck off a certain revenue assumption. And if you had a really strong revenue performance, you might very understandably not hold yourself to that guidance. So could you share any more details on what those assumptions are that go into the guidance, in particular, anything on revenue or what sort of market backdrop you're assuming on the CIB?

    "text": "Okay. Guy, why don't I have a go at those. So when you purchase a portfolio, you purchase it at Stage 1. So when we acquired Gap, it was all Stage 1. As Gap has started to season and started to mature and grow, we see some natural migration into Stage 2. That means that customers are starting to borrow more. We've got new customers coming on to the box exactly as we expected. If you use your credit card more than you did previously, you might progress to Stage 2 even though you're showing no signs of delinquency. That's just the way IFRS 9 works. So it's within our expectations. And in terms of sort of coverage of NIM, we don't disclose individual partner ratios, whether that be delinquency or NIM. But what I will tell you is that we manage each partner individually. We manage them on a risk-adjusted return. The Gap is a very good quality portfolio. But it is a retail portfolio, and we typically expect the risk -- the cost of risk to be higher in that type of portfolio than we would in an airline one, but we would also expect the NIM to be higher. So overall, think of this as us managing a risk-adjusted return. So even though impairment might be higher, we'd also expect NIM to be higher. So that hopefully deals with the first question. On the second one, the easy bit is, yes, around £90 million in absolute terms on the IFRS. It doesn't move around a little bit, not quite as mechanistic as the bank levy in the U.K. But that is up year-on-year, which I think we've talked about in the slides. From here on in, we have -- we obviously have an expectation of performance. Let me try and help you with that. We've given you, I think, clear guidance in terms of how we expect costs to move from here. We've also, by inference, given you some income guidance because we've given you a cost-income ratio expectations for the year. So hopefully, that will be somewhat helpful in getting you to the range of income that we expect, albeit at group level. The only other thing I would say is that the guidance we've given is based on the FX rate. It's also based on our current expectations of a normal seasonal profile in CIB revenues and driven very much by the performance costs underpinning that. So hopefully, that's helpful. And next question, please.",

On the deposits, it's great to see that you saw sort of deposits up actually, and we've seen quite different reports from some of your peers and overall. Can I just maybe sort of press you to -- you mentioned the flight to quality, but I don't know if you can size that flight to quality like some of the U.S. players have done. And more importantly, going forward, and I'm thinking here in particular in BUK, what would you expect the deposits to do from here? Do you continue to expand to slip or more stability? And the second question is more of a follow-up on the previous question on markets. You mentioned, Anna, that you're kind of expecting a normal seasonality that FICC was very, very strong on a very strong comp. So maybe to give us some comfort or some more color, could you maybe talk us through Q1 if a lot of that was March volatility? Is it more consistent that gives you the confidence for that normal seasonality? Thank you.",

    "text": "Hi, Alvaro, I'll take the questions. So the first one on deposits. You're right. I mean, we've gone up a little over the quarter, £10 billion. We saw a normal seasonality within the BUK deposit base, which has a very slight shrinkage. And that was due to basically people paying their taxes. The broad point within the U.K. context is that it has not seen the movement across banks that you've seen in the U.S. because there's not been the kind of deposit pressure you've got in the U.S. from some of the very large regional banks having problems. So in the U.S., it's very much a function of that regional bank issue and the movement from regionals to the big money center banks. You don't have that in the U.K. So it's been behaving the way we would expect it to in the first quarter, and we'd expect that same seasonal trend in the second quarter. Where we have seen a bit of inflow is in what we would call our treasury deposits, we've called it out, which are basically corporates around the world placing deposits, stand deposits with us, which is -- it's a nice thing to have. It's a show of confidence. And so that is what's been driving it. And I would say, otherwise, in the U.K. context, think of it as just the normal seasonal slow. Coming back to markets, I'll say two things. As far as the first quarter goes, it was a case of great volatility in fixed income markets both before March and in March, right? So if you remember, in the early part of the year, interest rates started rising. And then there was a big view that actually that things were going to -- that the Fed was going to stop making having interest rate rises after a certain point. And there's a bunch of sort of shall we say, bearish trade on rates and bullish trades on spreads in January. That reversed in March. So you see volatility. But I think the important thing what I would like to say about our FICC franchise is that our market share has continued to grow in that franchise. And as it has in equities over a number of quarters and years based on deepening client relationships, investment in technology, investment in people, right? So I expect as we go forward in the next quarter and the one after that for that market share to be sustained, if not to grow. And we did well in the first quarter of this year. We did -- in the second quarter, I'll also remind you that Q2 of '22 was a very strong point of comparison with the volatility that you had post structure in Europe. I mean, so far, you've not seen that in this quarter.",

On the structural hedge, you said in the slide that about two-thirds of the hedge income is coming through in the U.K. But where does the other one-third get booked by business, please? And how much of that will be coming through the Transaction Banking line? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much growth we should expect there. Are you able to guide this all, please, on your expectations for revenues for the corporate lending and Transaction Banking line? I know you don't generally talk about the revenue outlook, but I would hope that those lines might be a little bit forecastable. And I think that was a source of the beat in the quarter versus consensus. So perhaps we're missing something there. And then on the BUK side of things, in terms of the mortgage book, could you give us a sense, please, of where you're writing new business today versus where the average spread on the back book is in terms of what's rolling?

    "text": "Okay. Let me take those, Chris. So the majority of the rest of the structural hedge does appear in Transaction Banking. There's a little bit in the private bank. But as you can imagine, much less given its scale and also given that those are much more interest-sensitive balances. So that's where you see it going. That's in part driving the NIM in the CIB up year-on-year. And then there's another smaller part from assets, which I called out before, from the sales and trade finance side on that. In terms of corporate lending, I called out before, we've seen some movement quarter-on-quarter because we haven't taken marks because the pipeline is much lower., From here, let's see where that goes, but it's certainly much recovered on the prior-quarter. We've given some guidance on this line before, but just remember the other thing that's in there is our SRT costs, so our first loss protection costs. If I take all of that together, actually our corporate income is pretty stable. And the reason I say that is you're seeing a NIM that's stable for reasons that I said before. You're seeing good balance growth coming through. Actually, we've seen some year-on-year corporate lending growth as well. So as an outlook, it's performed. And as you say, a lot more stable than some of the other parts of the CIB. So we're pretty confident in its outlook. I think the other thing I'd just call out is we've obviously seen quite a lot of deposit migration there already. If I contrast the sort of three different deposit franchises we have, we've seen most migration in private banking, as you'd expect, a lot in corporate and probably less in personal. So hopefully, that gives you some guidance there. And in terms of BUK mortgages, we don't talk about specific margins. That's not something we ever disclosed. But if you're looking for the effects of the compression, I would say mortgage margins have been relatively stable, and they're pretty consistent across the market given the very competitive nature of it. And if you were to look back at the spread over swap in '21, then you're going to see that compression effect quite clearly, I think. Hopefully, that's helpful.",

On the transactional banking side, you've got two things going on there. You've got hopefully potential further growth coming from the expansion in Europe, but also the U.K. franchise.

BUK is now making around a 20% return. And I guess, if I look at your forecast or your guidance, you're going to expect that to go up from here, so probably mid-20s or even higher. That's I guess double what you're targeting for the group as a whole. And just like that business in recent years, you've been ceding market share in some of your key areas. And I wonder, at what point do you start to think that, actually, that is an area now where we should be putting more capital in and start trying to gain share, particularly in things like credit cards, deposits, that type of stuff. And actually, because it would seem that, that would make logical sense, given you look at the sort of the profitability mix of the business as a whole. So that was the key question. And I guess related to that. I see that, and it maybe be part of the answer. BUK costs were up 9% year-on-year. Is that the sort of cost growth? It's quite punchy. Is there sort of one-off in there? Or should we be expecting that sort of cost growth for the year as a whole? Thanks very much.",

    "text": "Thank you very much. So let me begin with the first part of it, and I'll ask Anna to talk a little about cost growth, about costs. So you're right, the profitability of the RoTE of BUK is 20%. We are not making any statement about how that would grow quarter-on-quarter. I think what you're seeing is the impact of, on the one hand, rising interest rates. On the other hand, especially when you look at the mortgage business and the NIM, we've spoken about those dynamics. So you see that all coming together and producing good numbers. I'll make two statements about just our market positioning in BUK. We aim and continue to be a sort of a full-service bank across small businesses, retail, mortgages, credit cards, everything. What you've seen is risk positioning on our side, particularly in credit cards since around Brexit, a little after that, where we have backed off from some of the longer-term balance transfer offers and sort of the two aspects of them. And you're seeing a prudent risk positioning. We will assess that as we assess all risk positioning over time depending on facts and circumstances, how the economy grows, and we will make those changes. So it's not a question of ceding or gaining market share. It's a question of just managing the risk profile of the book. And that's what you should see it as. At the same time, if you look at our Kensington mortgage acquisition from last year, what that is, is about building a capability for issuing mortgages or offering mortgages to people with complex incomes. It's something we felt we needed. And we will build that capability, and that will be part of the [indiscernible] items. I'll turn it to Anna for cost.",

As I said, you're right that if you look at the trailing credit behavior, it has been fairly benign. And we continue to see what you continue to see in the U.K. consumer is a resilience to the shock of higher energy costs, resilience to the shock of higher mortgage rates and managing the overall inflation. Now we will watch it month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter and we will make our decision. So it's not something that we sort of decide annually and it's put cost in stone at that point.

And the example I'd give you is actually our card book. So we stepped back into promotional balances. We're very thoughtful about where we position ourselves. But that sort of balanced transport -- transfer business takes a while to season through and get interest earning lending. So there's a little factor from there. And also the way that we are rebuilding our cards portfolio, we're obviously investing a lot in new products like the product, which is more fee-based and probably a slightly different demographic sector. So there's a lot of activity in there, I would say, for new growth forward as well. Just moving to costs. BUK is in the midst of a transformation. We talked about that a few times. And essentially, what we're doing is we're generating efficiencies, which are absorbing inflation, and then we are also reinvesting them into future transformation. So the kind of thing we're doing is we are obviously changing our physical footprint to your branches but more flex locations with simplifying our product stack with digitizing all of the journeys. So there is some quite heavy investment phases happening in there. That means the cost profile can be a bit lumpy. I wouldn't call out anything specific in Q1, but it's not a steady state is what I'd say. To help you from here, Venkat mentioned Kensington. So you should expect some integration costs from Kensington in Q2. But thereafter, you're going to start to see a cost profile that reflects the transformation starting to come through. So hopefully, that gives you a view of how we expect things to pan out this year and maybe a bit of background on the nature of the cost.",

You previously last quarter talked about the financing revenues being more stable and an example of where you gained market share that you think you can keep, but I was just interested in that comment specifically in the footnote, it sounds like there's an element of one-off nature in Q1 '23.

But financing right, any of the business is really has impact from balances, from spreads and from seasonality. What we're seeing in Q1 is continued good growth in client balances that reflects the investments that we put down that we talked about today. The spreads do reflect the macroeconomic environment. So for example, in Q1, we saw very conducive spreads in our fixed income financing business, given the rate of volatility. But we actually saw a bit of compression in prime because of the reduction on the equity side. The reason that we called out inflation in particular is that there are some positions within our fixed income financing business that are linked to inflation. And we're calling it out just to be helpful. They're not one-off. But the reason that I'm calling them out is that in a lower inflationary environment, we might expect them to generate less income. So -- and then the final thing I would say, Andy, is just this business is quite seasonal. So it tends to be heavier in the first couple of quarters just because of dividend season and then also tends to sort of be a little bit lower in the second half. Actually, you can see that in the disclosures from some of our peers is given the disclosures for quite a lot loan growth. So hopefully that will help you shape it but it's not a one-off but we are just calling out simply because of its scale in that particular quarter. But underlying that, we're seeing 10% growth, which we think reflects the investment that we've made.

It has been 5 years ago, the question that was asked of us was should you have one. And If you had one, would it be any good? And I think we've shown that it's important for us to have one. It's a great diversifying business, and we're pretty good at it. We are the top-ranked European investment bank, so in markets penetrating. However, I also recognized that at approximately 60% to 70% of the bank, it is much more important now to grow the bank that's outside of the investment bank and to get a better balance overall in due course. Now having said that, within the investment bank, there are some relatively attractive RoTE businesses, such as financing and prime. And we have been within the investment bank investing a lot in those.

So -- and that is both around liquidity and credit risk appetite. So you'll know that Barclays U.K. has a lower loan-to-deposit ratio than some of its peers. And we've managed our credit extremely carefully within Barclays U.K. as we do obviously, across the group. And it's part of the group risk appetite that we focus on, obviously, we've got global opportunities to place risk and many varieties of it. So I think risk is a large part in the way we manage that risk. But of course, it's also about the cost base, which is what the transformation in Barclays U.K. is about. So we're extremely focused on cost and efficiency, and we are working extremely hard on our physical and digital footprint and the benefits that, that gives to our customers. So what you see at the moment is us reinvesting the benefits of that transformation to make it go faster. But over time, we would expect to see the cost-income ratio of the business to trend diverse.

But I wondered if you could be a bit more precise on the yields that these things are coming off because you've got GBP 100 billion to GBP 120 billion in maturities over those 2 years makes a big difference if the average yield on the maturities of 1% versus 2%. The range could be as wide a GBP 1 billion or so. I'm also just a supplementary to that, wondering where all the hedges that were written in 2020 when the 5-year swap rate was close to 0. Where are those -- when are those coming off? And I thought there'd be a bunch of those in 2025. The second question is a more broader one on distributions. In particular, going forward, the sort of split of the free capital generation that goes towards dividends versus buybacks. I mean we can all understand you want to do a lot of buybacks over the next few years at this rating. The consensus dividend payout ratio is about 27%, I think, over the next 2 or 3 years. And as an argument, I suppose, the payout ratio could be a bit higher than that. I mean ultimately, cash in pocket today is just as important as enhanced cash and pocket in a few years' time. So thoughts around the distribution split between dividends and buybacks moving forward would be great so...",

    "text": "Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. Just picking up the first one, I'm glad you like the slide. So we're talking about Slide 18 here. What that shows is that we've seen a strong pickup in yield from FY'22 to '23. So our income has gone from GBP 2.2 billion to an expected GBP 3.6 billion this year. And your question is really, how that flows from here? Difficult to be completely precise about the maturing yield because it does impact on how much we roll into your calculation. But what I would say is that it's probably at the lower end of the range for 2024 and in the range for 2025. Typically, these are about 5 year swaps. So you're going to see the benefits coming through of 2020 vintage sort of from '25. On your broader question, the way we think about it is we want a progressive dividend, which is why you've seen us grow the dividend at the half year, year-on-year. So that's up by 20% year-on-year. And that's really -- that should demonstrate to you our confident in our ability to distribute capital consistently from here, but we want to be able to supplement that from time to time with a buyback, as you said, particularly given where the valuation of the bank is right now. And so at this point in time, we together these to around GBP 1.2 billion of distribution at the half year, which is 5% of our current market cap. So hopefully, that will underline to you our commitment to return capital to shareholders in dividend and in buyback.",

In BUK, I think they felt about GBP 4 billion or GBP 5 billion in the quarter, presumably that includes some outflows in current accounts and interest-bearing site accounts and the inflows into time so perhaps you could help us understand those moves in terms of the mix of deposits, either at Box U.K. or at group level. And then as we look forward, it sounds like you expect that had been to persist at maybe current levels, whereas one of your peers noted the experience thus far in Q3 was maybe a little bit better than May or June and thought that less base rate movement less prompts for customers to move money. So I just wonder if you share those sort of news or not, it sounds like maybe you're embedding slightly more conservative there. And then on the CIB, I guess we've become quite accustomed to top line beats and market share gains, the market for quite a while. This quarter was a little bit soft. I just wondered if you had anything into that, and you need to change or pivot mindful you've got a strategy review in the background?

And actually, what we're saying at this point in time is the migration behavior is broadly as we expected it to be. What we're seeing is that customers are holding a lower level of deposits and they're doing that for very positive and proactive reasons.  We think that the approach for that behavior is 3 things: Firstly, rates have risen beyond the level that any of us expected. Secondly, inflation is much higher and more persistent than we expected; and thirdly, mortgage rates are obviously higher than they have been at any point other than a brief period in the third quarter of last year. So our customers are sensitive to these higher levels of interest rates, but not actually in the way that consensus is assuming, it's manifesting itself and then using their deposits proactively to manage their financial position, and we're seeing the benefit of that in our impairment. So we said in the scripted comments that over 1/4 of our customers are using that excess deposits to pay down their mortgages in advance of a fixed rate change. We think that's the right thing for them to do. And whilst it will impact on income, it's also going to impact our impairment. Because those 3 factors of rates, inflation and indeed mortgage rates we expect to persist, we also expect this deposit behavior to persist into the third quarter. And really, that underpins much of the guidance that we've given you around the forward path for BUK [indiscernible] from here. Hopefully, that gives you some clarity on how we are thinking about it.

So our performance is consistent with that of the U.S. peers. We are very much in the middle of the [indiscernible]. And there's a little bit of a stylistic story in it. If you look at fixed income, where we're off just a little more. We had an excellent quarter in the second quarter of 2022. We also -- this was a quarter in which securitized products, which is an area of growth for us has done very well. So banks with big securitized products businesses did better than those without. And equities volatility was a little bit more muted, and we have a very derivatives heavy business. And banking has been fine. As I said in my remarks a few minutes ago, ranking share increase in the U.K. and Germany continue to maintain our global ranking. So I think if I take a slightly longer-term view, we continue to aim to gain market share with our biggest client, which is a specific objective of ours. We continue to do well within markets and in banking. And then the last thing I want to point out in terms of the diversification of the business and referring to the question that was asked earlier, I think from Jason about the CIB. If you look our transaction banking numbers and our corporate banking overall has been doing extremely well. So that part of the business, which is in part related to transaction volume, in part related to interest rates, but it's also in part related to just play good old fee income has been doing very well. So net-net, you put it all together, that's what leads to a CIB with double-digit ROTE and a continued accumulation and holding of market share.",

Anna, you mentioned, I think, just now around the -- it's really the deposit balances that are driving the structural heads down and the margin guidance down in the U.K., you've reduced around GBP 4 billion. And is that the run rate of reduction in deposits we -- that you might expect for the next few quarters that we should expect for the next few quarters? And I guess, more than related to the level of rates is obviously a level rates, but I guess clients are focusing on their rollover of mortgages, so it could last a bit longer than just with rate movements when base rate moves. Is that a fair observation, the GBP 4 billion run rate and it's more to do with the level of rates and then the movement of rates? And then the second question, also a follow-up on the strategic review and Venkat, some of the points you've made during the call of growing sort of balancing the business a bit more outside the investment bank. Obviously, the obvious part of the business to grow is U.S. cards, given I'm not sure there's a lot of room in the U.K. When I think about it, that's quite a capital-intensive business and there are some global peers that are pulling back actually from growing cards and payments. Is that the idea to deploy more capital become bigger in the U.S.? Or is it also an option of taking capital outside the investment bank to distribute? Is that another way of balancing the business?",

    "text": "So the disclosure that we've given you on the structural hedge is actually for the group as a whole. We've included it in that Barclays U.K. section just because of the impact and the link it has to Barclays U.K. NIM. But that reduction in the hedge that you're seeing quarter-on-quarter actually relates to our corporate business as it has done in prior quarters. And really, what we're doing there is I think we've described before the way we build the hedge we identify the rate insensitive balances and then we maintain a buffer and it's -- we maintain a buffer when we put the hedge together. What we're doing in corporate is we are very conservatively maintaining that platform in the current environment. Again, I think we've spoken before about the fact that our corporate businesses or our corporate clients were really very proactive in moving their deposits and really it's a continuation of that previous story. Today, we haven't actually changed the role of our hedge within the retail book. Of course, we are very focused on that every single month. But I'd just remind you that because of the way that we roll this hedge very mechanically, we have the opportunity every month to reassess it and pause or reduce the size of the roll. So we've got plenty of room and plenty of time to adjust it. But to date, in retail, we have not had the need to do that. And secondly, the pickup in this hedge in '24 and '25, we would expect to be pretty strong, simply given the amount that we got maturing indeed the yield on that maturing level. So that will impact the U.K. will also impact the broader bank, but that's what you should read from Page 18 as opposed to any specific concern about the level of BUK deposits.

So I think 1 way to look at is CIB, non-CIB the way I prefer to look at it is to continue to improve -- to increase the amount we have of fee-paying relatively capital light businesses. There are a couple that exist within the CIB. As I've mentioned to you, transaction banking is one of them. Our financing business is one of them, but there are many outside the CIB. And as far as -- and you should therefore look for us to continue to put an emphasis on fee-paying relatively capital light businesses. I think we would like to grow cards, but I would actually also like to increase the capital efficiency in our cards business and that's something we're spending some time on. So it's not just growing at current RWA density, but growing in a more efficient way. And that's an important feature.

    "text": "So let me start your first question, which was about the quarter-on-quarter movement in CCP. This is largely about U.S. card. I wouldn't link it directly to J curves or anything specific around the momentum in that business. There are some small FX impacts. There's also a little bit of seasonality in there. We typically expect slightly higher income in Q1 and Q4 just because of the patterns of holiday spending in the U.S. I think the other point, though, just to note is that we have seen an improvement in risk performance I would say, real risk performance quarter-on-quarter. And that's coming from a couple of things. It's from the stabilization of the delinquency trends. It's also from the fact that Gap is now fully embedded and is seasoning out and performing well in line with our expectations. So we're seeing that in the impairment line, as you can see that we also see it in the income line because it impacts these. So overall, very happy with it. It's going in the right long-term direction. This is a business that we want to grow as Venkat said. So I wouldn't read too much into the quarter-on-quarter movement. On your particular point around presentation, we hear you. Actually, there are two important businesses within CC&P and we are quite reflective about how we might think about and present those in the future. U.S. cards is obviously 1 of them. We'd also call out Wealth and Private Banking, which we've now brought together into a single division. So we'll reflect on that and update you in prior in subsequent quarters, but we are very thoughtful about it. And then to your second question, we're not seeing any real difference in deposit trends following the exit of Q2. It's been fairly consistent actually through Q2 and into Q3 so far. As I said, the trends that we're observing, we don't believe are different to those of the industry. The one that's a bit different from our expectations, does this use to sort of more current account deposits, I would say, simply customers proactively managing their financial situation. So I wouldn't call out any specific impact on the hedge.",

And we want to prioritize that. And so that's a big part behind continuing with the dividend program and the buyback program at GBP 750 million.

Is that the right way to think about the shape of the headwinds is the first question? And then secondly, back on the structural hedge phase.

    "text": "Thank you, Ben. So you're right about mortgage margins at the moment. The mortgage market is very competitive, very focused on refinancing. That means that spreads remain attractive relatively thin. We don't see that changing much through 2023. Remember, we know exactly who is maturing this year and what rate they're on. And in fact, in the disclosure that we've given you is that many of them have already refixed already. So we've got a very good view about what the forward impact of that is. We would expect it to be much less, probably largely neutral actually in 2024 because what we're really seeing at the moment is the vintage written in 2021, which was on much wider margins and on 2-year fixes, it's that's rolling off, really. So by the time we get into 2024, we'd expect the impact of mortgage compression to be much more neutral. And in many respects, the margin story for 2024 is much simpler, which leads me to your second question. It's a bit early to give very precise guidance around 2024. What I would say though is the following: Given the scale of maturities that we have and the yield on those maturities, we would expect a strong pickup. And clearly, we would expect that to mitigate any continued depositor behavior that we see through 2024. So I would expect it to provide a stabilizing effect as we go into 2024, noting again that mortgages will be broadly neutral and actually base rates, we would expect to be broadly neutral. So it's really a much simpler picture in margin terms in '24.",

    "text": "So let me talk about our deposit assumptions for 2023 first. So as I said, in Q2, we've seen that sort of increased proactivity from our customers. We expect that to continue into Q4 into Q3 rather. And by the time we get to Q4, normally what happens is we actually see a build of deposits in Q4 because people stand up on their way into the holiday period. We're not assuming that this year, but we are assuming the movement in deposits will somewhat stabilize in the fourth quarter. So that's our version of that seasonal effect in this forecast. So what we're expecting in NIM term is that for the NIM to step down in Q3 and then be a bit more stable into Q4. And remember, we've got really good visibility on the hedge. So of the GBP 3.6 billion in gross income this year, we've already locked in GBP 3.3 billion of it. We know who our mortgage customers are and when they're going to refinance. So really, what we're doing here is answering 3 questions. The first is, what happens if and when base rates go up again. And we are clearly saying that we expect that to not have a positive impact on NIM, it might actually be slightly negative. And that's because at these rates and beyond, we'd expect pass-through to be high. The second question we have is around deposits, and I'll just told you what we think. Sets down again in Q3, somewhat stable thereafter into Q4. The third and really important question is, what do we expect to happen to unsecured lending? In the current environment and given the proactivity that we see from our customers, we are not assuming that, that is going to grow. You're seeing some headline growth, but that's not interest earning growth. Now as I say, this is having some downward pressure on our BUK NIM, but it is also impacting the impairment, and we are seeing very strong low levels of impairments coming through in BUK. Hopefully, that gives you a bit more clarity I think...",

Having spent a lifetime in credit markets, what I will say to you is the NIM you want is not the highest NIM but the best kind of NIM. The one that balances your return with risks of credit impairment. We think we increasingly see the evidence that we've got a very good kind of NIM because what you are seeing is a reduction in it, but reduction for the right reasons. And the reasons are that people are using extra balances to pay off mortgages and reducing the impairment risk on the portfolio. So as you think through these numbers and as you think through our credit portfolio, I would urge you to keep it in mind because that's the way Anna and I think about it. And that's the way we've been targeting and developing and shaping the credit profile of this bank.",

And that's come down slightly over the past couple of quarters. So is transaction banking now, is that margin piece done and this is now a kind of volume-driven revenue line? That would be the first one. And then just on cost management in CIB. So costs have been coming down, but they've not kept pace with the revenue trends. I was just wondering how we should think about the cost trajectory there going forward. Is this -- should we expect the investment spend to drop out at some point or efficiency improvements to kick in? Or is this more about market share gains and revenue growth and market recovery going forward, so the revenue line more than the cost line?",

    "text": "And thank you for the question, which, of course, is on another very strong NIM story for Barclays. So the one we talk about a lot is Barclays U.K., which is half of our net interest income, corporate is a quarter of it and CC&P is the other quarter. So thanks for the question. What's happening in transaction banking is continued stability in deposits. These are very long sticky relationships with our corporate clients. We've seen earlier migration there as we would expect, that's a bit more stable now. And really, what you're seeing over the last couple of quarters is, they're both slightly odd in the data. So Q1 is relatively small in business days. Q2 has got more calendar days, but fewer business days because of the bad holidays that we have through May. So it's actually a slightly odd quarter. So we saw probably fewer fees coming through there because of the fewer business days, but higher deposit income because of the more calendar days, if you can decode all of that. But just stepping back from all of it, given that it's based on corporate relationships and given that our structural hedge also impacts this business, we see it as being pretty stable actually as an income line. And corporate lending is a much cleaner picture this quarter as well because it doesn't have any leverage loan marks in it. So that's a much closer picture to what I would expect that to be a clean quarter. On CIB costs, we've clearly been investing in our CIB for the reasons that then cuts gone through. What you're seeing at the moment is that, that cost trajectory around investments is reaching maturity really. And what you're seeing over time is the income growth whilst there might be difference this quarter to quarter, that income growth is coming through behind it. So you're seeing what were quite strict negative jaws now alleviating somewhat. I won't talk about specific quarters, Rohith, but clearly, our objective here is for this business to have strong returns and cost income ratio is a key part of that. So we are focused on it. And you'll see that it's part of our overall story, but we don't think that our CIR is outlined with our peers. And clearly, we're seeing the benefits of the growth coming through, but very ROTE focused. Just noting we've had double-digit ROTE in this division now for 10 or 14 quarters. So we feel like we're investing in the right things. Hopefully, that helps.",

I mean, I heard what you said about the success of the CIB over the last 5 years. And what it's worth, I agree with you. But if I let you share price over that time, it's down between 10% and 20%. So I guess, although we agree, the wider market clearly disagrees or clearly doesn't see the value in what you've created. And so I guess in that context, I also heard your comments about strategic review and perhaps fee income being a focus. But how sure are you that is enough to start closing the valuation gap on the peers? And at what point -- are we not approaching the point now after perhaps 5 or 10 years of this strategy where we start to think doesn't something more radical need to happen to actually start closing gap because you're now at a huge discount. I mean, Lloyd's is on [indiscernible], Natwest is on 0.8, 0.9. You're down 0.5 or less. And I'm just -- is there sort of a sense of how we can do something to close that. Does that make sense?",

    "text": "Yes. So what I want to say to you is obviously First of all, thank you for your comments on the CIB. I'm glad you agree that we've been making progress on it. It's clearly insufficient, right? That's what the price to book was steady. And I think there are 3 or 4 aspects of that. One aspect is the proportion of the bank's revenue, profits, risk-weighted assets that are sitting in the CIB. It does feel that, that is a drag on the overall valuation where it's at 60% to 70%, right? So in other words, the success of the CIB has been great, but it's now -- the rest of the bank has to pull its own weight. That's the part, again, where I'd say both within CIB and the rest of the bank that we've got to increase the proportion of relatively capital-light, relatively making revenue. And we are putting in place the pieces that allow us to think about this in and operate this in a good way.  So the merger of the private bank and the wealth business from the U.K. is one such piece. The investments we continue to make in our cards portfolio in the U.S. although I repeat the point I made earlier, not just to make investments in the card portfolio to make it more capital efficient or another part of that piece. And I think it's important also that we have -- we don't surprise the market in the way we did last year with that securities issuance problem. So we're spending a lot of time improving internal end-to-end management and efficiencies for that, we don't have negative surprises. But then ultimately, you come to the last part, which is to run the businesses at a very high level of operational efficiency, which includes in some part, scale, so that people believe that you can produce these higher returns sustainably over long periods of time and guide you to how we might do that. And I think we're spending time thinking about that. And at the right time, we'll share...",

But can you give us any sense as to where mortgage completion margins were you in Q2? And the second question, perhaps a little bit more kind of slightly philosophical question about the structural hedge. Why are you reinvesting at the moment? Because if you reinvest in the structural hedge today, 5-year swap at kind of 4.8 on our probably after next week's base rate rise is going to be around 5.5. There's a negative spread there. And it feels like you've gone beyond hedging your current accounts and equity, and you're partially hedging now sort of deposits where you have effectively 100% deposit beta. So just philosophically, why are you reinvesting a structural hedge now? Why are you not actively looking to kind of run it down, whether it's a kind of negative to sort of near-term income.",

    "text": "On your first point on mortgage completions. I think we've been pretty consistent in not quoting spread. All I would say to you is that the mortgage market is extremely competitive, largely intermediated, and you wouldn't expect our spreads to be markedly different from the market as a whole. What really matters, though, in mortgages is the current churn impact that we're getting, which, as I said, we'd expect to lessen into 2024. As to your second question, on the structural hedge and the philosophy around that. So the reason that we have the structural hedges to smooth the income of our banking book businesses over time. It is not there to be an expression of where we think rates will go, either up or down. It's there to protect and smooth the income pathways on those really important banking businesses for us, whether they be in corporate or in retail. And what it's done is it led to a slower income pathway on the way up. And to the extent that we keep reinvesting in it, it will stabilize our long return income. And at any point when rates start going back then, again, it will protect income on the down side. So for us, it's not an expression about how we feel on rates, it's actually an expression about how we manage our income and how we think about our risk actually in these critical franchise businesses.

With that, I'd like to thank you all for your questions this morning and your continued interest on and focus on Barclays, not only for Q2, but the great questions on our longer-term strategy.

    "text": "Hi, good morning. A couple of questions please. On first one on UK NIM, your guidance I think I understood the top end of the guidance, the 310, assumes a similar sort of deposit trend as in Q Three, I guess. Your guidance implicitly says that things could get worse in Q Four in terms of mix and volumes. Can you maybe sort of explain what happened during Q Three? And why have you given yourself some room for deteriorating trends? I think most of the guidance from your peers and maybe even yourselves was that once the rate sort of hikes were over, you would see much more stable deposits. So interested to see why you've left yourself some room for deterioration. And second question is on the restructuring charge in Q Four. Obviously your 10% Rot guidance is now x this restructuring charge. Question is, how much is that going to interfere with the payout and with buybacks that you may announce at the end of the year? Because I would have thought, given the provisions are going much better than expected, you would have had plenty of room to cover potential restructuring without going into your Rot guidance. But that doesn't seem to be the case. So maybe how should we think about year end distribution? Obviously capital going better, but more restructuring costs. Maybe sizing that restructuring costs will be helpful. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you. Good morning and thanks for starting off the questioning. I'll take the first one and then I'll pass to Venkatakrishnan for the second half of that. So let me just talk through UK NIM in the third quarter and just to level set and reiterate what I said on the call. A basis point of NIM is 20 million annualized, less than 0.1% of groups income. What we said at Q Two was that we expected NIM to step down in the third quarter and somewhat stabilized into the fourth. There were a few moving parts within that and much of it has played out as we expected. So we've seen a lessening of the impact of mortgage churn, we've seen a continued tailwind from the structural hedges. Actually, deposit pricing played out roughly as we expected. And you can see that that's negative in the quarter for the first time, as we indicated it might be. What's really different is the movement in deposits. And what I said on the call earlier was that actually the movement in average deposits is a bit more significant than the quarter end might indicate. And whilst we saw very similar trends to the overall bank of England movement in current accounts through the quarter, we captured less of that into fixed term deposits than we might have expected to. And that related purely to the intensity of competition that we saw during the quarter and very intense at particular points. And it's really that that's made the difference. So I would say it's depositor behavior that has somewhat intensified in response to pricing. So previously we said that we expected that to be more stable in Q Four and that's simply because in Q Four you typically see a deposit stabilization pre Christmas. We now no longer anticipate that just because of these competitive dynamics and that's really what's causing us to change that outlook. We're not saying that it will be better or worse in the fourth quarter. I think what we are saying is that this customer deposit behavior has been relatively difficult to predict and that's why we're giving you a range indicating to you that if we saw something similar, that would be towards the top of that range. So that's the reason for the changing guidance. ######.",

    "text": "Yeah. Thanks I'm sure you sort of caught this through the presentation, but just to add on the NIM point, for 1 minute overall group deposits, as #### said, buk NIM is part of our overall NIM. Our overall deposits grew about 7 billion quarter on quarter and our Nii is up about 6% year on year at 3.2 billion and NIM itself at 3.98%. At the group level, again 13 bips higher. So think about in the larger context and also coming back to the restructuring charge, two things I would say. One is you should think of this structural cost action as in part of the investor update which we will provide in February. So what this is, is we have to announce it now because as we work through it, we will likely take a charge in Q Four. That's why we announce it now. But you should think of it as not something related to a quarter or the last two quarters, but part of the larger structural improvement of efficiency and productivity for the bank. As for your specific question, what I would say is a few things. Number one is that we very deliberately start this quarter at a strong capital position of 14% and we've got a capital generation of about 130 basis points of CET One ratio year to date. This underpins our ability to return capital to shareholders. As far as our desire, you know, we completed a 750,000,000 buyback in the first half. And so total distributions so far this year are 1.2 billion, which is about 30% higher versus the first half of last year. And this really reflects our commitment to return capital to shareholders. We spoke about the efficiencies we are driving across the group equally. You should know that we are comfortable to operate in the full range of 13% to 14% and we have been there in the past. Obviously, any capital action ultimately is approved by the board and approved by regulators. But from our point of view and we'll come back with the details in February from our point of view, good initial starting position, good capital generation across the bank. Understand the importance and the priority to our shareholders of returning capital, willingness to operate through the range.",

The first is coming back to the issue of the flagged restructuring charges. as you mentioned, capital really strong and in fact, the Q Three beat alone is a billion pounds relative to consensus. And so I guess anything that you could say to provide a rough sense of how much you're looking at spending here. I appreciate this is not the venue at which you wanted to give it, but today conversations with the investors are that there seem to be risks on the payout front, with no sense of how much cost savings we might be talking about or where in the group you might be looking to be more efficient. Clearly, we think it's the right thing to be doing, but the billion beat on CT One is 7% of annual group costs. You could do a lot with that. So anything you can do to be helpful on what the payback would be for the charges that are already in mind and which are triggering these provisions, that'd be the first and then secondly linked to that at your conference in New York last September. Last month, before, you said you were happy with the mix of business for the group. And so I wonder whether you'd give us a sense as to when you talk about updating investors on capital allocation priorities, whether you're really just talking about what grows faster in future or whether we should have in mind a sense that the present mix of capital allocation is up for debate.

So on the capital versus the spending, look, this is not the right place to be giving think you. Know, as I said in the answer to the previous question from ######, we started a good point on capital. We've been accretive on capital and view the spending and the restructuring in the larger term context. I'll let #### add to that in a minute. And on the second thing, what I would say mean I view the investor update in a simple way. It's obviously complex to analyze and execute, but I view the question in a simple way. It is what do you think is the target return that this bank can generate for its shareholders? So what's the rote ambition? How is it comprised at the group level and in the individual businesses? How much can it improve in the individual businesses and therefore, what is it that you wish to fund in that improvement? I also said in New York, it's very, very clear that the market values different businesses differently and we obviously have to take that into account in the way in which we think about our capital. So, you know, you sort of put it all together and you get the picture of where we think we want to go. But obviously more details on that later. And then ultimately, once you do that, then to be targeted about saying what of that growth and return you wish to you target returning to investors? Because I do absolutely take the point that we announce the buybacks on a half yearly basis and we don't have a target out there for that.

    "text": "Hi, good morning. Thank you very much. I just wanted to sorry, come back on the Buk NIM and really the trends that you were seeing on deposits through the third quarter and then what you're seeing so far in October. So, you mentioned that the averaging effect was actually worse than the endpoint position, suggesting that actually things got better in September, perhaps. So I was wondering if that's continued in October. So really how we should think about sort of the trajectory of those deposit flows through the quarter and then into Q Four. And then, just to clarify that when you say if Q Three trends continue, then expect to be at the top of the guided range, is that essentially taking the margin bridge on slide 15 and excluding the five basis points impact from pricing is how to think about that. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thanks, Why don't I take those? So what we really mean by the averaging point is that the outflows were probably a bit more evenly spread through the quarter than they were in the second quarter, where we saw somewhat of an increase in intensity towards the second half. I don't think it was lessened in September at all. There were certainly quite a few headline rates out there that were extremely competitive in terms of October. I just call out the fact that we haven't yet seen the first month's end, so we're still midway through the first month. There's nothing in what we can see so far that's really sort of beyond our expectations. All right. With our own forecast, that's all I can really say at this point in time. But I would just sort of highlight that what we're seeing is the impact of the pricing in terms of the sort of range of guidance. What we're really saying, rather than any particular point on the bridge, is that depending on where those deposit flows go, you could end up with a very different exit rate. So that's what we're really calling out to you. And clearly, if we saw trends similar to what we saw I e. The deposit trends continue similar to what we saw in Q Three, we would be towards the top end of that range. And that would give you a particular jumping off point for 2024. What I would highlight, though, is that the structural hedge continues to protect the NIM overall. And what you have seen over the last quarter is that we've been able to lock in another large chunk, both of 2023 income, but another three to 400 million of 24 and 25 income just because of the way that hedge is rolling month on month. Thank you.",

    "text": "Yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you. Just a quick follow up, if I could then. So given that you talked about the hedge into the coming years and you were expecting this deposit stabilization in Q Four, do you have a view going into next year in terms of deposit trajectory, given what you're seeing in terms of competition in the market? What this year has taught us is that customer deposit behavior is quite difficult to call. So what I'm not going to do is give you a 2024 NIM outlook. What I can tell you is that there are three factors that we're looking at. One is positive, one is neutral, and one is more negative. So the positive impact is clearly the impact of the structural hedge. And remember that two thirds of that goes into buk. The more neutral impact is that we do expect and we are seeing that the impacts, quarter on quarter of mortgage churn are starting to dissipate called that out for some time. What is more difficult to call is the impact of this ongoing deposit behavior, both the reduction in deposits because customers are using them in order to manage the broader economic environment, but also then seeking higher rates, difficult to call out when that would stabilize #####. But all I can say is that there are other factors in the mix, most importantly, the structural hedge. SPEAKER A Okay, thank you very much for that. Okay, thank you. Next question, please. Our next question comes from ##### #### from Autonomous. Please. Go ahead, #####. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two please. One on NIM and one on #####. So appreciate everything you've said about the difficulty in predicting deposit behavior and the fact that the UK NIM is not the be all, end all for your group revenue dynamic. But obviously we've had some pretty dramatic shifts in your NIM guidance over a few quarters. And there's a huge range of possible four Q exit levels implied by the range you're now giving us. So a very simple question. Please help us own views on what might happen. What's the average cost of your deposit balances in the UK and what proportion? And then on Roti in terms of the risk to the 10% Roti target, inclusive of restructuring charges, if I just kind of run the numbers on your equity for the year to date and Wave are out of four. Q to get to, say, a 9% Roti, including restructuring charges that would imply sort of a negative bottom line number for the fourth quarter. You've obviously delivered pretty strong Roti year to date. The fact that you're flagging potentially not being able to hit the greater than 10% Roti inclusive of restructuring charges implies fourth quarter could be a net loss. Is that the right way for us to be thinking about this? And within that, when you're flagging the 120,000,000 of restructuring charges year to date, is it the case that when we get to the fourth quarter, the catch up to the normal 200 to 300 is going to be excluded from your Roti calculation as well? How are you thinking about that? Is two to 300 in the Roti calculation and then the exceptional charge on top of that excluded? Or is the whole amount potentially going to be excluded when you calculate your rotate end of the year to assess delivery on that target. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much, #####. Why don't I take those two and I'm sure ###### will add it if he wants to. So you're right, there has been some considerable movement on the UK NIM, particularly over the last quarter. As I said, clearly that's driven by customer deposit behaviour. I would highlight for you that as we look at UK NIM, we are actually looking at quite a narrow measure. So in comparison to our peers, remember, they would be including all of the corporate income and asset base within there. And so really you should be looking, as you make comparisons to the rest of the UK, you should be looking across both the UK and the corporate NIM position. We don't disclose the average rate paid on our deposits, although what we have given you this time to be more helpful is a split of our deposit balances and indeed how that has trended over time. And it's showing very clearly that movement into term, as you would expect, and as many have commented from bank of England data on your second question. So to be clear, what we are not doing is giving any kind of PBT forecast for the fourth quarter here. It wouldn't be appropriate for us to do so. Not least, we haven't concluded our assessment of the structural actions that we may take. Merely what we're calling out is a few things. Firstly, we're clearly going into the fourth quarter with good Roti momentum. We've delivered 12.5% year to date, somewhat ahead of consensus. However, the fourth quarter does have some seasonal impacts in it. So typically we see lower CIB income, typically we see higher impairment in US cards in particular, simply because of the seasonality in spending. We also see impacts from the bank levy. And we've just given you an indication that we see a continuation of deposit trends in the UK. So not saying anything more than that in that typically you expect Roti to be lower in the fourth quarter than in the preceding three. And to the extent that we take decisions in that fourth quarter, that may impact the Roti now, as we do so, we are very focused on future returns for the business. So our overall objective here is to improve the returns of the business through time. Clearly, efficiency and effectiveness is a key part of that. So we're just calling out our intention to continue that cost focus for the business. Yeah, and I cannot emphasize that last point that #### I cannot emphasize too much that last point which #### made, which is that think about this in terms of the investor update in February and the longer term plan for productivity and efficiency in this bank. If I could just follow up on the roti point first, please. I mean, the year to date you've done 4.4 billion profit. Your average tangible is probably going to be something like 47 billion for the year. So you're pretty much all the way there to delivering a 10% royalty on the nine months to date. But to get to a point where you're flagging to us that you might not do greater than ten for the full year unless I'm missing something there, the maths implies potentially very material restructuring charges. Am I missing something there? It does seem in the context of a debate where I had some investors asking whether you might be announcing a surprise buy, this is obviously kind of top of mind for your investor base. How are you going to be balancing these things? Are we looking at potentially greater than a bit of restructuring or cost to achieve or whatever? We're going to be titling it in the fourth quarter. That's by the maths even, except the point about seasonality et. So, I understand the maths of what you're putting in front of me. I'm going to say the same thing that we have not yet concluded on those plans. To the extent that we do, we will update the market further at full year, both in terms around the costs, but also the ongoing impact that we would expect them to have, just as investors do. Distributions are top of our mind too, as ###### pointed out. So as we take these decisions, we will be extremely mindful. And as you said previously, we go into the fourth quarter very deliberately at the top end of our capital range. And on the deposit cost point. If I could on that as well, please. If I frame it slightly differently, how do you expect investors to be able to take a view on what might happen with the buk NIM unless we're armed with some basic information about what you're currently paying on deposits relative to the types of offers that are out there in the market. You'll flag competitive offers as a key driver for the fact you're re guiding them lower and seeing deposit attrition, but we don't know how much better those rates are relative to what you're currently paying or had been paying earlier in the. So it's very difficult for us to take a view on what's going to without. So, all I would say is that we price competitively, but not uncommercially. If you look at our savings, pricing is very clearly indicated both on our website and indeed in any branch. You will see that we are competitively positioned across our term deposits, across our Isas, across our instant access, for example, rainy day saver. So we don't genuinely believe that there's something mispriced in our savings franchise. We're happy with it. From quarter to quarter, you will see other competitors operating in a different way.

    "text": "Firstly, the UK and then outside the UK. So first I'm trying to understand the comment that pricing played out as expected. Are you talking for Barclays or for the industry? As I would think about pricing and then movements and deposits for individual institutions as very much linked, had you priced up more in line with some peers than the balance move, wouldn't have been such a headwind. So perhaps you could clarify that point. I'm just trying to think about in the context of how you might want to react more to protect balances in the future in a competitive marketplace and then outside the UK, clearly that was much stronger. Could you just give a bit more color around what you're seeing, what the strategy is there and sort of are you having to pay up or is this very much profitable deposit growth that you're seeing outside the UK? Thank you. Okay, thanks guy. I'll take both of those. So what I meant by the pricing was, as we expected, clearly we knew at Q Two, when we reported to you the price changes we were going to make, and therefore that deposit bucket, the one that's called bank rate, is broadly as we expected it to be. Now, what subsequently happened to both the level and mix of deposits is much more driven by the external competitive environment. And that's what we are calling out very similarly to what I just said to #####. We are happy with the overall level of our savings pricing. Our strategy is to encourage our customers to develop healthy savings habits. We are pricing to, as far as possible, maintain our franchise rather than attract hot money. And we will price competitively, but not uncommercially. So to the extent that we see competitive pricing going in that direction, then obviously we would not follow it. I think the other thing just to put in the mix, as everybody is looking at the impact of buk NIM, please do not discount the impact of impairment. So all of this behaviour, this conservatism and behavior is also flowing through into the impairment line. And buk impairment has been lower than consensus for nine successive quarters. So just worth bearing that in mind. Second point that you asked about, which is around the deposit elsewhere in a high rate, persistently high inflationary environment, we would expect to see high level deposits flow from retail customers towards corporates. That's exactly what we see. And given our franchise, that is what you're observing. So UK corporate deposits are very stable. You see some migration, but very stable in totality. And what we've seen in the quarter is a continued inflow more from global corporates. That's particularly fairly long tenor term funding, competitively priced, but good for the deposit franchise overall. So, very much a continuation of what we called out actually in Q Two and indeed Q One.",

I think to me it's one of the interesting things that we've seen, where we've seen people using their deposits to pay down debt, whether it's mortgages or other things. One, it showed that they had the ability to do it. So obviously it's helpful with impairments, but it also gives you an idea of the type of credit quality of customer we have, which I think is a good thing. So, as #### said, nine quarters continuously of positive surprises, meaning lower impairments than consensus in buk and people using deposits to pay down debt. It's all a good thing about credit quality. Okay, thank you. Thank you, guy. Next question, please.",

    "text": "Morning both, and thank you for taking my questions. The firstly is around just some recent press speculation that you're looking to sell a stake in your UK merchant acquiring business. I know you won't want to comment on that directly, so perhaps the best way to phrase the question is to ask what do you think is the best way of Barclays generating value out of its UK merchant acquiring business going forward? And then secondly, I noted your statement around the PRA rules being the most relevant to the expected impact under Basel 3.1 in that context. The regulator gave a Mansion House speech last week. Our interpretation of that speech is that we'll likely see a softening of the rules around Basel 3.1 when they're announced later this year and in May 2024. Would you agree with that assertion?

    "text": "Right, let me take both of them. First of all, in the UK merchant acquiring business, I think we are fortunate that we've got a business that has both issuances and acceptance. And it is very much a business which is targeted at corporates and SMEs. And what it does is that it adds another quiver to our arrow. It's a very positive quiver to our arrow. When we deal with them, we provide them transaction services, we provide them obviously, baited banking, foreign exchange services and then payments. So merchant acquiring the business itself overall is very good. I think there's a broader strategic question for us which other banks have faced, which is it's a very technology driven business. What is your comparative advantage in this? Is your comparative advantage in developing the technology or in implementing the technology or building machines which you put with clients? Or is your comparative advantage in helping service them as part of a larger set of banking services? That's the question we are looking at. And then I think the commercial arrangement will come out of the answer to that question. So that's the way we are thinking about that business. As far as Basel 3.1 goes, I would say two things. I also read the Mansion House speech with interest. I think the UK rules are solidifying. They will probably on the market risk side resemble the US rules and it is still too soon to say how much of an impact, what kind of changes going forward there are from what we've seen. So I don't want to sort of comment one way or another. I mean, the only thing I will say on this more broadly is I think at the end of the day, I know there's some commentary from the US banks that the impacts are greater on them. But these capital regimes, and we've been under the UK capital regime, of course these capital regimes are very difficult to calculate apple for apple. And so I think at the end of it, when you look at what the Fed has done and when you look at what the bank of England has done, what you're probably going to have is roughly comparable capital regimes between the US and the UK. Roughly comparable. So let me just round that off. I think, ###, we're obviously we know these speeches with interest, but we're waiting the final rules both in the US and in the UK and elsewhere. And of course we don't yet know what the impact of any changes around Color Two might be. So until we see it in print, still some uncertainty. So we continue to guide to that 5% to 10% that we've given you before, erring, towards probably the bottom end of that range. But thank you for the question. Next question, please.

    "text": "Go ahead, Your line is now open. Hello there. Two from me again, please. The first, I just wondered what was in this seven basis points other drag that's coming through in the UK MIM in the quarter. I think you described it in the email as product mix, but is it just that or is there some treasury effect coming through there again like we saw earlier in the year and if so, how large? The second question is to focus on one of the bright spots of today's numbers that the TNAV very powerful move in the third quarter and the cash for hedge reserve seems to run my own by about 20%, I think, in just three months. I don't want to preempt anything you're going to say for the year on new financial targets and the like, but are you completely comfortable that in the medium term, including next year in 2025, that you can still do greater than 10% Rote target as it is today? All in, including any additional structural cost of actions, are taken through next year against this quite powerful move up in the Tnab? Because there's nothing to suggest the Tnab isn't going to keep moving up a pace from here. So they're the two questions. A - C.S. Venkatakrishnan – Okay, thanks I will take both of those. So in the seven bits other it is product, it contains pretty much everything else that isn't to the left. There's nothing significant in there individually, there's a bit of cards. There's a bit of business banking, as we see the government backed lending being paid down. There's also a little bit on barclays partner payments, barclays partner finance, rather. You might recall that we said that we were pausing new business in that space whilst we replatformed that business technology wise, because that's unsecured. Although it's small, it can have an impact on NIM. So nothing more than that. Nothing specifically in treasury to call out at all on TNAV. Clearly, that has moved significantly in the quarter. In part, that is actually a reversal of what you saw from the beginning of the year. So just to sort of unpack this a little bit, clearly what drives TNAV over time is attributable profit and us driving good returns, as we have done this quarter. So that's eight basis points. There was also three basis points that came from the fact that we'd conducted a large part of the share buyback by the end of the quarter. And this is obviously a per share measure. You're right to call out the cash flow hedge reserve, which was ten pence in this single quarter. But if you look at the disclosures at the back of the results announcement, actually, you can see that quarter to quarter, these reserve movements can be relatively material. And the third quarter just unwound the position from the beginning of the year. And what's actually going on here is that as rates fell back a little bit in the third quarter, the negative drag from that cash flow hedge reserve just lessened a little bit. But that was just unwinding. You might recall in the second quarter, there was a big move in the opposite direction that actually depressed TNAV. So really, as we think going forward from here, we try and strip out that kind of quarter to quarter volatility. What we're really focused on is the accretion of profit and driving robust returns. And that's really what we'll come back to you on in february. I want to come back to deposits and competition for deposits again. Clearly you've been surprised in the quarter by the level of competition out there, but the comments you're giving us back is very much that you're confident in your current pricing. I mean, what needs to change in terms of the level of competition out there for your view on that to change? If you look at your savings rates, they're clearly a step below your closest peers. And from what we can see in the data, then you're losing deposits that, whilst pricing up might be a threat to NIM, at least you're keeping deposits on the platform. So I just want to kind of understand your approach to competition short term, but also medium term. If these very competitive rates continue to stay out there. And second, you mentioned on the hedge that the hedge come down in relation to your hedgeable deposits. If I look at the disclosures you're giving us today, then it looks like you're hedging much, much more of your savings products than your peers. So I'd just like to get a bit more color around how you run that hedge versus your deposits, what your hedgeable deposits actually are, and how you see those developing over the next couple of quarters. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Why don't I take those and I'm sure ###### might add, particularly on pricing. So as I said on the previous answer, we are pretty comfortable with the way that we are placed on our pricing. Clearly, there is a difference in competitive pricing across the industry between what I would describe as bigger banks and challenger banks who might have a different need for liquidity, particularly over the next couple of years as Tffme runs off. So we are mindful of that and we keep our savings pricing under review. But as we are making savings decisions, we think about the franchise and we think about our liquidity and our balance sheet. Those decisions will be different bank by bank and institution by institution. And I wouldn't comment further than that. In terms of the hedge, our hedge strategy has been very consistent over the last few years. So what we do is we identify rate sensitive balances, we exclude those from the hedge, and then on top of that, we maintain a buffer and we hedge the remaining balance. We monitor that hedge on a monthly basis. And what you can see year to date is that we have trimmed our corporate hedge thus far. We do that by making the decision to pause all our part of the role month by month. And those are active decisions that we take. So we've got ample opportunities to adjust that hedge as we see deposits behavior changing as compares our hedge strategy versus competitors. I wouldn't comment on it. Just to follow up then, does that imply you see rate insensitive balances within your savings accounts? There are some balances within our deposits overall that are rate insensitive. So much of our current accounts would be rate insensitive simply because they relate to operational deposits. That will be true in Buk, as it is in the corporate bank, as it is in the private bank, although you'd expect those constituents to behave differently. So that is certainly true. There is also some rate insensitivity in savings because customers, and indeed corporates, do use some of their savings balances as sort of rainy day funds simplistically. And particularly in instant access accounts, we see customers turning over their savings within the period of about a year, for example. So we have demonstrable evidence of that insensitivity. ####, great. SPEAKER A The next question. Your line is now open. Yes. Morning everybody. Could I just ask you just trying to get the implications right for sort of 24 and 25 now, because if I look at the maths correctly, and I suppose I'm just checking my maths here, it looks like you've got an exit margin of somewhere around 290 into next year. And I guess we would imagine that that's going to continue to deteriorate because a lot of these deposit trends are long term trends. If you look back to the last time, interest rates were at 5%, the structure of a deposit franchise was completely different and the margins were much smaller than you're getting today. If that is the case, that looks to me like we're looking at maybe 500, 600 million off consensus for next year just for net interest income. And yet consensus is only looking at a 10% return on tangible even. Now, I assume you want 10% to be some sort of a base and you wouldn't want to be delivering lower than that. Is it the cost? Is it the cost program? Should we be looking at the cost program to offset that? Is that where the difference comes from? Or how else can we get ourselves back to 10%? Or should we be thinking that actually that is a risk? Now. Let me take that and I'm sure will add sure. I'm not going to comment on the exit rate from Q four. What we've done is we've given you a range, ed, we've told you what will happen if we see similar deposit trends. No, but I've just taken my math, that was all. We know what three are. Okay, so it is two nights. That's great. Thanks. Yeah. So your math, as I would expect, I'm sure, is very robust. As we've said before, it may or may not deteriorate next year. I mean, we've got a real tailwind from the hedge, so I'm going to go back to that. Secondly, we've got this neutralization of the mortgages month to month, and then you have ongoing deposit behavior. So you're right to say that we're in a different place to where we were sort of and we're going all the way back to 2006, 2007. I mean, I would remind you that at that point the liquidity positions of the very large banks was very different. So all of the large banks were running loan to deposit ratios well in excess of 100%, 100 and 5161 hundred and 70% in some instances. And therefore those fixed term deposits were essentially being used in lieu of wholesale funding to large part. So it's a different structure of market overall. So I'm not going to comment on where we end, but I would urge you to consider that we then make the jump from buk to group. So a percentage point or a bit of buk roti is 20 million. That is 0.1% of group income. So in all of these considerations, we need to consider the rest of the group. So, yes, Buk NIM is stepping back a bit, but we're also in a position where actually the market for markets, and particularly banking, is significantly depressed. So banking is coming off a decade low. We've seen pretty low levels of unsecured lending in the UK, relatively muted demand for wholesale debt, both in SMEs and in corporate. And of course, if you look across into CCNP, the US cards business continues to grow and the private bank continues to so I take the math point on Buk, but it is a relatively small part of the group. You're right to call out efficiency. We're very focused on that. We see that as a key part of driving our returns. And obviously we'll come back to you with the whole picture in February. Yeah, and I'll just add on the efficiency part of the structural cost actions. Think of it as a longer term approach to increasing the growth of this bank. That's what the efficiency is about. It's not about making ledger work. Can I just come back on that in terms of efficiency, though, are we talking CIB efficiency? Because your retail bank is making over a 20% return on equity. I mean, that feels like a really good number on most benchmarks. I don't know why you would want to take costs out of that particularly. So is it like head office and CIB or where would we be seeing that? So, look, we'll give you the details later. I applaud you for recognizing the rote of our retail bank. It has not come up yet, but you're absolutely right. It's doing 20% and it's doing well. But in every part of the bank, there are things which we can do better. Okay. And so that's not to take away from the performance of the retail bank. ####, I wouldn't have okay, thanks. Thanks. The next question comes from Jefferies. Please. Go ahead, ######. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess a couple of things. Just going back to this charge that you intend to take in Q Four, could you just talk about what your hurdles are in terms of payback and timing, just to give us a sense of time frame and payback? And then secondly, on the CC and P margin, there was a 63 on my number, 63 bips pickup, quarter on quarter in the margin, which was significant. And I guess how do you think about the trajectory of that, particularly given the growth in US receivables? And I presume that a fair amount of the growth in the US receivables is coming from the GAAP, which is a higher yielding book. So how do we think about the margin trajectory in CC and P? Okay. Thank you, I'll take those. I'm not going to go into the Q Four charge in detail at this juncture, we're obviously still evaluating actions. You might expect that depending on what those charges relate to, the payback might be slightly different. So you'd expect, for example, property to take longer to pay back, whereas other actions that we might take would be faster. But when we talk to you in February, ##, we will outline what we've done and what we expect that payback to be. In terms of CCNP, you're correct. The net interest margin has stepped forward in the quarter. There are two real impacts in there. The first is growth in US receivables. So the growth in the cards business, as we said, balances are up 11% year on year, and that clearly has a powerful effect. At the same time, we see deposit migration in the private bank, which is no different to what we see in either corporate or in Buk. So that has an offsetting impact. Although in the private bank, what we see is a flow into invested assets. So we retain that income. It just goes on to a different line. There is a one off in the third quarter. It's not huge, but I would strip that out. Ongoing. So that's why we're saying we'd expect Q four NIM to step back towards Q two NIM. So don't think of this step up as permanent. Think there is momentum in the number, but this is somewhat exaggerated by that one off. Okay. And then can I just be cheeky and ask one other question, just given because I think there's been some confusion. If it's a small one, it's kind of a yes or no question anyway. But do you expect to deliver in line with your 10% or greater return in 2024? We will come back to you on 2024 guidance when we talk to you at the full year. As ###### said, that's when we plan to update the market on our expectations for returns, capital allocation, costs, distributions. But you should read that we are very focused on returns. Ongoing. Thank you. Okay, thank you. So can we go to the final question, please? Our final question today comes from from City. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me on two questions. One, hopefully very short. First question. You're encouraging us to look at the group Nii, including the CIB. So perhaps you could just comment on the transaction. Banking revenues obviously up a lot year on year, but they are down Q on Q, which slightly bucks the trend versus what we've seen at US peers. So perhaps you could elaborate on what drove the Q and Q decline there. And then second and broader point on deposits and pricing just in relation to the 14 point FCA Action plan. I think their fair value assessment was due by the end of August. You had to provide details on communication and evidence, what you are providing to the consumer by end september. I think the next big thing is this whole debate around on sale versus offsell, which comes in from the 31 July 2024. So anything you could say on on sale versus offsell, how big a bucket of offsell products you have, how the pricing compares, et cetera, et cetera. Thank you. Okay, so let me start in terms of transaction banking, did step back quarter on quarter, there was a relatively small impact from deposit migration. And again, I would say within corporate we're seeing migration from our non interest bearing into interest bearing, but those deposits are remaining within the bank. So that's certainly not the larger part of it. What we did see is an impact from the returns in our liquidity buffer. There's nothing idiosyncratic going on. There more that for any liquidity buffer, the returns are in two parts. The first is the carry, and then the second is, in any particular quarter, you would see some disposal income. In this environment, that disposal income has been very low. And given that much of that buffer income is actually attributed to transaction banking, it's had a disproportionate impact in this quarter that will obviously move around a little bit. So we'll see what happens through the Fourth. So on the consumer duty piece on SCA, we actually did our mailing through July and August in relation to savings. That was exactly, as you point out, designed to ensure that our customers are very much aware of the savings businesses that we have and the rates on offer. And increasingly, we see our customers using digital means to look and observe that anyway. But that mailing is behind us. We will do a further mailing in November and December to our current accounts. And for us, off sale is relatively small, so I wouldn't call it out as an impact. And okay, so with that, thank you, #####, for the #### rather for your final question. Really appreciate you attending the call today. Thank you for your continued interest.+",

    "text": "Good morning. Thank you everybody for coming here and welcome to our Full Year 2023 Results Presentation as well as our Investor Update. You could see the agenda for the day on this slide. And so what we will do, we'll just go into the results for 2023 before turning to the broader investor update. So, as you saw this morning, I'll start with the results announcement with the performance highlights and then I'll hand over to Anna to take us all through the financials. So, we are delivering against our guidance. So, we achieved -- delivered on all our targets in 2023. And together with our consistently strong capital position throughout this year, what this enabled us to do was to give shareholders a material increase in distributions. Excluding the Q4 structural cost actions, return on tangible equity was 10.6% for 2023, in line with our target of above 10%. And on the same basis, our cost-to-income ratio who was 63%, in line with our guidance for the low 60s for the full year as well. As being accretive to future returns, the structural cost actions did not limit our ability to deliver a 37% year-on-year increase in total distributions, which now amounted to £3 billion. This £3 billion number for 2023 included a total dividend of £0.08 per share with the full year amount of the dividend of £0.053 being announced today and as well as a full year buyback of £1 billion, which we expect to start in the coming days, and that's on top of the £750 million at the half year. Tangible book value per share has increased by £0.36 year-on-year to £0.331. And our CET1 ratio was 13.8%, which is at the top end of our target range, which you will recall is 13% to 14%. Overall, we view this performance as a strong foundation on which to build towards our revised financial targets over the next three years and which we announced this morning and we'll talk about in greater detail in a few minutes. But before that, the financial report of these results. Anna, over to you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Venkat and good morning everyone. Turning now to Slide 5. I think I'm going to need the script. Thank you very much. On a statutory basis, RoTE was 9% for full year 2023. This included the £0.9 billion of structural cost actions taken in Q4. And given the materiality of those Q4 charge over and above normal annual cost actions, I'm going to exclude it from the financial performance metrics today. On this basis, 2023 return on tangible equity was 10.6%. I would note that there was no impact from the over-issuance of securities this year, but given the material impacts to income and costs in 2022, I will also use adjusted numbers as comparators. Group profit before tax was £7.5 billion, down 3% year-on-year, and income increased by £0.7 billion, while costs were £0.2 billion higher, excluding the Q4 cost actions. Within costs, litigation and conduct charges were small this year at £37 million compared to around £0.6 billion in 2022. And operating costs, which include L&C, were up by £0.8 billion. Impairment charges were £0.7 billion to £1.9 billion, representing a loan loss ratio of 46 basis points, better than our through-the-cycle guidance of 50 to 60. As usual, I'll now cover the three drivers of our returns: income, costs and credit risk management. We saw a continuation of year-to-date income trends through the fourth quarter, resulting in total income up 3% at £25.4 billion for the year. Barclays UK income was up 5%, with growth in net interest income from rate increases outlaying lower card income and the transfer of UK Wealth in Q2. Consumer cards and payments income grew strongly, up 18%, driven by higher margins and balanced growth in both US cards and the Private Bank. Corporate and Investment Bank income was down 4%, as lower volatility in markets and a record low banking wallet impacted the industry. This outweighed the tailwind from interest rates in the Corporate Bank. On the next slide, you can see net interest income across the bank and that it grew by £2.1 billion or 20% year-on-year, driving a 44 basis point increase in group NIM to 3.98%. The biggest contributors to NII growth were CC&P and CIB, together adding £1.3 billion with around one quarter of the total NII growth coming from BUK. Going forward, whilst we will still report net interest margin, we will guide to group NII excluding the Investment Bank and head office. This is expected to be around £0.3 billion lower in 2024 at around £10.7 billion. BUK is expected to be a point -- approximately £6.1 billion of this, excluding the impact of Tesco, which I'll touch on shortly. The benefits from the structural hedge are expected to be offset by continued product market pressures, particularly in the UK. Turning now to the structural hedge in more detail. The structural hedge is designed to reduce volatility in NII and manage interest rate risk. As rates have risen, this has dampened the growth in our NII, but in a falling rate environment we will see the benefit from the protection that it gives us. It generated £3.6 billion in gross hedge income in 2023, up from £2.2 billion in the prior year. It also provides a high degree of confidence in the net interest income growth assumed in our forward plan. To reiterate this, £3.8 billion of gross hedge income is already locked in for 2024 from the hedge investment we did through 2023, and this will continue to build. Given trends in retail deposits, we do expect the notional balance to reduce in 2024 at a broadly similar rate to Q4 2023 before stabilizing in 2025. We have approximately £170 billion of hedges maturing over the next three years, and we expect to roll around three quarters of them over the period and with reinvestment rates remaining well above the average maturing yields of around 1.5% for the next three years. So, we do expect the reinvestment to outweigh notional hedge declines. Turning now to costs on Slide 9. As guided quarterly costs through the year remained below the Q1 high point. This excluded the Q4 bank levy of £180 million, which was flat year-on-year and the cost-income ratio for the year was 63% and excluding the Q4 structural cost actions. Group costs of £16 billion were up £0.2 billion year-on-year. Operating costs increased to support business growth and enhance resilience and control. For example, partner focused spend to drive balanced growth in US cards and Kensington mortgages in the UK as well as technology investments to support markets within the CIB. The impact of inflation was more than offset by efficiency savings. Looking at the £927 million of Q4 structural cost actions in more detail now on the next slide. These were across three main categories; people, property, and infrastructure. Around half was in our head office and relates to our merchant acquiring and German consumer financing businesses as well as a Canary Wharf office lease exit. A large proportion of this head office charge is goodwill and intangible write-downs and which will have no impact on capital and the other charges are spread across the businesses. We expect the overall payback to be just under two years with around half of the cost savings landing in 2024. You'll hear later how these cost actions are a key pillar in our plans to improve efficiency and drive a more productive cost base going forward. Moving on to credit on Slide 11. The impairment allowance was broadly stable at £6.3 billion and we maintained our balance sheet coverage at 1.4%. The total impairment charge for 2023 of £1.9 billion was up around £0.7 billion year-on-year, and the full year loan loss rate of 46 basis points was below our through-the-cycle guidance. As we expected, this included a higher Q4 loan loss rate of 50 points, driven by an increase in US cards. US cards was also the largest component of the full year charge of £1.5 billion in CC&P. The full year Barclays UK charge was around £300 million with a loan loss rate of 14 basis points. We continue to see conservative consumer behaviors across all our UK portfolios, and we do expect the loan loss rate in BUK to increase over the next three years as we grow unsecured lending. I'll go into more detail on the US cards impairment on the next slide. Our US cards portfolio credit trends are in line with the broader industry. The US consumer bank loan loss rate is elevated in comparison to recent periods as we build our impairment reserves because of an increase in delinquencies. Write-offs are low, but we do expect them to increase during 2024, which is why we're building the reserve now. As a result, our US cards coverage ratio stands at 10.2% on an IFRS 9 basis, and when calculated on a US accounting basis, the CECL coverage ratio of 8.2% is in line with our US cards peers. The portfolio remains high quality with 88 of the book above 660 FICO. We do expect the impairment charge to remain elevated through the first half of 2024 and then to reduce in the second half. Overall, I'd expect the charge for 2024 to be below the 2023 level, and we're guiding to a 400 basis points loan loss rate through the cycle. A brief word on Q4 performance on the next slide before I take you through the businesses. Profit before tax excluding Q4 structural cost actions was £1 billion, down £0.3 billion. Income was down £0.2 billion year-on-year at £5.6 billion, the second best Q4 in the last five years after 2022. This was driven by a reduction in non-NII, partially offset by an increase in NII, whilst operating costs were broadly stable. Impairment was around £50 million higher at £0.6 billion with the higher Q4 charge in CC&P from US cards, partially offset by a lower Barclays UK charge. Moving now to the business performance starting with Barclays UK on slide 14. RoTE was 19.7% in Q4 and has been consistently around 20% every quarter this year. Total income was £1.8 billion with net interest income stable at £1.6 billion and a £0.2 billion reduction in non-NII year-on-year. This reflected the transfer of UK Wealth business in Q2 and a number of one-offs. We would expect non-NII to revert to a run rate greater than £250 million per quarter going forward. The NII generated a NIM in BUK of 307 basis points for Q4 and 313 for the full year. We said at Q3 that our 305 basis points to 310 basis points guidance. We're sensitive to the level and mix of deposits, and the deposit trends that we saw in Q3 slowed materially in Q4. Deposits were down £2.1 billion compared to the reduction of £6.6 billion in Q3 as the pace of deposit outflows and migration to higher savings rate slowed. The other NIM drivers played out broadly as we expected, and you can see these on the chart on the right-hand side. The structural hedge continued to be a tailwind to NIM, although a more modest 7 basis points in Q4 due to lower swap rates and a reduced hedge roll in the quarter. Bank rate effects turned negative in half two, reflecting pass-through in pricing and mortgage churn continue to ease. We also saw a positive contribution from treasury in the other category, as we flagged earlier in the year. Looking forward to 2024, we are guiding to NII for Barclays UK of circa £6.1 billion compared to £6.4 billion in 2023. We will have a building tailwind from the hedge roll. However, in the short term, consistent with our industry expectations, we do expect this to be more than offset by some further reduction in deposits but at a slower rate than in 2022 and a net reduction in mortgage. This excludes the impact of the Tesco Bank acquisition, which I'll summarize on the next slide. The acquisition accelerates our intention to grow unsecured lending in Barclays UK, which we will discuss in more detail later. The transaction involves the acquisition of £8.3 million unsecured lending balances, roughly half credit card receivables and half unsecured loans, and approximately £6.7 billion of customer deposits. This will result in £8 billion of RWAs in completion, which is expected to be in half two. Given the uncertainty around this timing, our 2024 guidance does not include the impact of the acquisition, although it is reflected in our 2026 plans that we're announcing later today. Once completed, we estimate initially generating NII of around £400 million annualized and growing from that level. And as we complete the integration, costs will be somewhat elevated, but they should be broadly neutral to the cost -- group cost-income ratio. And as usual, following a portfolio acquisition, we also anticipate elevated impairment initially under IFRS 9 but again expect that to normalize. As a result, we forecast a slightly reduced BUK RoTE in 2024, but once integrated, the business will have an attractive RoTE profile accretive to the group RoTE over time. Turning now to Consumer Cards and Payments. Continued growth in US cards receivables and Private Bank client balances drove a £0.1 billion increase in CC&P total income year-on-year. US cards balances grew to just over $32 billion, up to $2 billion in Q4, reflecting seasonally higher year-end spend. Client assets and liabilities in the Private Bank grew by £4 billion in the quarter to around £183 billion with most of the growth being in invested assets. This is a positive trend for the future, but the initial growth is in assets under supervision, which does attract lower fees. CC&P RoTE was 2.6%, reflecting the impairment build in US cards I've just talked about. And this will be the last time we report the CC&P segment as we start to disclose our US Consumer Bank and our Private Bank and Wealth Management businesses separately. Moving on to the CIB. CIB income of £2.4 billion was impacted by lower year-on-year global markets income. The Q4 market environment had lower volatility in markets and subdued industry activity for banking. Investment Banking performed relatively well in this context, up 13% in US dollars and up 36% on Q3 with DCM outperforming the market and offsetting continued lower activity in ECM and M&A. We maintained our banking market share in 2023 whilst we repositioned the business in a record low year for the industry wallet. Markets income was down 14% in US dollars, against a record Q4 comparator for us, whilst our business mix also affected us. Corporate lending income was materially down on Q3 at £40 million, primarily due to leverage loan finance marks of £85 million. Underlying corporate lending income was stable. Transaction Banking deposits were also stable whilst income fell slightly versus Q3. Whilst deposit migration continues, this was at a lower pace than earlier in the year. And as a result, we are now again rolling a portion of the structural hedge related to corporate deposits. Looking at markets in detail on the next slide. There were several factors driving our performance in markets this quarter. Similar to Q3, both our business mix and the record comparator contributed to FICC income being down 22% year-on-year in dollars. Lower volatility in UK gilts compared to Q4 2022 and an industry-wide slowdown in rates and credit impacted Barclays more than our peers. And conversely, the market rebounded in securitized products where we currently lack scale. Equities performed broadly in line with peers up 3% in US dollars year-on-year. Looking at the longer-term trends in markets over the last four years, our share in income has been consistently higher than the previous three. And our income now includes a greater proportion of financing which, as we've said before, provides greater stability to our overall markets income. Turning now to the capital funding and liquidity metrics on the next slide. We continue to maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding and a significant excess of deposits over loans. Looking at capital in more detail on slide 21. We finished the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%. The announced £1 billion share buyback will take us to 13.5%, in the middle of our target range. We generated 18 basis points of capital from earnings in Q4 and just under 150 basis points over the full year, both of which exclude a circa 20 basis points impact of the Q4 structural cost actions. Excluding the reduction due to FX, the £6 billion increase in RWAs reduced capital in Q4 by 23 basis points. We'll say more about our RWA flight path over the next three years later, but I want to address two main headwinds here. The first is a move of our US Cards portfolio to an Internal Ratings-Based or IRB model. We continue to make significant progress towards at least 85% of credit risk RWAs being IRB, which is the level required by the PRA for IRB bank. This move results in an expected increase in RWAs of around £6 million from half2 2024. We don't expect any further material impacts from model migrations from current portfolios beyond US cards. The second headwind is Basel 3.1, which we have quantified publicly for some time. The PRA's recent policy paper was constructive, and we've also worked through some refinements and mitigations. Furthermore, our previous Basel 3.1 guidance included an element for US cards RWAs, which has been superseded by the IRB migration. The aggregate impact of these factors means a materially lower impact from Basel 3 on implementation. And given this lower estimate, the total effect of the two headwinds is broadly aligned to the previously guided day one impact of Basel 3.1 towards the lower end of the 5% to 10% of group RWAs. Furthermore, as more risks are captured in Pillar 1, we would expect some offsets in our Pillar 2 requirements. On this slide, we're illustrating the drivers of the RWA increase from implementing IRB for US cards. When applied to US cards, our IRB models generate greater risk weight density versus standardized models. And the key driver is that the models include 2009 financial crisis, stress loss assumptions despite current and expected experience being materially less adverse. Under the US Basel 3 end game treatment, we expect our peers in the US to also experience a capital increase, although noting that these rules are yet to be finalized. There will be further details on planned migration in the US consumer bank presentation later on. So to summarize, we delivered on our financial targets in 2023. This, along with our strong capital position, enabled us to deliver a material increase in distributions to shareholders. It also represents a strong foundation on, which to improve over the next few years. I'm now going to take the Q&A. Given the time constraints we have, please, can I ask you to limit yourself to a maximum of two questions per person, and please stick to the full year results topics. There'll be plenty of time to discuss the investor update later on. And if you could please introduce yourself, as usual, not least I'm blinded by lights, so I can't actually see you very well. So thank you.",

But what you will see later on is that the assumptions that we're making about both the markets and the banking wallet are very reasonable actually. We're not expecting an increase in the market's wallet in particular in 2024. So we believe they're reasonable assumptions. And actually, that leaves the actions to grow revenues largely in our hands, and Venkat and Adeel will talk about those later. In terms of Tesco, we will be talking later about our desire to grow lending in the UK and unsecured lending in particular. Now many of you have commented on the fact that we've lost market share in unsecured over the last few years. And actually, what Tesco does is it allows us to accelerate and secure the plans that we would otherwise have pursued organically. And we believe that we can make those investments and fulfill the distribution plans, not only the ones that we've announced today, but the targets that we are giving ourselves over the next three years. So we'll balance shareholder returns with investments but in our high returning businesses. Okay. Next question, please. If I could go to Joe, please. Thank you.

So our NIM, remember, is an all-in NIM, some of our peers have a banking NIM, which excludes those treasury impacts. Really, what's going on in the fourth quarter is a reversal of what we talked about a year ago. And as such I don’t expect that that impact to reverse as we go into 2024.

It just seems a little bit odd given some of the improving dynamics within that market from a volume perspective, in terms of the data. So I just wanted to check assumptions there. Also, some peers have talked better new lending spreads in 2024 versus 2023? And then on US cards, it's quite a step up in capital requirements from that model change. Just interested to hear if that changes your views at all in terms of the appropriate pace of growth for that business, or was this something that was always going to happen at some point in time? It's just particular timing? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Guy. So the mortgage market through 2023 and actually as we enter 2024 has been somewhat dominated by refinancing activity. So it's pretty skinny margins, still attractive but skinny. And it tends to lead to a negative net in the market, which is what we've seen. So we're calling out nothing more than that, really, that the trends through the tail end of 2023 have been towards negative net. And similarly, that matches up with, I would say, the broader macro trend around deposits, where with QT and a sort of more constricted money supply, we'd expect deposits to fall. So it's really that, that we're calling out in BUK, a contraction in the market in those two larger products, which we would expect to reduce our net interest income expectations before ultimately we see the balance sheet start to grow, and we'd expect that in the second half of 2024. Your second question, so I'm not going to comment too much on the strategy of the cards business because we're going to come to that. But we obviously always knew that we were going to have to go through an IRB conversion for US cards. We typically update the market when the quantum becomes clear and when the timing becomes clear. And that's become clear to us in Q1 of this year. Why are we updating you now? As I said previously, we included an estimate for it contained within our Basel number. Actually, the way things have turned out, it's a bit bigger, it's a year earlier, but conversely is offset by some of the updates that we have on Basel. But later on, Denny will take you through some of the ways in which we expect to specifically counter at this. Okay. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Ben. Yes, we ended the year with a Q4 NIM of 307, bringing the full year to 313. You might recall at Q3, we said we expected to be between 305 and 310, but that was largely dependent on deposit dynamics. And actually, it might be good to go to Slide 15, if we can because it might be helpful for this question. We said it'd be largely dependent on deposit dynamics, and if we saw a replication of Q3, we'd be at the top end of that range. And by my math, that's around 296. We ended up at 307 and the biggest driver is really that movement that you can see on the slide, where the deposit pressure in Q3 was 16 basis points and the deposit pressure in Q4 was 7. And that's really because we saw a stabilization of deposits across Q4. And I think that comes sort of in two ways. Firstly, customer behavior, customer migration really slowed down. And secondly, we saw a stabilization in pricing as the rate environment settled. So as a result, it was a markedly different deposit -- deposit environment. Now clearly, we take that forward into 2024, noting those macro trends. And I would say, also noting that Q1 and Q2 tend to be fairly active as a deposit matter just because of seasonal effects, so paydown of tax, et cetera, but also because of the season. But in the second half of 2024, I would expect this deposit activity to slow down and perhaps a little. And of course, we've got that ongoing impact of the structural hedge. So as we go into 2024, I think it's fair to say perhaps there's a bit more NIM stabilization than we might have expected. But we expect downward pressure on the balance sheet coming from both deposits and mortgages. And we'd expect to start growing the balance sheet again really towards the back end of the year, particularly, for example, through organic card growth in the second half of 2024. And of course, none of that includes Tesco, and we'll update you when we know the completion date. Okay. Where next? Rohith?",

But there's nothing -- there's nothing stand out. There's nothing particular that I would call out for Q4. On the capital point, as I said before, it's a requirement for IRB banks to get to 85%. The eagle-eyed amongst you, if you look in the Pillar 3, I forgot which table, but it might be 28, you'll be able to see that actually post-US cards, we get to around 67%. The step between here and full compliance is largely around the wholesale models. And actually under standardized, the wholesale models do a pretty good job of having the right weights against counterparties to reflect what would otherwise be an advanced treatment. So on wholesale, which is our only remaining big movement to make, we are not anticipating a significant movement in RWAs. And of course, outside of cards, you'd expect a movement from standardized to advance to actually reduce the RWAs. It just doesn't in particular with cards. And our UK cards book is already IRB-compliant. So this brings the US cards book up in alignment with that. Okay, Andy. I think, Andy, you might be our last question in the interest of time.",

The other thing just to call out is, previously, we've seen relatively lumpy debt sales go through that line in the past. Don't expect that going forward. We've got a forward flow arrangements. So it drips through the P&L in a much more gradual way. In terms of the one-offs across Q3 being positive and Q4 being negative, they're all too small really. There's nothing I would specifically call out, which is why we're trying to be helpful here and give you some guidance to help you model it going forward and saying that we expect it to be above 250. And on the corporate lending line, clearly, that does include the costs of our SRT and it does include the cost of the portfolio hedges. But really, the only significant point in the current quarter is £85 million of leveraged loan marks that we took in the quarter. I wouldn't call anything else out specifically.

    "text": "Thank you, Anna. Right. So now we come to the strategy update part. It's been 10 years since our last Investor Day. A lot has changed in the world since then. A lot has changed at Barclays. So today, what we do is we present our vision for the future. It's a vision of a better run, more strongly performing, higher returning bank. It's a vision of a Barclays, which encompasses a potent collection of businesses and capabilities. Each is strong by itself. And together, they are mutually beneficial and reinforcing. It's a Barclays, which is appropriate to a changing and multipolar world, one which values a UK based bank. Equally, it is a Barclays, which seeks to deepen and broaden its role in the UK even as it engages with the world from London. As I say, we are very bullish on the UK as a place in which to do business and from which to do business. Importantly, it is a vision for Barclays that is committed to generating strong financial returns and distributing them to shareholders. In my two years as CEO, I have worked very closely with my colleagues and the Executive Committee, outside of it and with the Board, examining the path on which we have been, the direction we need to take forward. And what you will see in here today are the results of that work. We are creating a simpler, a better, a more balanced bank, words, which I will come back to later. It's dedicated to higher returns for its investors, and how we do that is equally important. It's a vision anchored in ambition -- measured ambitions, I call it, and it's driven by disciplined delivery. And as I said, it's harnessed to our home here in the UK. So we've embraced this plan of measured ambition, measured confidence. We start actually with very strong foundations. Over 20 million UK retail customers, and that is before Tesco, and we bank a one-fourth of UK corporates. In the US, our credit card business has a further 20 million customers. In our Investment Bank, we've built leading global markets and banking businesses, which are at scale today. I repeat, at scale today, delivering for our clients at a time when many competitors have pulled back and, in fact, some still continue to do so. For a long time, fixed income has been the calling card of Barclays. We are number three in credit and joined first fixed income financing. Our investment bank has led landmark transactions. And importantly to me, we were the top UK investment bank in 2023. This is a title to which I feel we all always must aspire. I said that we did an investor update 10 years ago, and Barclays has changed since that time, in fact, changed substantially for the better. We've strengthened the back financially, improved its capitalization and are now leaner. We reduced our headcount by about one-third over this period and our footprint more than 50 countries then to 38 today. We've exited non-priority businesses in Africa, in Asia, in European retail banking as well as commodities, and there are two more in advanced stages of discussion. We've reduced our RWAs by about 20% in this period, strengthened our CET1 ratio by 4.5 percentage points to 13.8% at year end, as we just spoke about. And at the same time, unfortunately, we have incurred about £16 billion on litigation and conduct issues and costs. To me, this is a very, very disappointing number. And it is a stark and serious reminder as to why it is so important to run a bank well. And at the heart of running a bank well is what I call running it in a consistently excellent way. It is the surest way we have to preserve our reputation, protect our bank and all our shareholders. Over the same period, we have reset our financial performance, particularly in the last three years, delivering return on tangible equity above 10% since 2021 and distributing £7.7 billion to shareholders in that period, which is 35% higher than the prior seven years put together. And while this has been an improvement, it is not enough. And indeed, our shareholder experience needs to be better. We have listened, we have heard and we will do even better. So how will we do even better? At one level, I want Barclays to be renowned for excellent operational performance. To me, operational performance and financial success are two sides of the same coin. Operationally, we have worked to what I call this new standard of consistent excellence for over 1.5 years, looking to reduce complexity, harnessing technology, promoting strong risk and controls and aiming to deliver a better customer experience. We need to continue to do this. Financially, we need to drive towards higher returns from our businesses while improving our efficiency. As I will talk about, we will invest RWAs in our higher return in consumer and corporate businesses while maintaining the RWAs and the investment bank broadly stable at their current absolute level. As you will hear, the Investment Bank RWAs will shrink in real terms as they will have to self absorb the impact of Basel 3.1. Crucially, we are targeting higher, more predictable shareholder distributions. And lastly, we will have clearer financial reporting, which will allow you and us to mark our progress more easily. So what will this plan deliver? First of all, improvement in RoTE from 9% statutorily in 2023 to 12% and above -- to greater than 12% in 2026. Second, we plan to distribute at least £10 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026, and this is about 50% of our current market capitalization. Third, we are putting a cap on the RWAs in our Investment Bank, reducing its share of RWAs from 63% in our current CIB construct to around 50% by 2026. And to me, these are the three important parameters and numbers that we're focused on. How will we do this? Over the next three years, we aim to make the bank simpler, run it better and make it more balanced. What does simpler mean? It means, first of all, a simpler business structure and then one that is organized and operated in a simpler way. I'll spend some time on this slide. From today, we will run Barclays through a business structure that, as I said, delivers greater accountability and transparency in reporting to investors. And there are three messages I'd like to bring out on this slide. One, why is this a simpler structure; two, why do we have each of these five businesses; and three, why do they fit together, okay? The structure is simpler because even though we go from three units to five, this reflects the way in which we serve our customers and clients and it increases the transparency on our performance. We will no longer report either consumer cards and payments or the corporate and investment bank in their current construct. Instead first, we bring private banking and wealth management at Barclays into one unit and we report this separately from the US Consumer Bank, which contains our specialty credit card partnership business in the US. From the old CIB, we have created the UK Corporate Bank, which serves midsized corporates in the UK. And this will be managed and reported separately from the Investment Bank, which now comprises global markets and investment banking. The investment banking part also includes our international corporate bank, which serves multinational corporate and institutional clients under one roof. As part of our effort to become a simpler business, we've also considered the strengths and weak opportunities within our portfolio. As a result of that, if you look at what is in gray, we are in advanced discussions on the sale of our German consumer business and our Italian mortgage book, and this will complete our exit from European retail outside of the UK. We are also evaluating options for our UK merchant acquiring business, which I will talk more about later. So the first point was the five businesses. The second point is how do we think about each of these businesses? We are at scale in Barclays UK, we are at scale in the Investment Bank, and we are a scale in the UK Corporate Bank. Our focus is on improving each one of them. Some parts will need to grow and they will. In the Private Bank and Wealth Management space, we are very profitable, as we show you, but we need to scale further. And in the US consumer bank, we are on a journey to scale while mentioning our specialist -- maintaining our specialist focus, which must be more profitable. And that includes better management of capital and the lower cost to income ratio, and we'll talk about that. Finally, why does this collection of businesses fit together? The way we think about it is either they have a UK focus and/or they bring synergies to the bank. For instance, if you take the US consumer bank, it has client synergies with the investment bank but also with our US cards capability as our Tesco mortgage -- Tesco Bank transaction shows. And given that we have in that transaction entered into a partnership program, which is, in fact, the focus of our specialty business in the US. Further, the US consumer business diversifies investment bank in the US stress test CCAR. Lastly, we've announced management changes this morning for our five businesses. They reflect both the promotion of the next generation of leaders for our important businesses as well as a rotation within Barclays to broaden the experience of some of our existing business heads. So Barclays UK will be run by Vim Maru, who ran the equivalent business at Lloyd's, and we look to him to apply his experience with Barclays UK. The UK Corporate Bank will be run by Matt Hammerstein, my colleague who has run Barclays UK for over half a decade and is now ready to step into this new challenge. His deep experience in the UK makes him an opportunate and fit person to run this division. Private Banking and Wealth will be managed by my colleague, Sasha Wiggins, who has served as both my Chief of Staff and managed our public policy effort most recently. She has her career anchored in our Private Bank before she ran our business in Ireland, and she brings the knowledge and the profile and the connectivity within the bank to achieve this ambition successfully. And our Investment Bank will be run by Adeel Khan as Global Head of Markets and Cathal Deasy and Taylor Wright, who remain Co-Heads of Investment Banking. Stephen Dainton, who co-ran Markets with Adeel, is appointed President of Barclays Bank plc and Head of the Investment Bank management. My colleague, Paul Compton, who's been with us on the Executive Committee for eight years, will step back from his current role as Global Head of the CIB and become Chairman of Investment Banking, speaking and working with our most critical clients. The US Consumer Bank continues to be run by Denny Nealon. These business leaders or all members of the Barclays Executive Committee, and they will report to me. So, that was the structure. Equally important in running the bank in a simpler way is how we operate them. We removed 5,000 roles in 2023. We are also repositioning about 30% of the people from our common platform, Barclays Execution Services, which we call BX. That's about 20,000 people. And we are driving that -- moving them into the businesses driving closer ownership, greater accountability, and speed of execution. We are focused on technology, which is a big driver of simplicity. 75% of our workload so far has been moved to the cloud with a plan to get this to 85% to 90%. We expect to decommission a further 450 to 500 legacy systems on top of the 400 that we have decommissioned to-date with a much greater focus in the future on buy versus build. So, I said, first, a simpler bank and then a better bank. What does better mean? Having the simpler business means we can focus on delivering better performance for our customers and clients and as well as improving -- delivering an improved financial performance for you, our shareholders. And we managed to do it in these ways. First, to better returns. As you have heard, we aim to deliver greater than 12% RoTE by 2026. To do that, we will continue to generate consistent high returns Barclays UK, the UK Corporate Bank, and Private Banking and Wealth, while investing more in these higher-returning businesses. At the same time, we aim to improve the investment banks RoTE from 7% in 2023 to be in line with the group target of above 12% by 2026. And in the US Consumer Bank, we are also targeting an RoTE of for 2026, in line with the group. So, up from the 4% in 2023, and building back towards the levels of RoTE, which we have delivered previously. So, we are generating higher group returns by a combination of delivering higher returns from businesses which need to improve and allocating more core capital to businesses that have consistently generated higher returns, and we expect them to continue to do so. The second part of running better is to continue to invest selectively. We have spent £300 million on cost efficiency and revenue growth and protection in 2023, and this number is increasing to £500 million by 2026. And while we continue to invest selectively in the investment bank, the proportion that goes to consumer-facing businesses will grow to 70% and the absolute amount will double. We are getting capital resources, as I said, and investment resources. Better income is not just higher income, but better quality income. And we aim to grow our total income to around £30 billion by 2026. Today, we already have a balanced mix of NII and non-NII, which is relatively resilient through rate cycles. But if you look at the bottom of this chart, you see two parts: retail and corporate and financing. We consider these two to be more stable income streams and they have grown by about 35% since 2021. And the proportion from these more stable income streams will be about 70% of the bank's total income by 2026. This slide reflects the anticipated effect of the announced acquisition of Tesco Bank and the planned disposal of our German cards business. Lastly, and very importantly to me, happy and satisfied customers are the sine qua non for any enterprise. And we need to improve our customer experience and outcomes. I mean, to illustrate this in the UK our Net Promoters Score ranked 8th among 12 leading banks. This is not good enough. We aim to improve the customer experience by investing in it deeply, and making it not just a point of focus, but a point of ambition and a point of pride. Our investments across all businesses are aimed at operational excellence and client satisfaction. As I said at the start, they are the same thing, and it's the same side of one other side of the coin of financial performance. So we spoke about simpler. We spoke about better and we spoke now I'm going to talk about balanced bank. And what does it mean? It means a more balanced allocation of RWAs with more capital deployed to our highest returning opportunities and it also means a more balanced geographical footprint, more concentrated in the UK and in the US. We will continue to add discipline on how we allocate capital both across the bank and within the businesses of the bank. Of the £50 billion which we now expect an RWA increase between now and 2026, we intend to allocate about £30 billion to our three UK businesses: Barclays UK, the UK Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth Management. Now this includes the about £8 billion in RWAs in the Tesco Bank acquisition, which we announced 10 days ago. Of the £20 billion in RWA increases are allocated to the U.S. consumer bank, about £16 billion is driven by the changes in regulation that Anna spoke about earlier. Investment Bank RWAs as I have said will be relatively stable and, in fact, shrink in real terms because they are absorbing -- we are absorbing in the investment bank, the impact of Basel 3.1. Over the medium-term, this will rebalance RWAs between our consumer and wholesale businesses and will support more consistent and higher returns. As I have said, the investment bank is both very competitive and at scale. Our prior CIB construct accounted for about 63% of the group's RWAs. The newly segmented investment bank accounts for about 58%. And as a result of the rebalancing of the group that we've announced today, it will reduce to about 50% by 2026. Further, as I'll talk about later, we will recycle capital dynamically to the highest returning areas within the investment bank, and I'll talk about that in the next presentation. And we do that so that it can grow income without needing more capital, improving productivity and returns for the group. Taken together, all of this delivers a more balanced bank. Now, coming to geography, I said earlier that, we feel very confident in being a bank that operates in the UK and from the UK, and it is time to grow in our UK market. We have been UK-centered bank for 330 years. We are still transatlantic with an important presence in New York. But the UK is a great place to run a scaled banking franchise. The economy has remained resilient. The legal and regulatory environment is extremely strong and trusted. And for our international businesses, people want a UK counterparty. Taken together, operating out of London, we aim to be the UK-centered leader in global finance. So in summary, we aim for stronger returns, greater shareholder distributions and operational excellence. They all go together. We will do so by having a simpler structure, better operation and financial performance and a more balanced business. So I repeat the words I said earlier. On the one hand, simpler, better, more balanced that's the type of bank. On the other, we get there with our approach of being disciplined, consistently excellent in our operations and risk managed in a way that will deliver enhanced returns for our shareholders. So what I will do now is turn it over to Anna to talk through what all of this means in financial terms for our shareholders in more detail. Anna?",

    "text": "Thank you, Venkat. As you've heard, our new three year framework sets out more ambitious financial targets, it's going already, and meaningfully higher our shareholder distributions. I'm now going to take you through what underpins these plans. We start from a strong foundation, having delivered RoTE above 10% for three years now, excluding the structural cost actions taken in the last quarter. Our objective is to deliver RoTE above 12% in 2026 as we grow and generate further efficiencies. Along the way in 2024, we aim to deliver returns of greater than 10% whilst we reposition the organization and navigate the changing macroeconomic environment. Our plans to 2026 include the announced acquisition of Tesco Bank and the planned disposals of the German consumer business and Italian mortgage book, where we are in advanced discussions. I do anticipate that these planned disposals will reduce RoTE in 2024. So on an underlying basis, I expect we'll deliver around 10.5%, broadly flat to 2023. But this inorganic activity focuses our businesses for RoTE improvement beyond 2024. So in executing these plans, we are focused more on what we can control. And over the coming slides, I'll talk you through the drivers of RoTE across income, costs, impairment and why we're comfortable with the assumptions that we have made. But before I do though, I would like to cover the impacts from the cash flow hedge reserve on this slide. With a year-end value of negative £3.7 billion, it is currently a drag to tangible book value per share. As we expect its value to increase going forward, we're confident that our tangible book value will increase from the year-end position of 331p per share. And whilst mechanistically, it creates a drag on routing. It's worth remembering that its movement -- that movements in the cash flow hedge reserve don't impact our ability to distribute capital. So, turning first to income. So what underpins our nearly £5 billion of income growth? First, a tailwind from our structural hedge; second, some reasonable assumptions in the investment banking wallet; and third, the deployment of RWAs into areas where we have a credible opportunity to grow. So the plan includes the capital effect of £30 billion of RWAs deployed into high-returning UK business, and we will focus that on areas where we are, frankly, underrepresented. For example, we've been traditionally been underweight in high-value mortgages. Our acquisition of Kensington provides us with the capability to expand in specialty mortgages and drive higher margins. In our UK corporate bank, our ratio of loans to deposits is very low and much lower than our peers. In UK cards, we have lost ground and aim to recover it. And clearly, the acquisition of the Tesco business accelerates and secures our plans in this respect. As a reminder, we hedged the return from rate-insensitive deposit balances and our equity, and in doing so, we smooth our income profile through rate cycles, reducing interest rate risk. Given that we are at the point in the cycle where rates may have peaked and are now expected to fall, it acts as support and stabilizer. We have around £170 billion of hedges maturing over the next three years at an average yield of 1.5%, significantly lower than current swap rates. The expected NII tailwind is significant and predictable. £8.6 billion of aggregate income is already locked in over the next three years. And in addition to that, reinvesting around 3/4 of the £170 billion at current swap rates would compound over the next three years to increase structural hedge income in 2026 by £2 billion versus 2023. Turning now to the assumptions that underpin our investment bank. Venkat and the Adeel are going to take you through how we plan to improve our RWA productivity and reallocate capital within the investment bank overall to generate higher income and returns. But it's very important to us that our growth in the investment bank is driven more by the execution of our own initiatives than by the market wallet. So we are not assuming that the market wallet returns to the highs of 2020 and '21. In fact, our plans assume that the market's wallet is broadly flat to 2023, and the investment banking wallet reverts to the 10-year average from last year's decade lows. Going forward, we do expect higher income from the investment bank. Of course, managing costs is at the heart of what we control, and I'm now going to explain how both the efficiency programs and the changing shape of our investment spend deliver a more efficient and profitable bank. I gave a breakdown of our structural cost actions earlier. And to date, we've used efficiency savings to offset inflation. Now we expect these to more than offset inflation, bringing us capacity for business growth. The first £1 billion of savings lands in 2024, including payback from around half of the Q4 structural cost actions and a further £1 billion of cost efficiencies is expected through to 2026. And it's really important to stress that the efforts will not end there but continue to benefit our businesses beyond that point. We would expect in our business growth cost to flex in line with income. So overall, we're targeting a cost-to-income ratio in the high 50s by 2026, improving from 63% in 2023. Given the income target of £30 billion by 2026, we'd expect costs to be higher in absolute terms versus 2024 at around £17 billion. So spend on regulatory change has been very intense in the run-up to Basel 3.1, and we anticipate that this will peak in 2024 and then fall to a more normal level as material projects complete. This will give us the capacity to invest more in income growth, efficiencies and returns without increasing our total investment spend. And on the next slide, you'll see how these actions will improve efficiencies in each of our businesses. We expect to drive better cost income ratios across all of our divisions and not all of them, however, will be top quartile compared to peers by 2026. Whilst the leading cost efficiency is a goal for all of our businesses over time, for some of them, we don't believe it's a credible ambition within this plan period. Barclays UK and the investment bank fall into that category and together represents some 70% of the cost savings we're expecting. And whilst the 2026 targets will take us more in line with the top quartile of peers, they don't represent the scale of our ambition, and we're committed to driving further efficiency savings beyond that point. In BUK, our ongoing transformation program has been successful in streamlining and digitizing, but there is more to do. And you'll hear more on how the identified savings will offset inflation and facilitate growth. In the investment bank, we spent about £3 billion since 2021 to sustain and grow future income, and around two-thirds of that is in market technology whilst the focus in banking has been more on people. And we will now monetize the investments. So in the future, we aim to self-fund further investments, and total costs are expected to rise only modestly from 2023 levels. Turning now to our risk positioning. I explained earlier that we plan to increase RWAs in Barclays UK, UK Corporate and Private Banking and Wealth by an aggregate £30 billion. This is a substantial shift in capital allocation and will reflect significant growth in lending across all three businesses in the planned period. When considering the associated risk, it is essential to understand where we start from in balance sheet terms. We've grown lending between 2019 and 2023 by £29 billion but that's through mortgages at low LTVs and lending to corporates over which we have significant loss protection through risk transfer trades. Our unsecured lending has fallen despite US cards growth. So, at this point in the cycle and as inflation continues to fall, we see an opportunity to reestablish our position in lending in the UK and unsecured in particular. And because of where we start, we're comfortable that we can do that within our existing risk appetite whilst maintaining our 50 to 60 basis point loan loss rate through the cycle target. In Barclays UK, as we grow, we expect the normalization and loan loss rates towards 35 basis points, consistent with the 2019 level. In the US Corporate Bank, we expect the loan loss ratio of about 400 basis points through the cycle as we grow a more diversified portfolio and optimize our credit mix, still prime but not exclusively super prime like our LI files. And finally, as we grow our UK corporate bank lending book, we'll maintain our diversified portfolio, including our long-standing prudent approach to commercial real estate. And we'll continue to use significant risk transfer protection where appropriate, and I expect a loan loss rate of about 35 basis points. Over recent years, we benefited from our diversified business model through a range of macro environments. And this diversification has provided us with relative stability to RoTE during the 2020 to 2023 period that we've just experienced. For example, in 2022 at the onset of the pandemic, our global markets business supported our performance when elevated impairment charges impact to the rest of the group. In 2023, we've seen a weaker investment bank income and decreased volatility and lower deal activity. But in this environment, our consumer and corporate businesses have provided ballast to group returns. We believe there's a natural offset built into our diversified business model by income and by geography and further supported by the stabilizing effect of the structural hedge. And reflecting this, we are confident that we can deliver consistent returns in a range of scenarios, providing a floor to our ambition. And on this slide, we've provided you with our macroeconomic and market assumptions, which we view as realistic. The next few slides describe how our drive towards higher and more predictable returns come together for our shareholders. We have a clear hierarchy for capital allocation. In order of priority, first, how much capital do we need to run the bank, taking into account regulatory changes including Basel 3.1. Our 13% to 14% CET1 ratio range remains unchanged with sufficient flexibility and appetite to operate within the range and absorb headwinds. By doing so, we'll deliver for our investors, our customers, our clients and our colleagues regardless of the environment. Our next priority, having maintained our target regulatory capital is to our shareholders, and going forward we expect to generate a greater amount of free capital for shareholder distributions. And third, we will balance this thoughtfully as we invest selectively in our higher-returning divisions, resulting in a more profitable RWA mix over time and a better bank for our stakeholders. We set a high bar for investment returns relative to the importance we place on shareholder distributions. In 2023, our 9% statutory RoTE delivered more than 125 basis points of CET1 capital accretion. By 2026, with higher returns, we expect this to grow above 200 basis points. We expect meaningful capital generation over the next three years. Taking into account capital demands from regulatory change and investment in higher-returning businesses, we expect to have meaningful free capital supporting our distribution plan on the following slide. We have distributed a total of 7.7 to shareholders over the past three years compared to £5.7 billion over the preceding 7, and we expect this to increase further through to 2026. We've made one step change. And as you've heard today, we plan to make another and return at least £10 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. And this is in addition to today's announced full year final distribution. Including those distributions, the total would be at least £11.8 billion by 2026 and represents approximately 55% of our current market cap. From this year onwards, we plan to keep the total dividend broadly stable and grow dividend per share progressively through lower share count. Over the past three years, we've reduced our total number of shares in issue by around 13% and do expect further reduction from the higher planned share buybacks from here. So to summarize, there are three key points of reset in today's targets. First, we're targeting a RoTE of above 12% in 2026, up from 9% statutory in 2024. Second, we expect this improved profitability to support our plans to distribute at least £10 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. And finally, the proportion of the RWAs in our investment bank to the rest of the bank will reduce to around 50% by 2026. We have also set ourselves some supporting targets, which allow us and you to track our progress. We expect to grow our income to around £30 billion by 2026 with more stable income streams growing by around 15% and maintaining a high-quality mix. We aim to improve our cost-income ratio to the high 50s as we balance future investments with further efficiency savings and capitalize on the cost actions we've taken already. And we maintain a 50 basis points to 60 basis points loan loss rate guidance as we grow our loan book within the existing risk appetite, all the while maintaining a solid foundation and operating across our 13% to 14% CET1 ratio range. Now I'll hand back to Venkat.",

    "text": "Thanks, Anna. So to summarize this first part of the presentation, what is the investment case for Barclays? As I said, we have very strong foundations. We have a high returning UK retail and corporate franchise, which complements our top-tier global investment bank with scale in our home market in the UK and in the US. We manage our capital in a disciplined way, growing our higher returning divisions, while improving RWA productivity within the investment bank. And over the medium-term, we will rebalance our capital allocation between and across our consumer and wholesale businesses, and we do this in order to support more consistent and higher returns to our shareholders. So from a strong foundation of double-digit returns over the life of the plan, we plan to deliver over 12% RoTE by 2026. And I think this reflects both ambition and realism. We are well-capitalized, have deep liquidity, sound risk management. And when you combine that with consistent and improved profitability, we believe it enables a higher return of capital to you, our shareholders. And we plan to return at least £10 billion, as Anna said, to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. This is our vision for a better run, more strongly performing and higher-returning Barclays. So I will now open for question and answers, for which we have about half an hour assigned. Please limit yourself to two questions per room that we can get around as many of you as possible. As always, please introduce yourself, and there will be more time for Q&A after the business presentations.",

I guess where I'm coming from is, there's quite a bit of headwinds, as Anna pointed out probably earlier than expected on credit card.

We -- in fact, one of these things was identified many years ago is something we wanted to do in Italian mortgages. And German cards, we are not the best holder for that asset. It's a non-core to us. So that's the reason to do it. Obviously, if you gain some benefits from it, you can deploy it elsewhere. But the primary purpose is the simplification of our business and concentrating on our core capabilities.",

    "text": "Thank you, Alvaro. Let me pick up the capital detail there. So, if I just take the businesses in turn, As Venkat said, the overall objective is simplification. Our German cards business is not large in scale. You'll see from our disclosures, it's about €4.5 billion. And as we noted earlier, we would expect that to be -- the disposal to be slightly accretive to capital but not an enormous number given the scale of the business. Our Italian mortgage business, we are relatively well-progressed. We might expect some negative impact on RoTE from the sales I called out previously, but we expect that to be capital-neutral. So, it's actually neutral to our distribution plans. And in relation to the payments business, we're not required -- or our distribution plans do not require any action on that business at all. As we said, we've got it under a strategic review as we consider in future options for it. But we don't require a sale of that business to fulfill the £10 billion. As it relates to specific timing, the way I would think about it is we'd expect 2024 to be broadly similar to 2023 and we'd expect distributions to increase over time at the point when Basel 3.1 is behind us and when the high returns for the businesses start to come through. So, I would say a gradual increase over time. Okay, I was going to say Jason has his hand up for longer. So, let's go to Jason.",

The impact of disposals in the round, all of the potential things that you're trying to get done on this year's RoTE, I appreciate Italy probably is a loss-making endeavor but there may be gains elsewhere. So, what have you got in the RoTE guide for this year for that? And then secondly, the targets for 2024 quite clearly suggests no negative operating leverage from all the moving around that's going to take place in the balance sheet and so on. And while I appreciate a lot of the guidance you've given for 2026, as you look at consensus for 2024, it's at least 10% lower in profit terms than you're suggesting you'll achieve today.

    "text": "Yes. Okay. So, I referred to it in my scripted remarks. We'd expect the impact of inorganic to be around 40 or 50 basis points this year. So, that's why we've distinguished between our statutory target of greater than 10 and indeed the number that I called out on an underlying basis, which is around 10.5. And as a RoTE matter, the biggest moving part in there is actually Italian mortgages. But as I said, no not expected to have a significant impact on capital. So, hopefully, that's relatively clear for 2024. In just of 2024, I would say as I look at consensus, obviously, our plans are above their -- my expectation of cost is broadly an element with consensus, so I think around 16.5%, I would be happy with that number. There is clearly a difference in terms of income expectation. I'd also call out, it looks like there's a difference in terms of impairment expectation as well. Remember, before I talked about US cards perhaps being a little bit heavier in the first half of the year and then falling later. So, I think they're probably the biggest difference is, Jason.",

The first one is just one of the key highlights of your plan is the growth ambition both in the UK and outside the UK. And I guess if we look at the evolution over the last few years, the change here seems to be the ambition to grow the UK and in particular, I guess, a change in the UK unsecured and cards strategy. I think, Anna, you described it has not a change in risk appetite. And I was wondering if you could elaborate that. Because from the outside, it might appear that you are changing your risk appetite to take more risk in the UK. So that's the first question. The second question is, there are plenty of people out here who are more -- who reward cost-cutting plans and might be less optimistic on the revenue environment. So, just on that point, the 1.7 billion of business growth-related costs, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of how permanent those costs might be, and if you ended up in a macro environment, which is slightly different from what is in your plan, how much of that 1.7 billion can be flexed quite easily?

So within our broad risk appetite, which is the way we generally look at not just what our expected losses, our credit losses are, but also internal stress tests and so on. This fits well in. In a sense, it's a reversal of a risk position, which the former Chief Risk Officer took a few years ago, where post-Brexit and in COVID, we were extremely cautious on the UK consumer, rightly or wrongly. And equally, there was a structure which we had in our credit card business that favored longer bigger balance transfers. What we're talking about now is something that does not emphasize that. It is a generally higher quality, but broader expansion of unsecured lending. And this is both in loans and in cards. The Tesco portfolio by our judgment has a very similar credit profile to our own. And so it is within the broader risk limits. Obviously, you're taking on more risk by doing it than if you didn't, which is the point of your question.

We've consistently -- under consensus consistently under 30 basis points. So we're starting from an extremely low base rate. And actually, we've already started acquiring. We stepped back into the market in '22. It just takes a while for that lending to season through, which is what we're observing now. On your second question around costs, our fundamental objective here is the RoTE, it's 12%. And therefore, as far as Venkat and I are concerned, the primary target is the cost-income ratio target. The £17 billion is the number that falls out, okay? And that £1.7 billion is the business growth that we would expect to flex. Now most of that is run the bank cost, there'll be an element of performance costs in there. And of course, we will seek to flex that if the income is either up or down relative to that £17 billion, and that's why we're calling that number out specifically. As to your point around the macro though, I'll take you back to the point where we feel like we've made realistic assumptions. We've got a well-diversified bank. So we're confident in our ability to grow. We've set out today for you the expectation of that, which is 30 and 17.

    "text": "Thank you. Andrew Coombs from Citi, again. Two questions. First, big picture strategic question. If you believe the press is part of Project Minerva, originally, there were some bigger strategic decisions considered the US cards, the equities business, et cetera, et cetera. Obviously, what you've decided today is more kind of shifting things around the edges and reallocation of capital as opposed to any larger exits or divestments. So if you could just elaborate on thoughts there, if there was anything you consider anything you ruled out, that would be helpful. Second question, number-specific question on Slide 48, our favorite hedge roll. I missed this initially, but in the footnote, you say you only plan to roll three quarters of the hedge, which would suggest quite a sizable decline in the notional. So why is that? What's the rationale there? And if you could also just provide us with the split of where the income is recognized now on the new segmentation basis. So two-thirds will be in UK, but how does the other one-third split between IBAN and corporate UK?",

    "text": "So, what I said at the start, Andy, was that in two years as CEO, working with my colleagues, working with the Board, we've obviously taken a broad and deep look at the bank and the direction which we want to take. And your question was specifically about the investment bank. And it has been very clear to me from the very start that the investment bank, a, has been at scale, approaching scale, that the businesses which we have work fairly well together and are linked and are mutually reinforcing. We'll talk a little about efficiencies which we can do within the investment bank, between banking and markets and even within markets. So I'll come back later to that question about where are we getting our the efficiencies from when we come to the investment bank section. But it's equally important to recognize where we start from in the investment bank. There are many businesses in which we are not. And we are at scale for what we do. We are not in commodities. We are not in Asian equities. We are not in local emerging markets other than in India and a bit in Brazil and Mexico, actually Mexico. So there are things we are not in and we don't plan to get into them. And if you even look at the last three or four years, the areas we have built are three and talk about it, areas of focus. Financing is one of them where we've been steadily accreting market share. Equities has been one of them through prime, but not just prime; and securitized products because in the fixed income is the calling card of Barclays, as I said, and you can't be in fixed income without being strong in securitized products. And we've always been good in origination and financing and what we are doing is building trading. So it is very conscious of the ecosystem in markets -- and in banking, as we will talk about, it's been debt capital markets heavy moving to equity and ECM. But it fits together. We don't feel the need at the scale which we have and the footprint that we have to take any of the sort of more drastic actions that others have taken. So let's come back to US cards. I believe it's a business of great synergy, as said, and it stands on its own two feet. It had a low RoTE print this year, but we're going to talk to you about how we manage the capital change as well as how we -- not just in some capital management but also cost management. So we'll come back to that.",

So that's why we're saying we -- our assumption is that we'll roll about three-quarters of it, and that's what builds up the math that I referred to. As to where that actually lands, still two-thirds within BUK. The rest of it will be spread across UK corporate. There will be some in the investment bank both because of the international corporate bank, but also remember, the equity structural hedges allocated through RWAs and then obviously the private banking and wealth. So perhaps we'll come back to you and others, Andy, with a bit more of a detailed split of how we expect to land in the future.",

I'm just interested in that plan, how much incremental revenues you might have generated from the IB. Obviously, not looking for a number, but just in broad senses.

And then the second one was just, you've given us some very helpful information on how you're re-segmenting the businesses. Curious to understand a bit more about how that changes the way that you actually run the business. So this essentially is a breaking out of subdivisions within existing businesses.

    "text": "Okay. So I think when you look at the way we -- Anna described the capital and the use of capital, she said there were three things. The first thing was to be a well-capitalized bank, and that is the 13% to 14%. The second thing was the shareholder returns, the £10 billion. And the third thing was after that, investments. If you look at the investments we're making and have been making and we lay out in this plan, they are in businesses that are today returning in the high-teens or 20% and above. well above what most people would consider our cost of capital. So that's basically the answer to your question, Rohith, that if we have that waterfall, we have the discipline that anything we are going to do is going to be above what is our accepted cost of capital. And so, I don't foresee ourselves breaking from that waterfall, right? We're going to be guided by it. That's the first part. On re-segmentation, and Anna, you should stick into both. But on re-segmentation, first of all, as I said, it's guided by how we run our businesses and our clients. There are tremendous synergies, including synergies, which you might not easily anticipate. I spoke about the synergies between US cards and the UK cards business. Tesco is a 20 million credit card portfolio, 20 million is a lot of people to bring on to your systems. When we did GAAP, we did 10 million, right? So we clearly have an experience of a scale that, frankly, no other UK bank can match. You'll also see synergies between private banking and wealth and our corporate bank, private banking and wealth and our investment bank in terms of both products and clients and, of course, private banking and wealth and our UK banking network. We'll talk about that and the corporate bank synergies to everybody else. So there are strong synergies, which we intend to exploit and continue to exploit as we go through this. And you'll hear more about it in the afternoon, later today.",

    "text": "Thank you. All right. So we're now going to begin with the discussions about the individual businesses. We'll begin first with the Investment Bank and then we'll go to U.S. Cards and Barclays U.K. And then I will come back to spend two minutes on -- not two minutes, a few minutes, on the U.K. Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth. Later this year, you're going to hear from the heads of those businesses in more detail. And then within the Investment Bank, Adeel Khan is going to talk about the Markets business. I will cover banking at a higher level. And later this year, you'll hear from Kahil and Taylor in detail on banking. So let's begin with the Investment Bank. For over two decades, investors have been asking questions about the size and the importance of Investment Bank at Barclays. And you heard a little even today. Should we have it? Will it be competitive? Is it good for the U.K. to have an investment bank and more? Let me be very clear. I am proud of what we've achieved. We have built a leading business, a globally competitive investment bank. As I've said, it's performed very well. It is at scale. It is a critical part of Barclays, and will continue to be an important part of Barclays. I'm equally clear that there is a lot more to do. Our investment bank has to be higher-returning, and relatively speaking, it has to become a smaller part of Barclays. As I've also said in answer to some of the questions, our Investment Bank is a focused business. We powerfully cover large sections of the global capital markets with deep client relationships. And what we want to do is strengthen this position in our key areas of coverage. We aim to deepen our client relationships and to monetize the investments we have already made. And even as our investment bank grows in absolute income, we aim to hold our capital broadly flat to today's levels. And so importantly, therefore, we expect a higher RoTE from our investment bank. And we're going to be more efficient in our use of capital, as I've discussed earlier. But the simple way to think about it, is that we are looking for the Investment Bank to grow and to contribute more while consuming less, to contribute more while consuming less and we're going to show you how. So what is the Investment Bank? We've changed that structure, as I mentioned earlier. And so going forward, its two businesses: Global Markets and Investment Banking. Together in 2023, they contributed £11 billion of top line revenue to the bank. The UK Corporate Bank was part of what we called the CIB, and that is now reported separately and I'll talk about it later. There is also an important business, the international corporate bank, which serves our largest corporate clients in the UK and elsewhere. It already works closely with our investment banking business but now will be managed, operated and reported as one unit. This combination of businesses will allow us to deepen our relationships with clients, both large cap and multinational corporates, which require access to the full spectrum of investment banking capabilities. And so that is beyond DCM, ECM and advisory into corporate lending and transaction banking. The Global Markets business, which comprises fixed income and equities, remains the same. Important, of course, is how markets and banking cooperate and work together to deliver the entire suite of investment bank capabilities to our clients, and I'll come back to that. So today, the investment bank has strong foundations. As I said, with the scale and breadth to succeed amongst our largest global peers, and we are focused on our core strengths, which is very important. It's diversified and has a stable top line, which I will take you through, and we have focused top tier businesses and have demonstrated strong risk and capital discipline. The secret sauce in our investment bank is in our synergies. I'll repeat it. The secret sauce in our investment bank is in our synergies. We are big enough to offer multiple sophisticated products to our clients, but both nimble and culturally driven to work closely across banking and markets to customize delivery and to create tailored solutions. And this nimbleness and cultural drive are really important. In fact, we are renowned for the sophistication of our service, especially our fixed income and risk solutions for our clients. About 55% of our revenues come from the Americas, which is the largest financial market in the world, and which is why I believe we are the only known US domiciled investment bank that can consistently compete with the US banks and win. This audience more than anybody else should appreciate the importance of a strong research franchise. And so I think you know us well here. We have many top research teams and we are maintaining momentum as a top five research house globally. We lead with data-driven content and help clients identify and adapt to changing thematic trends of the future, and these capabilities underpin our client relationships. And it's an important ingredient in helping us grow our rankings both with our top 100 markets clients and with banking clients and you'll hear Adeel about that in a minute. So let's go to financial performance. Looking at our financial performance over the last three years, what you will see is that our income has been relatively stable at around £11 billion, and I'll talk a little about that. But RoTE has reduced from 14% three years ago to 7% in 2023. Both RWAs and costs have risen as we've invested deliberately in the business. But what we want to show you now is how we will improve our RWA productivity, capture cost efficiencies and generate income growth by monetizing the investments, which we have already made. We aim for the RoTE of the investment bank to be in line with the group's greater than 12% target by 2026 through three key levers: income, RWA productivity and cost -- income, RWA productivity and cost. So let me start with income. One reason why people have always questioned the value of the investment bank within Barclays is they think that it's a volatile business. And up to a point, it is. There are parts of this business income that fluctuate with the markets and fluctuate with the economic environment. What we have been doing though is to construct a business that has greater stability through two things: one is diversification and the other is what we call ballast, businesses with stable income. So if you look at the top-line, it has been in the £11 billion to £11.5 billion range since 2020 through changing, and some would argue, volatile market environment which include COVID, which include recent geopolitical instability. So let me take those two things first. First, you take diversification. We get diversification between the volatility-related elements of banking fees and market trading revenues or what we call intermediation, the top two lines. And in volatile markets, trading revenues go up, deal volumes tend to shrink. And in common times, the opposite happens. So this means a combination of the two more stable than for banks which have only one deal making or only have trading, right? That's the diversification between the relatively volatile elements. Then you come to the ballast, which is what you see circled at the bottom. And the first part of that is our financing income, the money which we make from lending to institutional clients against stocks, what people call prime, and against bonds, which we call fixed income financing. It's a business in which we have invested heavily over the last number of years. It's technologically complex and it's very sophisticated. You have to manage the risks well. And our income has grown from around £1.8 billion in 2019 to £2.9 billion in 2023. Adeel will talk about this in a moment. The second source of ballast is our international corporate bank. That income has grown also. It's helped, of course, by the rising interest rate environment. But in turn, it makes for a more stable top-line. So I said first is income. And you continue with income, and what you've got, as I said, is a scale business overall, but two businesses at slightly different stages of evolution and success. In Global Markets, we've made significant investments in technology and capital and we've had a corresponding growth in revenues. What we want to do now is monetize the investments which we have made and continue and deepen our capital discipline. The bottom-line here is that the markets business is at scale, it's well invested in, and it's a counterparty of choice for the most sophisticated investors in the world. The investment banking business is at an earlier stage of maturity. It has just gone through a repositioning under new leadership. We have to strengthen in DCM and in the UK and with financial sponsors -- we have strength in DCM and in the UK and with financial sponsors, but we need them to broaden and we need to deepen. We're happy to focus here on RWA productivity, trying to move the business from being debt-heavy, which tends to be RWA-heavy to be more balanced across advisory and ECM, and fully integrate with our international corporate bank. Anna spoke to you earlier about the income growth in the investment bank and how much of it is under control, is in our control. And on this slide, what I want to convey to you is that over half of our income growth is coming from initiatives, which we control. This means, of course, doing things better, because our team and client relationships can improve and deepen. And it is not arising from heroic assumptions about wallet growth or market share. We expect high single-digit income CAGR through 2026, but over half of that comes from management initiatives in markets and banking, which Adeel and I will cover in more detail shortly. The remainder comes from a normalization of the industry wallet. But as you heard from Anna earlier, it's not the industry wallet going from lows to highs, but it's going from its currently low levels to more historically normal levels. So the first lever was income. The second is RWA productivity. So moving to that second lever, what does RWA productivity mean? And why is it important? As you can see from the top left, as we've increased RWAs in the markets business, we've actually kept the ratio of income to RWAs relatively constant. This reflects capital discipline, which we need to continue by recycling capital continuously to higher returning opportunities. And it also benefits from the higher velocity of capital, which we allocate to markets. On the other hand, the right hand side shows banking income over RWA, and this has declined over this period, which reflects the reliance on DCM in our current mix. As I mentioned, we have a plan to improve this, and I'll cover this among the key initiatives in a moment. Overall, we intend to increase RWA productivity by reallocating capital towards the higher returning international corporate bank, and that's within investment banking, and as well as towards financing opportunities in markets. So income, RWA productivity, costs. And so the third important lever is costs. We have invested in a very planned and focused way in the investment bank, both in markets and banking, to the tune of about £3 billion in cash investment in the last three years. In markets, it's mostly been about technology. Investing in the modernization of our infrastructure not only simplifies our operations and reduces costs, it also drives improved stability on our platforms, which leads to better client outcomes. Remember what I said at the start. Technology excellence and client outcomes are the same thing. In investment banking, of course, it's much more of a human capital business. And what we've invested is in people with a focus of the infusion of talent in our focus sectors and products. Now, what we intend to do is to monetize these investments and grow future income with relatively modest cost growth expected across the investment bank. So this includes higher performance costs, given the higher income, which we have in our plan. We will, of course, continue to make focused investments in our client franchise, but we expect these to be self-funded by efficiency savings. Overall, we expect to deliver an improved cost income ratio from around the 69% we have now to the high 50s by 2026. So, let me now take you through these two pieces, and Adeel Khan is going to begin -- I'll begin with investment banking and then Adeel will go to market. So in investment banking, I said that our markets and banking businesses are at different stages of evolution. What our markets business did three to five years ago has been paying off, and we look to do the same in investment banking. So we start with some points of advantage. As I said, we are consistently number six globally. We finished this year over 2023 as the top UK investment bank, which is a position I always inspire to hold. We look more like a US bank than a European one. If you look at 66% of our revenues coming from the Americas and which is a much more profitable market than Europe. I've also said debt and DCM is the calling card of Barclays, where we are number five globally. We've also ranked number five with financial sponsors and have established ECM and advisory practices, but we need to grow them, and I'll describe that shortly. We intend to leverage our strength in DCM in several ways. We drive greater product penetration with clients, making existing capital allocated to our loan book work harder for us. First, we aim to broaden the product relationship with existing clients, principally by a treasury-oriented products and services. Second, we will continue to provide sophisticated rates, FX and equity risk management solutions to our clients through ongoing collaboration with global markets. And these synergies are important. This kind of business is typically originated with investment banking clients, but designed and executed in our markets business. Adding incremental products requires minimal additional capital and provides attractive recurring revenues, as I'll cover on the next slide. Our international corporate banking business is already well established in the UK, where if you look at it, 92% of our UK investment banking clients, have corporate banking dealings with us. That number is far lower outside the UK, and we aim to increase that by fully integrating our treasury platform into the investment bank. The ICB generates high-quality income and about 80% of it is recurring, therefore, making it more stable and more predictable, and it is capital efficient, helping RWA productivity, which is an important area of focus for us, as I said. We also need to rebalance our investment banking mix. We recognize clearly that we are overweight in DCM, and we are going to grow the proportion of our relative share in ECM and M&A, and we aim to do this in two ways. First, we have invested on the top right to upgrade talent in technology health care and energy transition. Over 60% of the hires for which we made in 2023 were in these sectors. And together, they represent -- these sectors represent about 40% of the industry wallet in the last three years, and we are confident that they will continue to be important. We also have an opportunity to leverage our strong position with financial sponsored relationships, where we rank on par with our US peers and to do more, ECM and M&A with the same sponsor clients as our US peers do. So to summarize on investment banking, we've got the products. We've got the client relationships. We've got the capability. What we've got to do now is to translate it into returns. And the bottom line in the Investment Bank is we expect to generate about £700 million of income growth by 2026 from management initiatives. We will do this by building our key share to the levels we had a few years ago in the ways in which I outlined, and by improving our income productivity to drive further returns. I will turn over now to Adeel to talk about global markets, and then I'll come back to conclude.",

    "text": "Thank you, Venkat. Good morning, everyone. My name is Adeel Khan. I run the markets business at Barclays, and I've been here for the last 15 years, a stat I'm incredibly proud of. So before I start, I think it's important to set the stage. Over the last few years, we've all lived in an increasingly challenging environment. This has been experienced by a lot of few. As Venkat mentioned, we've gone through a pandemic, a war in Middle East and Europe and also a unpredictable inflationary environment. So our clients have also experienced this and the increasingly need a more reliable partner. So with all of this in mind, our ambition for the business is fairly simple. Number one, we want to be a consistent partner for our clients. And secondly, we want to drive stable double-digit returns for our shareholders. So how do we do this and what are our drivers for success. Firstly, we won deep, broad client relationships within our business. Secondly, we want prudent risk and capital discipline within our businesses. And lastly, we want to transform our technology to drive better outcomes. So now I will run you through our plans for the next few years. But before that, let's start with the numbers. So on the top left, you can see in 2019, we produced £5.3 billion of revenues. Now we knew at £5.3 billion, we cannot produce stable double-digit returns or be consistent to our clients. So we embarked on a new strategy. And over the last four years, we have increased our average revenues by £2.2 billion. And today, we run a £7.5 billion revenue franchise. Now we care deeply about the capital we use to produce these numbers. And last year, our income to RWA ratio was 6.2%. Now that is a little light compared to where we like to operate, and we have generally operated higher. Plus in periods of volatility, like 2020, we were at 8%, which means we serve as a natural hedge for group income. Now over this period, we've also grown our institutional client market share by 200 basis points. In fact, since 2019, we have been the second fastest-growing client franchise among the major banks. Now if you look on the right, you can see that we have diversified ourselves across geographies, capabilities and businesses. Our regional footprint has a strong lean towards Americas. As Venkat mentioned, we are the only non-US bank with scale access to the largest capital markets pool in the world. Our businesses are equally weighted among equities, spread and macro. And while individually, these revenue streams can be volatile depending on the operating environment, together, we think they are stable. And lastly, we have grown financing. It is one-third of our revenues today. This is a stable and predictable income that allows us to be more strategic with our clients. So in summary, when you think about markets today, it is a business with deep, broad client relationships. It's also highly diversified, so it can produce stable double-digit returns. And lastly, it is at scale at scale to be competitive and a relevant player in the market. Now Venkat talked about simpler, better and more balanced, I will walk you through the same journey and starting with simple. So for us, it's very simple. Our client franchise is what drives everything. On the top left, you can see through an intense focus on our clients, we have been improving our client franchise. Today, we are a top five client franchise in global markets, in fixed income and in equities. In fact, what is more impressive because you have US banks in the mix here is that we have grown our client franchise by one notch in markets, two notches in fixed income and three notches in equities. Within our client franchise, we have also grown our share with the top 100 clients by 220 basis points. And our growth and progress is not limited to that account base. We've made similar progress with the next 150 and the rest of our clients. Now if you look on the right, you can see how many of our top 100 clients we rank top 5 with. In 2021, that number was 30%. We wanted to deepen our relationships with these clients. Why? Because they are large and they're growing. They're also more complex. So they like to partner with the same reliable banks again and again. And that brings more predictability and stability to our income. So we implemented an accountability framework with a lead client executive per account. And we figured out where we needed to lean in across the investment bank and the group versus asking for more. And today, through that framework, we have grown our number to 49. Now we will apply the same framework and intensity of coverage to grow this number further to 70 by 2026. Now staying on the team of simpler clients are important. They bring us to business, but the stability of our platform relies heavily on how well we risk manage ourselves. On the left, you can see that we have broadly kept flat broadly stable VAR profile despite transacting much more volumes to our platforms. Over the last few years, we've also made a deliberate effort to move away from illiquid longer-dated type intermediation activities into more flow focused businesses. And so because of that today, we turn over 80% of our market's cash balance sheet on a weekly basis. And this is what enables us to outperform in periods of volatility like Q1 2020 and Q2 2022. At the same time, 70% of our capital profile today is under two years, and that is how we recycle 20% of our intermediation RWAs every quarter towards higher returning opportunities. Now on the right, you can see the bell curve of our income distribution, and you can see how we have shifted it to the right. In 2019, half of our trading days, half of our trading days sat in the £0 to £15 million bucket. Today, we have moved them all into the £16 million to £30 million bucket. This effectively means we have raised the floor on our income, and it also makes us more stable. In this process, we've also taken the number of our loss days or loss-making days from 16 to seven in 2023. Now moving to the team of better. Let's start with our businesses. Here, you can see the strength of our franchise. Our top five revenue rank businesses are 53% of the wallet today. So effectively, we are a top five player in half of the market's wallet. This is a very large wallet of nearly £100 billion. And within these businesses, we have a strong market share of 11% today. In 2019, we had 8% market share. And over the last few years, we have grown that, and we've held a double-digit market share now for the last three years. Also today, 72% of our income comes from these established capabilities, which again means we are more stable. So how did we achieve this? Since 2019, we used our capital discipline and allocated them an extra five points of capital. And now five years later, their contribution to our revenues has increased by 12 points versus the respective wallet contribution only growing by two points. This tells you that there is strong evidence here that when we provide oxygen to our established capabilities, we can outperform the market. Let's take the example of our equity prime business, which Venkat talked about. In 2019, we were outside the top five. This is a business that requires a huge amount of infrastructure. And we know in order to finance a client, we must be able to execute clear, settle and asset service to collateral across all major global markets. So when the operating environment changed in 2020, we invested. And today, we run a top five franchise that actively competes with its US peers. Now I'd like to make two final points on this slide. Firstly, the 11% market share we have here, this is in our established capabilities. We want to grow this further. This is where we have operating leverage. And secondly, as Venkat mentioned, prior to 2019, we did make some very difficult decisions. We exited commodities. We exited parts of our onshore emerging market trading businesses. We exited parts of our Asia equity business, and that is what has allowed us and enabled us to be consistent to our clients for the last few years. Now moving on to the rest of our franchise. There are parts of our franchise where we are not top five. We still have a healthy market share of 5% within these businesses. And we think about -- when we think about these businesses, they are important to us for two reasons. Firstly, they help us maintain a stable ecosystem to our clients, so we can be consistent to our clients. Secondly, they represent opportunities for us either because we have lost some market share or the operating environment is changing. For example, last year, in European rates and equity directives, we did lose some market share due to idiosyncratic reasons. But traditionally, these businesses have been very large for us because in rates, we have our Sterling franchise. We're also a primary dealer in 17 countries. And our corporate derivative franchise through banking brings us large structural advantages. Similarly, in equity derivatives, we are one of the largest issuers of structured nodes. So over the last 12 months, we are addressing our platform gaps, and we have already allocated them the capital they need to regain their lost market shares. Securitized products, is a different example. This is where the operating environment has changed. The life cycle here is you originate a pool of assets, you finance those assets and finally, you trade those securities. We have a top three origination franchise. We've built the top five financing franchise, but we did not trade these securities. So in 2021, when QT was starting, we realized there was an opportunity. So we invested in the product. And today, just as the operating environment is improving and our clients need us, our investment is starting to come alive. Now these three opportunities together represent an extra £500 million of revenues for us, and just a 1% market share here gives us an extra £200 million of revenues. So given our historic market shares and the fact that our client franchise has stayed strong within these businesses, it gives us confidence that our plans are measured and prudent. Now staying on the team of better, a common dependency across all of this is technology. Today, within our trading businesses, our clients increasingly experience us through our electronic offering and in our financing businesses through the stability and delivery of our platforms. Now this experience relies heavily on running a smooth life cycle of a transaction. And the life cycle of a transaction through pre-trade, pricing and post-trade has large dependencies on your technology infrastructure. So our journey here started by simplifying our infrastructure. We started getting rid of legacy applications, legacy point-to-point feed, and we have now decommissioned 84 applications since 2021. Once we simplified our infrastructure, we started modernizing it. We started putting new applications in the cloud. We started containerizing new applications, and we also started creating more reusable applications. So what happens once you have simplified and modernized your infrastructure, you start to become more stable and agile. And today, we run a much more reliable platform. Our outages are down by 78%, and that is something our clients care about deeply. At the same time, our breaks are down by 53%, and that is something our regulators care about deeply. And finally, now we are more agile. We are releasing more algorithms. We're deploying product features quicker within our platforms. So, why does all of this matter? Because eventually, we want better electronic platforms, because we want these businesses to play a bigger role in our revenues as their capital-light businesses. And you can see that our efforts are paying off. Today, we are ranked number one on London Stock Exchange, and we have grown our low-touch equity and FX revenues by 87% since 2019. So finally, moving to the team of more balanced. We want to be more predictable and stable. So we did that by growing financing. Since 2019, through a very deliberate strategy, we have grown our financing revenues at a 13% CAGR for -- from £1.8 billion to £2.9 billion in 2023. Today, they represent 36% of our markets revenues, a very stable 36%. Now, why did we want to grow these revenues? Firstly, they represent stable and predictable income for us. Secondly, if you look at all the consolidation, AUM consolidation going on among clients, their financing needs are going up. This gives us an opportunity and enables us to be a much deeper partner with our largest accounts. Thirdly, these are RWA efficient businesses that are secured lending businesses. So, we like the risk profile -- the risk-weighted profile of these businesses. And lastly, there are huge barriers to entry here. So, to operate at scale, you require a huge amount of investment. Now, our platform has been tested over the last few years here. Between 2019 and 2023, there were some very large moves in asset prices. And these moves happen in a very, very short period of time. That is the worst kind of operating environment you can have for this business. Despite all of that, we managed our credit and operational risks very well through this period. Now, I want to share two more facts with you before I leave this slide that gives us confidence in our financing platform today. Today, we have a financing relationship with 96 of our top 100 markets clients. Secondly, over the last -- or since 2021, over 50% -- more than 50% of £1 billion-plus hedge fund launches. These are large, very experienced hedge fund managers. They chose Barclays to be their prime broker at the beginning of their journey. That gives us a lot of confidence in our platform, but it also tells you that clients are trusting us at the beginning of their journey. Now, to wrap-up, we will stay focused on clients. We want to further deepen our relationships by achieving a top 5 rank with 70 of our top 100 clients. We're going to remain prudent around risk and capital management. We're going to deliver an extra £500 million through a three select intermediation businesses, while maintaining momentum in our top five franchises. We will complete and monetize our technology transformation, so capital-light businesses can play a bigger role. And finally, we're going to bring more balance to our financing revenues by growing them by an extra £600 million. Now, I'd like to finish by saying we have been executing a strategy that is working since 2019. We have been consistent to our clients. We have been a reliable partner to our clients. At the same time, we have the ability to produce double-digit returns regardless of the operating environment. So, the next few years are about executing the same strategy with the same precision and discipline that we have applied over the last few years. Thank you. And now I'll pass it back to Venkat.",

    "text": "Thank you, Adeel. So, I'll wrap up on the Investment Bank. So, what you've heard from Adeel in the market side, and what you heard from me is that overall, we intend to improve the investment banks RoTE to be in line with the group target of about 12% -- above 12% by 2026. We recognize that this is a significant increase on the 7% last year. And I believe from what I've told you though, that and what you've heard from a deal, that this is a credible and achievable ambition built from the foundations we've developed. Our income growth target in this is a high single-digit CAGR, and it's firmly predicated on initiatives which are within our control. And it monetizes investments which we have made in cost and capital, driving strong operating jaws and resulting in a cost-to-income ratio in the high 50s. You have heard that we are limiting the proportion of the Investment Bank RWAs to the rest of the group at around 50% by 2026, as we allocate more capital elsewhere to higher return in consumer and corporate businesses. We can achieve this, while absorbing regulatory inflation within the investment bank, due to the capital discipline, which already exists in our markets business and a pathway to improving return on RWA in the Investment Bank. And as I said at the start of this, we are looking for the Investment Bank overall to do more with less, keeping the cloud clients at the heart of what we do and indeed deepening those relationships with clients. We expect this plan to generate stable and attractive returns on a consistent basis, supporting our group targets and delivering value to our shareholders. So I will now hand over to Denny Nealon to take you through the US Consumer Bank Presentation.",

    "text": "Okay. So, good morning, everybody. I'm Denny Nealon, CEO of the US Consumer Bank, a role I've held for the last four years. I've been in the financial services industry more than 25 years, having previously worked at JPMorgan Chase and Bank One and have been with Barclays since 2004. I'm excited to be here today and talk with you about the US Consumer Bank, a business that was previously reported within the consumer, cards and payments division. I'll focus my comments on three areas. First, I'll provide an overview of the business, as well as some key US market characteristics. Then I'll review our financial performance and key performance drivers. And finally, I'll walk through our plan to achieve mid-teens road on a sustainable basis post migration to IRB capital rules. Now, let me tell you more about the business. So the US Consumer Bank has been part of Barclays for 20 years, and we're principally focused on providing credit cards to US consumers. We operate in what we call partnership cards, which is essentially a business-to-business to consumer model, where we partner with global corporations. Partners choose us to help them drive increased sales and customer loyalty through the co-brand or reward cards that we provide. Focusing on partnership cards is a conscious choice that we made, which plays to our strengths in a market where we would otherwise have to invest significantly to build brand awareness. The strategy has worked well for us. We've grown significantly and are now the ninth largest issuer in the US and a leading partnership issuer. We have approximately 20 million customers across 20 partnerships and [Technical Difficulty] Yes, thank you. Okay, so starting back with Slide 92. As you can see on this slide, we partner with 20 leading U.S. brands across multiple industries. And I already mentioned a few of them by name. A key point here, very strong relationships, many of whom have been with us for more than a decade and our historical renewal rate is about 90%. And importantly, this portfolio is very balanced by size without undue concentration risk. That said, the current portfolio mix is heavily weighted to airlines. So we are diversifying our sector exposure. The addition of GAAP in a partner in 2022 was a noteworthy first step, which I'll talk more about later. So Slide 93 and now turning to financial performance from 2021 to 2023. First point, first I'll point out that the 4% road he delivered in 2023 is clearly below our target level. I will explain the drivers of this performance shortly. But it's important to state that this level of return is not representative of the strong underlying performance of the business. We've grown net receivables by $10 billion, or 45% over the last two years to $32 billion. We've achieved that through a balanced mix of strong organic growth post-COVID and strong inorganic growth from the acquisition of the AARP and GAAP portfolios, with combined balances of close to $4 billion at acquisition. Alongside balanced growth, we have also seen significant growth in income and an improvement in NIM to 10.9%, driven by the benefits of a higher interest rate environment, the addition of the GAAP portfolio, and normalizing revolve rates from COVID lows, and a steadily improving cost-to-income ratio, in part reflecting benefits of beginning to scale the business. But offsetting these, the loan loss rate increased to 500 basis points as we built reserves for the expected rise in write-offs, which were coming off of historic lows consistent with those seen across the industry. In addition, new accounts were down significantly due to less travel during COVID, which otherwise would have matured and added to profitability in 2023. This, along with a large allowance build, resulted in a lower-than-normal RoTE of 4%. Now, switching to the next slide, Slide 94, I'd like to use the remainder of this presentation to articulate why we are confident that we can deliver returns in line with the group target by 2026, even in the face of regulatory headwinds in the form of IRB and late fee legislation, and also give some color on the impairment outlook and why we think it will revert towards our historic long-term average in the future. Now moving to Slide 95. We have a very clear path to deliver RoTE in line with the group target by 2026, which incorporates three elements. The first is the stabilization of consumer credit performance. Second, the specific actions we're taking, which will improve performance by scaling the business, driving improved operational efficiency, and expanding margins, each of which I'll talk about in more detail shortly. And third, it considers regulatory headwinds that we are actively working to mitigate. But first, it's important to understand USCB's track record, which gives us confidence that we can deliver on this plan. If you move to Slide 96, please. As you can see from this slide, the business has a long track record of growth, returns, and prudent risk management. In the nine years before COVID, the business delivered an average RoTE of 16%, helping the group achieve its return targets over that time. The RoTE performance since 2020 has been uneven, reflecting impacts from COVID, but given the recent balance recovery and normalization of customer behavior, we expect future performance to return to the more consistent pattern delivered between 2011 and 2019. It's also worth noting that we are making very deliberate investments to scale of business. New account originations incurred J-curve effect, principally driven by upfront marketing and day one impairment build, which dampens in year RoTE. That said, these annual new account vintages mature to RoTEs of greater than 20% over time. This is one of the key reasons why scaling the business is so important. This J-curve effect will decrease significantly at greater scale with a mature higher returning back book becomes a larger percentage of the total portfolio. Additionally, greater scale has the added benefit of reducing volatility when we add new partners in the future. Now moving to slide 97. We're back up. Okay. Now building on the theme of USCB's strong track record. What we wanted to highlight on this next page is how the business compared to other top 10 US issuers over the last 10 years, using delinquency rates as a proxy for credit quality. And as you can see from the chart, we have consistently maintained our position within the peer group during the period. Even in the early and mid-2010s, when our average FICO score was a bit lower than it is today. And being positioned in the middle of the peer group is consistent with our partnership-focused model, where we balance the need to deliver resilient risk-adjusted margins for shareholders with trying to say, yes, to as many of our partners' customers as we can. While we've seen a recent uptick in 30-day delinquencies, this is expected as we are coming off historic lows during COVID, and as you can see, very much in line with industry trends. We believe this 10-year period demonstrates two things: first, that we have demonstrated strong credit discipline over time; and second, that we have not taken on outsized risk to grow the portfolio at the rate we have. Now let's take a closer look at the drivers of impairment over the last few years. As previously mentioned, the recent normalization of delinquencies was expected and is largely a reflection of customer activity catching up from COVID lows. While write-offs have been broadly stable, you can see that we've rebuilt loan loss reserves to cover the write-offs we expect in the future following the normalization of delinquency rates. While this positions us well for the future, the in-year impact in 2023 was significant. Now looking ahead, we expect delinquencies to continue to tick up in the first half of 2024 and then to stabilize. The result is that we expect the 24 and 25 impairment charges to be below 23 levels and for our loan loss rates during those periods to be closer to our long-term average rate of around 400 basis points. Importantly, we remain well-provisioned as evidenced by a strong total coverage ratio of 10.2%. As you can see, we've also provided our US legal entity CECL coverage rate of 8.2%, which is in line with US peers. Finally, it's important to note that we continue to feel encouraged by the health of the US consumer. Unemployment levels remain near historic lows, moderation in inflation is contributing to real wage growth. There are still healthy levels of excess savings and strong spend and repayment levels persist. Now in line with the group, our plan to improve returns can be viewed through the lens of simpler, better and more balanced. And I'll speak to these individually in a moment. But to summarize, we are looking to improve operating efficiency, scale and diversify the business, improve margins and optimize the use of our balance sheet. Now, starting with simpler. As you can see from the charts, recent investment in the business has improved operational efficiency, but we recognize there's more to do. We've invested to digitize the business and built the retail platform as part of the Gap acquisition, which will enable us to add new partners more efficiently in the future. This increased investment onboard Gap, combined with lower card balances and subdued income post-COVID, drove our cost-to-income ratio in 2021 to 60%, significantly higher than our long-term average. Since then, though, these investments have helped reduce the cost per average active account by 15% and contributed to a reduction in cost income ratio to 51% in 2023. Now looking forward, as we continue digitizing, automating and scanning the business, we expect a further reduction in cost per average active account, contributing alongside margin improvements to a cost-to-income ratio in the mid-40s by 2026, broadly in line with our historic average. On the left-hand side of the slide, we provide a few examples of what we mean when we say we can become more efficient and improve customer experience by digitizing and automating key customer journeys. Transaction dispute or rewards are two great examples of common points of customer friction, which today too often result in customers reaching out to our call centers. We can simplify processes like these that customers can self-serve through the device of their choice without ever picking up the phone. That's simpler for our customers and more efficient for us. And we have similar opportunities on the colleague front and so are investing significantly to upgrade colleague tools and are leveraging automation to eliminate manual time-consuming activities. Now, moving to better and more balance. We will also look to scale and diversify our business, targeting $40 billion in net receivables by 2026. That strong track record of growth since 2011, where we've grown receivables at an 8.5% CAGR versus a 5% industry average, gives us confidence that we can achieve this through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. We see a large opportunity to grow in the retail vertical, and we expect the retail portion of the portfolio to increase from around 15% today to around 20% by 2026. And this will also help us rebalance our FICO mix to improve risk-adjusted returns. We also plan to recalibrate our risk-based pricing in response to industry-wide lead fee reductions. We expect that over time, this and other actions will fully offset any headwinds from these changes. Now on the liability side, today, we're about 60% funded by core deposits, which is a great low-cost way of funding our card assets. We are investing in new capabilities for our deposit platform, including targeted marketing to our partners and a tier-based pricing strategy, which should result in around 75% of funding coming from core deposits by 2026. Overall, we expect these actions to drive more than 100 basis points of NIM expansion by 2026. Now turning to the shift to IRB capital requirements, which you heard Anna speak about earlier. The first point, I'd like to make is to reiterate that this is a PRA driven adjustment that is industry-wide and not US CV specific. There is no underlying credit problem that is driving this increase in RWAs. We expect US card issuers to also see an increase in 2025 under proposed Basel rules. But as you can see, the capital treatment for us under IRB is significantly more conservative than the current standardized model. This will impact us in the second half of this year with an expected RWA increase of around £16 billion or our risk weighted density equivalent increase of around 60%. While this will have an adverse impact on returns, we've been focused on a series of actions that will reduce the impact and help deliver returns in line with the group target by 2026 and mid-teens returns over the long run. These actions include: re-optimizing credit line strategies and leveraging strategic risk transfer agreements to reduce capital requirements, enabling USA need to continue to grow but at a less capital-intensive rate. So, to summarize, the US partnership market is very attractive with solid economics, ample room for growth, and require specialized capabilities and expertise that we have developed over the last 20 years. We have a proven track record of winning and growing partnerships, producing strong outcomes for our partners and customers and delivering strong value return for shareholders. Although there remains some uncertainty with regard to the macroeconomic environment, we are well positioned. We have extensive experience managing credit through multiple cycles and are also well equipped to manage regulatory change. As you can see, we are outlining key targets for the business that underpin our commitment to deliver returns in line with the group target by 2026. First, we will continue to scale the business and grow receivables to £40 billion. We will deliver a net interest margin of more than 12%, which represents more than 100 basis points of growth. We will drive cost-to-income ratio down to the 51% we saw in 2023 to the mid-40s, reflecting our long-term average. We will continue to manage credit risk prudently, and we will manage loan loss rate to around 400 basis points, also consistent with our long-term average. On RWAs, we are taking action and expect 2026 RWAs to be around £45 billion, which represents an RWA density of around 145%. As we deliver upon these targets, we will be building momentum in the business that not only will deliver returns in line with the group target in 2026, but will generate increased confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term goal to deliver mid-teen roadies on a sustainable basis. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to future opportunities to discuss the business deal. I will now hand over to Vim Maru, CEO of Barclays UK.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone. I'm Vim Maru, the new CEO of Barclays UK. I know many of you here today through my 20 years in financial services, and I look forward to getting to know you again in my new capacity. So let me take you through how Barclays UK or BUK, as we call it, is going to support the ambitions and targets that Venkat and Anna just set out. As you know, BUK is our ring-fenced bank. It serves retail customers and small business clients across the UK. Barclays 330-year heritage helps to build deep customer trust and a strong brand position. Whilst our history gives us those foundations, our focus is on positioning the business for the future as a growing high-returning business, which delivers good customer outcomes. That's about making BUK more efficient, investing in our client and customer relationships and growing through more tailored products. Before I come to each of those, let me briefly remind you exactly what BUK is. BUK operates at scale in an attractive and sophisticated market. We have 20 million active customers. The depth and breadth of those relationships provide a robust and strong deposit base. That is the foundation of our lending businesses where we are a leading player in the mortgage, credit card and loan markets for individuals and small businesses. Over 80% of our income is generated by net interest income, and we are committed to growing this through a combination of lending growth, asset margin enhancement and the structural hedge program that Anna mentioned earlier. That structural hedge program is a fundamentally important part of how we manage the business through an interest rate cycle. The strength of our deposit franchise is the result of significant investment in focus over many years, irrespective of the rate cycle. That hedge helps ensure we can maintain investment in our customers, efficiency and asset growth. All of that underpins our plans to maintain a high RoTE performance. RoTE for the past three years has been around 18% or higher. We have been disciplined in the way we have delivered these returns with positive jaws in our cost-to-income ratio, low impairments through tight credit controls during the pandemic and a conservative funding profile with low loan-to-deposit ratio. We know we have more work to do to drive more efficiencies and lower our cost to income ratio, which we aim to reduce to around 50% by 2026. Our prudent risk and funding profile means we have the capacity to grow lending whilst maintaining our discipline, thus enhancing our profitability. So how do we intend to do that? Consistent with the group's strategy, we are focused on making BUK simpler, better and more balanced. We will be simpler by investing in digitization, automation and technology, delivering material efficiencies. We will be better by investing in customer experience and our product offering, supporting the relationships that underpin our deposit franchise and creating opportunities to broaden these relationships. We will be more balanced. We have positioned the business conservatively over the past few years. Now is the time to grow by winning back market share on the asset side of the business, particularly in unsecured lending and business banking. I'm going to spend a little time on each of those to bring them to life and how we intend to deliver. On delivering a simpler BUK, we have invested significantly in transforming the business in the past three years. That combined with economic headwinds over the pandemic led to a cost-to-income ratio of 68% in 2021. Our investments and changes in the environment have brought that to 58% today. But we must go further. Our aim is to get that to about 50% by 2026. In the chart on the left, we have segmented our cost base into four parts to show how we think about our costs. We are focused on driving efficiencies across all four, but I have singled out the top two, because this is where we believe we lag peers. On distribution, this covers the cost of servicing our customers day-to-day. We have historically operated with a higher number of branches, creating higher associated real estate and people costs. We have acted by reducing our branch presence as customer behavior has shifted. Our focus will now shift on optimizing the way we engage with our customers and communities. We will do that through a far more efficient and flexible footprint. By the end of this year, we will have over 900 touch points available across the country, including branches, flexible community sites and shared banking hubs. Of course, the primary basis of customer interaction today is through our digital channels. In fact, 98% of customer interactions are now digital. Our touch point optimization will strengthen that further completing our digitization work and leveraging our physical footprint as a value-added complement to it. In Operations and Technology, we are in the process of automating the parts of our operation, which are not yet processed straight through and simplifying and upgrading our technology capabilities. The historic complexity and fragmentation of our technology means that the transition cost has increased this proportion of our costs. However, this is an investment in our future capabilities and further efficiencies that we must make. The evolution of our cost base over the last three years has been shaped by these investments. The left side of this slide outlines the impact of our cost actions to date. We have streamlined BUK through actions such as rationalizing our product portfolio, reducing our branch numbers and headcount and simplifying our technology estate, all of which I mentioned on the prior slide. That has brought base costs down by 7% and contributed to our cost-to-income ratio declining from 68% to 58%, notwithstanding the impact of inflation on our underlying costs. That gives us confidence in our ability to drive our cost-to-income ratio to about 50% in 2026 as our investment in efficiency will continue to offset any lingering inflation. This cost discipline not only delivers efficiency today, but it also creates capacity to invest in both future cost efficiency and future revenue. On the right-hand side of this slide, you see that our plans reflect an 80% increase in transformation investment spend over the next three years to £1.2 billion from £700 million in the prior three year period. Our investment in driving cost efficiencies will continue through customer journey, automation, optimization and simplification. The mix of investment will evolve with continued focus on revenue growth as we align our products with customer needs better and capture the opportunities of the partnerships that you saw on a prior slide. Combined with the benefits of our investments to date, we expect the income benefit from investment to increase by about £600 million in 2026 from £100 million in the prior period. Combined with the expected efficiency savings, that makes our aim to deliver a cost-to-income ratio of 50%, both achievable and credible. Let's shift to how we make the UK better. That requires increased focus on an investment in improving our relationship with our customers and clients. As I mentioned at the beginning, our starting point is strong, evidenced by a deep deposit franchise rooted in trust earned across multiple generations. We know that our focus on transformation over the past years has disrupted those relationships. You see that in the dip in our overall Net Promoter Score in the chart on the top left here. For example, the scale and pace of our branch closures as well as the product and service simplification that we've undertaken has disrupted how we interact with and support customers. Meanwhile, work required to update the information that we hold on business clients has created understandable frustration on their part. We are committed to enhancing that position from here on. I showed you earlier that we've rationalized our product offering by 32% and made our range simpler. We did that in part for efficiency, but also so that we could invest in tailoring our offering to better align the service that we provide with the needs and expectations of our different customers. We have much more to do to get that alignment as precise as it needs to be. Getting that alignment right creates the opportunities for us to enhance our relationships with our customers and as we do so, we would expect to see average balances grow and an increase in the number of needs that we solve for each customer. By being better, we improve customer satisfaction, we support our deposit franchise, and we maintain the foundation of a resilient funding profile that enables us to grow the asset side of the business. And that brings me to the third priority, how we intend to make BUK more balanced. As I mentioned at the beginning, we are a scale player across our balance sheet. The last three to four years has benefited scale players on the liability side of the business as consumers and businesses retained high cash balances across the pandemic, coupled with economic uncertainty, the severely limited their appetite or need for borrowing. We believe we are at the beginning of more stability in the UK with the inflation outlook having moderated and the consequent rate stability, giving more confidence to borrowers, both individuals and businesses. We are also confident that our investments to date have placed us in a good position so that we can capture the opportunity that recovery will present. A quick reminder of where we have come from. We made deliberate choices to navigate the longstanding economic uncertainties in the UK with a low-risk profile. That was prudent, but it led to market share declines, particularly in unsecured lending and a lower margin profile in mortgages and a persistence of a low loan-to-deposit ratio in business banking. In short, we didn't take the opportunity to reallocate or recycle underutilized risk appetite from one area of BUK to another. That opportunity is now in front of us. I'd like to bring each of those to life a little more now. In unsecured lending, our plan is to grow market share. We have simplified our customer journeys and revamped our credit and affordability models to enable this. In consumer loans, we have historically focused on relationship lending, but we will shortly begin to open up our lending to all qualifying customers, whether they bank with us or not. I will shortly come back to a dedicated slide on the recently announced Tesco deal. In mortgages, our aim is to improve application margins through a number of initiatives. First, by improving our broker support, including by simplifying how we support brokers and improving the platform through which they provide us with their applications. Secondly, we will do more high loan-to-value lending as a proportion of our total book. Our current position versus peers is conservative at 6%. We have capacity to grow that proportion without materially shifting our risk position. We also have the capability to offer specialized solutions through our Kensington acquisition from last year, where the margin opportunity is typically significantly higher than that of our existing Barclays product range. And finally, we intend to increase our focus on the mortgage needs of our Premier and Blue customers who are far more likely to come to us directly. In Business Banking, we will grow our lending market share by leveraging our existing relationships on the liability side, both in terms of access to customers and our ability to automate credit decisioning given the visibility we already have on their financial positions. We will also continue to broaden our lending proposition, including in the asset finance space and accelerate digitization of client journeys to make it easier for them to access what we offer. Whilst lending is at the heart of our growth opportunity, we will conduct this in a controlled way that maintains our disciplined risk profile. I'd like to bring that to life explicitly. As I noted earlier, we made deliberate choices to derisk during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty in the UK. While that impacted market share negatively, it also led to historically low loan loss rates. You see that clearly on the left side of this slide. Today, that rate stands at 14 basis points versus 36 basis points in 2019. It's worth noting that even that 2019 level was lower than years before that. We have capacity to grow within the parameters of our historic loan loss experience and our 2026 plan delivers a risk profile that is consistent with that 2019 level. The right side of this slide shows you that same information in a graphical format for BUK at the top and then cards and loans below that. You can see the larger Blue Eagle representing 2026, lies in between the 2019 position to its right and the 2023 position to its left for the business overall. My point simply that we have room to grow as we pivot the UK to take advantage of opportunities to increase market share and margins and deliver a more balanced asset profile within BUK and ultimately, for the group. Given the recent announcement of our intention to acquire the retail banking business of Tesco and enter into a long-term exclusive partnership, you will naturally wonder how that fits within the ambitions that I've just shared. This slide outlines what that banking business is. £8 billion of high-quality unsecured loans split evenly between credit cards and personal loans, funded by £7 billion of non-transactional deposits that fit neatly into what I outlined earlier about being better. We are naturally excited by this opportunity. It takes us a long way towards the unsecured lending growth ambitions that I just shared. In particular, this provides the opportunity to grow both the lending and deposit products through the Barclays and Tesco brands, which we believe appeal to different segments of the market. The long-term exclusive partnership with Tesco also provides an unparalleled platform to work with the UK's leading loyalty program as well as the opportunity to market through Tesco channels and the open market. This builds on our existing UK partnerships with other leading retail, consumer electronics, and loyalty program brands. Importantly, the customer base is similar to ours, leading to broadly aligned risk profiles. So, this fits squarely within the risk appetite framework that I outlined earlier. By delivering on our plan, we position BUK for the future and deliver an attractive and sustainable RoTE profile that is high teens in 2026 on a larger balance sheet. Underpinning that is continued growth in income, where we expect a compound annual growth rate of mid-single-digits CAGR over the next three years, concentrated in net interest income. Our continued focus on efficiency will lead our cost-to-income ratio to around 50% by 2026. We expect the better utilization of risk appetite to normalize our loan loss rate towards the 2019 level in a controlled and disciplined progression. And as we grow our asset position, our RWAs will necessarily grow as a result and BUK's contribution to the Group's RWA profile is expected to grow. Given our focus on unsecured lending, you should expect the impairment build in RWA growth to be slightly more weighted towards the first year than the associated revenue build. That will cause RoTE to moderate in 2024, then recover to our target. Our ability to invest in that future revenue growth, as I said at the very beginning, is protected by the structural hedge, reflected in the 2024 net interest income guidance of £6.1 billion that Anna referenced earlier, although that excludes any contribution from the Tesco portfolios when that transfers to the UK expected in the second half of this year. So, our focus on efficiencies will make us simpler, our focus on our customers and clients will make us better, and our plans for growth will make us more balanced. We have invested significantly in recent years to prepare the business to growth. We are now ready to seize the opportunity before us. Thank you for your time, and I will hand back to Venkat.",

    "text": "Thank you. So, we will now spend a little time on the Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth, which are two new reporting units. I mentioned that we will also come back later in the year with a presentation on each of these by Matt and Sasha, respectively, in addition to a deepdive on the Investment Bank. So, you will have the opportunity later to hear from them. The UK Corporate Bank is the beating heart of Barclays' 330-year history. We have relationships with about 25% of the UK market. These relationships average 18 years in length and they are covered with a network of locally-based teams around the country. Under the resegmentation, the UK Corporate Bank includes a large part of the operations, which we previously reported in the corporate lending and transaction banking lines. It also includes corporate card issuing previously included in consumer cards and payments. So what this does is that it brings together our trade and working capital solutions into one business. The integrated business has reported strong returns and last year generated about £1.8 billion in income. The income streams are diversified, and the key priority for us is to grow the fee income alongside capital-efficient growth in lending. So what is it that we do here? On this slide, I'll summarize the breadth of our offering to corporates. We support clients with their short and long-term financing needs, including extending finance to support the transition to net zero. We provide working capital solutions through card issuance, overdrafts, invoice discounting and traditional revolving facilities. We help clients to move their money, to pay suppliers and employees, to collect money from their customers and reconcile their transactions. We also help clients to invest liquidity through a range of solutions. We support clients in managing risk as they grow their international exposure through our award-winning trade finance and FX propositions. And what this range does is it positions us well to grow over the next few years, while giving clients access to expertise in other parts of the group. Our clients' needs are evolving quickly, and we are focused, therefore, on delivering operational needs simply and seamlessly. And to meet these, we have priority areas, which are well defined, starting with the importance of our leading payments ecosystem. And digital delivery is important because it frees up time for our clients and also makes our bankers more efficient, allowing them to spend their efforts sharing data-driven strategic insights. And this client interaction will enable us to deepen and to broaden our client relationships. And as growth opportunities emerge, clients want us to make it easier for them to access the right financing structures in quick and simple ways. I said I will talk about payments. We spoke earlier about looking for a partnership in our merchant acquiring business. So I want to say a little bit about the payment ecosystem, which is about making and receiving payments. This is an essential part of the functions we provide our corporate clients. We are one of the largest sterling clearers in the UK. We are a leading corporate card issuer with more than £12 billion of payments per annum and the third largest merchant acquirer across Europe. That's the far right. We process over 300 billion payments a year a pound in payments a year, which we estimate represents one in every three card payments in the UK system. Our objective always is to bring the best capabilities and the most efficient services to our clients, and we pursue the models which deliver these outcomes. Our traditional bank payment systems have largely been built in-house over many years and are very resilient. What we are doing now is focusing on developing further digital solutions. And the landscape across card issuing in the middle and merchant acquiring on the right has been fast moving with much innovation. We've had years of experience combining strong in-house capabilities with those provided by some of the partners listed here in order to benefit from greater scale in technology and operations. In merchant acquiring now, which is on the far right, we are exploring how best via partnerships to provide further benefits of scale, global scale and new technologies and innovation to our clients. That is what that strategic exploration is about. As with the rest of the bank that you've heard, we talk about simpler, better and more balanced. We are focused on making this business simpler by enabling clients to access the solutions and services more easily. Our main digital channel, something we call iPortal already gives clients access to a wide variety of services through a single entry point, and they can self-serve about 30% of their needs, and the adoption for these solutions is around 90%. We plan now to build on this, expanding our self-service capabilities through both online and mobile access and increasing the efficiency, speed and frankly, better controls. And what this will allow us to do is to decommission legacy systems. And what we've been doing is also investing in stable and automated back-office platforms and the tools our relationship teams use, making their client interactions, as I said, more productive. All of this, we expect will improve the client experience while using efficiencies to fund investment and it allows us to retain our low cost income ratio. We aim to be better by deepening the relationships, which we have. We were the first bank to introduce industry specialist teams more than 20 years ago, and we continue to lead and to innovate. Our network of business development directors has resulted in more than 550 client wins in 2023 and a growing market share. And we are hiring additional coverage bankers in areas where we see growth opportunities and continuing to develop our propositions. Recently, we migrated our trade finance business from legacy technology to cloud-based systems. 40% of our clients use five or more products, which is up three percentage points over the last two years, and this demonstrates our ability to increase that penetration. And as we deepen our relationships and improve our offering, we think we can do more with 28% of our clients using two products or fewer today, the potential for revenue growth here is significant. And we are confident that we can increase our share of wallet from existing clients and grow through new client acquisitions. So next, I want to focus on lending, which makes us more balanced. We have a loan-to-deposit ratio here in the UK Corporate Bank in the low 30s, and we are well-placed to grow, providing a better balance for the business as we grow more fee income. And we will deploy more RWAs to support this effort, which in turn can lead to deeper and wider client relationships. Our existing book is well-diversified across sectors, and we have a track record of low impairment. And so we'll continue, of course, to use the group's significant risk transfer program, providing first loss protection and reducing both impairment risk and capital requirements. Within our credit risk appetite, there are areas where we can be more competitive on price and take larger credit positions with stronger clients. And we are confident in that way of growing lending at attractive risk-adjusted returns as we develop our digital delivery and product offering. And we also expect to generate business for other parts of the bank, leveraging our track record in the debt capital markets. So finally, on the corporate bank, I just want to highlight some key financials and summarize our ambitions. As I said, a key priority is to grow fee income alongside a capital-efficient growth in lending, our recent performance positions as well to achieve this. Over the last two years, we've grown at a 15% CAGR. This reflects, of course, the benefit of -- to NII from rising rates, but also double-digit growth in fee income and net client growth. And while loan and deposit volumes have been stable, our propositions and client relationships have enabled a 10% growth in clients in the last two years. The income growth has actually helped us with resulted in a healthy cost/income ratio and contributed to returns increasing from 14% to 20%. We have the opportunity now to grow income further while we increased our investment in simplification and automation. So we still aim to deliver a cost income ratio in the high 40s. And post COVID, we have benefited from a gradual release of modeled impairment, and we expect a more normalized impairment profile going forward. Overall, we expect returns to moderate from the 20% we reported last year, but we still target high-teens over the coming years. So to summarize, the UK Corporate Bank is already delivering strong returns. We are confident we can continue to grow at these attractive returns despite the normalization of rates and impairment Lastly, Private Banks and Wealth Management. On top of my mind, day I became CEO, who was an ambition to realize the great opportunity that the Private Bank and Wealth Management business provides for Barclays. We had a strong private bank, have a strong private bank, both in the UK and in select international markets. But the wealth management business in the U.K. and our digital investing business, what we call smart investor was unprofitable and subscale. Moreover, these two businesses sat in separate parts of the bank on either side of the ring plans. Over the last 12 months, we have put them together again with the regulatory commission. And what this does is it provides us with a very significant opportunity to serve the financial needs of UK customers in our retail business, together with serving our high and ultra-high net worth clients. In addition, it enables us to have a single investment function and shared platforms. We aim to provide advice to our customers and clients at each stage of their financial -- personal financial journeys. And we will do so with robust financial management tools, which are fairly priced, managed transparently, constructive simply and delivered efficiently. So this is the Private Bank and Wealth Management business today. As you can see on the left-hand side, the business has been structured into four distinct segments. Firstly, self-directed digital investing for those who are starting out or want to invest anything from £1 upwards, a UK wealth management proposition for those that are more advanced stage in their financial journeys. And of course, a service for high and ultra-high net worth clients domestically and internationally, who have a full access to a full suite of private banking products. What you see on the right is that the business has grown its assets and liabilities on the average of 10% a year over the last five years, and it's reasonably well diversified both geographically and in terms of products. The combined business today is already producing high returns, 31% in 2023 compared to 14% RoTE in 2021. A good part of that growth has come from deposits, given the impact of higher rates, but we've also been growing our investing and lending offerings. The income has grown from £1 billion to £1.3 billion, and our cost-income ratio has shrunk from 86% to 69%. This is a very good and profitable business, but what it needs to do is to scale, particularly in the digital investing and the U.K. Wealth Management segments. Again, given its high contribution to the group, this is an area of investment. So again, we're going to do this by being simpler, better, and more balanced. Part of what I, being simpler, as I said, was to combine the businesses. We now have one management team, a single investment function, shared platforms, and simpler segmented customer propositions. And there are significant efficiencies from doing this. Part of being better is for us to fully leverage the synergies across the bank. And we are developing a more effective two-way referral flow for clients with other business units within the group. Barclays U.K. provides us with a significant source of new client referrals into digital investing and wealth management. And having a closer collaboration with the investment bank enhances our distinctive point of differentiation by giving private banking clients access to a wider range of investment solutions. Being more balanced is in part by growing our digital investing and U.K. wealth management offering to the scale that is aligned to the size and scale of our U.K. retail bank. This proposition has very high operating leverage and we are focused now on making specific enhancements to provide better service to our customers. Very recently we launched a new pricing structure and we will now focus on the content and digital capabilities we need to enhance the customer service and journey. In the U.K. wealth management space, we will lower the entry point to £250,000, and again focus on providing easily accessible advice, digitally enabled as much as possible, and a simplified transparent investment proposition. Both of these will be better integrated within our banking app and our website. Moving to the private bank. Across the U.K. and our international business, we have over £160 billion of client assets and liabilities. And we provide a high-touch personalized client service. Our priorities are actually fairly similar for both segments. We need to build out our teams, including our U.K. regional footprint, as well as our teams in the international markets where we already have an investment banking presence. Also we need to invest in systems and processes to enhance the client experience. In addition, we will invest in our client solutions, including alternatives and lending capabilities. Altogether, these priorities are going to require an investment into our private bank, which will lead to our RoTE being greater than 25% by 2026, which is slightly lower than last year's numbers. We aim to deliver high-quality, double-digit asset and liability growth across segments and maintain a cost-income ratio in the high 60s. To conclude, we have a great opportunity in this business, and it's one that I'm really excited about. We need to be simpler in terms of our business and the propositions, which we provide our customers and clients. We need to be better in terms of our service and technology capabilities and more balanced by scaling our UK wealth offering. Now, almost every bank talks about doing better in private banking and wealth. And so you might well ask, what makes Barclays succeed. I think there are three things. One is the scale and depth of our franchise in the UK and how few of our customers use our investment services today. There are 3 million customers in Barclays UK with investable assets who we benefit from our digital investing or our UK wealth offering. The second in my opinion is that the UK market could be better served, particularly for those customers in the intermediate stages of their financial journey. I think there's a real role for us to provide a service which is transparent, which is competitive, which is digitally available, but with access to human advice. And finally, we have proven we can grow this business. Over the last few years, five years, we've grown client assets and liabilities by 10% per annum. We have won awards internationally, the best foreign private bank in Switzerland, the number one private bank in Monaco, the number one international private bank in India. And we are confident we can achieve an RoTE of greater than 25% by 2026. And to me, private banking and wealth represents a very attractive opportunity for the bank. It's a capital-light fee income-based business and high returning. So with that, what we will do is I'll invite my colleagues to come up, and we will move to the final part of Q&A or for today's investor update with Q&A on the business presentation, which you've heard. As previously, please limit yourself to two questions and introduce yourself. And I am the MC [ph]. All right. Who would like to go first? Yeah, Alvaro.",

    "text": "Happy to go first, again. To first again Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Just a couple of questions. One is on the efficiency gains in the investment bank. I don't know if you can make it a bit more tangible for us, given any examples of where you see capital efficiencies in particular. Obviously, there's been discussion in the past about leverage finance deals that are still on the balance sheet. Is that a source of capital efficiency? And if so, maybe help us quantify it or give us a bit more sort of flavor on how easy those efficiencies are to deliver? And second, on US Cards, the 12% NIM. You've listed sort of quite a few things that drive the NIM improvement and rates wasn't one of them. And I realize this business, it is lower rates is good for it. So maybe, I've seen your rate assumption at the back, but can you quantify maybe how much rate plays into that NIM expansion in the US Cards business? Thank you.",

    "text": "So, why don't I take the first one? I'll pass it to Anna to start on the second one, maybe, Denny, you can chime in afterwards. So, at a macro level within the investment bank, efficiency, capital efficiency, which is what I think you're talking about, RWA per unit income is going to come in a few ways. Within markets, as we've said, we've always -- we've maintained a high level. And I think recycling capital and focusing on liquidity and sort of revolving as a deals at 20% a quarter of what you put out and increasing that is going to be one source. In investment banking, it's coming in a couple of ways. Number one, it is from the move from DCM, which is capital heavy into ECM and M&A. The second is recycling capital as it gets released into -- into international corporate banking and the transactional services, which are going to be closely managed by the Investment Bank of managed within the Investment Bank and which represents higher recurring revenue and an allocation of RWAs into the financing side of markets. So at a macro level, that's how it happens. Obviously, with individual clients, over time, we will assess whether we are getting the right mix of business for the capital which we lay out. And -- but that's part of exactly that reallocation. Anna, then do you want to start on them?",

Actually, our NIM expectations are much more about what we expect to happen to pricing to mix.

But I highlighted three things that are going to help us drive NIM expansion. One is we have -- we are going to be going more in the retail sector. We expect that to help us rebalance our FICO mix they'll help deliver higher margins. Second, alongside the late-fee legislation, we'll be re-pricing some of our existing accounts. And then we have a really strong award-winning deposit platform, and we're investing in that. And so we expect to get more value from that going forward.

    "text": "Yeah. So let me start with Capital One discover, then I will just give a broad answer to the first part of your question and let a Adeel and Denny talk about that. Unless, Anna, you want to add something, too? So on Capital One Discover, look, we've got to see the details on it. Clearly, it is a transaction that is based on a cards portfolio as well as payment rails and payment capabilities. And it shows, if anything, that these things are valued in the banking system today. As I hope you've seen in the last few hours, both cards and payments are critical parts of the Barclays proposition as well, and something which we think we're good at and trying to do better. So that's my sort of first takeaway from it. And we'll, of course, have to see the details. And I will say that there is a regulatory angle of it, which, you know, my colleague Jason Goldberg, I have to plug Barclays Research, wrote overnight with Terry Ma. And we have to understand that better as well. Okay. So then coming back to the competitive landscape in the U.S. So at one very high level, capital rules generally increase over time and banks adjust to them, The big banks adjust, right? And I imagine that's what ultimately will happen. And what I do hope is whatever settles down in the U.K. -- in the U.S. capital landscape is relatively mirrored in the U.K., whereas you know the regulators also have a competitiveness mandate in addition to financial safety. So we'll have to see where it goes. And what we hope is that it's sort of fair across both sides of the pond. What you have seen us do is move to internalize what that will be, both at the overall Basel level, as Anna said, to the lower end of 5% to 10%, which includes what we said for IRB in the U.S. cards business, already included in U.K. cards, and then we've got a bit of corporates to go. So I think it will all finalize over the next two years. Hopefully, it will be relatively even but we will adjust competitively as we have done in the past. Adeel?",

So what the teams are doing is they're firmly focused on what we can control, both in Denny's world and in Adeel's world. We would expect to see some increase in capital in the U.S. from our U.S. peers. The exact level of that, we'll see. I think what's really important for us to just remember though is that less than 10% of our Greek capital is in the IHC.

Is there anywhere else within particularly, I guess, the markets business, where outside of optimization you might be taking some capital away from businesses in order to fund the capital-light growth that you're talking about in some of the focus areas for markets? That would be the first one. And then again, on -- the second one is just on -- again, on US cards. I guess what you've shown is you have some inefficiencies relative to your local peers from a capital density perspective, which you expect to offset through mitigation, but that usually comes at some cost. And Venkat, you talked earlier about the benefits of being a diversified business, but when you've got a standalone cards business without a broader US retail offering, there are some, I guess, some headwinds from an efficiency perspective relative to peers.

So we really think about our business through the lens of two components. We have a bunch of top five revenue rent franchises where we are maintaining a pretty high income to RWA ratio. And then you have the non-top five franchises, which we showed you. If you look at the non-top five franchises, there are two types of businesses there. One, which we need to maintain to be stable to our clients. Within those, we have a pretty, pretty low capital footprint. And then you have the rest of our franchise, which we think we have room to improve because we've either lost market share or the operating environment is changing. If you look at that component of our franchise today, we have 38% of our RWAs allocated versus them driving 28% of our income. So it also tells you that those three focus businesses which we've talked to you about, we've already allocated the capital they need and the technology resources they need so we can drive that income over the next -- over the coming years.",

This is a specialized partnership card business. We are not looking to compare this to a broad-based US bank's cards business, which includes its own branded cards. We are not in branded cards. In fact, the important thing, whether you talk about this or whether you can talk about our markets business or investment bank, is that we focus on the things which we try -- which we think we do very well and which are attractive to our clients. This specialized cards business has a few attractive features to it. Number one is we have 20 corporate clients, B2B, B2C, 20 million customers. We are not competing with the end customer -- for the end customer with a corporate client. We are not trying to sell them a mortgage. We're not trying to do other things with them, which many other banks might. And what it does is allow us to focus on increasing the engagement with the corporate -- which the corporate customer has with the underlying client. And that is the thing that leads to the revenue uplift for the corporate client, and that's what Denny had on one of his pages, 6x, 7x. So we don't compete. Second is we are good at what we do. And that's an indication of both the blue-chip quality of our clients and the 90% renewal rate that he spoke about. So it's an apples-to-apples comparison would not have us talk against the broader US banking market. Of course, there are things we need to do better. We need to adjust for the capital rules, we need to improve and increase our sort of own funding of this and manage our costs better. And as we get scale, improve the RoTE. So we have a lot to do to improve it. But the apples-to-apples comparison is not versus a general US bank. Anything to add?",

And the other thing I've pointed out earlier is the size and scale of the partnership market is very significant. So there's a big game to play for, and we believe that we have built a sustainable competitive advantage and the capabilities we bring to the table.

So -- in terms of consumer duty. So there's a broad agenda that is leading to various implications for financial services players. Obviously, apart from motor finance, you're present in most products in the UK, but one of the features of the UK market is very limited cross-selling. So I guess the question for you and for Vim is where do you think are the risks for you in your current business model as configured, especially as we go into the new rules, July this year on the back book? And then secondly, where might be the opportunities for you as other players have to reconfigure their own pricing.

So I think consumer duty, which is a very beneficial way to look at actually what products people provide to customers and managing mis-selling risk across an appropriateness risk across the consumer product landscape is a good thing for the customer. As in all forms of regulation, it actually ends up benefiting the larger players because what we were able to do is understand it, manage it, absorb the fixed costs, and operate. Frankly, over the long-term service as a barrier to entry. I think, therefore, when I spoke earlier about Wealth and I said fairly priced, transparently constructed, efficiently delivered, it's easier for us to do these things than for smaller companies because we can, -- A, we know how to do it because we do it in other parts of our business; and B, we can sort of structure it and absorb the cost better.

    "text": "So, I think a couple of things to add. And I think that point about our scale and what we've done in the past is quite important because I think one of the things that struck me about Barclays and you'll see it in other banks too, I guess, is just the culture from a customer focus perspective is really strong. And treating customers fairly has been around for a while and the nature and behavior that we have here has been strong, too. Of course, Consumer Duty made us think through every line of our business and consider very carefully with the tweaks that we should make, but it's not been as heavier lift because of the culture that's already innate in our business. And so I think that's been a huge help in where we were and the steps that we have to take. And actually, I think we've made lots of great progress. I think the important thing here is a level playing field. Actually, there are some things that sit outside of the fence in terms of regulation and then making sure that the regulators then apply all of that in a similar and coherent way right across the market. I think that's the important thing to call out. And then you touched a little bit about sort of limited cross-selling. To some extent, when you look at our balance sheet, and I talked about it, conscious steps that we've taken have led to that. And actually, one of the things that we're trying to do as we lean into the changing shape of our balance sheet as we move forward is actually protecting our franchise and increasing that cross-selling capability. So, at the moment, some of our customers are going somewhere else for a credit card because of what we've chosen to do in the past. That's a real opportunity for us to really deepen the franchise and increase the number of products and services that we offer to our customers.",

We've got multiple levers to allocate capital in a discipline where we're looking to drive growth within the higher returning divisions of the bank and greater RWA productivity within the investment bank. We are resetting our level on RoTE to 12%, higher than 12% in 2026 and capital return of at least £10 billion in the next three years, 2024 to 2026. Those are summary statistics. There's a lot more. We are available over lunch to chat with you as well. So thank you for coming, and thanks for spending the time with us. We really appreciate it.",

    "text": "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just had a question on the -- a couple of questions on the U.K. business, and then the U.S. business. Just in terms of the U.K. balance sheet versus the NII performance, and I note that the NIM, which I'm glad we're not talking about as much anymore, was up 2 bps. And it looks like separately, the current account mix shift is starting to settle now with £59 billion of current account balances versus £60 billion last quarter. So do you think that we have kind of arrested the mix away from current accounts? I mean, clearly, the Bank of England data shows some flow into noninterest-bearing accounts, at least for the first two months of the year. So just wondering what the outlook there is because it seems like that you can easily deliver on your target for this year on the NII guide there. So any comment around those moving parts would be helpful. And then in the U.S., I guess how do we get the trajectory on the credit loss number? I mean, how should we think about that from the 610 basis points in Q1 to 400 basis points by 2026, given that, I suppose, unemployment could deteriorate in the U.S. or what have you. But clearly, part of the mix is also going to be coming from the GAAP portfolio. So I'm just wondering what's the confidence in the moving parts to go from 610 to around to circa 400 basis points. And on the U.S., could you also just confirm that the fee -- late fee matter is embedded already reflected within the guidance that you've given for that unit at the update in February? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thanks for the questions. I think just on the U.K. question, I think it's worth just reflecting on Slide 16, where we've shown you the balance sheet progression as a deposit matter. And I think you're right, we are seeing some stabilization in underlying deposits. And the way I read that is partly through the current account movement, but it's also -- whilst you continue to see some movement towards time deposits, that rate of change is definitely sold down. And what we see in Q1 is a mixture of those deposit trends continuing, but at a slower pace and what I would describe as normal seasonality. So in Q1, people pay the tax bills they also sort of pay off credit card bills, et cetera. And you also see that a little bit in business banking. So I think it's as we expected to see. From here on in, I think now in Q2 and beyond, you get almost beyond the [indiscernible], which can cause a bit of noise in the U.K. I think we'd expect those deposit trends to continue. So that's how I'd characterize those changes in the U.K. As far as the U.S. is concerned, I think worth looking at Page 13, which is a replication of the slide that we gave you at the year-end. And what that shows is we expected write-off to increase in the U.S. because delinquencies had been rising through last year, in line with the industry, and as the standard required us to re-reserve in advance. So what you see in Q1 is really a switch around in the balance between reserving actual write-offs, so write-offs have gone up, and reserving is now starting to settle back down. So for 2024 we expect higher impairment charges in the first half, lower in the second half and for the year as a whole to be lower than 2023. And in terms of the longer term trends in this business, I mean you're right in terms of one of our objectives is to have a higher proportion of retail. But actually, our GAAP portfolio is very high quality. And the FICO balance that we've got in the book now is no different to what it was pre-GAAP. And as we grow that retail proportion in time, what we also see is a roll-off of the legacy slightly lower FICO portfolio such that the mix remains broadly similar to what it is today. So that's why we're guiding to this longer-term position of 400, and that's what gives us confidence. And just to confirm on your final piece, yes, we did include late fees. The late fee matter in our RoTE projections. We'd expect those to come in -- I mean, obviously, planning for May. They may be slightly later than that. We have offsets to come in the plan, but they slightly lag the imposition of the legislation. So you'll see a bit of a gap there, but that's what we expected.",

    "text": "Thanks, Ben. On your second question, I think it's worth looking at the new disclosure that we've given you around the NII movement in the U.K., which is on the bottom right of Page 15. And what we're seeing here in the quarter is more stability in margin than we saw throughout 2023. And you can see there that there's still some product margin dilution, which is coming from mortgages and it's also coming from those deposit changes, but largely offset by that continued strength in the structural hedge. And what's really going on here is balance sheet movement. So the reduction in deposits that I talked about before, also just more of a broader market-wide movement in terms of reduction in mortgage balances, so we continue to guide to 6.1 -- or circa £6.1 billion for the full-year. Still confident in that guidance. And I'd just reflect perhaps on the NII across the group more broadly, which was stable year-on-year. And we do think, not taking into account -- not just the U.K., but the corporate bank, Private Banking and Wealth as well and indeed, our U.S. Cards business. So we're pleased with that, as a result. And that's a good position from which we can grow. The only other thing I would call out is, of course, that circa £6.1 billion is ex-Tesco, and we now expect Tesco to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. Okay, thank you, Ben.

But I also note your U.S. competitors, they've been -- there's been a bit of a mix sort of messages on the pipeline. So I just wanted to pick your thoughts on the seasonality you see during this year considering the one-offs we've seen in the quarter, what seasonality could we expect in markets? And also in DCM, maybe the number is obviously up, but according to Dealogic and other NPAs, it could have been up more. Or do -- how do you see the pipeline there? Because, as I said, some of your peers were a bit more cautious. And on the U.S. cards, noted your comments, Anna, around the reserve build. But in your modeling, you obviously -- the 400 basis points -- to trend towards 400 basis points. Based on that, when would you expect the delinquencies to peak? Because conscious that typically, the seasonality provisions is the provisions tend to be higher in the second half. So just looking for data points that we could look out for to confirm that 400 basis points in particular, the peak and delinquencies? Thank you.",

So on seasonality, I think in markets with one provider, which I'll say in a second, you should expect the normal seasonality that you see, which is a little quieter in the summer and then picking up in the fourth quarter. And so far, the second quarter is behaving like second quarters, generally do in seasonality sensors. The thought on DCM and the proviso I will make on overall fixed income markets is there is an assumption there about when volatility comes. And obviously, that's very, very hard to predict. We've seen, since the 1st of November, a round trip of about 90 basis points in 10-year gilts and approximately the same, slightly less than 10-year treasury. And so the question really is based on rate expectations, do they stabilize at this level or there's further opportunity, I don't know the answer. And -- but in part, that answer affects the next question, which is on DCM. And I think there are two parts to this. One is, obviously, rates are much higher than people might have thought six months ago. But at the same time, or at the same -- three months ago. At the same time, spreads are much tighter. And so I think the tightness of spreads is going to be one important factor in the thinking of issuers on actually what they bring out to the market. So I'm expecting that you will continue to see people tempted by the lower spreads.",

And you can see that in our IFRS 9 assumptions. What that would tell us is that we should continue to see some increase in delinquency. That said, a couple of things, our expectations of that peak of unemployment have actually come down quarter-on-quarter. So we've seen an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, we believe for the U.S. And actually, that economy remains robust. So whilst we expect to see a continuation of delinquency, we are content that we have very robust coverage. You'll see that our coverage is now over 11% on an IFRS 9 basis. It's 8.5% on a CECL basis, so we're well covered. Where we had concerns, probably, at the lower end of the FICO scores, we've taken action on credit lines. So we feel like we're preparing well both in terms of provisioning and indeed, our credit actions, if you like. But it is progressing as we expected to and given the IFRS 9 forecast we have for unemployment. Thanks for the question. Next question, please.",

The first one's just coming to the Investment Bank, where revenue performance is well below peers even after adjusting for the one-offs that you flagged, and that's particularly the case for FICC and fees and even equities is off quite a low Q1 2023 base. So thanks very much for the color that you've given us in terms of kind of the product narrative. I was just wondering, because you target a lot of market share gain and quite a lot of improvement in return on risk-weighted assets, I'm just wondering when we should think about that from a timing perspective? Is that a similar sort of time frame to what Venkat was talking about in terms of the euro rate benefits coming through. So thinking about seeing those market share and RWA benefits over the coming quarters, is that realistic for the IB as a whole? And then the second one is just back on Barclays U.K. actually. Anna talked about mortgage flows being in line with 2022. I just wanted to clarify what you were talk about there. Is that sort of gross lending? Or is it approval because I think approvals particularly are up year-on-year significantly. Thank you.",

    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Rohith. I'll take both of those questions, and I'll start the first, Venkat might wish to add. So you're right. There are two particular quirks, if you like, in both equities and our FICC numbers. In equities, there's a one-off in the current quarter, which we've called out, actually, excluding that, but business is up 11% in dollar terms, which we actually believe compares very favorably to our U.S. peers and demonstrates that we're making progress, and we called our cash, and we all called out prime, and we called equity derivatives, which of course, is one of our vacant areas. FICC, on the other hand, you might recall this time last year, we were talking about some inflation-specific income in there, that does color the comparisons a little bit. But even after we split that out, it's down 14% in dollar terms, which we don't believe lines up too favorably against our U.S. peers. There's a few things going on in there. We are pleased with the progress in securitized products. And in previous quarters, we would have said we're small in that business, we still are. But we've been able to monetize it much more effectively because of the investments that we've put in. And then across banking, I mean Venkat's covered that, but it feels like quarter-on-quarter progress. When we stand back from it all, this is one quarter in a 12-quarter plan. And we do believe that we have the right plans to grow this business, but we're not going to see the results after one quarter. So I won't give you a time frame, but hopefully, we'll be able to show you regularly how we are making progress. That's one of the reasons why we set up the reporting that we have so that we're not seeing a huge change in that revenue over RWA number yet, but it's important to us, and therefore, we're just showing you that. And on BUK, you're right to call me out on this. So let me be very specific. I was talking about gross flows. Apps are up 22% for the market in the first quarter. And interestingly, what we're seeing is the purchase market coming back in the U.K., which is really good after '23 being very much remortgage dominated. So that's really good. We think that helps for us, although it will take time for that to flow into the balance sheet. One thing I would call out is we feel like we've taken share in higher loan-to-value mortgages, which again, was one of the areas we were seeking to do. But just to be really clear, this is going to take time to flow into the balance sheet. But thank you for the question. Can we have the next question, please?",

I think it's Q3. I think we had £16 billion. I'm not sure if that was my number or your number, but additional risk-weighted assets which I guess if you put on a pro forma now, that takes you really down to £13 billion or a little bit below. So I guess the first question is, is that still the right sort of number? And then the second question is, I sort of thought that the German consumer disposal would sort of pay for some of that, if that makes sense. And therefore, you still have plenty of capital in the second half. But it sounds like that's not going to be so likely now. So am I right about that? Should we really be thinking that Q3 is going to be sort of low point for capital really? And how should we think about that in terms of capital in the second half? Thanks very much.",

Still expecting that in the third quarter. So in terms of the numbers that you read out, I understand -- so I understand the math behind it and the pro forma. The thing I would say is there are obviously a lot of moving parts here. There's the organic generation of capital, which you can see in the first quarter has been strong. There's some seasonality in RWAs, which will obviously move as the year goes on. And typically, we would expect Q1 to be in the middle of the range, or maybe even slightly below the middle of our range because of that. You've then got inorganic actions. And I'm not going to comment on the specific timing of the German card disposal, but I would say it continues to progress. And then you've got business mitigants. So I'd call out the Blackstone transaction, and you can imagine that we continue to work hard on RWA efficiency across the group more broadly. So in terms of sort of capital generation and distribution, our plans remain as they were on the 20th of February in terms of both the priority, clarity, first, reg; second shareholder distribution; third investment in the business, and we are still planning to distribute greater than £10 billion across '24 to '26, and we're still expecting to deliver broadly what we did last year, so around £3 billion in the current year.

Just looking forward, some of dynamics look quite encouraging, but still the guidance implies a slight headwind versus the Q1 run rate on NII. So I guess I would have thought the hedge and the product margin dynamics are pretty neutral from sort of Q2, perhaps even slight benefit beyond that as we think about the hedge benefit and support from higher LTV lending perhaps outweighing some of the headwinds. So I'm just trying to understand what is the headwind from it? Is the deposit volume component still being a drag even post the season effects that you called out in Q1? And then on U.S. Cards, you highlighted the increase in core deposits percentage balance. I just wondered how much of that is a sort of dollar increase or how much has that been impacted by the fall in lending balances and perhaps a reduction in other funding? And sort of how are you going to grow the growth -- drive that growth in core deposits as we look forward? Is it really about the changes in providing deposit proposition the same at or some of the lending? Or is it pricing? If I can just squeeze in a follow-up on U.S. cards. You talked about mitigating the late payment fees. I just wondered how much of what's embedded in the plan is sort of the market reacting to that versus what's more in your control? Thank you.",

I mean I'd just reiterate what I said before, that really '24, we see about a bit more stabilization in the margin because of the factors you call out and the strength of that hedge. And then also, you've got continued deposit migration. So even though it's slowing down, we still expect it to be there. And in terms of the mortgage market, while we're seeing encouraging signs in terms of the market, it is going to take a while for that to start flowing into the balance sheet. So you see a balance sheet that contracts before it starts to expand, and that's really what underpins our circa £6.1 billion. So it's playing out in the first quarter sort of as we expected it might. In terms of your question 2a on dollar deposits, it is exactly what you say. So we're expecting really, this is a product led and actually, the way we go to market with those dollar deposits reaching more directly to consumers. And again, this is the first quarter in a 12-quarter plan. It's going to move around a little bit. And actually, I've been looking for longer-term trends there really, but it's product propositionally driven. And then finally, just in terms of the market on late fees, I think we do see some price changes coming through, which is sort of what we anticipated and we would expect to participate in that which is why I said late fee legislation happens first, the pricing changes will drift through over time. The only other thing I would say is, of course, given the nature of our business, we are able to share the impact of those late fees with some of our partners. So you might expect the impact for us to be slightly less than it would be more market-wide. But overall, we considered all of that and included it in the RoTE sort of pathways and guidance that we gave you on the 20th of February. So no change.",

Could you just give us some quantification of the expected annualized impact around the late fee changes for your U.S. consumer business? I think it would be helpful to understand what the sort of initial impact you're expecting there is even if you expect some industry-wide and idiosyncratic mitigations over time. That would be the first question, please. Secondly, on NII, just conscious that you do have this £120 million Bank of England levy. You're indicating that there's a £70 million offsetting revenues this year, I think, you said £50 million net impact year 1. And I understand that's going to go through the NII line. And when I think about what swap markets have done since your guidance would have been struck at the full-year, I guess it's a bit more supportive, slightly higher average base rate for this year, slightly higher average swap rates than have £70-or-so millions of benefit to come through relative to plan from this Bank of England funding adjustment. Why hasn't the NII guidance being nudged higher? Is that just prudence? Or is there something else going on in there, which is maybe a little bit worse than expected? And I guess related to that, what is your guidance around NII sensitivity to base rate at this point, please? You haven't given us anything in the slides quite some time. And given the relative size of your hedge versus peers and some of the commentary you gave at 2Q results last year, I do wonder actually whether in the very short term base rate not coming down as much as negative or very near-term NII trends?

You can see that it's actually a net negative over the period. So you can see it being a drag on the RoTE, but it is part of that. But I'd just reiterate, I would expect it to be slightly less than other market participants some are calling out just because of the impact from the partners. So in terms of NII more generally, we continue to guide to circa £10.7 billion for the full business excluding the IB and head office and to circa £6.1 billion for BUK.

And what we did on the 20th of February was try and underpin our targets with prudent macroeconomic assumptions. Of course, we monitor those very regularly. We consider the impacts on the business, but we're not going to mark-to-market those targets on a quarterly basis. Just mathematically, you're right, we would expect some offsetting income from that Bank of England levy. I think we've called that out, around £75 million. But one quarter end, we're not going to adjust the targets that we've given you. In terms of your specifics around the sensitivity, I would say, given the scale of our hedge, we are and always have been less sensitive to immediate changes in base rates. That remains true. The -- any sort of near-term change in rates is less important to us than just a mechanistic rolling of that hedged quarter in, quarter out. And there's nothing that I would call out as a negative in terms of rates being higher for longer. Of course, you might expect some benefit in liabilities, but there might be some offsetting matters in terms of asset formation, for example. So that's why at this stage, we're really happy with the £6.1 billion and the £10.7 billion. Okay, thank you, Chris. Perhaps, we can go to the next question, please.",

    "text": "Good morning. Just two. Just to quickly follow-up on Chris. So just to confirm, the £300 million reduction in NII within BUK, that was set before the BOE levy kind of changes? I guess you are going to get probably about a £50 million NII benefit within BUK. Just could clear that up. Second question, a much broader question. Obviously, you've got an RoTE target for this year of greater than 10%. I think consensus is currently around 8.8%. And when I look at the numbers, it looks like you need about £1 billion revenue growth based on your 2024 RoTE bridge. And that's just not something at consensus or my own forecast currently have factored in. I think consensus has about £250 million of income growth. I guess a great disparity there must particularly be in the IB given you've given us fairly precise guidance on things like NII elsewhere. I'm just wondering if there's any kind of anything hardened -- you kind of point to and say, look, I think consensus is just wrong on this number when you look at our models? Any color there, that would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Robin. So on the first one, our circa £6.1 billion for BUK was struck for the 20th of February, which was before these BOE changes. They just mathematically, that is true. But we are in the first quarter, which is why I'd reiterate, we're happy with our progress thus far. In terms of your RoTE of greater than 10%, the 12.3% that we've delivered in the first quarter is exactly where we thought we would be. So -- and within that, the constituent parts are what I was looking for. So number one, real stability and income, particularly in NII and particularly in our financing businesses. They provide real balance to our income overall, the 63% of income in the quarter, and that's what we're focused on growing because it's a really good base for us to deploy the RWAs into the U.K. and to focus on those areas within the IB. The second thing I was looking for was delivery of cost and efficiency. We said £1 billion for the full-year. We've delivered £200 million of that in the first quarter. So we're on track there. Third thing was continued good credit conditions. And again, we've seen that. So good credit performance at 51 basis points, really at the bottom end of our sort of through-the-cycle range, which again gives us a good base to grow from. And then finally, the capital position. So there's nothing different in our performance versus we expected when we spoke to you on the 12th -- on the 20th of February. However, there probably are some changes in shape relative to last year. So last year, we had an income -- sorry, we had an impairment profile that was very back-end loaded. This year, it's pulled forward, driven very much by the U.S. positioning. The second thing is we did see quite a sharp change in NII -- sorry, in NIM last year, driven by the deposit mechanics that really started to kick in, in the second and the third quarter. The third thing is we did see a drop-off last year driven by the cash flow hedge reserve and the way that was impacting the tangible equity of the group. And then finally, I'd also call out, in the current quarter, that Bank of England levy has a 70 basis points impact. Now we expect that to be not quite neutral, but nearly neutral over the year as a whole. So that is depressing the first quarter RoTE. Now of course, last year also, after a strong first quarter, we saw a dramatic force in IBCs in particular, to a decade low year for the whole market. And we're seeing more positive signs this year. So I think it's quite a nuanced question. But overall, we still believe that we can hit greater than 10% for the year, and we're exactly where we thought we'd be at this point.",

    "text": "Good morning guys. A couple of questions. Back on the hedge and then a broader question [indiscernible]. On the hedge, I think you probably pushed on about a quarter of this hedge now since medium-term rates moved above 3%, yet the yield on it is still only 1.8%. And it sort of implies that the rest of the hedge, despite all the hedges earning closer to 1%. So I'm just trying to square that with a 1.5% maturity guidance -- yield guidance that you've given over the next few years. Is that just a prudent number you've thrown out there and actually the maturity yield on the hedges over the next few years is closer to 1% rather than 1.5%? Or is there actually a very decent tailwind expected into 2027 and '28 as well? The second question is not entirely unconnected. When I look at 2026 consensus RoTE, NII rebase for £30 billion revenue number rather than where consensus is in the mid-28s you're getting to your target. So I assume on that basis, you recognize the consensus TNAV numbers out end of '25 and into 2026. And then there's a -- sorry, final question on this, maybe to the Venkat. The LTIP targets, incredibly commendable, but you don't get paid out in full unless you hit the 14% RoTE in 2026. But I'm just wondering what's your thinking there? It looks extremely aggressive, given consensus doesn't even believe you'll make the 12%. So why did you put a 14% RoTE target into that latest delta? Thank you so much.",

    "text": "Okay. Jonathan, thanks for the question. I think there are three. So let me deal with the first two, and then I'll pass the third one to Venkat. So on the hedge, no, it wasn't prudent. It's the actual number. So we do expect the average maturing yield to be 1.5%. We do expect £170 billion to roll '24 to '26, inclusive. We haven't talked about the tailwinds, '27 and '28. We talked about the tailwind for '26 which we said, given the assumption that we gave you or the indicative number rather that we gave you of 3.5% swap rate, that would add £2 billion or around £2 billion of income by 2026 relative to '23. And you can see the progress that we've made in the quarter. So for 2024 alone, when we were at the year-end, we locked in £3.8 billion. Now we've locked in £4 billion. And that compares to a total gross hedge income of £3.6 billion last year. So there is a very powerful tailwind that comes from this hedge. To your second question, we do -- I won't specifically comment on the consensus numbers that far out, but we do expect an increase in the tailwind -- sorry, an increase in TNAV. We're seeing it grow as we expected, both because of the mechanics of the cash flow hedge reserve. And you might recall, we called that out specifically on the 20th of February. It was one of the moving parts as a headwind to RoTE, both in 2024 and beyond into 2026. So it's being driven by just the mechanics of the cash flow hedge reserve. It's being driven by AP accretion. And of course, it's being driven by the reduced share count over time. And that's really why we're seeing it move forward. And clearly, as a management team, we're most focused on the loss of those two, just noting that the cash flow hedge reserve can move around quite a bit. So it's AP accretion and really that buyback value creation that we're focused on. And Venkat?",

Well, first of all, it should be clear, the LTIP targets and the composition and levels of compensation for both Anna and me are set by the Board.

    "text": "Okay. Thank you Alvaro. Good morning. Okay, first question. Just starting with one off cost. We did have a few structural cost actions within the IB. not really that significant. And certainly, over the full year, we don't expect to spend more on SBAs as than we have done historically, which we said was a GBP200 million to GBP300 million run rate. So for the full year, the thing that's really important here is the delivery of our growth efficiency savings. We've done another 0.2 in the quarter so it’s 0.4 in the half year. We got really good line of sight to that GBP1 billion. So that’s really what’s underpinning the cost results that you're seeing. And I just to reiterate, our cost guidance for the year is circa 63%. The consensus of total cost is there or thereabouts. So that's how I'd guide you there. In terms of the U.S. Consumer Bank, you're right, NII has fallen off a little bit in the quarter. There's a few things going on in there. Firstly, remember we did the Blackstone deal in the first quarter. So you're going to see some switching out of and into non-NII. Secondly, I would say seasonally sometimes a little bit lower in the second quarter than the first, just because of the amount of customer repayment that we have. And thirdly, within that, there is a little bit of lumpiness in terms of customer reward monetization, that ultimately is a really good sign because it means we're growing the book, but the way it can sort of chunk itself to counter our revenues it can be bit lumpy. So that’s all that's happening. So we haven’t changed our charge rate to a 12% NIM. That’s really around pricing optimization. It's around increasing our proportion of retail within the book and also really focus on our funding costs, and you'll note that our retail deposits are now 67%. We're really pushing that towards greater than 75% to deliver that 12% NIM. But thank you for the question.",

As you mentioned there's an implied GBP2 billion of structural hedge income growth, assuming that you reinvest 75% of the maturities, but it seems like your NII upgrade today is based in part on more stable deposits. So would it be unreasonable to assume there's some upside to that GBP2 billion based on greater than 75% of the maturities being reinvested? That's number one. And then number two, one of the issues that investors have with your 2026 targets is that the high single-digit revenue growth in the CIB is on the flat risk-weighted asset base. And it looks like in the quarter, you needed GBP3 billion of incremental risk-weighted assets to grow revenue. So I guess, how do we square the circle in terms of maintaining the RWA balances relatively flat on 2023. I mean, it was nice to see the revenue productivity picked up year-on-year, but still, we've had a few questions on that today. Thank you.",

And that really led us to upgrade our NII today for the UK and for the Group to circa GBP6.3 billion and to GBP11 billion. The way we think of that is really an underpin to what we are doing. This is a plan of many parts. We set out really detailed targets and plans in February of this year really to sort of guide you towards what was important to us and allow you to track our progress. So as we continue through the plan, we're pleased to see this progress. But as I said, a plan of many parts, and we have more things to deliver around our efficiencies and obviously around our capital allocation. So that's the reason really why we’re not upgrading 2026 at this point in time. Of course in isolation, the movement in rates, you would expect to have some impact on that GBP2 billion number. But we're not going to mark to market our 2026 targets on a quarterly basis because we're just very, very focused internally on disciplined execution against the targets that we've given already.",

We're pleased to see that go up year-on-year while also growing the other side of the balance sheet. So I would say largely temporary in nature and nothing really to call out specifically.

In terms of deposit trends, you're right, we've seen greater stability or that stability come a little faster than we expected. Perhaps that's how to think about it. And we do, however, expect the structural hedge notional to continue to fall broadly in line with broader deposit trends. Customers continue to seek yield even though they're doing so at a much sort of slower level of migration than before. But we reassessed that structural hedge very carefully with each passing month. We regard it as a key way in which we manage the interest rate risk in our income line. So we'll continue to monitor it and update as we go.

So presuming it's sort of an order make of 75% in 25% and 55% in '26, but any color there would be very helpful. And then in terms of the 1.5% maturing yield, which I think is consistent with prior disclosure, could you remind us sort of how that breaks down between each year? And just a sort of final one on this slide. Maybe I'm reading too much into dotted lines and sort of putting a rule context it, but it looks to me like it's near sort of 2.5% in 2026, the gross yield in that dark blue dotted line.

So the way I think about this is that coverage, the sort of tenor that we've got here is between 2.5% and 3%. But there's actually a range of maturities within there, and that really reflects. How we think about the composition of our deposit book and the varying behavioral sort of trends that we see within there. So we haven't guided or given you any clarity consistent about how that actually breaks down between those tenors. But just to say, over the next few years, we expect that will mature near within our 1.5% which is consistent over that period. And then on the final question, which was around the gross yield. Again, we don't guide to gross yield. We've given you some mass in February, which is really how we expect that structural hedge income over time. What I would just say is you can see that it continues to grind higher and I think this slide shows us that well. So at Q1, we were at GBP9.3 billion of locked-in income. Now we're at GBP11.7 billion of locked in income. And obviously, in the current year, that is 4.5 locked in already by the half year versus the total we have for last year of 3.6. So that's really how we focus on it, less about the overall yield and more about how much are we locking in base as a combination of the notion of but also obviously the yield and hedge it fast. So that’s how we think about that. We’ll come back with a bit more color.",

And I guess by extending the duration of the hedge, I suppose that the point a bit more sticky. You're talking about stabilization. So the '25 again reduction in hedge size, I'm not sure if that does seem a bit too conservative. And then the second question is again just on the capital allocation. So I appreciate you commented that some of the RWA increase in IB has been a bit temporary in the quarter, but that is where we've seen most of the increase year-to-date and quarter today.

    "text": "Okay, thanks Amit. In terms of the pathway on NII, not only for the UK Hey, but for the other parts of that core part of corporate banking, international corporate Banking and indeed, our private banking and wealth business. I mean, obviously, the trends that we're seeing around deposits and indeed rates are helpful, but we do see them as an underpin and hopefully an indication of our confidence in reaching those '26 numbers. And as it relates to the hedge as I said not on a mark-to-market hedge income on a quarterly basis. We gave you some moving parts and just to remind everybody, we've got 170 billion maturing over the three years. We've got a maturing yield of about 1.5%. We expect high to roll about 75% of that. And at the time of the investor update, when swap rates were around 3.5%, we though that would probably yield around GBP2 billion. Again, there are some movements in the yield curve that might in isolation, push that number up a bit. But this is a plan of many, many parts. So we're very focused on delivering the greater than greater than 12% RoTE in the round. On your second question around capital allocation, I want to reiterate, we think those are largely temporary and there's obviously also a natural seasonality to the RWA path within the IB. I think more fundamentally, though, what we're talking about here is the two-part strategy: firstly, holding that broadly flat. And secondly, growing elsewhere. So you're going to see this meaningfully change as a percentage really from the fourth quarter onwards. And that in the first part comes from the completion of Tesco, which we now expect to happen on the first of November. But also, but also really the organic progress that we're making in terms of the balance sheet. Now you can't see that yet coming through a strong balance sheet growth. That is what we expected. You might remember that in February, we said that we expected that the UK balance sheet would get smaller before it got bigger and that indeed is what's happening. But we're seeing good growth momentum. The mortgage market is up. We're taking a greater share of that. And we're also taking a good share of high loan-to-value mortgages. Our cards balances are up quarter-on-quarter and in corporate lending, whilst we haven't seen the balance sheet move yet, you can see the RWAs going up because we've extended balances to clients. So I think it's really sort of quarter four onwards that you're going to start to see this move meaningfully but just to reiterate on the RWAs and the IB our intention is still for this to be broadly flat and really for the work to be done elsewhere in moving that percentage But thank you for the question. Perhaps we could go to the next one, please.",

    "text": "Good morning, everybody. I had two questions, please. The first one was U.S. consumer cards, credit quality. I think you said to see the provision charge has turned. But if I look at your non-performing loans in the quarter, they were up, I think, 7% or 8%. So just trying to get a sense as to where we are in that price and how we should expect that to progress from here if that's okay. And that’s the first question. And then the second question I'm just trying to sort of square the BUK performance with some of your targets and with some of the revenue coming through from the hedge because you're making around a 20% return on equity in the first half and even if I normalize impairment but when you when you take your share of the hedge benefit it's going to go in there that's probably closer to 25 or even high 20s returns as of today. And yet in your target -- I think you said greater than 15% return on tangible by ‘26 and I know it's greater than 15% encompasses an awful lot but I guess mid to high 20s there's a long way ahead of that. So I'm just trying to think what should we be thinking about in terms of the difference between the greater than 15 and the mid to high 20s? And how do you think about a mid to high 20s return in a sort of we had to listen to the FTA talking about consumer duty yesterday. I mean should we be expecting some of this GBP2 billion hedge to actually go to depositors or are you we should be confident that we can hold the bulk of that thanks so much.",

    "text": "Thank you, Ed. I'll start on cards and Venkat might want to add something on USA quality also and then and then we'll go into the UK performance. Then really the U.S. CB and impediment pathways is panning out as we expected. The last year when we saw the macroeconomic variables particularly around unemployment start to increase what we expected was first delinquencies would increase, and secondly real if you like non-performance and write-offs would follow. And that's exactly what's happening here. And you can see it quite clearly in the charts which I think is on Slide 13. And so this time last year we got ahead of this in a couple of ways, the first was by building our reserve proactively. And so you can see that reserve build through the second half of last year and that was in anticipation of the write-offs and that movement of non-performing loans that you're now seeing. So from here what I expect is consistent with what we thought at the beginning of the year which is actually we'd expect impairments in the second half to be lower. Now the composition of that is going to still look a bit like what it does in Q2. You're going to have relatively high levels of write-offs and you can have lower levels of provisioning. And then overall for ’24 it's going to be lower than ‘23. But we did take actions last year in credit lines also in anticipation of this. And that certainly helped. And just to remind you, this is a high-quality book. Venkat, anything to add?",

The Fed's statement yesterday pointed, even though they didn't change rates, pointed to a balance in their concern shifting a little away from inflation into softness and employment. That is speaking to the thing that we put in and anticipated. And we've, as Anna said, tried to risk-manage the portfolio in advance of that. And so we hope we're prepared for what could be a softness. But the charges -- non-performing piece is exactly as Anna said. It's following upon a provision bill, which was earlier.",

But that balance sheet is going to change from here. We are anticipating asset growth. So obviously we expect NII to grow over time, but I'm also expecting that the RWAs here are going to grow over time. And clearly we haven't seen growth in assets in BUK for a couple of years now. So that will moderate it. And it's just a reflection of, really, if you like, the emphasis moving from profit being in liabilities to really trying to grow the asset books for when the curve turns. So that's really what we're thinking about here. Think of it as an increase in equity rather than a reduction in returns. And that's really what's led to our RoTE thought process.

And the UK, we'll see what the Bank of England does later today, but the UK employment picture has remained strong. There's really only one way this thing can go.

    "text": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have one on the UK and one on consumer, please, the U.S. consumer. So on the UK, in your remarks, you referenced the stabilization in deposit books coming off the back of pricing actions that you've taken earlier in the year. I mean, you don't give us much disclosure around your deposit costs. But if I look at the interest expense you're disclosing in the UK financials, I think that's down half on half, i.e. lower overall interest expenses in the first half versus the second half of last year. So I just wanted to understand a little bit more what pricing actions you've taken, and if there is any color you could give us around the level of your average deposit rates, which some of your domestic peers do provide, that would be very welcome. And on consumer, obviously, income down, you've spoken to that in terms of the amortization and various other things, bits of lumpiness, I guess. How should we think about the progression of income for that segment from here? Should we be expecting growth to be coming through in the second half, or is more of the progression you're expecting to that 12% NIM back-end loaded within the plan? Thank you.",

    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Chris. So we don't disclose our deposit costs. Obviously, within the interest costs and the P&L, there are more things going on than savings within there. However, what I would say is we've made good progress around not only our range of savings, it's much broader than it was, but you can also see, and I think it's probably on Slide 16, the continued progression that the customer had towards yield. So fixed-term deposits continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. We have a lower proportion of fixed-term deposits than the industry more broadly, which is what you would expect, but still a significant change there. And I would just say, really, it's about range. It's about pricing consistently. It feels like we've performed well in the first quarter, sorry -- first and second quarter. The savings market overall has grown. And we initially lost share last year, but I would say that's very much stabilized this year as we've seen those benefits come through. And current account share has actually been flat throughout. So it feels like we've managed that well. In terms of consumer in the U.S., there is a bit of seasonality to U.S. cards. Typically, you see slightly higher income and slightly higher impairment in the fourth quarter, so we'd expect those trends to be the same this year. It's a bit the converse of what you see in the current quarter. There's a seasonal down in Q2, and you tend to see that go up again for holiday spend in Q4. So that's the seasonal element of it. More broadly than that, obviously, we do expect to grow. Cards growth takes a while, so you're going to see this happen over time. There are also some headwinds to NIM, an income that we called out, so specifically around late fees, although that appears to be delayed at this point in time. We'd expect to take some actions in response to that in terms of our optimization. We're continuing to build our deposits in the U.S. So I'd expect these to manifest themselves gradually over time, the implementation of that. But you're going to see some lumpiness from, for example, the implementation of that late fees whenever it comes.",

I guess the reason for the question is, when I look at data we do get for 2023, which we can at least see on an annual basis, Barclays in the UK was paying meaningfully lower rates than large incumbent peer banks in the UK. I guess off the back of that we saw deposit volumes compress for Barclays to a far greater degree than for those peers, so customers moved elsewhere because you weren't keeping up, I guess, with even the large incumbent banks. We've seen that stabilize in the first half. Is it just that the customers who were going to move have now moved and actually you've retained a meaningful pricing differential to large peers, or do you feel like you've substantially caught up with large peers in terms of your rates?",

I see most of the impairments in the head office relate to the German consumer finance business, so is the gap there just kind of costs for around GBP30 million, GBP40 million a quarter?

But we're now in an environment whereby it looks like for the U.S. banks, the delay in Basel 3.1 could potentially be much longer. I know when you gave your investor today, you talked about the risk rate density go from 100 to 160, and then through mitigation back to 145. And you thought that would be comparable to the U.S. banks post Basel 3. But in an environment where Basel 3 doesn't get introduced in the U.S., or Basel 3.1 -- sorry, in the US, how do you feel about the competitive positioning of that business? If a co-brand deal comes up for renewal, do you think you can still price competitively versus the U.S. peers given a higher risk rate density? And then second question, similar theme, strategy, but investment bank given, I know you said the IB RWA increase is temporary this quarter. But if somebody comes to you and says, I'd like an extra GBP100 million of RWAs, I think I can generate more than 12% RoTE on that from your investment bank. You've always said your North Star is the RoTE. So do you say, yeah, fine, please go ahead? Or is it a case of reducing the RWAs from 63% down to 50% a Group in the investment bank by holding them stable as a more of a priority? Thank you.",

So we always expected there to be a gap. Obviously, we'll have to see what happens to the U.S. rules. And it's very, very difficult for us to comment on that until we see both that and indeed the final UK rules. In the meantime, we're focused on the things that we can control. So we're focused on the commercial actions that we said we would take, which are really around improving the capital efficiency of the business through doing trades like the one that we've already done with Blackstone. We continue to work on the NIM, as I alluded to before, through pricing, through deposits, et cetera. We've got a big program here of efficiency and digitization. All of those things will improve the returns of the business. So we're really sort of focusing on execution of the piece here that we can control and which we have line of sight to.",

That would be our wish. And then if I come to your point on the RWA and the increases, what I would say to you is the strategic ambition or goal of this bank is to keep IB RWAs roughly flat, absorbing some of the capital impacts we've spoken about, and then growing RWAs outside of the IB, and therefore shrinking the relative proportion of the IB. Now, if somebody comes with an interesting high RoTE trade, we would, of course, consider it. It would have to be shorter term, right? It's not something that can affect the broader strategy. So the broader strategy is that relative reduction. And if there are shorter term opportunities that we can take, of course, we would consider them, but at the secondary part of the broader strategy.

And so I just wonder how you think about the sort of quarter-to-quarter volatility around this component of NII trying to avoid a situation where we worry unduly about nearer-term dynamics from that? And then secondly, on the same chart, quite surprising to see the product margin as a net positive. Can I just confirm, please, that includes whatever the leads and lags on depository pricing there are? There's some feedback in the investment community that perhaps Barclays hasn't been able to cut deposit rates as others have done as rate cuts began.

    "text": "Thanks, Jason. Thanks for the questions. I’ll take back those. So just looking at Slide 16, I can see why you’re asking the question. The structural hedge impact is lower than the previous quarter. Last quarter, the product dynamic was negative, now it’s positive. So I’ll pick those up in turn. I mean last quarter, we did have a slightly higher swap rate, as you point out, but we also topped up the hedge a little bit, particularly around business banking. That’s now obviously in a run rate. So it’s no longer causing that sort of quarter-on-quarter impact. Sort of going forward from here, we’re going to continue to see momentum from the structural hedge. You can see that from the other disclosures that we’ve given you, for example, on Page 10. So I still expect it to be a net tailwind overall to this business and really supporting the NII growth that we’re seeing. So nothing more really than that. On the product margin, you’re right, that does include all product margins, so it’s including assets and liabilities. I think important to point out that some of the drags that we’ve seen historically are no longer there. So you’re no longer seeing that really significant deposit drag from migration coming through. Actually, our mortgage position is broadly neutral from a churn perspective now. So you’re no longer seeing that. What Iu are seeing Is some positive momentum from both mortgage and card margins, which is a little bit offset by deposit pricing, as you point out. But actually, I’d expect given the kind of regulatory lag that we have in deposit pricing for that to be more meaningful, that lag impact to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter. So a bit a lot of small numbers here because it is only a quarter-on-quarter movement, and it is only 6%, but that’s the things that I would call out. Okay.

    "text": "Okay. Thank you, I’ll take both of those. So yes, please put that disclosure in on Page 38, you haven’t seen it. I mean we often talk about the structural hedge and the support that it gives to the U.K. I guess, in absolute percentage terms, that’s where it is most meaningful, but it does provide support elsewhere in the group, particularly through the equity structural hedge. So you’ll see perhaps surprising to many that it’s providing some support into the IB and because we allocate that equity portion by RWAs. So hopefully, that’s helpful. But the structural hedge notional I’m not going to give you specific guidance spend, but what I would say is we’d expect it to sort of trend broadly in line with where the deposits are going. When we spoke in February, that was less guidance, more sort of a framework to help you model it as time goes on. So we talked about I 170 billion of maturing and rolling about ¾ of that. But that was designed really to give you the math that you could that you could then update rather than a forecast itself. So clearly, as we look at the moment, there are some positives in there, but we will continue to update you as we go through. But I wouldn’t call out anything more than we should expect it to move in line with deposits. On your second question, I’m not going to talk about NIM then is going to be quite – it’s going to move around quite a lot over the next few quarters. As you can imagine, we’re about to onboard I 8 billion worth of unsecured lending. That’s going to move the NIM materially. What I would really focus you on is actually the net interest income. So we’ve upgraded our net interest income for the group and for the U.K. in the curre’t year. So now we're expecting circa £6.5 billion for the U.K. And if I take you back to what we said in February, we said we expected mid-single-digit growth in NII in the U.K. We still expect that. And what’s driving that? Well, clearly, we’ve got asset growth coming through what was a drag coming from deposits. We now see a stabilization. And hopefully, as deposits start to grow across the market, we would see the same. And whilst we’ve got some uncertainty coming through from rate changes, I would offset that with the kind of momentum that we've got from the structural hedge. So we are expecting NII to be higher in '25 and in ‘26 than it has been in ‘24. And that’s, obviously, we would be putting Tesco on top of that. Okay. Thanks, Ben. Next question, please.",

I think this is a source of significant dispersion within consensus how people are thinking about sort of the underlying head office, and it has been an area where historically, consensus has got a little bit out of kilt with your own expectations. So any color on once the transactions you've currently got in the pipeline are done what does that group center income cost run rate look like? And I appreciate that there's still the payments business in there, which may or may not go at some point. But sort of what's the sort of go-to run rate, how things stand for the transactions once the transactions you've got in train are done? And then on BUK NII, just a point of clarification. So it's mid-single-digit growth on the 2024 number, excluding Tesco and then we put Tesco on top.

So the first one, look, I appreciate head office has been a bit volatile in the current year, both because it's housing or inorganic activity and those businesses before they actually flow out. So just to remind you, there's no inorganic activity in the current quarter. You can also get some volatility in there from educating. So we're seeing a bit of that in the quarter, but year-to-date, that is a 0 number, and we expect it to be timing only. It's a bit early to guide you to what that run rate is, Chris, but we will do that in time. But just to remind you, nothing in the current quarter and just appreciate it's very difficult to model at the moment. But once we get beyond that, we'll give you more guidance. On the BUK NII, let me just clarify for you. So ex Tesco, I expect some increase. the mid-single-digit guidance that we gave you for BUK did include Tesco because that was from '23 to '26. So we include Tesco, obviously, in our RWA bridge to £30 billion, and it's included in the mid-single. So I would say, overall, we're expecting some organic ad test go on top to that.

It's quite striking that you're not highlighting to get at all as an impact this quarter. I think you said it was minimal or marginal. I can't remember your exact words in terms of your sensitivity rates falling going forward. And I'm just trying to understand a commentary you could just help us understand why that is? Is that just like a temporary thing? And as the hedge rolls off, then you would expect some more sensitivity? Or is there something that you sort of structurally changed is obviously on the way up, we saw NII grow very strongly on the back of higher rates. So that's 1 question. And then the other question was on the U.S. the margin there. I get your comments about you're still targeting greater than 12%. And I think you said there was a lot of incentive programs or loyalty programs that you were running at the moment. And just again, any help you could give us to understand from a business perspective, how that works? Because I do obviously the U.S. loyalty program is a huge part of the business. It's a huge part of attracting volumes and customers, et cetera. And I'm just trying to think what is it you're expecting to change in the market more broadly? Or how is your offering going to change that's going to allow you to reduce those loyalty offerings but still maintain momentum in the business.",

    "type": "answer",
    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Ed. I will take both of those. On the first one, we gave you some guidance on the interest rate sensitivity in the previous quarter, and that really shows for a 25 basis point parallel shift, it was Good morning. 50 million in the first year. And then what you saw was that build over time. And that build over time. The way I think about it, Ed, is in the first year, it’s dominated by the lag effect. So the sort of 60-day regulatory lag that we have, particularly in the U.K. And then in the outer years, you see the impact of the h’dge grinding lower in response to that parallel movement. So that’s really what’s going on there. If I go back to what I said in products for that product margin on Page 16, just to clarify, we’ve got 2 offsetting impact in that. There is a negative movement from the delay in pricing or repricing the liabilities. But there is an offset, which is coming through from our asset margins, which are expanding. Now you might expect that in a downward movement. Sort of overall, we would expect that as a liability margin start to compress, you see asset margins widening out. And of course, we’ve got specific actions around things like high loan-to-value mortgages that are perhaps driving that a little bit faster. And so it's not that it's not there. I’'s just that there are some offsets. And actually, I would expect a bit more of that lag just because of the way the months sort of pan out in. On your second question on U.S. margin, yes, the NIM is clearly lower than it was at the beginning of the year and indeed last year. But our expectation is that this is still a greater than 12% NIM business. And all of the actions that we are taking to underpin that are taking place. So in the current quarter, and if you look sort of sequentially across the last few quarters, there’s a few things going on. There’s natural seasonality in this business. So you see more purchase activity, more borrowing activity as you go into the holiday season, which is much more seasonal in the U.S. than it is in the U.K. So you’ll see that natural shape. The second thing is, remember, we did that risk transfer in Q1. What that meant was we swapped out NII for fee income, but obviously, it’s roti accretive overall. So you see some movement in the geography of the P&L and the balance sheet. And then thirdly, as we've called out, there are’a couple of things that we’re just observing as a customer master. Actually, I don’t think they’re unhelpful, but there are 2. The first is that customers are – they’re managing their balance as well, they’re repaying, perhaps a little bit faster than we expected. In the context of the broader discussions about the U.S. economy, I don’t think that’s unhelpful and we see the other side of it in positive impairments. So we’re not uncomfortable with that. The second point is that customers are using their awards not necessarily more, but faster than we would have previously expected. Again, long term, for the franchise whilst that puts a bit of a headwind into near-term NIM. It means they’re really engaged with the [indiscernible]. They’re really engaged with the brand program. So it’s good news. So that kind of explains Q3. As I go beyond Q3 and think about that build to greater than 12. The deals that we talked about in February were our #1 repricing, that repricing action has actually taken place, it’s complete. But what happens is customers have to actually purchase under the new terms and conditions. So it’s going to drift through into NIM over time. The second action was really around the funding mix. So we are now around 7% of retail funding. We want to get that to around 75%. That’s going to take a while for us to build. But we’ve launched the tiered savings products that will underpin that, and you’ll see more on that in time. So those things are really important. The last thing I would add is a key part of that move to 12 is how we start to morph this portfolio towards having a richer mix in retail. And you can see that we’ve announced our new partnership with Good morning. That again, is another plank of the strategy. So we’re not going to get to 12% or greater than 12% immediately. You’re going to see it sort of emerge over the next few quarters. But greater than 12% is still our target, and we feel like we’re on track. Next question, please.",

I'm just wondering if that changes how you manage capital in theory, it sort of frees up some capital in the next 12 months to perhaps distribute a little bit more early in the plan? Or should we think that you're more likely to run at the very top end of the 13% to 14% range, maybe even above it, especially if there's a Pillar 2A temporary uptick? Just thinking about how you think about that capital ratio during 2025 now as you have to wait for 26 for some of those come through. And then on the product margins, I just come back to that point in terms of the lag effects and saying it might be more meaningful in Q4 in deposits. I would have thought there'd be some sort of catch-up from the August rate cut, if you like, and you take the day 1 hit on the unhedged deposits and you have to wait to pass some of it back on the rate card. So I just checked that sort of thinking is correct. And your comment around the lag effect been greater in Q4 is maybe reflection of an assumption of 2 rate cuts.

    "text": "Okay. Thanks. I'll take the first of those and then hand to Venkat. So it's probably helpful if we start on the sort of leading indicators page that I that we've included this time. It's on Page 14. And if I take you back to February, what we said in February was we didn't expect significant change in the net balance sheet, particularly in the U.K. in the current year. And that was because of our expectation and the known maturities that we have, not just the mortgages, but for example, in business banking. What we did expect was the change in the gross production a comfort that we are driving that gross production. So in mortgages, it's relatively straightforward. It's actually our gross lending. You can see that stepping forward quarter-on-quarter. It's obviously helped by the fact that the mortgage market itself is strong and robust. But also the fact that we are broadening out our range within that market, and we're really putting Kensington to work now, which we've been unable to do over the last few years. The second point is on card acquisitions, and you can see that meaningful step-up in '24, but we've already started that journey in 2023. And actually, what you see over time is that those cars volumes will start to feed into interest-earning lending. And then finally, on U.S., U.K., CB, I know you're not asking about corporate here, but it's a bit more difficult there because clearly, what you do is you put out lines to clients which is shown here in terms of RWAs. And then those clients in time will draw down on them. So in terms of what happening in terms of lead indicators in the balance sheet, I'm happy we're going in the right direction. In BUK, specifically, we saw positive net lending in the businesses that we've got in focus. So we saw positive net lending in mortgages. We're seeing it in cards. What we've got offsetting that is some runoffs in portfolios, which are obviously no longer call is not the right word. But if I use the example of government lending within business banking, I don't think that's different, either in percentage terms or sort of in directional terms from our peers. You're hearing similar things there. So I think we're happy overall. And obviously, as we increase our card lending, you get a mix impact as we've increased the proportion of lending at higher loan to values, you get a mix impact, and that's really what's flowing into the product margin and giving that positive.",

Are you starting to make those selective decisions to deemphasize DCM? And where are you comfortable doing less, I guess.

    "text": "Right. So Chris, let me take the IB and then Anna will talk about Tesco. On the IB, first of all, big picture, we're looking to keep RWAs in absolute terms, relatively flat to their current number of around 200 billion. The relative reduction in RWAs as a percentage of the group happens because the rest of the group growth. Second, in the Anderson Bank [indiscernible] came down by about £9 billion this quarter compared to the previous one, but about £6 billion of that was due to FX and 3 was actual action. And 1% up and down or 1.5% up and down in the quarter is normal business mix. Third, we are not looking to deal the CCM. What we are looking to do is within the investment bank, be prudent in assigning capital to clients, looking at the totality of their relationship, and that relationship is not just DCM, but it includes M&A and equities and what corporate banking, we do with them. And that's the way to think about it. And lending is a part of it. Lending is not the only part of it, and we don't want lending to be the main part of it. And as far as revenue of £750 million from financing, look, we've been stable at that number. What I would say is while we have been gaining clients and gaining market share in that business, the actual revenue is a function of 2 things. It's a function of what happens in the composition of balances, fixed income and equity and so what the markets do as well as spreads within that. So I can't tell you that is going to stay at this level or not go up or down. It depends on that mix. What we do think we have is a diversified business between fixed income and equities, a competitive business in both but particularly strong fixed income business and a diversified business among the types of clients who use it regionally, product-wise and within fixed income asset class is, meaning spread versus govern. So that's what we think contributes to a good and stable mix, but I'm reluctant to put sort of floors and ceilings on numbers.",

On Tesco, for the next year or so, for the next sort of 12 to 18 months, our focus is really on integration and our focus will be on customer service.

But similar to Q2 where you called out a large deal there, is there any lumpy deals that we should bear in mind is the performance sustainable? I'm guessing ultimately, I'm asking about the pipeline from here given the strong performance? And second is on the leveraged finance marks. It feels like it's a bit of a hard quarter to take those marks and with credit spreads actually very tight. So maybe could you give us a bit of color on what's driving that? Is it portfolio? Is it a single sort of ticket or are you looking to sell something in the mark? Or should we expect more of this in the coming quarters? Just a bit of color on this.",

So on fee performance in Q3, nothing special to call out, look, we are part of certain larger deals, but I wouldn't say that unduly if there's anything I would call out. And as I've said elsewhere, we've obviously seen activity pick up over this year compared to the previous year. We expect it to continue to be relatively firm. Obviously, there are a couple of wild cuts out there in terms of what happens with the U.S. elections and economic policy and rent policy in the U.S. on M&A activity after that.

    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Venkat. So let me pick up that second one, Alvaro. I mean [indiscernible] is a really important part of our business. And you’re right, in the current environment, what we see is that market overall performing really well. Deals are clearing quickly. Occasionally, we find that either some of those don’t. That is episodic. It’s a feature of our business. It’s a feature of the market overall and not something that we would particularly call out. So it’s normal. What we do at the end of every single quarter as we assess our balance sheet and we use prevailing market information in order to assess the fair value of that balance sheet. And where we feel we need to take more than we do, and that’s what we’ve done in the current quarter. So it’s very much BAU and as I say, it occasionally occurs it’s episodic. I wouldn’t comment on clients as we would never do. I would just remind you also that this is a book which have some hedging set against it. The cost of that hedging also flows through corporate lending. So we protect ourselves in that way. And I would say, overall, our exposures are probably, whilst they’re higher than ‘23, they’re lower than they have been historically. So it’s a well risk-managed book. And really, this is sort of the kind of thing we see normally, but on an episodic basis. Thanks, Alvaro. Perhaps we could go to the next question, please.",

    "text": "I've got two, please. The first is -- I'm sorry, it's back on rate sensitivity. Thanks for the hedge allocation data, again, by the way, helps us a bit more precise in the tailwinds there in Barclays U.K. The piece that's sort of struggling with a bit is the rate sensitivity. But the £50 million in year 1, I hear what you're saying about a lot of that being related to deposit back. But if this £40 billion of hedge maturities a year as per guidance, you'd have thought a 25 basis point shift in the curve, would be knocking £50 million out of the hedge income in year 1. So I'm not quite sure what's going on here. Are you saying that there is no impact on what we might call managed margin from a 25 basis point rate reduction at all, just simply because the structural hedge is now so large in the context of the deposit book. So it would be helpful just to understand why that is so low. I mean it's the lowest in the sector. quite difficult to triangulate. The second question -- sorry, this is just for the models really assets into year-end, there's 2 bits that like a bit of clarity on Barclays U.K. saw a £4 billion increase in the early part of the year for methodology, policy changes. At the time you said that would partially reverse over the rest of the year. It doesn't seem like it has reversed yet. Is that coming in Q4? And then in the other direction, the year 1, I think, is pointing to about a £2.5 billion of risk increase in the fourth quarter. Is that about the right number to be sticking in the spreadsheet?",

    "text": "Okay, Jonathan. Let me take the first one. So I would say we said £170 billion over 3 years, so I think you're probably closer to around £60 billion of hedge maturing. And really, what's going on here is Remember, you've got that underlying maturing rate at around 1.5%. So even though rates are coming down, you're still getting a pickup from the structural hedge. And it's only really in the outer years when that grinds out that you're seeing that more meaningful difference. So I think it's nothing more than that, but we can talk you through that outside of here, if that's helpful. As it relates to our relative sensitivity, we talked about this quite a bit as rates went up because we were clearly less rate sensitive on the way up. So you'd expect us to be less sensitive on the way down. So that is exactly what's coming through right now. Perhaps we hedge a little bit more. We certainly hedge more proactively, we are looking forward and assessing that on a monthly basis and adjusting those hedges very, very actively as we go to reflect the detail of customer and client behavior. So I think it's a benefit of that approach that we're seeing and the fact that we've just done this very programmatically over a very long period of time. We're not seeking here to have any kind of view as to where rates will go. We're just lifting the hedge roll and we're reacting to we're reacting to customer behavior. And on the second question, I think we'll have to come back to you on that 1 on op risk. So let us do that. Venkat, do you want to [indiscernible]?",

It kind of implies a Q4 run rate ex Tescos of kind of £6.8 billion, £6.9 billion. If we add in kind of £400 million for Tesco is we're at kind of 7.3%, I think you're looking to grow next year. I think especially given the product hedge is in the U.K., but the structural hedge benefit is more than going to outweigh any kind of rate reduction impact.

We started in a position where – we started in a position where we had 5 rate cuts in February. Now we’re expecting 3. And then the other 3, including the 1 we’ve already had, so a further 2.

So with the scale of the hedge, does that mean that your sensitivity to long rates would be higher than perhaps other banks or your peers? Or just all else equal, would you expect more sensitivity to the long rates? Because the reason I'm asking is because there's obviously been a lot of discussion around neutral rates in Europe and in the U.K. So I'm just wondering, is the reason why your sensitivity is a bit lower in a parallel shift to narrows because maybe there's a little bit of difference between a short end and the long end? And so that's the first part of the question. And the second part is that it sounds like the notional is more stable than you -- than we might have expected previously. And you previously assumed a reinvestment of 75% of the maturing hedges. I guess the question is, does it matter whether you reinvest or just simply let it roll off? Because obviously, you're reinvesting into a higher yield is a positive. But equally, if you runoff at a 1.5% hedge and then just sort of let it roll on to the variable rate that is removing negative and removing the drag. So does that matter whether you're reinvesting or not?",

    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Perlie. I will take both of those. The first is a tenor of what we’re hedging is between 2 and 7. So I wouldn’t say we’re any more sensitive to the long end of the curve than others. We really try and reflect what we think the varying behavioral lives of the different pockets of deposits that we have. So I wouldn’t call that out as a key difference. And then on your second point, just to bring everybody back to this, the I 75 million and the I 170 million was indicated to give you some math that you could then update as we go rather than a specific forecast from us. To the extent that the notional is more stable. I mean clearly, we have a choice every single quarter or every single month as it rolls. At the moment, you’re right, we’re getting a pickup from that maturity as it rolls off even if we just left it overnight. The difference that the structural hedge gives you is obviously secures it. So the structural hedge gives you certainty, which is why we do it programmatically, and why we’re really focused on how much income are we locking in ‘25 and ‘26, which we’ve shown you again on Page 10. So that locked-in number is now I 12.4 billion over the 3 years. So for us, it’s really about the certainty and stability of NII rather than the opportunists kind of every month passing. And just to remind you, that equivalent number was 8.6 in February. Okay. Thank you, Perlie. I think we are going to our last question in the queue, please.",

It's difficult to give any specific guidance around quantum or exact timing, but you'll note that we said modest. And just reiterating, we are already holding Pillar 2A for this.

    "text": "Good morning. It's good to see you all this year. Thank you for coming, and welcome to the -- our first -- our Full-Year 2024 Results and Progress Update Presentation. You can see the agenda for the morning on this slide. We'll go straight into results before turning to review progress in the first year of our three year plan. And as usual, there will be an opportunity for those in the room to ask questions at the end. Note, we also include an update on key operational developments for each of our five divisions as an annex to today's presentation. We won't talk to these slides, but have included them in the spirit of transparency and to help you understand how we are delivering our plan. So let me start with some performance highlights before handing over to Anna to take you through the financials. At our investor update last February, we set out a three year plan to deliver a better run, more strongly performing and higher returning Barclays. I'm encouraged by the progress which we have made during the first year. We are executing the plan in a disciplined way and have achieved all of our financial targets for 2024. And we are on track to achieve our 2026 targets. Last year, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 10.5%, in line with our target greater than 10%. We also announced £3 billion of capital distributions, an important step towards our target to distribute at least £10 billion to shareholders by 2026. This includes £1.2 billion of dividends, enabling a 5% increase in our dividends per share to 8.4p. And also £1.75 billion in buybacks, £1 billion of which was announced today, and which we expect to initiate in the coming days. We have made progress on deploying £30 billion of additional RWAs in our highest returning U.K. businesses, while keeping investment banking RWAs broadly stable. This has resulted in the investment bank falling from 58% to 56% of the group's RWAs on its way to our 2026 target of circa 50%. And we remain well capitalized, ending the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%, within our range of 13% to 14%. We are improving the quality of our income and the stability and durability of our returns. And we are making progress towards our approximately £30 billion income target in 2026. Our top line grew by £1.4 billion or 6% year-on-year during 2024. And we achieved our NII targets for the group and for Barclays U.K. Our structural hedge provides a predictable and highly visible source of net interest income growth over several years. And our cost-to-income ratio for the full-year '24 was 62%, better than our guidance of circa 63%. Our credit performance was also strong, particularly in the U.K. with a group loan loss rate of 46 basis points for the year, below our through-the-cycle 50 to 60 basis points target range. Across Barclays, we are focused on execution. We delivered £300 million of gross efficiency, cost efficiency savings in the fourth quarter, enabling us to achieve our £1 billion target for all of 2024. We remain focused on improving our operational and financial performance across each of our five divisions. Anna will review our financial performance by division shortly, but let me first cover a few highlights. Barclays U.K. delivered a return on tangible equity of 23% for the year. And on the 1st of November, we completed the acquisition of Tesco Bank. Through this acquisition, we have gained a strategic relationship with the U.K.'s largest retailer, supporting growth in our home market. We plan to leverage our expertise in partnership credit cards developed over years, decades in the U.S. to drive further growth and customer engagement. Across the rest of Barclays U.K., deposit balances have continued to stabilize and lending trends are encouraging, resulting in organic balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter. U.K. Corporate and the Private Bank and Wealth Management divisions also contributed to the group's balance sheet expansion. In the investment bank, our objective is to improve returns by regaining market share and improving our RWA productivity and cost efficiency. I'm broadly satisfied with how we have fared against these metrics. And of course, I expect further significant progress in each of the next two years in order to deliver our targets. The 8.5% RoTE for the Investment Bank in 2024 is up 1.5% year-on-year, and it's a good step on our journey to deliver returns in line with the group by 2026. And we expect the Investment Bank to deliver further progress on RoTE in the year ahead. Returns in the U.S. consumer bank improved to 9% from 4% as impairment charges normalized as expected and as we proactively improved our operational performance. We've also made good progress to simplify the bank by divesting the non-strategic businesses that we outlined at our investor update. This included the Italian mortgage portfolios in 2024 and the German consumer finance business completed last month. Before I hand over to Anna, I would like to make two broad points. The first is about the composition and quality of our businesses and of our results. As I hope you see in our 2024 outcomes and in our 2025 outlook, we are aiming to construct a bank with a good mix of businesses, which performed well individually and collectively. We aim to achieve a healthy balance between consumer and wholesale activities, a sound revenue weighting among fees, interest and transactions. And the geographical mix, which takes advantage of the full scope of our presence in the U.K. the depth and breadth of our business in the U.S. and from both those locations, bridges to the important financial centers of the world. Through this, we aim to deliver robust and reliable performance across interest rate and credit cycles. That is the objective of the business strategy, which we presented last year and which we continue to prosecute. My second broad point is that, while Anna and I have the honor to present our results, this performance has been generated by over 90,000 colleagues at Barclays. They have helped to implement the strategy so far, and they are core to our achieving success over the next two years. And to further align their efforts with our shareholders as interest, our colleagues should be able to participate in the ultimate outcome of their work, which is the change in our share price. Therefore, we are announcing today a share grant of approximately £500 million each for the vast majority of our colleagues. Essentially, all employees across all locations outside of managing directors and what we call material risk takers. I have long felt that this kind of alignment between shareholders and employees through broad-based equity participation, strengthens business outcomes. In the U.K., sadly, broad-based equity ownership has been declining. This represents our effort towards arresting and correcting this trend. So with that, I'll hand over to Anna.",

    "text": "Thank you, Venkat, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 summarizes our financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year. Profit before tax was £8.1 billion and was up 24%. This included a Q4 profit before tax of £1.7 billion, up from £0.1 billion. Before going into the detail, as always, I would note that our results are affected by FX rates. The year-on-year performance in Q4 was impacted by a weaker U.S. dollars, which decreased our reported income, costs, and impairments. Conversely, the dollar strengthened from Q3 to Q4. And I'll call out these effects where appropriate. Group's statutory RoTE was 10.5% for 2024 versus our target of greater than 10%. This was against the previous year's RoTE of 9%, which was impacted by £0.9 billion of structural cost actions in Q4. Much of the improvement in RoTE reflected higher income, particularly in the investment bank, Barclays U.K. and Private Bank and Wealth Management. This improvement occurred even as we grew tangible book value per share by 26p during the year to 357p. Throughout the year, as you know, I've been looking for four things in our performance. Income stability, cost discipline and progress on efficiency savings, credit performance and a robust capital position. We delivered on all four. I'll now cover these in more detail, starting with income on Slide 8. Our income growth continues to be supported by the structural hedge and is now complemented by balance sheet growth. Income in the Investment Bank, while seasonally lower in Q4 benefited from the execution of our initiatives to improve productivity and an increase in the industry wallet. Together, this resulted in a 6% increase in total group income for the year to £26.8 billion. Excluding FX, income was up 7% year-on-year. More stable income streams from retail, corporate and financing grew 3% year-on-year and together contributed 74% of group income. Turning to NII. Our group net interest income increased for the third consecutive year by 3% in FY '24 to £11.3 billion. Excluding Tesco, group NII increased 2% to £11.2 billion. And within this, Barclays U.K. rose 1% to £6.5 billion. Both were in line with our guidance at Q3 and more favorable than our February guidance. This reflected the benefit of higher-than-expected interest rates and faster deposit stabilization on our NII, including as a result of higher reinvestment income from the structural hedge. The structural hedge is designed to reduce income volatility and manage interest rate risk. The high proportion of balances hedged reduces our sensitivity to the short-term effect of rate cuts. NII from the hedge increased £1.1 billion during the year to £4.7 billion. Income provided by the hedge is significant and predictable. We've now locked in £9.1 billion of gross income over the next two years up from £7.8 billion at Q3 and £4.8 billion a year ago. This income will continue to build as we reinvest maturing assets at higher yields. As consumer deposit behavior has stabilized, the average duration of the hedge has increased modestly to around three years. Moving on to costs. We achieved a cost-income ratio of 62% for the year below our circa 63% target. This included a £90 million motor finance provision in Q4. In line with our plan, we delivered £1 billion of gross efficiency savings during the year, including £0.3 billion during Q4. These savings created capacity for investments and business growth. We also took proactive steps to accelerate structural cost actions in a number of our divisions given the strong performance in the year, whilst importantly, still delivering on our cost income ratio target. The costs of these measures, which will support our future returns and efficiency came to £110 million in the quarter, or £273 million in total for 2024, well within our normal annual range. Turning now to impairment. The Q4 -- sorry, the FY '24 impairment charge of £2 billion equated to a loan loss rate of 46 basis points. This included a day one charge for Tesco Bank of £209 million where accounting rules require balances to be brought on to our books at Stage 1. The U.K. credit picture remains benign with low and stable delinquencies in our consumer books and wholesale loan loss rates below our through-the-cycle expectations. Specifically, the Barclays U.K. charge was £365 million, including day one effects from Tesco, resulting in a loan loss rate of 16 basis points for 2024. The U.S. consumer bank impairment charge was down 10% year-on-year at £1.3 billion. Delinquencies in UCSB are developing in line with our expectations, with 30- and 90-day delinquencies stable. As guided, impairment charges in this business were lower in '24 versus the prior year, and H2 was also lower than H1. Coverage ratios remained strong. Looking ahead, we expect the loan loss rate in FY '25 to be similar to '24. This includes the lagged effect of hard delinquencies in the past 12 to 18 months and the anticipated day one effect of bringing the General Motors partnership on board in Q3 '25. I would also note that loan loss rates tend to be seasonally higher in Q1 given holiday spend in Q4. Turning now to our U.K. growth. This slide summarizes key aspects of our organic growth. Gross mortgage lending strengthened throughout the year, supported by a more active property market and higher loan-to-value lending. 15% of our mortgage lending was to higher LTV borrowers, up from 9% in 2023. We acquired 1 million new Barclaycard customers up 58% year-on-year as part of our strategy to regain market share in unsecured lending. And in the corporate bank, we deployed around £3 billion of RWAs by extending client lending facilities to support future lending growth. Clients have now started to draw down on these facilities reflected in around £1 billion of net U.K. corporate loan growth in Q4. Turning now to Barclays U.K. You can see financial highlights on Slide 15, but I will talk to Slide 16. The acquisition of Tesco Bank in November complicates comparisons for Q4. So let me start by unpacking the moving parts. First, there was a gain on acquisition of £0.6 billion and a day one impairment charge of £0.2 billion. Together, these created a one-off benefit to Barclays U.K. statutory RoTE, which was 28% in the quarter. Excluding these day one effect, Barclays U.K. RoTE was 19.1%. Second, comparisons are affected by the inclusion of Tesco Bank's underlying earnings for two months since November. This included £101 million of NII and around £60 million of costs in line with our guidance for £30 million run rate cost per month. We continue to expect circa £400 million of NII from Tesco in 2024, 2025. Whilst the Q4 run rate exceeded this level, we expect this to normalize in future quarters. The inclusion of higher NIM balances from Tesco also explains around 11 of the 19 basis points increase in BUK NIM versus Q3. Excluding Tesco Bank, Barclays NII increased £48 million Q-on-Q. This reflected continued structural hedge momentum and a tailwind from balance sheet growth partially offset by product repricing lags. Non-NII was £244 million, the decline versus Q3 reflects the one-off effect of the Q4 securitization that we previously highlighted. Going forward, we continue to expect a run rate above £250 million per quarter. Q4 costs -- total costs increased by £209 million versus Q3 to £1.2 billion. This included around £60 million for Tesco Bank and a £36 million bank levy. The remaining increase reflected investment to support growth and structural cost actions. Moving on to the Barclays U.K. balance sheet. In Q4, both loans and deposits grew organically. The acquisition of Tesco Bank added a further £8 billion of loans and £7 billion of deposits. On an organic basis, deposit balances grew by circa £1 billion. Flows into savings accounts and current accounts were particularly strong ahead of the U.K. budget in October and customers have so far retained this liquidity. Looking ahead, tax payments during Q1 typically lead to a seasonal reduction in customer deposit balances. And as I discussed earlier, stronger activity in mortgages and Barclaycard led to a £1 billion increase in Q4 lending before the effect of our securitization in the quarter. Moving on to the U.K. Corporate Bank. U.K. Corporate Bank delivered a Q4 RoTE of 12.3%. NII was up 31% year-on-year, reflecting deposit income growth and the non-repeat of adverse liquidity pool income in the prior year. Non-NII was down 9% year-on-year and broadly flat to Q3. Whilst this line can be volatile, we expect investments in our digital and lending propositions to drive non-NII growth over time. Investments to support this growth and to drive greater efficiency led to a 10% year-on-year increase in costs, excluding the structural cost actions we took in Q4 '23. And our full-year loan loss rate of 29 basis points was within our through-the-cycle guidance of circa 35 basis points. Turning now to Private Bank and Wealth Management. Q4 RoTE was 23.9%. Client assets and liabilities grew £7 billion versus Q3 and £26 billion versus the prior year. We also attracted net new assets under management of £0.7 billion in Q4 and £3.7 billion for the year. This is a new metric that we will disclose going forward. This growth in volumes as well as higher transactional activity led to a 12% year-on-year increase in income. Excluding Q4 '23 structural cost actions, costs were up 15% year-on-year as we took further actions this quarter to optimize headcount and drive business growth. As you heard at our deep dive in December, we will continue to prioritize investment in this business. Turning now to the Investment Bank. The Q4 RoTE was seasonally low at 3.4% with a full-year RoTE of 8.5%, both ahead of the prior year. Q4 total income was up 28% year-on-year, while total costs rose 11%, excluding the Q4 structural cost actions. This was the third consecutive quarter of positive jaws. Adjusted for FX, total income was up 31% year-on-year, and costs were up 12% year-on-year, excluding structural cost actions in the prior year. Part of the increase in our Q4 costs reflected actions we took to improve future efficiency. Period-end RWAs of £199 billion were £5 billion higher versus Q3, with FX accounting for £6 billion of the increase. Now looking at the Q4 income in more detail. Using the U.S. dollar figures as usual to help comparison to U.S. peers, markets income was up 36% year-on-year. Macroeconomic conditions supported a 32% increase in FICC income driven by financing, credit, rates and FX. Equities income was up 44%, aided by strong performance across cash, prime and derivatives. Investment banking fees rose 22%. For FY '24 as a whole, our share of banking fees increased by 30 basis points to 3.3%, but we have more work to do to build on this improvement. Within Q4, our ECM performance was strong, with income up 160% year-on-year. Advisory fees were also up 12% with good momentum and a robust pipeline headed into 2025. Whilst DCM was up 10% year-on-year, our performance was mixed. In leverage finance, we increased market share by 70 basis points to 4.7% in a strong market. This was offset by softer performance in investment grade, particularly in Q4, with a strong Asian wallet, which we did not participate in, given our limited presence in the region. In addition, we were less active in event financing in the quarter, and this represents an opportunity as we further improve our advisory capabilities. Importantly, we saw progress in areas of the investment bank that inherently have more stable revenues. Financing income was up 34% reflecting a strong increase in client balances and international corporate bank income was up 22%. U.S. deposit balances grew by circa 90% year-on-year which we see as a lead indicator of income growth. U.S. Consumer Bank RoTE was 11.2% in the quarter. The improvement versus the prior year reflected lower impairment charges following the reserve build in H2 '23. Income was down 1% year-on-year or up 1% excluding FX. This reflected a $0.9 billion increase in card balances to £33.1 billion on a reported basis. From Q3 to Q4, NII increased 5%, supported by seasonally stronger balances, which also grew 5%. NIM rose 28 basis points partly reflecting the lagged benefit of our repricing actions earlier in the year. The successful launch of our new tiered retail savings product in Q3 led to a 17% year-on-year growth in retail deposit funding with a $2 billion increase in Q4. The proportion of core deposits rose 1% year-on-year to 64%, reflecting wholesale funding raised during Q4 to meet seasonal asset growth. As seasonal spending eases we should see a further increase in our share of funding from core deposits towards our target of 75% in 2026. Excluding Q4 2023 structural cost actions, total costs were up 8% as we continue to invest in the growth of the business, driving a cost-to-income ratio of 51%. Moving to capital. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%. This included around 140 basis points of capital generation from profits, excluding the day 1 P&L benefit of the Tesco Bank acquisition. We previously highlighted two inorganic transactions that would impact capital in the near term, both of which have now completed. The first was the circa 20 basis points of capital consumption from the acquisition of Tesco Bank in Q4. The second is the circa 10 basis points accretion from the sale of the German consumer finance business, which was completed last month and will benefit the CET1 ratio in Q1 '25. The £1 billion share buyback we announced today will also lower the ratio by around 30 basis points in Q1. Looking ahead, we maintain our guidance for between £19 billion and £26 billion of regulatory-driven RWA inflation. The U.K. regulator's decision to postpone the implementation of Basel 3.1 to January 2027 may, however, alter the mix and phasing of this change. Adopting IRB in the U.S. consumer bank is still expected to increase RWAs by circa £16 billion. Whilst uncertainty around the size and the mix of the portfolio at the time of implementation has increased, this remains our best estimate for now. In the meantime, there are a few changes in the regulatory landscape. Prior to implementing IRB for U.S. cards, our Pillar 2A requirement will increase by 0.1% from Q1 2025. We expect this Pillar 2A capital to be removed when the IRB model is implemented in 2026 or 2027, when this £16 billion RWA increase is reflected in Pillar 1. Consequently, our maximum distributable amount ratio or MDA is expected to rise to 12.2% from Q1 '25. We previously expected that this would reduce following the implementation of Basel 3 in January 2026, but this will now be delayed to January 2027. Reflecting this, you should continue to expect us to operate towards the upper half of our 13% to 14% target CET1 range as we have been doing. Naturally, our distribution expectations remain unchanged. Turning now to recent RWA developments. RWAs increased £18 billion from Q3 to £358 billion. Tesco Bank added £7 billion and a further £7 billion was driven by FX in the Investment Bank and the U.S. Consumer Bank. As usual, a brief word on our overall capital and liquidity on Slide 30. We maintain a well-capitalized and liquid balance sheet with diverse sources of funding, and a significant excess of deposits over loans. TNAV per share increased by 6p in the quarter and by 26p during 2024 to 357p. Attributable profit added 6p per share during Q4, whilst our share buyback and other movements added 1p and 3p, respectively. These were partially offset by a more negative cash flow hedge reserve, which reduced TNAV by 4p per share. This is the fourth quarter in the 12-quarter plan we laid out in February. Today, we are reiterating our group targets for 2026 and providing additional guidance for 2025, including a further improvement in group RoTE to around 11%. I'll come back to discuss the building blocks of this guidance in more detail with you. But first, I would like to hand back to Venkat to take you through some reflections on progress during the first year of our plan.",

    "text": "Thank you, Anna. So almost a year ago today, we set three key priorities for Barclays by 2026, to improve our returns, to distribute more to shareholders and to rebalance our RWAs. We also set 2020 -- interim milestones for 2024, which we have delivered. Our plan was set on realistic assumptions, which together with our diversified business model, allowed us effectively to navigate market, macro and regulatory conditions throughout the year. So what were these? U.K. deposits have stabilized faster and the investment banking wallet has been stronger than we expected. Fixed income, FICC, which is traditionally an area of strength for us, performed slightly weaker than we had expected in 2024, but our strong performance in equities where we have taken market share, partially compensated for this, rebalancing our overall markets business. And the economic environment has been more supportive with interest rates remaining higher alongside more benign unemployment and inflation in our main U.K. and U.S. markets. Last year, I described the important reset of our financial performance and shareholder returns since 2021. I also told you that this improvement was not sufficient and that our shareholder experience needed to be better. We are making progress on our plan and we are generating growth. Notably, we have achieved our fifth consecutive year of TNAV per share growth of 8% during 2024, and 7% annually since 2019. This positive outcome reflects improvements in our returns and growth of our earnings per share, including by 30% year-on-year during 2024 to the highest level in decade. This enabled a 5% increase in total distributions, including progressive growth in our dividend per share. For the group as a whole, we look to generate higher returns in two ways. First, by allocating more capital to our higher returning U.K. businesses, which I'll come on to discuss. And second, by improving returns in the lower returning businesses, namely the investment bank and the U.S. consumer bank. That was true last year when we set out our strategy, and it remains true today. We are making progress, including in target growth areas of the Investment Bank, but further improvements are needed to achieve our RoTE target of greater than 12%. And in the U.S. Consumer Bank, too, we remain focused on rebuilding returns towards the mid-teens RoTE beyond 2026. A reduction of impairments in line with our expectations as well as other operational improvements enabled a 9% RoTE in 2024 versus 4% in 2023. Let me now discuss the allocation of capital to high-return divisions in more detail. At our investor update, we outlined the plan to create a more balanced group. To do this, we plan to allocate £30 billion of additional RWAs to our three highest returning businesses, Barclays U.K., the U.K. Corporate Bank and Private Banking and Wealth Management. As we expected, actions that we took during the year began to generate organic balance sheet growth due towards the end of the year. And including the acquisition of Tesco Bank, RWA is in our highest returning U.K. businesses, increased by £13 billion due to business growth and by £15 billion overall in 2024. And as Anna has discussed earlier, lead indicators of growth across our U.K. businesses are encouraging. Given this, we expect a step-up in our organic RWA deployment during the year with further momentum in 2026. We are committed to keeping Investment Bank RWAs relatively stable at 2023 levels. And this is the third consecutive year in which this division has operated with this level of capital. We continue to expect investment banking RWAs to fall proportionately to about 50% of the group by 2026 from 56% today as we grow the three U.K. businesses. Taking a closer look at the Tesco Bank acquisition, which we are thinking about in three stages: acquire, integrate and improve. The first stage was completed on the 1st of November '24. The acquisition has added £8 million to our unsecured balances, moving our weighting in credit cards and personal loans towards our 2019 position. And the profile of Tesco Bank's customers is attractive. As we show in our operational data pack on Slide 57, Tesco Bank's customers have a higher spend per card than the market average. Tesco's position as the U.K.'s largest retailer with strong customer satisfaction and more than 20 million Tesco Clubcard holders provides a significant customer growth opportunity. We've also gained an additional brand to operate with and an open market lending capability. The second stage is to integrate Tesco Bank, which we intend to do during 2025 and '26 and this involves onboarding Tesco customers to Barclays' platform in 2026 to reduce duplication of systems and processes while maintaining a strong customer experience. The integration will require some upfront investment, but the realization of synergies will reduce the run rate costs. These actions are factored into our plan, and we continue to target a circa 50% cost to income ratio for Barclays U.K. in 2026, following an increase in '25 given the costs associated with the Tesco Bank. The third stage is to improve the business which we expect to gain momentum after 2027. This will involve further growing customer balances supported by better access to funding and to capital. This increased scale will enable greater efficiency as fixed costs are spread over a larger customer base. Turning now to the U.S. consumer bank. We made meaningful progress in 2024, improving RoTE to 9% from 4% and achieving cost-to-income ratio of 49%. We also announced that our American Airlines partnership will not be renewed beyond 2026. American Airlines has been a card partner in our business for seven years as part of a dual issuer model and we valued our long relationship with them. We knew that the partnership could transition to a single issuer model. That happened last year, and we chose not to participate on that basis. The ending of our partnership provides a short-term gain on sale in 2026 and releases capital that we intend to use to diversify the business. We expect the overall credit mix of the portfolio to change, still prime, but with less weighting to super prime balances. And all things being equal, this will lead to a higher net interest margin and loan loss rate and a higher risk-adjusted margin for the portfolio. Our 2026 targets are unchanged, including an RoTE of greater than 12% in line with the group as the gain on sale offsets lower profitability due to the loss of the receivables. We are confident in our ability to grow card balances to achieve necessary scale in the U.S. consumer bank. In line with our broader group strategy, the plan is organic. And organic growth has driven around 85% of our increase -- of the increase in our net card receivables since 2011. And looking ahead, will drive two-thirds of our planned growth. We have a strong foundation for such growth given that over 80% of our card receivables are under contract at least until 2029. Our success in accelerating balance growth for partners also translates into significant loyalty with a historical partnership renewal rate of around 90%. In 2024, notable renewals included Hawaiian and RCI. And at the start of 2025, we have also renewed our partnership with Wyndham. In addition to being a long-standing top five partner for us, Wyndham is also a long-term investment banking client. This provides a good demonstration of how collaboration across the Barclays Group can drive successful outcomes. While organic growth is at the heart of the plan, opportunities for inorganic growth in the market are also significant. For instance, 15 relevant deals [Technical Difficulty] in dollars of balances were tendered annually on average in the market during the past five years. We remain confident in our ability to win new partners given the strength of our offering and our ability to increase customer engagement and balances. And this was evidenced by recent wins, including Breeze in 2023 and General Motors in 2024. The General Motors card portfolio, which we will onboard in the third quarter of '25 will offset about a quarter of the balances we expect to lose from American Airlines. Overall, we remain focused on achieving scale beyond 2026 and driving improved efficiency to deliver mid-teens RoTE for this business. Turning now to the Investment Bank. Last year, we shared our plan to increase returns in the investment bank to greater than 12% by 2026, in line with our group target. While competitive and industry dynamics are creating opportunities and challenges for individual businesses, our overall progress is as expected, and we continue to run our own race. Our objective is to generate higher and more stable income and returns by improving RWA productivity and rebalancing resources in the business, while only modestly increasing costs. We delivered 7% year-on-year income growth in 2024, broadly on track with our high single-digit annualized growth target from '23 to '26. And as a reminder, more than half of our planned growth in the investment bank comes from initiatives, which we control with the remainder coming from growth in the industry wallet. So we expect these initiatives to add £1.8 billion to our income by 2026. And in the first year of our plan, we achieved around a third of this planned improvement. In Investment Banking, we've increased share across most products. This included strong performance in ECM where we increased fee share by about 100 basis points. And in leveraged finance, where we increased share by 70 basis points. And across the three focus businesses in market, we've made progress within equity derivatives and securitized products. And while progress in European rates has been slower, we saw a recovery in the fourth quarter. Across our markets business, we now rank top five with 56 of our top 100 clients, up seven from a year ago and versus our target of 70 by the end of 2026. Our capital productivity has also improved, with income to RWAs increasing by 30 basis points year-on-year to 5.8%. And we achieved positive jaws, with income up 7% from '23 versus a four year -- 4% increase in costs. And this enabled a year-on-year improvement in our cost-to-income ratio to 67%. And we are focused on making further progress on this cost income ratio in 2025 towards our delivery -- towards delivery of our high 50s target for 2026 full-year. I'd like to highlight two areas of progress during the past year that helped to position the investment bank to perform in a range of scenarios. First, as Anna said, we continue to prioritize growth in stable income during 2024, particularly within financing. Growing financing income enhances the durability of our returns, and we now have financing relationships with 98 of our top 100 clients. Second, our banking fee share has increased by 30 basis points year-on-year to 3.3% with the wallet also higher. And we remain particularly positioned -- well positioned to benefit from stronger activity in the U.S. where we generate 68% of our total banking fees. At the same time, our market share in global markets declined 20 basis points in the year reflecting lower share in fixed income, the larger of our markets businesses. And so while we are pleased with our direction of travel, we recognize that there's further work to do to deliver the full extent of our ambition. Let me now hand over to Anna for the final installment of today's update.",

    "text": "Thank you, Venkat. At our investor update last February, we outlined a plan to deliver ambitious financial targets and meaningfully higher shareholder distributions. We are confident that we can deliver consistent returns in a range of scenarios underpinning our ambition. I'll now go through what supports these targets. The diversification of our business model by income, by geography helps supports return in a range of economic environments. This has contributed to more stable returns in the last four years. As Venkat mentioned, the external environment in 2024 was generally more supportive than we expected. But in executing our plan, we remain focused on what we can control. Our plan continues to be based on realistic assumptions. These include four U.K. base rate cuts during 2025 and a bank rate of 3.5% by the end of 2026. We also assume a five year swap rate of around 3.5% for the purpose of our structural hedge reinvestment, although I acknowledge that current market rates are higher. And we are not relying on a recovery in the investment banking wallet to deliver our plan with our assumptions unchanged from those we outlined last year. The next few slides describe how our drive towards higher and more predictable returns come together for our shareholders. Our 2026 targets are unchanged, including our North Star of a RoTE above 12%. Our foundation is strong, having delivered 10.5% last year, and we expect further improvement in 2025 to around 11%. Crucially, we expect income growth to provide a RoTE tailwind in 2025 with NII accounting for more than half of this. We will maintain cost discipline as we grow. We expect our cost income ratio to fall in 2025, and we expect further cost efficiency savings and income momentum into 2026. This combination will support a RoTE of more than 12%. I'll now explain the drivers of our income and costs in turn. We continue to target around £30 billion of income in 2026. This means a further £3 billion of income growth over the next two years, having delivered £1.4 billion in 2024. The drivers of our growth are within our control. First, the strong NII tailwind. For 2025, we expect a £0.9 billion increase in group NII, of which £0.8 million is from Barclays U.K. Our confidence in delivering this reflects the predictable tailwind from the structural hedge underpinned by realistic assumptions about rates and reinvestment yields. And this tailwind lasts beyond '25 with the structural hedge driving around half of our expected increase in total group income over the next two years. In addition, we expect balance sheet and earnings momentum from the deployment of RWAs in our three high returning U.K. businesses. This momentum was apparent in Q4 and we expect it to continue and to be visible in our 2025 performance. Second, non-NII, mainly coming from the investment bank. We expect to deliver a high single-digit CAGR income growth over the life of our three year plan and are broadly on track, having delivered 7% in '24. Overall year-on-year growth of £0.8 billion in the IB included £0.2 billion from wallet growth. Importantly, the biggest share of this increase of £0.6 billion came from the execution of our management initiatives or a third of the £1.8 billion total we expect by 2026. This leaves a further £1.2 billion of growth from management actions over the next two years. As with the case last year, we are not relying on wallet growth to meet our target. In fact, our assumptions are unchanged from a year ago with a lower banking wallet in both '25 and '26 versus '24. And should the recovery continue, our business is strongly positioned to participate in a rebound in deal activity, particularly in the U.S., where we generate around two-thirds of our banking fees. Moving on to costs. Managing cost is at the heart of what we can control. We showed this in 2024 achieving a 62% cost-to-income ratio. This improvement versus 2023 was supported by the delivery of £1 billion of gross efficiency savings in the year. These savings reflected targeted actions in respect to people, property, and infrastructure. For example, in the past year, we decommissioned around 200 legacy applications as part of our plan to exit between 450 and 500 by 2026. We increased our digitally active customers in Barclays U.K. by 700,000 and rationalized our branch network by more than 25%. And in markets, our actions during the last two years have driven a 20% reduction in the number of trade capture and risk pricing systems supporting our efficiency and operational resilience. Looking forward, there are three drivers of cost change in 2025 and 2026. First, efficiency savings. We expect a further £1 billion in gross efficiency savings split broadly evenly across the next two years. Around one-third of these savings come from plans to simplify customer journeys with the rest driven by actions to streamline businesses, including the optimization of people and technology. Second, inflation which we expect to be more meaningful in '25 versus '26. This is because inflation impacts on us on a lagged basis, so '25 reflects some of the headline inflation pressure we've observed recently. It also includes a £50 million increase in national insurance contributions following the U.K. budget. And third, greater investment in our highest returning businesses in 2025. Specifically, I would call out the annualization of investment costs, which have increased during 2024 and additional Tesco Bank costs, including integration. In 2025, incremental investment and inflation are expected to exceed efficiency savings, resulting in an increase in our costs. In 2026, we expect costs to be broadly stable, if not down a little year-on-year, as incremental investment and inflation moderate and are offset by efficiency savings. Given this cost profile and planned income growth, we expect our cost-to-income ratio to fall by 1% in 2025 to circa 61% and to fall more significantly to our high 50s percent in 2026. Given our 2026 income target of £30 billion, our high 50s cost-to-income target would be consistent with around £17 billion of costs. We will drive further efficiency beyond that in each of our businesses and for the group as a whole. Barclays U.K. and Investment Bank represents some 70% of our planned cost efficiency savings, work to reduce duplicate systems and processes for Tesco Bank should reduce the cost run rate from circa £30 million per month currently synergies are realized. And across Barclays U.K., we remain focused on streamlining and digitizing the business to improve our efficiency. And in the Investment Bank, we invested significantly between 2021 and '23 to sustain and grow future income. In markets that investment centered around technology, whilst the focus in investment banking was more on people. We expect these actions to result in greater productivity and a high 50s cost-to-income ratio in the investment bank by 2026, with further efficiencies expected beyond. Put differently, 2026 does not represent the full extent of our ambition. Turning now to capital and capital generation. As we grow returns in line with our plan, we expect to generate around 170 basis points of capital during 2025, rising to more than 200 basis points in 2026. We have a clear hierarchy for capital allocation in order of priority, first, to hold a prudent level of capital with an expectation that we will continue to operate towards the upper half of our 13% to 14% CET1 target range, taking into account regulatory requirements. By doing this, we deliver for our investors, customers, clients, and colleagues regardless of the environment; second, to distribute capital to our shareholders; and third, to invest selectively in our highest returning divisions, resulting in a more profitable RWA mix and a better bank for all our stakeholders. We set a high bar for investment returns given the importance we place on shareholder distributions overall. We announced £3 billion of capital distributions in respect of FY '24. These distributions represent an important step in our target to return at least £10 billion to shareholders during the life of our plan. We expect a progressive increase in our total payout during 2025. And as a reminder, we plan to keep the total dividend broadly stable at £1.2 billion per year, growing our dividend per share progressively through lower share count. Bringing this together, we are reiterating our group targets for 2026 and are providing additional guidance for 2025. This includes 2025 RoTE guidance of circa 11% and a progressive increase in our total payout versus £3 billion per year in the past two years. The expected increase in RoTE will be supported by group NII growth to around £12.2 billion including an increase in Barclays U.K. to around £7.4 billion. We expect to improve the cost -- group cost income ratio to circa 61%. Our progress during 2024 provides a solid foundation for these milestones. We continue to deliver against our plan to achieve a RoTE greater than 12% by focusing on structural actions that are within our control to improve income and efficiency.

I've noted that you expect wallet share -- the size of wallet to come down, but I'll focus on BUK, because I guess we'll have a view on that. On BUK, the guidance for 2025 looks my numbers for an underlying 2% growth versus the run rate in Q4, which sounds quite conservative given the volume growth and given the hedge contribution should be increasing. Are you just being conservative? Or are we missing any moving parts around more competition in asset product like mortgage? Is there anything we're missing there? I just been out of conservatism? And the second question on capital. If we take out, obviously, the buyback and German cards will come down and you want to operate at the higher end of the 13% to 14%. Do you have any sort of RWA efficiency measures that you can call out? And I'm thinking, obviously, there's been a Twitter sale. It sounds like a couple of blocks there, and these are very high risk-weighted sort of kind of positions over to 50% from -- if memory serve me right, will that have a significant impact that will help you sort of reallocate the capital to growth areas?

    "text": "Thank you, Alvaro. I'll take both of those. So let me start with the question that you didn't ask, but you sort of asked, which was about the banking wallet. So I want to be really clear here. We are assuming or we have an assumption that the banking wallet remains as we had it last year. You shouldn't take from that, that if the opportunities are greater in the market that we would seek to monetize those as we have done in Q4 and indeed all the way through 2024. So I'll just call out that distinction. Relating to Barclays U.K., we're guiding to NII next year or in '25 of £7.4 billion. As I think about that number, I reflect back on 2024. And actually, what we've seen in successive quarters is strong NII growth. And we expect that to continue in 2025 and into 2026. BUK NII is not near its peak. As I take the 7.4%, I think of it in a number of building blocks. So the first is take the Q4 run rate ex-Tesco multiply that by 4. Then add on £400 million for Tesco, add on the impact of maturing structural hedge this year. Now we are assuming a reinvestment rate of 3.5% in that calculation, and then take off the impact of four base rate reductions in the year. As I put those building blocks together, you will get to around £7.4 billion. In addition to that, there's two further things for you to consider. The first, as you note, we have got good momentum in the business, and you can see that in Q4. You can see that in cards and in mortgages, we expect that to continue. In our calculation, what we're assuming here is that there is some offset in margin. I wouldn't call anything out in particular. I would just say particularly in liability margins, we expect a continuation of migration. Nothing more than we've seen. So I'm not expecting it to accelerate, but I'm just assuming that those two things are somewhat offsetting within the year. You may have different expectations for those macro assumptions or indeed the swap rate. But we're trying to route this plan within factors that we can control, and we believe that we've made realistic assumptions that underpin that number. But I'd just highlight, we're expecting continued income momentum in BUK into '25 and beyond. In terms of your capital number, I mean, I'm not going to speak about any client positions as you would expect. Our focus here is on executing the plan as it is elsewhere. We'd expect the investment bank to operate within the framework we've given it for RWAs. So you should expect those RWAs to be broadly flat. The thing that you didn't call out actually was organic capital generation. That's what we're confident in here. So throughout Q1, remember, Q1 is a seasonally strong quarter for us. We deploy RWAs into the business, but seasonally, it is very strong for us in terms of investment banking and markets activity. And as we've called out in the presentation, our expectation is that organic capital generation will continue to develop, both in '25 and in '26 and the kind of capital range that we talked about today is no different from where you've seen us operate actually over the last two to three years.",

And I guess a share price reaction this morning, maybe reflects the fact that people were expecting a little bit more. And as you noted that -- well, the environment is probably better than what you were sitting on a year ago when you put out the targets for the first time across every metric you could think of pretty much. So I guess, why did you not upgrade '26 targets a bit more. I mean, I know it's greater than 12%. So -- but would you, for example like invite us to put more focus on the greater than, for example, and any color you could give on that would be really helpful. Just if you were to come up with a plan today, wouldn't you be more optimistic than you were a year ago? I guess that's the first question. And the second question is on U.S. cards. Just the direction of the business as the AA book phases out. So do you still see it as a growth business? Because a few years ago, that was an area of growth that we all looked at? And then I guess more operationally, what does the exit of AA mean? So what I'm thinking is that, well, maybe receivables growth will be a bit slower in the next couple of years as the bill comes to an end. And then as you take on new books, well, there will be more J-curve impact and more day 1 impairments, et cetera. So how is that going to impact the RoTE because I know that you haven't changed the guidance on that either.",

We've hit all of the targets and guidance that we gave you, and we feel we've set the business up really well for momentum in '25 and '26.

It's a confident plan, which is based on strong structural progress across the things which we can control and then taking advantage of cyclical opportunities as we did last year, and we expect to, as they come up. On the U.S. cards business, we remain confident for a couple of reasons. First of all, we gave you the statistic of the number of accounts and the volume of receivables that come up for bid. Second, which is £40 billion in this thing. Second is that we have a, locked up around 90% of our -- 85% of our net receivables outside of American through to 2029. And third, we have a retention rate of 90% renewal rate. We operate in a very specialized place with midsized companies for whom we have a particular skill at managing their partnership portfolio and able to grow their balances and increased customer engagement. And so just like General Motors came in this year, we will continue to look for these opportunities. I'm fairly confident we'll land them because when we participate in these, we know what we provide very valuably into the market. And then on the operational side, we will continue -- to come back to your point on J-curve, first of all, if a lot of the book, 85% of the book is locked through 2029, yes, there will be a J-curve for new things, right?

It's an executional plan that actually goes all the way through the P&L and the balance sheet. Clearly, revenue growth is important, but it's not the only thing that we're working on to improve the RoTE of the business. So we're working very hard on mitigating the impacts of regulatory headwinds. So you saw that transaction in Q1 of this year. We're working very hard in terms of the cost efficiency of this business. The cost income ratio is now below 50% in this business. It's fallen for the last consecutive four years. And remember, we're targeting to get it to mid-40s. So there's a big digitization push in this business. The third thing is we continue to work on the net interest margin of the business. We spoke again about that last year and that there are two parts. The first was repricing. We completed that repricing in 2024. And you're going to see it start to accumulate in the NIM over time. And the second thing is really reducing our funding cost by driving up the proportion of retail deposits. Again, I spoke about that in my prepared remarks. So Venkat is absolutely right, there are there are opportunities here to grow volume, but our RoTE delivery is volume, capital efficiency, cost efficiency and NIM.",

So look, I think we are at the early stages of a regulatory debate in the U.K., which go both to what might happen on prudential regulation as well as consumer regulation. We do think that, obviously, regulation is very important, and it's important to the city of London. We also think it's important to have a balanced regulatory outlook and one that is commensurate across the globe. So in the U.S., you're seeing a rethinking on Basel, on the base of Basel as well as stress testing. And the PRA has postponed its own decisions till 2027. We would always want. We've always advocated for consistency in total capital requirements. That means base capital in Basel as well as stress testing. And that's what we'd like to see, but it's too soon for me to say one way or the other what the results are going to be. So you've seen the plan that we've given you with the assumptions we have. On the consumer side, obviously, there has been volatility that's come in because of impact of regulations, impact of court cases, worries about retrospective application of these things. And you've seen it in the charges that people have taken and we took a provision on Motor Finance. What I'm very happy about on that is that we were small in the business, and we exited the business in 2019, right? And so you've got to risk manage this situation, you should always expect us to do that. And then as far as M&A, look, this is an organic plan, right?

And then the third thing is around potentially reducing RWA weightings in higher loan-to-value mortgages. We're an IRB bank.

Presumably what you're essentially saying is you're expecting the cost base to grow to in excess of £17 billion in 2025 before them fading back to around £17 million in 2026, but just wanted to make sure that understanding was correct. And then the second question on the U.S. Consumer Bank. You've specifically drawn out on Slide 39 that there is going to be a gain on the sale of the AA portfolio, and that seems to be included within the target.

So we're expecting our costs to go up in 2025 because of the annualization of Tesco because of the integration costs of Tesco and because of those inflation headwinds that I talked about in my prepared remarks. But underneath all of this, you've got a continued focus in gross efficiency. So that's going to be continuing. In '25, inflation and investment outweigh the efficiency. In '26, it's the other way around. So actually, I'm expecting costs to go above £17 billion actually. I think consensus is not in a bad place and then drop back. So that's my expectation. In terms of U.S. Consumer Bank, in 2026, you're going to have those two offsetting effects, as Venkat said, you're going to have a gain on sale and you're going to have a more immediate impact from loss of volume. I'm not going to guide you to a 2027 RoTE at this point. I would just make a few points. Firstly, we're confident in our ability to regain volume both organically and inorganically. Secondly, I'd just remind you of what Venkat said in his remarks where he talked about American Airline was an incredibly important partner for us. But in terms of risk-adjusted returns, it's a lower part of our portfolio. And we will continue to really focus on the things that I talked about in terms of cost efficiency, in terms of capital efficiency, in terms of NIM. So let me give you an example on cost efficiency. So the digitization, if you like, of U.S. cards. So as customers interact with us in a retail business, clearly, we want a large portion of that to be digital. In U.S. cards, that's low 90s. If I compare that to either BUK or indeed the German cards business that we've just sold, that was high 90s. So we do feel we've got good opportunities here to continue to streamline the business.",

There's a lot of focus on cards and whether Barclays is the right owner for the asset given the differential in capital loading that you are going to be having at some point. So one of the benefits is that the IB carries less capital because of the stress losses that the card business helps protect the unit from. Can you give us some concrete sense as to how much of a saving that is? I think it's a really important part of the debate, helped not only by what it means for you, but also by the excitement about easier stress tests in the U.S. at some point, we'll see how that goes. Secondly, on Tesco Bank, it came in at about a 90% indicated cost-income ratio. And it looks like from Slide 47, if I'm reading it correctly, it doesn't actually contribute to a lower cost income ratio to the end of '26. Is that right? Or is that part of the efficiency gains? And maybe you could just talk about how much pre-provision profit do you think it can make -- there was a deployment of capital, it felt like a cost takeout story in the beginning. It's no longer that. If you could just talk about how much profit do you think it might generate once you're done? Thank you.",

Obviously, it's under current rules is to look at the CCAR results of the top banks in the U.S. and look both at our initial level of capital, which we keep and look at the drawdown and compare it to banks who don't have that kind of a credit card or a retail consumer portfolio in the mix. Now scenarios vary from year-to-year and so on. So you have to look at it for a few years, but you will get a sense of the benefit.

    "text": "Thanks, Jason. I'll take the second one. So you're right. Tesco has got a high cost income ratio around 90%. And I think that reflects in and of itself, it's lack of scale as a stand-alone business. And so I think our view is as follows. This is -- it actually still is a cost take-out story, but this is a complex integration. It's not like a portfolio and asset runoff. It's a growing business; an active business and credit cards have a daily and digital interaction with the customers. So actually, it's quite a complex piece of work. But we are confident that we can do it, and we can -- we're confident that we can execute it well. But it doesn't happen as quickly as if, for example, we bought a mortgage portfolio. And that's really what you're seeing here. Our expectation that this is RoTE accretive to BUK and indeed, the group hasn't changed. Typically, I would expect the cost income ratio of an unsecured business to be relatively low, certainly lower than BUK as a whole. And if you want a good indication, look at where we're trying to get the USCB business too. So hopefully, that gives you some indication. But you're going to see an increase in '25, both from the operational cost, if you like, that you'll running some investment in integration, you'll start to see some efficiencies flow through in 2026. But as Venkat said, the real scaling and the real unlocking of that value will come somewhat beyond '26. But that's included in all of the targets that we have given you for BUK and for the group.",

And then secondly, just getting back to Tesco Bank. I mean for me, what's more interesting is actually the customers that you gain.

    "text": "Yes. Let me take the first one, and Anna can take the second one. So within fixed income, we've had three focus -- we've had two focus areas. One is securitized products and the other was European rates. And I think it's fair to say securitized products did well through the year. Credit, which has been a historical great strength of ours. It was a smaller part of the overall wallet last year as spreads remained both subdued and tight. And then the third thing is that European rates started picking up only later in the year as did macro overall. So when we look and we give you the market share, there are two ways we look at it. One is the market share number, which we give, which is we take us on the top nine other banks, 10 banks total and look at what our proportion was. And that's always a little bit of noise in it because we are not in commodities. That's part of the number. There are certain regional exposures we don't have, especially in Asia. But the other number which we look at is our penetration of our top 100 clients. So we are #6 markets business and #6 investment bank. So we ask off that top 100, how many of them are we #5 with, right? So one step higher. And in that, that number, which we began at 49 in '23 and want to be at 70 by '26, we've moved from 49 to 56. So I take comfort from looking at that data with those clients in the things we do. But of course, I want to see a broader improvement in fixed income. I'm confident, as I said earlier, because I think this is our strength. And we have strong structural presence and cyclicality when it comes place towards trends will help us.",

    "text": "On Tesco, I think we'd agree with you. It's an exciting opportunity. And I think that comes in a number of parts. When we look at the customers, obviously, with 20 million Clubcard customers, that's broadly the scale that we have in our U.K. retail bank it's inevitable, given the population of the U.K. that there will be some overlap between them. That said, we see the opportunity to build and grow this business. And what's interesting here is our ability to use more than one brand in these markets that we haven't previously done to target different demographics and launch different products. So we're very thoughtful of that. But I'd encourage you to think about Tesco a bit more holistically than just those customers and what we can do with them, because it speaks to a much bigger part of the BUK strategy, which is one, which is more multi-brands, more partnership led. So we talked when we bought Tesco about leveraging the capability that we have from U.S. cards and bringing it to the U.K. you're now seeing that both in terms of Avios and Tesco and Amazon. So more of a partnership focus in the U.K. that really helps us grow and diversify that Cards business, but also more broadly across the bank, we've always operated as a single brand. Now we've got Kensington, now we've got Tesco, et cetera, et cetera. So it's much more holistic. The other thing I would say is that in buying Tesco, we've actually acquired some very good capability that we can take back into the core BUK business. And one of the things I'd really call out there is an open market loans capability that we didn't really have. And actually, Tesco does extremely well. So there are multiple points of leverage here.",

Thank you for splitting out the impact of base rate cuts or moves in the curve more generally, sorry, into swaps and manage margin. The managed margin piece though is extremely small. I mean I think we could work that out from the previous disclosure. Year one at £30 million, I'm assuming that's £20 million of gaping negative. But then we moved to £10 million as a sort of ongoing hit from a 25 basis point rate cut. Why is it so small? And maybe you could tell us what the pass-through assumption is behind that £10 million. That would be question one. Question two, slightly longer-term one for Venkat. Where do you see the return on tangible equity going in this business in the medium term? I know it's in the report in accounts today that the second year on the trough, we've got a 14% RoTE target to hit the top end of your LTIP awards, that's now average across 26, 27. Is that where you sort of see this business potentially going in the medium term? And sorry, a part two to question two, the dividend -- your dividend has been sub-10 for nearly two decades now. The payout ratio on your targets next year is going to be sub 20%. Are we looking at a dramatic increase in the dividend payout ratio into 2027, please? Thank you.",

The impact of a 25 basis point parallel shift in the curve between two imparts, the top is the swap rates for that, I think the impact in structural hedge. That's why it builds over many years. And then the bottom is the base rates. And there, what you have is two impacts. In year one, you have a timing impact. And then on a longer-term basis, you have a pass-through impact, which is what Jonathan is asking about. The reason that the numbers on the bottom there are so small is because of the proportion that we hedge. And actually, if you compare this version to the version that we had earlier in the year, you'll see that our sensitivity has increased. And the reason it's increased is obviously because we've reduced the scale of the hedge as the year has progressed. So that is increasing our relative -- or absolute sensitivity, but we think that we are still relatively insensitive just because of the proportion that we hedge. Now what we don't call out is a pass-through assumption, but I would guide you that by using this assumption and by using the split that we've given you on BUK deposits, so you could probably come up with a reasonable approximation.

So when you look at the business beyond 2026, what I would hope is that if we've got the businesses, the lower returning businesses, such as the investment bank and the U.S. cards business to at 12%. And we maintain the higher return businesses at their roughly 20%-ish range for Barclays U.K. and the corporate banks, a little less private banking. There's a little more. And we continue to grow them, that proportionate mix would have a play into ultimately what the RoTE of the business should be, which I would hope is higher not just because it would allow me to get more of my compensation plan, as you mentioned, but because I think that takes advantage of the full potential of the business. It's a calculation which we will have to come back to because right now, we are focused on 2026, right? But I do think, and I would hope that what we are building is a bank that's much more strongly performing well beyond 2026, that this is not a limit of our ambition.

I think -- I mean, I'll start by just reiterating what Venkat said at the beginning, which is how important we realize shareholder return is and you should just reflect on our capital priorities, which are regulation first, distribution second, investment in our businesses third. The way we think about it and the conversations that we certainly had with our shareholders are really about total return, and that's our current focus. We're pleased to see that total return go up by 5% year-on-year. As you can imagine, we do have conversations with our investors about this, and we're committed to the greater than 10%.

    "text": "Good morning. It's Chris Cant from Autonomous. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple on RWAs, please, and then one on head office. So on Slide 45, you present your RoTE bridge and you gave us the similar slide last year. You've got a 1.3% headwind in there over the two year period from RWA growth, but obviously, some of the regulatory impacts have been pushed back your American Airlines card book is coming out? And essentially, I think you're probably going to undershoot your RWA growth target for U.S. cards. Why hasn't that RWA headwind come down relative to where you were last year? So in the equivalent bridge '24 to '26 a year ago, you said greater than 1% headwind from RWAs, now you're saying less than -- I think it's less than 1.3% if I add those together. So it seems to have gone up despite the fact the RWA growth outlook looks better, what's going on there? Are we missing something? Because the reg headwinds have been pushed further into the future. So it's now a 1.3% reduction here from RWAs in the RoTE bridge. And it was greater than 1% a year ago. So it looks like it's got worse despite the fact the RWA growth should be less. So if you could speak to that and sort of related on the deregulatory point, FRTB, I don't think you've ever given us a number, a lot of your wholesale banking peers in Europe to give us a number now. Obviously, that's an area that may never happen. So if you could give us a sense of that that would be helpful to understand the RWA trajectory. And then the general one is head office. It's been incredibly difficult to model because there's been so much going on. It feels like it's a bit cleaner this year. I think it's a big driver of the range we see in your consensus. Could you give us an indication of what you think that looks like? And I completely appreciate. It's always a mess because there's always odds and sods in there. But putting those to one side, what do you think sort of underlying head office income and costs are to help us corral consensus on to something more sensible? Thank you.",

So I recognize the fact it's been very difficult to interpret and model as we've gone through 2025 -- 2024. I mean you've had German cards coming out well going in and then coming out, same with Italian mortgages. So it has been very complex. I appreciate that. I won't give you a number for going forward, but let me tell you how I think about it. There's going to be a few things which will be stable in during evergreen, at least for the foreseeable future. So within there, you've got the costs that truly relate to the group, and you've got some costs that relate to some legacy treasury funding. For the moment, we also have our merchant acquiring business in there. Those three things are going to be relatively stable throughout the period. Then there are things in there which are inherently more volatile and in part, that's why they're there. So the first of those is hedge accounting. So that's essentially where we're offsetting the fair value of a hedged item with the fair value of the hedge itself. Sometimes they don't entirely offset and where there's leakage, it goes to P&L. Actually, that was quite significant in Q4, and it probably explains the income swing between Q3 and Q4. It's broadly neutral over time. It's just timing, but it can be volatile. The second thing that you do see in there is where we've got any marks on our principal investments. That tends to be a bit smaller. And then the third thing in there will be if we are carrying any litigation or conduct that relates to a business that we are no longer active in. So that's why Meta finances in there. So as this settles down, Chris, we'll talk to you more about it. But at the moment, that's the sort of broad guidance I would give you.",

So to hit the RoTE expectation, which is in line with the group more than 12%, it needs to improve earnings by about 23% without more capital.

    "text": "Yes. And I can answer the second one, if you wish. So on the capital number, so getting to 50% is as we set out last year release. So we expect the IB to be broadly stable. I would say FX is going to move that around, as you've seen from Q2 to Q3 to Q4, but broadly stable around that £200 billion mark. Remember that about 50% to 60% of our IB revenues are in U.S. dollars. So FX does make that number move around. But just to remind you, you then got earnings and RWAs moving together. So even though those RWAs are going up and down with FX, I wouldn't expect that to have an impact on capital generation. So that would be the first piece. In terms of the overall sort of trajectory to 50%, it's holding that piece stable and continuing to grow in those three focused U.K. businesses. I mean you've seen us come out of 2024 with some degree of acceleration, you should expect that to accelerate over the period. So you might see slightly more in '26 than you see in '25. But we will report to you as we have done along the way with the equivalent of Slide 14, so you can see that progression. Why don't I start with some maths and then I'll hand over to Venkat. Just in terms of the IB RoTE, I mean, simplistically, it's gone from 7 to 8.5, it's gone up by 1.5. We recognize the 3.5 at least to go. So we're very conscious of that and that comes in a number of parts. The first is clearly revenue and Venkat talked about having delivered £0.6 billion of our £1.8 billion around our focused businesses. So revenue growth is important here, and we're very focused on the things that we can control, and those areas are focused not only within markets, but the IB. The second is revenue stability. And the reason this is important is we won an IB here, which can deliver in lots of different environments. So we think of financing and we think of the ICB as balanced within our investment banking revenue. So that's also important. If you take those two together, the third thing that's important is capital discipline. So for the third year in a row, we've got broadly flat RWAs in the IB. So we're generating revenue consistently. We're holding that capital flat consistently, and that's why the revenue over RWA has gone up. And then the thing that is most in our control, and I'm talking about it last, but it's not least is costs and cost efficiency. So the IB CIR is down by 3 percentage points year-on-year. It's delivered positive jaws in three quarters out of the last four. It needs to continue to do so. It's not going to do so every quarter, but you'd expect it to do it more often than not because we want to get this business to a high 50s cost income ratio. But even then, even in '26, it's not going to be top quartile. So we'll have more opportunity in terms of efficiency from that point. Venkat?",

But I guess just thinking about the world as it is today versus how it was maybe 12 months ago when you were putting the plan together and the kind of opportunity set that you see, it looks like there's perhaps a bit more opportunity in the U.S. Maybe regulation is a bit slower discussion about growth in the U.K. relative. So I appreciate you're executing against the plan that you've laid out just around 12 months ago. But curious if you were to rethink about or think about where you would position capital, if you're looking at it today, if there are any changes or anything else you would consider or think about? And then secondly, maybe a bit more kind of detail. But I think on the RoTE the group delivered for the year this year, the 10.5%. I think Q3, that was kind of guided to. So I think the environment was a bit better in Q4 from an FX and IB trading standpoint, maybe a slightly bigger gain on Tesco.

We -- there is a lot of opportunity potentially in the U.S. We certainly have it in trading, and we could have it in banking. We've had some through the last year, and it may continue. So two things. First of all, as we've said, we have a fairly big U.S. presence. The firm itself makes about 40% of its revenue in U.S. dollars. The investment banking side makes about two-thirds of its revenue, 68% in the U.S. So we've got a huge presence there. There is enough willingness and capital availability and flexibility within the investment bank and for U.S. cards to be able to deploy it in those attractive opportunities. And in fact, if you take U.S. cards to begin with, we've already said that what American, the nonrenewal out of American. And what it does is that it gives us capital, which we look to employ for higher risk returning businesses and to diversify our portfolio. The similar opportunity exists inside the investment bank, and you've seen it in the deals we've taken in the U.S. as well as the strength of our Equities franchise, which is very heavily U.S.-based as well. So we'll deploy it and we'll adjust.",

There are a number of these things that were certainly better. I'd call out rates, obviously, better than our assumptions. The investment banking wallet was better. We performed well in equities, deposits stabilized faster. So all of those things gave us a tailwind. But we talked about some of the headwinds here, too, some of which were quite evident in the fourth quarter. Venkat talked about FICC. We saw some improvement in Q4, but it's definitely been weaker in the year. And that's important because it's a big business for us. We also saw some unforeseen inflation, not just in the fourth quarter but throughout the year. I'd call out the Bank of England levy in Q1. I'd call out Motor Finance in Q4. And of course, in the fourth quarter, as I said in my remarks, we actively, deliberately took some actions in Q4 to manage within the guidance that we've given you to actually accelerate some of our efficiency plans to really secure those costs in the outer years. So from our perspective, we're encouraged by what we delivered. We're managing actively within the plan to deliver it with no surprises.",

I did want to focus on the area which, as you rightly said, gets quite a lot of attention, which is the U.S. consumer. And thanks for the extra disclosure. I was hoping you could help us think about the book and the strategy as we look forward. So firstly, on the impairment charge, I guess for the quarter, £399 million, the actual write-offs themselves were flattish and sort of in line with the last four quarters. You've taken the PMA and increased the coverage. So could you talk to the drivers of the increase in the reserve bill that goes above and beyond the PMA this quarter, perhaps? And in terms of the growth, as we look forward, the strategy is predicated on very much growth in the business. But I think a lot of people would understand you being a little bit more circumspect if delinquency trends looked like they were deteriorating. So my question really is sort of how wedded are you to growing the book meaningfully as planned and into higher margin, but slightly higher risk segments? And how easy would it be to pause that growth, if you like? Presumably you sort of still feel good in the long term outlook and don't want to exit partnerships. So trying to understand how you weigh up balancing that strategic outlook with the current uncertainty. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Guy. Thank you for the question. So I will take the first one and then I'll pass the second one to Venkat. So as we look at our U.S. consumer business right now, we have given you additional disclosure. I'm glad that's helpful. That's on Page 38. And it's a bit more of a holistic view of what's going on in the U.S. market generally, but also in our book. But really what's happened in Q1 is as a BAU matter, you've got a slight seasonal elevation in the impairment charge. We normally see that in Q1 and it's just reflective of the high levels of consumer spend that we see in Q4 through the holiday season. Typically, what then happens is you start to see that reverse in Q2 and beyond. So far, very straightforward. In terms of the PMA, it's worth stepping back and thinking about what we consider when we book impairment. And we're looking at two things. The first is consumer behavior. And the second is what we expect to happen in the macroeconomic environment. On the first, in consumer behavior, we see no change. And you can see that clearly on the charts. Delinquencies are relatively low and stable. Actually, we see no change on the second. So U.S. economic consensus forecasts are actually relatively static and that they're very similar to where they were at the full year. But we think that's likely a timing issue. And therefore, it's reasonable for us to assume that they will change in the coming weeks and months. And therefore, we're trying to get ahead of that. So we're being thoughtful and methodical. So what we've done is essentially skew the downside bias in the impairment charge to accelerate a bit of coverage here. But just as we step back, the performance of the book itself is extremely robust. Venkat?",

And I look at the risk or we look at the risk of this portfolio in four dimensions. The first dimension is who is the partner and what business they are in and so on. The second is related to that, what's the industry? We've had a bias towards travel and we've been looking to diversify out of travel. We added GAAP, we added General Motors, and we chose not to renew Americans or our share of Americans. The third is the size and renewal rate. So we like to have a mix that is relatively smaller to our overall portfolio and not a lot of renewals coming in at the same time. And the last one is the actual underlying credit card, creditworthiness of the borrower. And through this combination, we like to create a business with a stable risk and high risk adjusted return. So when you take all of this together, we are continuing to want to grow this business. We do think the opportunities are great. Obviously, we will factor in the consumer environment when we do the actual risk selection of customers and look to get risk adjusted returns. And that risk selection is who do you open an account for and how do you manage credit lines. But we will continue to seek good partners that diversify our book and bring us opportunity.",

So on SRT, the DCFO letter that we and others received recently did deal with SRT, but it was actually more focused on the financing of SRT. And to be really clear, we do not finance our own SRT programs. So we're not extending financing to investors who are then ongoing investors in our SRT. So we think that's the focus. From our perspective, we've run our Colonnade program since 2016. We share the details of each tranche of that with the regulator in order to get capital relief and we manage the reinvestment risk around that very, very carefully, as we've, you know, outlined before.

So while I agree with what others say that there is friction in the system, there was obviously a high cost to set up the ring fence. Let's call it a sunk cost now. And there's a little bit of trapped capital and liquidity. And if you release that in the short term, it would be good for banks. And let's argue for some customers. But I think in the long term, it weakens the system because it weakens deposit protection. I think the ring fence is an extremely strong and secure form of deposit protection in the UK. And while it might be short term attractive, I think in the long term, it weakens the system and weakens the participants in the system. And that includes Barclays. That's why on balance, I do not think we should change the ring fence regime. And I'm a strong supporter of it in its current form.",

First on RWA, how should we think about RWA developments into 2Qs, specifically thinking about market risk here, given the volatility? Obviously, 1Q was a somewhat unusual quarter where IB RWAs were down on a constant FX basis, didn't seem to demonstrate the usual seasonality. So any color you could give us on how to think about Q-on-Q RWA developments into 2Q for the IB would be helpful, please. And as I think out to sort of targets, the 2026 targets that you've given us previously, and the circa £50 billion of RWA growth you expected by the end of 2026, obviously Basel 3 is being delayed, Card IRB transition, I guess, is probably going to be a '27 event. I know you've said it's sort of ambiguous, but that's not necessarily going to hit you. With the weaker dollar, I guess that's also going to reduce the RWA growth. How should we be thinking now about where you expect to land in 2026 for group RWAs relative to that previous £50 billion growth expectation? I also just wanted to add one on the U.S. So thank you again for reconfirming the FX splits for group and IB income and costs. I think that's helpful for us in thinking about the weaker dollar. But in the event that the U.S. administration applied some Section 899 taxes to UK companies, for instance, due to digital service tax proposals, how would we be best thinking about the possible impact of that for Barclays? Would it simply be a case of taking the country by country disclosures you give us and multiplying that percentage of PBT by the relevant incremental tax top up? Or is there something more nuanced we need to do in terms of subsidiary financials and that sort of thing? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Chris. I think there were at least three questions there, so I will attempt to deal with them in order. So on the IB RWAs, we remain fairly clear that the business should operate within the third circa £200 billion of RWAs that we've allocated to it. And you can see us doing that very, very consistently actually since '23. So we were doing it for some time before we even did the investor update. This period is no different really. And you can see that nimbleness in RWA deployment in the first quarter. So if you look in the disclosures, you'll see that credit risk RWAs are down, market risk RWAs are up, and counterparty credit risk RWAs are up. So our intention is to manage it nimbly within the framework that we have given them. And sort of to your second part of the question, which is really around the RWA shape from here. The way we think about it, Chris, is that there is some uncertainty around the timing and the quantum of the regulatory impact. And we've given you our best view that may happen at the beginning of '27, as opposed to the end of '26. But we don't feel that it undermines the fundamental objective of the plan. And the fundamental objective of the plan is to hold our RWAs and the IB broadly flat, as I said, and to deploy RWA growth into our highest returning UK businesses. And that part of the plan, which is, if you like, is the most strategic part, remains intact. I think as the regulatory environment becomes clearer and those timings become clearer, we can give you sort of exact splits and impacts of that. And then on the final part of your question. So what would a U.S. tax change mean for Barclays? Well, there are obviously short term and long term differences. So in the short term, what we would see for a rise in U.S. tax rates, for example, would be an increase in deferred tax assets. So you'd see a short term boost to capital and then obviously you'd have a longer term drag from any higher rate. It's a bit too early to give you precise guidance. We're expecting an initial U.S. tax bill in Q2. And some of the discussion that's happened around higher rates for non-U.S. firms, I mean, clearly hasn't been confirmed or firmed up into any kind of regulation yet. And I just remind you that the IHC is actually a U.S. firm. BB PLC branch isn't. So there is some nuances. You're exactly right within this that we'd have to guide to nearer the time. So I think it's not quite as simple as looking at the country by country reporting, unfortunately. Okay, thank you. Perhaps we can go to the next question, please.",

Or is it just a case of just not changing it at this point? Or a bit more risk on that USCB part of the business? So number one, just curious why the 11% hasn't changed. As well. And then secondly, in terms of the hedge benefit beyond 2026, I think you're commenting, obviously, that it remains quite a strong tailwind. So just wanted to double check the kind of roll-off yield that you're anticipating, say, in 2027. We have about 2.5%.

So we've got good operating leverage and we're pleased with that performance. But it's only the first quarter of the year. So all we've done is we've repeated our circa 11% guidance and I'm not signaling anything by repeating that guidance, whether that be in income costs or impairments. So I'm merely repeating it. On the second question around the hedge benefit, we have said today that we expect the hedge momentum to continue beyond 2026. Why have we said that? Well, if I take you back to deposits and the stability of deposits, what that means now is that we expect the hedge notion to be broadly stable from here. And that actually takes one of the variables off the table. So all we're doing now is we are comparing, if you like, the prevailing swap with the yield on the hedge, whether that be the average yield or indeed the maturing yield. We haven't given any disclosure on maturing yield beyond 2026. But I think if you do this simple math, which I know many of you have done, and just take our planning assumption of 3.5 and push that through the maturing elements of '25 and '26, you will find that the average hedge yield in 2027 is below 3.5% so that's really what we are signaling here and obviously as we get closer we'll talk a bit more about maturing yields but just a bit too far out for that. Hopefully that's helpful. Okay thank you. Can we go to the next question please?",

So on the U.S. cards portfolio, the growth is going to come in net receivables from three things. One is organic growth in our existing portfolio. The second is how we choose to flex the lever that we have used of risk transfers. We can do more or less and if we do less the receivables are up there on our book. And then the third thing is portfolio changes which is new accounts or accounts leaving. So on the first one which is organic growth we're fairly comfortable that we continue to see organic growth and we have a very high credit quality portfolio. We're looking to diversify it among certain sectors but it's a high credit quality portfolio. On the second one which is risk transfer there's always a question at the time of what capital benefit we get, what's the price at which we sell it and whether it suits our risk management. As you say given that we've chosen not to bid for our portion for a renewal of our portion of American all else equal we would want to keep things on our balance sheet. Third is acquisitions or the other disposals. We've renewed a bunch of our other accounts through 2024. I think we've mentioned that in our previous full year earnings. And then we continue to look in this environment even in this environment especially in this environment at good quality portfolios that we think rounds out our business. These things are very long term decisions. A typical portfolio takes two to three years to decide to bid and to come to you and then it's there with you for hopefully seven years.

    "text": "Thanks Venkat. Alvara the only thing I'd add to that is that achieving the plan and the returns that we want in USCB is not just only volume either. We're working very hard on margins. We're working very hard on cost and digitization of the business and also the capital efficiency as Venkat said. So a plan of many parts. Let me talk about the IB sort of generally in the quarter and then I'll pass across to Venkat who might want to add at the end. If you think about what should have happened to our IB in the quarter given the volatility that we've seen, we should see strong markets revenues in the more subdued banking environment and that's exactly you know the shape of our results very much in line with the market more broadly. As I look at Q1 in particular we've been investing in this business for some time and investing to create a franchise that allows us to perform in a range of environments and you see that. So the FICC results very strong and I think that reflects our investment in securitized products. It reflects our investments in our rates businesses and equities is strong. Actually you'll recall there was a one-off last year but you know our equities position has been very much driven by the investments that we've made in equity derivatives. So we feel like we're facing the market with a much more complete franchise and of course our financing business adds stability and is probably less impacted by volatility but you can see good growth in there that's obviously also underpinning FICC and equities. I said we would have expected the IB to be a bit softer and of course or investment banking to be a bit softer in Q1 and of course it has been we feel that in line with the street and in fact we've seen share gains across advisory ECM DCM and for the complex overall albeit in a smaller market and I just remind you that that our planning assumption was for this market to be 10% down year on year and that's broadly what we see in Q1. All of this has been underpinned by us being a bit more nimble in RWAs in the IB as I've said but we're really focused all the way through the P&L and the performance of the IB so you see good cost control and you'll also see very, very good risk control. We've disclosed today for the first time consistently both our bar progression and indeed our lost days and you can see we're not taking outsized risk. I should have actually mentioned also a very good performance within the ICB, the International Corporate Bank within banking so financing and the ICB are both less sort of impacted by volatility. Venkat do you want to comment?",

    "text": "Okay, thanks. Thanks Chris. Thanks for the questions. I'll take the first one and then I'll hand across to Venkat. As I said, that was our assumption for banking and actually what we're seeing here is the diversification of income working really well across the bank both in terms of more than offset by markets activity and also the strength that we're seeing coming through in the UK and the UK complex more generally across deposits that's underpinned our upgrade today. So, you know, the revenue line appears to be very robust and we have confidence in it. That said, that does not undermine our focus on costs. You know, it's what we're doing every day. It's a key part of the strategy. You can see that all the way through the P&L today, income up by 11%, profits up by 19%. The plan is to create operating leverage, not just at the group, but across every single business within the group. Overall, I still expect what I expected at the year end, which is for incremental investment to underpin the longer term growth of the plan and investment -- I'm sorry, inflation to outweigh our gross efficiencies for the year and for us to see an uptick in costs. All of that is contained within the most important cost metric, which is cost income ratio at 61%. That is the number that we are most focused on. It's likely that we'll see some movement in absolute cost. I'm happy with consensus as it currently starts, but it is FX sensitive and it is performance and volume sensitive. And therefore, I'd really urge you to focus on the cost income ratio target that we've given. We feel like 57% in Q1 is a good down payment against that and should show you how focused we are on operating leverage. Venkat, transaction banking?",

    "text": "So, transaction banking has been an area of great emphasis for us in the last few years. We spoke about it last year, we've spoken about it at our year-end earnings. People choose us and the quantum of deposits is based on two factors. One is the growth in our overall transaction banking business or relationships generally, people's choice of us as a counterparty, which is increasing. And then ultimately, their needs for cash and their use of cash. In this period, we continue to see happily people choosing us as a counterparty newly, and that's good. And that's improving again. And then I think on cash, what you're seeing is growth in deposits, in part, what you would expect when people are being cautious on the deploying of cash for transactions. So, you're seeing deposit growth whether it's individuals or it's institutions. It's all what you would normally expect in this environment.",

    "text": "Hello. Hi, Anna. So, just a couple of questions. One, just quickly touching on the U.S. card margin. So, obviously, that's been down. But you've talked about some of the drivers, some of the time lags between deposit pricing and asset pricing. And I know you've mentioned that the interest rate risk is already hedged. But I guess the market is pricing in faster and more rate cuts on the U.S. side for the rest of the year, maybe three or four rate cuts. So, if that were to happen, I guess, is it already in your planning assumption? And if that were to happen, would you still expect the meaningful progression during 2025, as you've just talked about? So, I guess that's number one. Number two, I guess, more broadly on the full year '26, greater than 12% returns target. So, consensus has just got to about 12% taken a year to get there. I guess the operating environment is arguably a little bit more challenging. Certainly, impairment looks like it is possible that it will go up given economic indicators coming down maybe a little bit. And I suppose in general, U.S. dollar weakening is probably not super helpful either. So, where do you see a gap between your planning assumption and where consensus is? Because you've reiterated guidance. So, presumably, that you see maybe some positive to where consensus is currently, notwithstanding maybe a little bit of worsening in credit quality and maybe some FX impact as well. So, just it would be helpful to understand where you think people might be too pessimistic.",

    "text": "Okay. Thank you, Perlie. So, let me deal with the U.S. cards margin first. We've given you our macroeconomic variable assumptions. I think they're on Slide 35. So, you can have a look at those. Obviously, we are expecting further downward pressure on Fed rates. You can see that from there. What I would just remind you, though, is that that matter is hedged. So, we've got floating rate assets. We've got largely fixed rate deposits. So, you can see that we would have a timing difference in a downward rate environment. We do hedge that interest rate risk. But the nature of those hedges is different from the ones that we have in the UK. And therefore, the accounting geography is different. So, you do see an income offset, but it manifests itself on non-interest income. So, if you look year on year, you're going to see non-interest income. So, I'm not concerned about the income overall, but you might see a bit of a split geography between the margin compression and the hedge benefit, which obviously you wouldn't see in the UK. And then, if I step back and look at FY '26, we've reiterated and reaffirmed our targets today. We feel like we've got momentum in the business and we are delivering our plan. What you should expect us to do is execute the operational plan and deliver the numbers with no surprises. And that's no different in the current environment than it is last year or the year before. So, we're 100% focused on that. We've clearly got good income growth that comes from the diversification of the business. There's clearly a bit of a weak spot in investment banking, but markets, as Venkat's been through, benefits from periods of volatility. And very importantly, we are seeing a strong underpin here from the upgrade of NII that we've given you, not just for BUK, but for the group as a whole. And that's coming from the strength of deposits in the UK. Our costs are well controlled. Again, you can see we're focused on operating leverage. And whilst there's more uncertainty in the impairment line, I would not see that uncertainty taking us out with the 50 to 60 basis point range that we've given you for loan loss rate. So, we are confident in the delivery of our circa 11 this year and also the targets that we've given you for next year. And that's the case for the financial targets and the distribution targets. Okay, perhaps we can go to the next question, please.",

You know, I've called out rates, I've called out securitized products. There are no one-offs in there. And so, you know, where we take remarks on lead-thin positions, they are not in FICC. They are on our corporate lending line. And we've called that out separately. So, I wouldn't call out any one-offs. So, it's a good performance. On mortgages, you know, the mortgage market was robust in Q1. As a market matter, approvals were up by 15%. Notably, within that, house purchases up by 20%. And that's not just house purchase, but first-time buyers as well. We think both of those two are really good lead indicators. Sorry, my voice is going. Let me take a drink of water. They're good indicators for the health of the mortgage market overall. If you step back, you've got rates that are broadly on the downward trend. You've got robust and stable house price inflation, and you've got real wage growth. So, there may be a bit of pull forward in Q1, but honestly, the market as a whole is performing well. Okay.

    "text": "Good morning, everybody. Thanks very much. Yes, I just have two questions. Number one, UK fees look very weak. They're down about 9% year on year, and they're certainly annualizing at no more than about a £1 billion, I guess, that's in the UK business. So, could you tell us a little bit about what's going on there and how we should expect that going forward? Is the sort of 250 like the run rate we should be thinking about, or is there something that was in there that means it might pick up as the rest of the year progresses? So, I guess that's my first question. The second question is just coming back to risk-weighted assets, because you talked about how IB was broadly performing as you might expect in terms of trends in the first quarter. I would agree with that completely, except for risk-weighted assets, which have always been up very strongly in the first quarter. With all the volatility, you would have expected them to be up even more, I guess, or I might have done. And yet, they were down and down, down quite, and I know there's an effect in there, but even if you strip all that out, I think they were flat to down. So, could you just tell us a little bit more about why that was, and is there potential to further reduce that going forward? And can I ask you, you might have told us this, so I apologize if I missed it, but I think you told us in one of the backslides, you said you've done £57 billion, I think, of risk transfers at full year '24. Could you update us where we are on that? Is that where that number is now? Is some of this about increasing risk transfers, et cetera, and how that might progress? Thanks very much.",

There is no story within the Q1 beyond the fact that Q1 can sometimes be a bit light just because of lower transactional activity, and honestly, there's nothing more in there to read into. So, I'd stick to the guidance of greater than 250. On RWAs, you're right, there's a bit of FX in there that's taking it downwards. We haven't elevated the SRT.

You came into this year at 13.6% equity Tier 1 ratio, 13.3% adjusting for the buyback. It does sound increasingly like you want to operate close to the 14% moving forwards. Can I just confirm that that is how we should be thinking about it? I'm just wondering whether there's an element of this relating to the fact that UK RWA growth, your target for end of next year, looks increasingly stretching and maybe, you know, you're thinking about some sort of inorganic bolt-on, which obviously would consume some capital in a one-off sense there. So that's the first question. The second question is on sensitivity again, particularly in the U.S. card book. If I look at your full year downside scenarios, even on downside two, which has got GDP falling over one percentage point this year and next year, unemployment moving to above 7%, the models are telling you that your required stage 1 and 2 ECL build would only be about £177 million, which feels very low given that set of macroeconomic assumptions. I mean, I guess the models are, you know, telling us what the models are telling us, but how robust do you think the models are? I guess in the COVID, IFRS 9 was quite news, a bit wet behind the ears. We're seven to eight years in now and this obviously applies across the group as well because the sensitivity to downside one and two scenarios is very limited given the severity of those.

You're right, we're generating a lot of capital, but as I said previously, that is an outcome of the plan and it is intentional, it is deliberate and it's what you should expect going forward. We did indicate at the full year that you should expect us to operate towards the top half and, you know, I'll just reiterate that as our formal guidance, but just reflecting on the fact that we are generating a lot of capital. Just on the utilization of that capital, you know, we're very focused on deploying £30 billion in the UK, that plan is intact. As I look at where we are now, we've deployed £14 billion of that, recognizing, of course, that a large part of that has come from Tesco, but you can see good loan growth in the quarter, both from the UK and from the UK corporate bank. If I look at the specifics of lending, you know, the consumer preference at the moment is for secured versus unsecured lending. That's very clear, that's okay, and then as I look at the lending as it's developing in the corporate bank and private banking and wealth management, actually it's very high quality and that's reflective of our portfolios. So, key one, you know, if I look at that in isolation, the lending's happening, maybe the RWA waiting is a little light, but over the period of the plan, that plan is intact and I particularly point you to the momentum that we've got both around mortgages and cars on the leading indicators on slide 15. We're going through that J-curve in cards, you're going to see interest earning lending and RWAs growing cards from the back end of '25 with all of that maturing through.

    "text": "Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quickies for me. I think you kind of touched on this a little bit, Anna, in your last answer, but the Barclay card Consumer UK revenue line doesn't really seem to have made a great deal of progress over the last 12 months, despite the kind of the big pickup in card acquisition numbers. Is that just a kind of lead lag effect? Does it kind of take 12 months for the revenues to come through? Or is there some other kind of trend in there when you might expect to see kind of proper revenue growth in that line? And then the second question is more of clarification. I think slide 8 talks about a 90% reinvestment rate on the structural hedge. But I think you mentioned earlier that you expect the structural hedge to be stable. Is that 90% unstable? Is that just kind of a very broad definition of stable? Or how should we read that?",

    "text": "Okay. Thank you, Robin. Let me deal with those. So on the Barclaycard line, I mean, we step back into the credit card market in 2023. So all you are seeing here really is a production line of those cards acquisitions, then maturing into interest earning lending. Actually, if you think about the structure of the market, it tends to be slightly longer dated than 12 months. So you're going to see some pickup in interest earning lending towards the back end of 2025. But the bulk of this is actually going to be in 2026. So it is a lead lag effect, as you suggest. And then on the second question, we've given you a planning assumption of circa 90%. But you can see, given where deposits have been in the first quarter that the notion has been stable. And we would expect it to be broadly stable. But just for your planning math, that's why we've said circa 90%. Nothing more to read into it than that. Okay, so I think that brings us to the end of questions for today. And I'd like to thank you for those questions. Thank you for your continued interest in Barclays in what I know is a very busy day. And we will see you either on the road or at the Analyst Breakfast in a couple of weeks.",

I've got two questions, one, about the capital walk kind of this year, in 2020, and one about kind of your thoughts about the reserve build, and I do appreciate there is a lot of uncertainty in both. So, let's start with the capital conversation. You've implied to us that you think that you're going to end 2020 or kind of throughout with a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. Could you help us kind of run through the components of the move from the current 12.1% to the 11.5%? You've given us some. Of course, we've got still the CHF9 billion of the regulatory inflation to come through in the remaining three quarters, you've kind of given us a little bit of a view on the market risk-weighted assets, i.e., your expectations that they're going to come down with volatility. But how do you see the credit side of the equation, and also the operational side of the equation on the risk-weighted assets, as you have got a little bit of a relief on the model in the 1Q from that side as well? Just to kind of give us a sense of the moving parts on the risk-weighted asset side as you see it.",

    "text": "Magdalena, very good to speak to you. Thank you very much for the question. It seems a long time since March 18 and I'm very glad that I'm not on video today, so you can't see my haircut, or lack of haircut should we say. Look, I think we wanted to be as clear and transparent as possible. I think if we looked at the CET1 ratio that we reported for the end of the first quarter of 12.1%, I mean, it was similar to what we guided to back on the 13th of February when we did our end, year-end numbers, but obviously the components were notably different, because rather than CHF12 billion of SA-CCR and related impact, we only had CHF3 billion and yet you end up with the same number. And that does give you an idea of the inflation or the increase in RWA that we have seen from the volatility in March and how that actually flows through into some of our bar numbers. The adverse CVA migrations you're actually seeing, and clearly, the drawdown on the corporate loan book, which actually does increase both RWA and result in a CECL provision in respect to that. Reality is most of the RWA increase was actually due to that measure. There wasn't a great deal of discretionary business increases in the RWA. It was due to the market impact. And I mean, let's be clear. I mean, I think you've seen very similar drops amongst the U.S. banks last week, and I'm not particularly surprised. I think looking forward to the second quarter, I think it's worth remembering, as you know, as Mel and I do, that a lot of these metrics and changes are only actually averaged in during the whole of the quarter. So you've only seen some of the impact of that volatility within the RWA numbers you see now. And I would expect to see a significant increase in both CVA and market risk-related RWA as that actually flows through the time series. I think drawdowns have pretty much come to a halt in the last week or so. But I think we are going to see migration impacts as credit ratings and rating agencies catch up with the events of the last month and start to make estimates of what we're going to see, economic-wise, over the next quarter or so. So I think I have to warn you, I think we will see an increase in credit-related RWA as a consequence of that. And then, obviously, you have the mathematical consequence of CHF3 billion of SA-CCR related. But essentially, that would obviously take you down from 12.1 down to about 11.9, 12.0. So the rest, as you might say is an estimate, which I think will be partly offset by our own actions to actually reduce that of that inflation in the first quarter. So I mean, I just would caution. Generally, in the past, we've been very precise around CET1 numbers. I think due given the level of volatility around this process at this point, I think when I said around, I meant around. And I think when I spoke at your conference, Magdalena, I said around 12%, I do mean around in that sense. I think there's a degree of unpredictability here. And I think quite clearly as well, we also do respect, and it's very important to us that we look after our clients at this moment, and that's obviously led to some RWA increases in the first quarter. So we will see some consequence, and that's another factor as to thinking. So I think around 11.5% is my broad guidance, basically. And I would probably expect us to be at around 11.5% by the end of the second quarter because by that point, you should see it fully phased in.",

    "text": "Okay. Yes, it's been a complex month, shall we say. There's one point I just want to make clear to, Magdalena, and I think I did refer to this middle of last year at some point, which is the capital deductions under the IRB approach for credit losses actually exceeds the CECL effect. So therefore, the increase in CECL reserves that we took at the end of the first quarter, and indeed, the transition at the end -- the 1st of January did not have any meaningful CET1 deduction effect. And that will be the case, provided any further CECL increases that we see in the balance of this year and second quarter, I think, is obviously the focus, do not exceed the IRB allowance. And that's got to be a little more helpful. There's a couple of hundred million left before the CECL numbers would actually exceed IRB, plus/minus. So that might be helpful to you, Magdalena. If you're thinking about CECL, which to me reminds me of an old-fashioned general provision, it isn't. It's a completely different accounting concept, but perhaps I'm feeling my age. Obviously, PCL is more specific because that doesn't fall into that. So the PCL component, to the extent we see an increase in specific provisions in the second quarter as we see how this -- the economic effects of COVID-19 pans out, would be capital relevant. The CECL would not be provided. It doesn't exceed more than a couple of hundred million, at which point we would actually exceed the IRB calculation and then move forward. So I hope that's helpful, Magdalena.",

And then, secondly, on the mid-March, 19th of March, I think you -- I mean, you gave us very helpful numbers and you talked about the first 2 months. If I now look at the PBT of CHF1.2 billion, strip out all funds, pretax profit was probably just around above CHF900 million. So how can I just link today's numbers with what you said back then? I guess, the big explanation is some of these risk costs and mark-to-market moves. But if I strip that out, was March still loss making? Or what was sort of the picture in March? And then very lastly, more a strategy question on the IB. I mean, assuming the world remains a challenging and somewhat volatile place, how you think about your IB franchises in that context and in terms of resourcing, head count, balance sheet usage. I mean, it's obvious that it produces some volatility in the results. I mean, obviously, the environment is extreme, but how you think about it as being part of your overall portfolio that's -- what's the positioning in there? And just very lastly, sorry, the CVA/DVA on credit, I mean, I see the CHF78 million benefit in the comp line on Slide 46. But can you tell us what the impact was on the revenue side?",

    "text": "Okay. I will take the first and the third question, and maybe, David, you can take the second and the fourth question. So starting with RoTE, it's clear that this quarter's 13.1% benefited from a very low, actually negative tax rate. But as we said, if you adjust it to our new guidance, it's still 9% to 9.5%. But also, if you take a bigger picture and if I refer you to Page 35, actually, if you look over the last four quarters and you take the average, we're actually at or above the 10% and we had very high tax rates in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. So I think on average it's now over those four quarters, 18%, which is not significantly below our guidance. So I think we have proven actually over the last four quarters, that we have a franchise that can deliver something around 10%, and it's gotten very clear to me, that continues to be our target, at least in the midterm. But it's also clear that in the short term. Over the next, you know, two, three quarters with COVID-19 and the impact of it, the RoTE is going to be challenged, but it's still clearly our goal to be at or above 10%, because that's where we think in a normalized world, the cost of equity is of our business and we want to earn in excess of that. Maybe I will hand over to David for the risk cost, then I will take IB franchise question and then the fourth question around on credit, back to David.",

    "text": "I'm not going to give you an exact number for March, but perhaps putting myself in your shoes, perhaps, the way I think about this is, obviously Thomas and I said on 18th March, that our profit for the end of February exceeded the CHF106.2 million that we made in the whole of the first quarter 2019. So just setting that as a minimum basically, you take the CHF106.2 million, you drop out, as a starting point, you take our number of CHF102.1 million, and you deduct CHF268 million, you'd end up with a number ex invest lab of CHF933 million. So at the limit and obviously there was a degree of comfort, and what we said on March 18, you'd be talking about a loss between CHF106.2 million to CHF933 million, which I think is CHF129 million. Now so, if we then look at the various provisions we actually took, you really have got the mark to market move in the leverage finance book, which was CHF284 million that was taken entirely in March. If you look at the APAC CHF160 million, that was taken partially, perhaps mostly in March. And if you look at the CECL adjustments, the add-on to day two to component which we had given before, that was taken, over CHF300 million, that was actually taken almost entirely in March as well. So I think you can see pre the reserve build, March would have been very substantially profitable, even allowing for, I have not told you, which is the degree of buffer that Thomas and I had, when we actually made our statement on the 18th. Is that helpful, Daniele?",

    "text": "Okay, Daniel. So as we come to your question on Investment Banking, the way I look at our Investment Banking franchise globally, we obviously have sales and trading in global markets, but we also have sales and trading in APAC markets. And in addition to that, in IBCM, you have to really look at our investment banking capabilities also within APAC, Wealth Management and Connected, as well as in the SUB, Swiss Universal Bank. And if you look at page 13, you can actually see that we have had a very positive trend, both in fixed income sales and trading and equity sales and trading, which on this page actually includes APAC market. And if you look at advisory and underwriting, excluding mark-to-market losses, we are actually also on a positive trend. So just because we have some mark-to-market losses in our lev fin book doesn't really change my view on that. And quite the opposite, if you look at the composition of our advisory and underwriting fees, revenues actually in the first quarter, we have been up compared to the first quarter '19 in each of debt capital markets, equity capital markets, M&A and fixed income derivatives and, so that's the first point. The second point I want to make, I'm convinced that our strength of ultra high net worth clients and family offices can only be further strengthened, if we continue to provide Investment Banking type of additional services beyond what pure play private banks can offer, be it in the sales and trading environment, be it through advice related to M&A, IPOs or otherwise. So my conviction very much is that the differentiating factor from Credit Suisse to other private banks, is that we can actually offer these services. I hope that answers the question?",

    "text": "Final question was actually on CVA and DVA basically, I think that was your fourth question. I don't have a complete answer to that question, but perhaps we should just look briefly at page 36 of the earnings release, which does give you some useful disclosure around the corporate center. So I think, if we actually look there, you can see that we saw losses of CHF279 million with respect to owned credit spread moves in the corporate centers. So that was there. But I think you should also know just clearly, is that this was largely offset by other gains that we actually saw in the period. So I don't think you should be working around adding that back in. You can see we had CHF179 million of fair value money market instrument gains. We had CHF94 million relating to the fair value option volatility on own debt. So I wouldn't encourage you to add that back, but I don't know if you'd seen that, but that is useful disclosure. And just to clear up any other points, that is not related to the issue around structured notes which I discussed at length in previous quarters. Actually the hedge on the accretive portion, the structured notes actually worked almost perfectly in the first quarter, and there was almost nil impact from that at this point, and we've also extinguish part of that portfolio, in what was obviously a fairly extreme interest rate move basically. So it's something quite separate. So I think that's, probably strictly speaking, most of the answer to your question, Daniele, basically, but please don't go back adding things up in that sense. I think there is gains and there is losses in this whole thing. And you're right, there is the DVA gain of CHF78 million relating to the credit spread widening on the compensation instruments, to which we award employees and I would expect that to reverse clearly in the course of 2020, as our credit spread narrows.",

So then if you could just elaborate on any thoughts there on the impact in 2Q based on movements to date. Second part would be with regard to the asset management loss on seed money, CHF101 million a quarter, and you said there's a risk of further losses here in your outlook statement. Is there any way you can help us frame the magnitude, the potential impact there? So how much of your AUM is seed money? How much investment is there in place? And then, finally, on global markets in the revenues and the other items, there's a loss on a single name counterparty. Can you just elaborate on exactly what that relates to? Is it acting as a clearing member? Or is that a credit exposure that you book through there? Just we can get a feel for whether that's potentially recurring as well.",

    "text": "Thank you very much, Andrew. So let's just take those 3 questions in turn. So if we look at, I mean, probably Page 23 as the use was anything else as an aide-mémoire for this, you have CHF284 million of leveraged finance mark-to-market losses and you have CHF160 million relating to the AFG financing group. I think if you look at our slide deck, I think in the first page, I believe it was in the appendix, I actually also included the leveraged finance exposure numbers, which I think we did give at the MS conference last month. But just to give you an idea, essentially, oil and gas exposure, there was CHF9.1 billion in the fourth quarter of '15, CHF7.7 billion now, of which CHF2.9 million is non-investment grade, which I think is the most important component. Leverage finance exposure was CHF11.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter '15, down to CHF7.3 billion. So that gives some degree of background around this. I think if we just go back to Page 23, again, basically, let me just talk around those different components. Firstly, the leveraged finance mark-to-market, these are underwriting commitments that we had coming in during the quarter. Now, these are fair value elected. So even though these deals have not yet financed in large part, I would caution, we have to estimate at the end of March what the market would have been, had they been financed at the end of March on a probability-based metric. And essentially, as the widening of high-yield credit spreads in the course of March had actually gone through flex and through the margin, you actually end up with a potential loss in respect to those underwriting commitments. Now obviously, as you rightly say, since the end of the March, you've seen significant normalization on those spreads. And the Federal Reserve Bank, as you know, has actually been buying some of these assets, which has clearly contributed to that narrowing. So yes, there is clearly potential for that. These are unrealized losses. But I think just a word of caution, I think these deals are not yet closed. So they will close at some point in the next few months. So it will depend on what the credit spreads are at that point. And I think if markets continue to normalize, then you would expect to see recovery, at least in part of that MTM number. And if they weren't, then you wouldn't, basically, Andrew. And I think it's a little bit dangerous to make forward-looking comments in the slightly stressed environment that we still see. I'm just obviously just looking at what happened in the WTI market over the course of the last 72 hours. Actually, APAC mark-to-market is actually almost simpler. We have a CHF4 billion portfolio of fair value elected financing positions there. Most of those have been marked to proxies, emerging market loans. Those are often very liquid and somewhat distressed markets, but we mark against those. It's not that we've actually seen defaults against them, it's just essentially you see a mark-to-market effect. So you would expect to see that normalize again, clearly subject to how these markets evolve and develop over the course of the next six months. And that's why I thought I want to be super clear about breaking that number out. So hopefully, that answers those two points in terms of that component, the reserve build. I think on the asset management point I made before, there's about CHF100 million of impairments, of which around two third relates either to seed money or to joint ventures with partners. As you know, our asset management business, really oversimplifying a bit, consists of an equity and a long fixed income and a real estate business closely associated with our wealth management business, particularly here in Switzerland, and then the alternatives business in the United States. So this really relates to the seed money in the alternatives business. And that -- it was in respect of that, about two third was due to that. And just to be clear, just to be transparent, the other one third was in respect to the 5% retention in CLOs you have to hold under European rules, not U.S. rules, which we also mark. So those are those two components. I mean, I think we've just been cautious. In terms of investments that asset management has, it's around about CHF2.4 billion, of which half is in external asset management’s and about half basically is in these types of seed money investments. I think we'll need to see how these investments perform in the balance of the second quarter. But I think it was worth being explicit because I think it's important to be transparent about these things that this is obviously a risk for the second quarter. Final point then in terms of the GM other revenue number, there's not much I'm going to add. I mean, essentially, the increase in the other revenue loss between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, as I've said, is in respect of a single counterparty, and it's clearly not something I've included in the reserve build. So that says something as well to you. But it was a single counterparty. And obviously, it was a distressed position, and we've marked it appropriately.",

So that's what's actually driving it, in terms of the numbers. So you see a gain, but the second phase actually results in that intangible been deducted from CET1. I think the second question I'd say straightforward. I don't think there's any particularly material overlap, actually probably no overlap between the leverage finance and the oil and gas exposure. So two separate numbers. Although it's a very good question, Stefan, but there isn't any. In terms of FVA or we tend to call it XVA because the number of different derivative adjustments. I think you note, you should know obviously, that we did disclose, I think it was only IBCM page. So let me just get you that page number. I think it's actually on page 30, that we take net losses of CHF51 million for hedges on uncollateralized corporate derivative exposure. That is, I think, we'd call an XVA loss, because it relates to the derivative, the funding components of this. That is the largest component. There is also a smaller component I think within the APAC business, but, that's where it is. I'm afraid, I don't have the APAC number to mind, I'm afraid, but it was I think slightly less than the IBCM one.",

    "text": "I had some problems with the line before. So good morning from my side as well. Well done on the results, particularly in the Investment Bank. I have three questions please. So the first two are just sort of technical nature. The first question is on collateral management and your lombard loan book. David, can you please give us a sense what the change of total lombard loans and for the Group outstanding was during the first quarter of the year? And just to confirm, right, so if there is a recall of some of the lombard loans that comes toward the net new money outflow, if I'm not mistaken? And the second question I have on levered loans. So can you maybe just have the question, if I may ask the question this way, what is the notional amount of leveraged loans that the mark that you've taken relates to? And then finally, I have a question more of a conceptual nature, and I think it falls into two parts. So the first question is, I think I understood from your presentation well, what you're not afraid of, as Credit Suisse Group, and what type of scenarios don't scare you and what type of scenarios you think are manageable? Thomas, I would like to ask you, what does scare you, at this point in time? And the reason why I ask this question, as I look at the pre-tax profitability, which is fine, it gets you underlying through, as you point out, an 8%, 9% ROE. On an annualized basis that's 40 basis points of leverage exposure, 120 basis points of risk-weighted assets. I mean, does it take much imagination if the current environment persists to see those profits disappear, and Credit Suisse starts loss making? Thanks.",

So I think on collateral and lombard loan exposure to mind I don't actually have an exact number on the lombard move quarter-on-quarter, maybe we can get that and give it to you later, Jernej, but I'll refer to my IR colleagues on that. What I would say, is that was not to my knowledge at least, any material component of net new asset moves that we actually saw in the quarter. Obviously the biggest thing was, this transfer of a single, low margin ultra high net worth mandates from Credit Suisse to a different bank, which was the bulk of what you actually saw in SUB, and that was definitely not related in any way to a leverage loan. I think we have seen some deleveraging as you'd expect and face these markets and if you actually look at the components of assets under management, it's up to about 32% cash now across all three of our private banking business. So there definitely has been some deleveraging as part of that. But that's all I'd say at this point. I think your second question was on the leverage finance exposure. I'm not really going to add more to what I've said before. The marks that we've taken are in respect of the CHF7.3 billion book. Clearly, some of those positions will have a higher mark than others, but I'm not going to sort of break it down any further. I think you should just assume it's in respect to that entire book, basically. I think your third question, perhaps I'd refer to Thomas in sense of what are we worried about?",

    "text": "Before I get to the third question, I mean on the on the collateral management and the lombard loan question, the first one, I mean if you look also at our loans in the three private banking led divisions, you can see actually it increased in Switzerland, but it went down both [indiscernible] and in APAC and that really is, as David said, a result of some deleveraging we saw there. But the same time a lot of our clients are now positioning themselves to reengage, as they see the lock downs in various countries, especially in Europe to ease and they are taking increasingly positive views on the market, obviously, in a cautious way. That leads me to what scares me or first of all, I can say, I can sleep well and it's I think probably the worst scenario would be, if we all went back to the offices too quickly, lockdowns to follow, some think we have a second wave of infections, and that will then result in prolonged crisis, and I think that will be bad for the economy and indirected end for us and capital markets generally. So that is certainly something that we all have to factor into our scenarios as well. But broadly seen, I'm actually taking a lot of comfort of how we have managed at least so far through this crisis. If I look at our capital, if I look at our liquidity, if I look at our earnings growth in Private Banking, if I look at our ability in trading, be it equity or fixed income, to navigate the markets have been very encouraged by that. So, I can assure you that we are very cautious. We are very aware of the overall slowdown in the economy. We expect, as it was mentioned also by David, a recession, not only in the U.S., but also in Europe and Switzerland. But I'm not losing any sleep. So thanks for asking.",

Could you just repeat and maybe add not just to the assumptions, I think you mentioned the U.S., but just the GDP and unemployment numbers for some of the key regions for 2020 as well as 2021 that you're assuming in CECL? And lastly, on CECL, are you using a phased-in approach? And if you do so, what would be the fully loaded impact on your CET1? The second question I have is, it was partially discussed. But if I look at your valuation, you're roughly at 0.5x tangible book, and mainly, I would say it's because of your IB concerns by the market or market concerns on the IB, not your concern, clearly. I was trying to understand how you square your view around why this is a good business in the long term, especially, I assume in ITS, and maybe you can share that with us, you sell basically no credit products to your private banks, why you need a credit business considering post restructuring, it again made losses. Why you need a credit business, i.e. the investment bank, in light of a wealth management business? And thirdly, if I may ask one more question.

    "text": "Perhaps if I take the first question and then hand over to Thomas, really, in terms of your question around the credit business, I believe, within the wholesale operations. I think the number of questions is really about CECL. So I think the approach that we take is similar, the same, as I understand, that the U.S. banks take. We have a significant number of models, which we apply across our different businesses, both IB related and wealth management related. Those include a different range of inputs, which we actually probability weight in order to actually calculate the outturn. In terms of the key assumptions, I think what I said was that if we think about the U.S., then we are assuming a quarter-on-quarter reduction in excess of 20% for the second quarter. We are expecting something not dissimilar in the year '27, but a lower impact in Switzerland. In terms of unemployment in the U.S., we're assuming double digit, which I think is similar to what most of the U.S. banks are actually also assuming. And in terms of -- I mean -- and clearly, we expect all three of the economies I've just mentioned to be in recession for the whole of 2020, and we do not really expect to see a recovery until the first quarter '21, i.e., positive GDP growth. So those are our set of assumptions that we made. And I think those are probably the most -- the key ones to actually think about, not the only ones, but the key ones, basically. So hopefully, that helps, Kian. Now in terms of the capital impact, as I said in response to an earlier question, the capital reduction for CECL, we'd have no significant capital reduction for CECL because we already did make a capital deduction in respect of the IRB capital model, which exceeds the CECL provision. So we already have a greater deduction. So therefore, increasing the CECL does not, therefore, reduce our capital. And as I said before, I think to be helpful, there's about another CHF200 million of buffer that CECL would have to increase by before it exceeds the IRB buffer. And then at that point, you get into these interesting questions around phase and everything else, but that's just not relevant at this point, and hopefully, does not become relevant in the future in terms of capital reductions. So that's what I'd say to your technical question, Kian, I think. Thomas? Just on CECL, can you just highlight what assumptions you make for GDP and unemployment in 2021? Actually, that's more interesting from my perspective, at least. Should we just use consensus numbers on Bloomberg as a good indicator? Or are you different from that assumption?",

    "text": "Okay, so your other three questions on valuation on the credit business and the buyback. So first on valuation, I very much believe in the correlation between return on tangible equity and price to tangible book value, and I think there is a clear dislocation at the moment from where we are, against that line and where we are trading. So I think it's our task to deliver quarter-on-quarter, to get as close as possible to that line. At the moment, we are clearly way below our tangible book value, which is not a Credit Suisse idiosyncratic problem. I think most most banks suffer from the same, but we just have to prove quarter-over-quarter that we can deliver on our returns, and that's how we look at valuation. Secondly on the credit business, I have to say that, don't quite understand your question, because our credit business is actually profitable. If I look in Global Markets, it has had actually an excellent quarter as part of our fixed income and this is even after absorbing their share of the unrealized markdowns. Now if you refer to more the lev fin business, clearly it was an extraordinarily difficult quarter, not only for us, but also for the U.S. banks that are mainly our competitors in that market. But over a mid to long-term cycle, we very much believe that private equity related business will continue to be a main driver of Investment Banking fees going forward. If you look at our CHF7 billion exposure in the context of our CHF300 billion loan book, I think it's a small exposure. We have significantly reduced it after the financial crisis. This was, I think from the peak, we went down 85%. So clearly lev fin had a bad quarter, but I think we are well positioned in that business and it is actually also, in many cases, relates also to M&A, for example, where we have a lot of clients now approaching us about public-to-private, with low valuations and you can only discuss that, if you also have people at the table that understand lev fin markets. And from that perspective, I'm actually very clear of the opinion, that it fits well with our overall strategy. On the buyback, very clear, we have suspended it in March, and we are now observing the market. We are in the first instance, focused on the second part of the dividend -- of the 2019 dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter. Secondly, we are focused on paying a dividend for the year 2020, and then only in the third instance on the share buyback, so that's how I look at it. Thank you.",

    "text": "And to your first question, sorry, Kian, I think the confusion or the point I have to clarify really comes down to IRB, their standard models. So the IRB model, as approved by the FINRA, is extremely conservative and that's why the capital reduction exceeds the CECL number. If we were operating under a standardized approach, as opposed to an IRB approach, then I understand what you mean at that point, because at that point, CECL would then be more closely aligned to capital, but we are operating on IRB, the approved model for that is very conservative, and that's why we have a buffer. So just to be clear, that's the core reason for the difference between Credit Suisse and any other CECL banks you've looked at.",

    "text": "Thank you, Magdalena. So on Private Banking, as you saw on one of the slides, that we grew in the first half by 7% on an adjusted basis in an environment which was, frankly, quite hostile and it shows that the Private Banking business as a whole and that Credit Suisse is on a healthy growth trend even in a difficult environment. Now clearly, there are some headwinds, be it on U.S. dollar interest rates, be it in our strong Swiss franc. And clearly, in the current environment, it’s difficult to win new clients as clients are relatively, let’s say, conservative at the moment. But nevertheless, we continue to believe in the overall growth rate of the private banking industry as a whole. And we think that Credit Suisse is extremely well positioned in all three regions, be it Asia, be it EMEA region including Switzerland and be it in Latin America. And we have continued to invest in these businesses, be it through hiring of relationship managers; be it by improving our offering, working together with the Investment Bank; and to be the bank for entrepreneurs in all of these regions. So I have mentioned some of the initiatives like, for example, the establishment of the IFG, International Financing Group, here in Switzerland in IWM, which will incorporate all share-backed lending activities we do in this time zone, including also for institutional clients and for SUB clients. We want to improve also the collaboration of IWM with IBCM and especially for mid-market transactions for entrepreneurs in M&A but even also in the lending space for corporates where we see quite a lot of potential still to tap market share and increase market share. And from that perspective, we continue to target high single-digit revenue growth in our global Private Banking business. On the IB side, your question was how we’re going to integrate this and how we’re going to drive revenues and the 10% return on capital. I mean in order to get to 10% return on capital for the full year, we have to do CHF 1.6 billion PTI. We have now made CHF 1.1 billion in the first 6 months if you take the three areas together, Global Markets, IBCM and APAC Markets. So I’m very confident that we have a good, strong base to work from. I see further growth opportunities in each of the areas, be it in Equities, be it in fixed income, be it in the M&A and underwriting business. Clearly, there are headwinds in the current environment, but we continue to expect volatility, which should generally help our trading business. We continue to see the desire of corporates to refinance themselves in the capital markets, be it in equity capital markets, be it in debt capital markets. So I do think that there continues to be very decent volumes in capital markets. Clearly, M&A will be tough in the second half because announced M&A volumes in the first half is down over 50% globally. I’m talking about Street numbers. And there is a delay, as you know, for M&A revenues. So I think overall Street will have a tough time in the second half in terms of M&A revenues. But at the same time, we see our pipeline growing. We also saw recent announcements of M&A transactions. So from that perspective, I think momentum is building.",

We, for example, to create a global Equities platform, will help us also with our large institutional clients; or for example, to put together the underwriting business, where we had a 50-50 joint venture, will simplify things. We want to invest in M&A with an asset-light business and we continue to see opportunities there to grow. So overall, we see various areas. We are actually top 6 in 84% of our revenues in Investment Banking, we are in the top six position. So we have concentrated on areas where we are globally competitive. And from that perspective, we are confident to build on the success. You saw we are number one in the first six months in IPOs globally, so strong leveraged finance, strong private equity franchises. So we have a very strong base to work from.",

And is there any business in APAC Markets that will remain in the APAC division or will it be totally going to the Investment Bank – to the new Investment Banking division? And the second question relates to liquidity. You mentioned the increase of the LCR ratio during the quarter, but it’s really basically back to where it was late in 2019. So from your perspective, have you actually incurred excess cost of liquidity during the second quarter? And if so, is that excess cost still sitting in the Corporate Center or have you allocated it to the divisions?",

One is what we would call the IBCM business in Asia, so M&A and Capital Markets business, which is currently in the segment Wealth Management & Connected, and that will stay 100% part of APAC. And then within the Markets business, you have, on one side, Equities, cash and prime, which will be fully part of the global Equities business, and therefore, fully part of Global Markets but with local reporting lines, obviously. And then you have APAC Solutions, which is now being merged with ITS, which – and will be Global Trading Solution, GTS. Yves-Alain Sommerholder used to run both businesses, so he was spending 50% of his time out of Zurich running ITS and 50% out of his time in Hong Kong running ITS. He now runs both together. So this has been, if you want, already prepared and there will be local reporting lines. There is a revenue-sharing setup in the same way that we have a revenue-sharing arrangement today between Global Markets, SUB and IWM for ITS, and we’ll have the same thing in Asia. So from that perspective, hopefully, that answers your question on the Asia-based Investment Bank.",

    "text": "Stefan, just on the second point then, so just a few numbers then. So you’re correct, the LCR ratio of 196% is very similar to the LCR ratio of 198% that we had at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. However, due in part to the 1Q events, the net – NCOs are actually higher, CHF 83 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, increased to CHF 104 billion. So in terms of our HQLA position, the CHF 203 billion average actually compares to CHF 165 billion in the end of the fourth quarter of last year. So that just gives the sort of full picture in terms of the liquidity position. And I think we just regard this as a prudent thing to do. It gives us much greater reserves at the central parent entity as well as in our subsidiaries, and it prepares us for whatever stresses we may or may not see in the autumn. In terms of your question about the increased cost to that, there is an increased cost to that. That has predominantly been allocated to divisions, particularly Global Markets and IBCM. So the numbers you see for both of them are actually after the – that increase in costs. There are some costs also sitting in the Corporate Center, not dissimilar, I think, to the CHF 90 million that UBS talked about, and those will be allocated in due course as we actually move forward. But the majority has actually gone out to the markets-based operations already and it’s actually in our run rate number, Stefan.",

Look, the – our business model, as we said numerous times, is to be a global leader in Wealth Management with strong Investment Banking capabilities. And it’s very clear that based on these two fundamentals, we need to have the appropriate capital allocation. So to have a strong investment bank helps us directly and indirectly with our entrepreneur clients. And if you want to advise an entrepreneur around his private wealth, he usually wants to talk first about his company and how he can grow it and how he can make acquisition and how he can finance it and potentially make an IPO or whatever. So you need to have strong investment banking capabilities to holistically advise entrepreneurs, and that’s why it’s very important we maintain a minimum size in there. And a lot of the revenues that we’re actually making in Private Banking and profitability, we are making because we have a strong investment bank, global investment bank. And I think with the 10% target returns, which we see as a minimum for the Investment Banking business, we have a realistic number to support that business. It’s above our cost of capital in the long term. And from that perspective, we think that’s the right mix. There will also be, as you know, over the coming years, certain changes in Basel III RWA modeling around the FRTB, for example, and that will increase obviously the RWAs especially on the Investment Banking side and that’s why we have taken this approach. And obviously, you also have to look at it not only from an RWA perspective, but also from a leverage perspective where today we are above 1/3. And that’s why on a mid-to long-term approach, the 1/3, 2/3 is the right mix for us.",

Now a lot’s happened in the last six months and particularly the move in U.S. dollar rates. But it’s – I would still expect our net interest income to be up by about CHF 100 million in 2020 compared to 2019. It’s a combination of those measures. And you know the exemption threshold at the SNB is also – was actually increased in the first quarter. But the benefit for that will be almost entirely in the Swiss Universal bank because you are obviously seeing the adverse impact of lower dollar rates on an NII basis in both IWM and in APAC. And I would caution that you would see further pressure on net interest income in 2021 if interest rates remain at this level as the various swaps and structures that we put in place with the dollarization begin to roll off towards the end of 2021. So that’s – I hope that’s helpful in terms of the guidance. Much more resilient here in Switzerland, less so elsewhere, although clearly the reported net interest income numbers will also depend on our loan activity over the course of the next year or so.",

I mean just to remind you, we were actually trading at parity against the U.S. dollar a year ago and latest rate is, I think, somewhere between 0.93 and 0.94 today, which is quite a material move. And not relevant for APAC, but I mean, if you look to the Brazilian real, it’s down about 30% against the year. So there’s a lot of currency moves. And I would just remind you, we obviously report in Swiss francs, not in U.S. dollars. And that does have an impact on our APAC PB businesses across the line. In terms of the specific line items, the pressure you’re talking about in terms of recurring activity in APAC was actually linked to some of the insurance products that we actually sell in Asia Pacific and that’s what caused the slowdown in the second quarter.

The measures that we’ve announced today should generate about CHF 400 million of cost saves, which we will see during 2021 and realized in full by 2022. But I think the question is how much we actually let drop through to the bottom line for that will depend critically on the markets we actually see over the next six to 12 months. Clearly, if conditions remain difficult, if we see a further economic slowdown, then I think the pace of reinvestment is going to be extremely limited. If, on the other hand, we continue to see a gentle recovery in economic activity, then I would expect to allow a much higher level of reinvestment of that CHF 400 million number. So I mean that’s why I’ve given guidance for this year of a range of between CHF 16 billion and CHF 16.5 billion because I think there is considerable uncertainty over the next six months. And clearly, part of the rationale and the reasoning for taking these measures is to actually drive further efficiency measures and to give us greater flexibility either to reduce our costs or to free up resources for growth elsewhere.

And then in IWM transaction-based revenues were again relatively soft at least versus my expectation in the second quarter.

I remember there were some headwinds in the first quarter regarding unrealized losses, CHF 101 million, whether there was something similar in the second quarter. Sorry.

And the second quarter, we had CHF 11 million specific, but we had a reversal of CHF 9 million in CECL based on an update we’ve done on our economic assumptions, which actually slightly improved for Switzerland. So overall, if you take it together, we have CHF 114 million provision in the first half. For our corporate business, it’s actually still a pretty big number. So – and anecdotally, when I speak to our Head of Corporate Banking, be it on the large risk corporate side, be it on the SME side, we feel that our clients are overall feeling extremely well with the crisis. Clearly, there is pressure points and there are certain areas where our corporate clients or certain sectors, especially in tourism and in other areas where they are challenged, but we feel relatively comfortable with where we are year-to-date on that side.

    "text": "Yes. I mean I think in terms of the transaction revenues for IWM, I think two points. Firstly, the point we’ve made already around the moves against these currencies. I mean 30% for the Brazilian real, and that’s an important part of the IWM business. I mean I think, let’s not overlook, that’s a big move. 6% in the U.S. dollar, these actually do depress our reported transaction revenues when you actually look at the numbers in Swiss francs. But I would also note, which might be helpful, that we did see about a CHF 21 million loss in respect of hedging of certain derivative positions in IWM, which we have noted in general terms in the MD&A. So that’s probably the other factor in there. So that might help you, Daniele, in terms of the models. And that basically just relates to the moves in credit spreads in the second quarter compared to previous periods. I think you asked a question around CHF 101 million, I think. That was actually in Asset Management, not in the PB side basically. So that was an AM issue, not the PB side. We have disclosed we’ve seen a write-back of about CHF 20 million of that CHF 100 million in the second quarter, but that’s clearly the other subdivision from IWM PB, if that helps. I think on the more general point around costs, I mean I think there’s a few points to make. Firstly, Credit Suisse does have, I think, a very good track record in terms of delivering cost saves. We delivered over CHF 4.2 billion through our committed program. And that program is very much ongoing in terms of what we’re actually doing today. Secondly, we’re not changing our targets for return on tangible equity. We’re not moving back from reported to adjusted or anything like that. The key metric for the bank remains the reported metrics. What we do have though is, as a consequence of the measures that Thomas has announced this morning, we will see a slight step-up in terms of those restructuring costs that ordinarily we just let flow through our P&L. And therefore, the reason why we’re disclosing it today is just so you know that is coming and to make clear that essentially we will be giving that disclosure going forward. But our numbers remain measured on a reported basis. But as we’re taking these bigger steps, essentially, in the interest of transparency, we wanted to let you know that there will be a slight step-up in these costs, which otherwise would actually flow through our P&L without requiring disclosure. So it’s more of a disclosure point in terms of this. We’re not going back to some kind of adjusted type metric in terms of how we actually judge ourselves. It’s clearly part of the ongoing measures we’re actually taking. And I think that’s the kind of key point. You should see it more as how we basically double down on our existing strengths across our business and give ourselves some more cost flexibility going forward.",

So we very much believe in this regionalization empowering. And the Private Banking business is a local business, is a regional business and it’s quite different from the Investment Banking business, which is a global trading, underwriting and advisory business built on strong infrastructure, et cetera. So we very much believe that this is the right approach. And as I also mentioned earlier, at the time when Global Markets and IBCM were split, that was really to fix the Global Markets business. We had too much capital, too much risk-weighted assets in that area. We reduced the risk. And we want to protect the IBCM business. We did do that in the restructuring phase. And this is the right thing now to do to put the global Investment Bank back together. And from that perspective, it’s a natural step.

    "text": "Okay. Well, thanks very much, Jeremy. Let me take the first one. So in terms of RWA movements for the second half, I think the – there are probably three points I’d want to make. Firstly, we still do have the phase-in of the SA-CCR reform here in Switzerland. So that’s another CHF 3 billion in the third quarter and another CHF 3 billion in the fourth quarter, but I think you know about that. Second point, I think it is important to point this out, that the inflation of risk-weighted assets that resulted from the volatility in March is still largely in the system and in our numbers and it will probably take another year or so for that to be completely amortized out. It doesn’t just drop out in one quarter or two quarters. So we will see, though, if volatility remains at these sorts of levels, some reduction in RWA in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and then into 2021 from that, and that is likely to be the order of – similar sort of order of magnitude, say, CHF 3 billion to CHF 4 billion type magnitude. The third component then is ratings migrations. We did see some increase in RWA in the very low billions from rating migrations in the second quarter. And we may see some further rating migrations in the third quarter, although that clearly will depend on the credit environment which we actually operate. Now just to be clear, Jeremy, so if you add all that up, David is telling me that there is going to be some benefit because I would expect, honestly, at this point, the volatility gain to exceed the ratings migration plus you have the SA-CCR effect, why are we guiding to 12%. And I think the answer is that is intended as a conservative guidance and a reinstatement of what we actually said at the end of 2012. There’s nothing more you should read into that. I think we – I think the key message you should take away from this presentation is preparedness. We do not really know what level of infection we’re going to see in the second half, how governments will choose to respond to that in terms of either lockdowns or extension of state measures or anything else. And therefore, I think being conservative on our capital guidance is the right thing to do. But I think I’ve given you the numbers. There’s nothing else there to read into it in terms of that and that’s why we went back to the 12% number, but it is intended as, I think, a conservative guidance looking forward on our CET1 ratio. I think on the share buyback comment, I would merely say that we informed both the FINMA and all of the core college regulators of everything we’ve said today in advance. So I think our regulators are fully informed of this. I’m sure, basically, we’ll have further discussions with them as we actually go through the preparations for the EGM on the 27th of November and everything else we say there afterwards. But this has obviously been made in the full cognizance of FINMA and the core college.",

There are other banks in Switzerland that did pay the full dividend and this was the result of very constructive discussions. We have now a situation where we have not only confirmed first quarter, but actually improved on the first quarter in terms of pretax income and profitability. The overall situation is much more stable, so it’s a very constructive dialogue and we don’t have any indications that there are any issues with us paying that second half dividend. In any event, this is the decision by the shareholders.",

And in that context, your staff numbers have gone up in Global Markets 9% year-on-year. Just wondering if you could comment what that is related to.

Clearly, the volumes are not at the level that we had, to a large part, in the second quarter, but we are actually satisfied with the start generally in Global Markets in the third quarter. And that is also true for the credit trading. Staff up in GM, I will have to refer to David, but I just want to make a general comment on staff. I mean staff is up globally over the last 12 months and that’s also a result of our disciplined approach of not having engaged on any structural initiatives in the first half of this year, and clearly, generally, in the industry, a lower turnover, if you want, of staff generally.",

So what you’re seeing there is the allocated component of that flowing through to GM in respect to their use of corporate functions. I think I’d also point out, I mean, those costs – or those heads are almost entirely in our lower cost operations, particularly in India. They’re not an increase in staff in some of the higher cost locations. So that’s what’s actually driving that. I think your second question, Kian, was actually around cash balances, so I’ll just give you a few numbers. I mean it has something in common with other things we’ve seen, which is they’ve fallen but they’re still not back to where they were pre-COVID. So at this point, basically, in terms of PB AUM, it’s running at 30%, is actually wholly in money market liquidity. That compares to 32% at the end of the first quarter but basically also compares to 28% in the second half of 2019. So as you see, generally speaking, there has been some drop in cash balances but not back to the levels we saw before. I think you asked specifically about Asia. Asian cash balances are actually around 25%. But the same comment applies basically. It was 27% basically because they dropped back somewhat and that’s kind of true across our Wealth Management businesses. So reduced, but not by any means back to pre-COVID-19 levels.",

So of course, we discussed with our regulator and not only here in Switzerland, but also with our U.S. and UK regulators the plan changes and they were very supportive. And those regulatory changes actually were totally independent on any capital discussions which we’re also having. But as you know, during the last two quarters, the Swiss approach was to actually get less forbearance than probably some of our European neighboring countries benefited. Quite the contrary, we continue to have, for example, the increase in SA-CCR CHF 3 billion per quarter during this year. So the discussions we are having with the regulator are very constructive and we’re very constructive and allowed us also to make this announcement today about those organizational changes.",

So no comment, no point – no change in that. One point, which I think Thomas alluded to, which relates to regulatory capital relief, which I think has obviously been much more limited in Switzerland than it has been elsewhere, one point I should make, and this is coming back, I think, Jeremy, if you’re still on, to the question you had about capital ratios. We did decide not to take a CHF 3 billion procyclical relief at the end of the second quarter because the volatility had actually dropped so much in the second quarter. So I guess, Jeremy, there’s probably CHF 3 billion of RWA move there, which I should just complete on. But we took that out because, frankly, this isn’t the volatility in the market to actually justify it. So as Thomas said, there’s not a great deal of regulatory relief in terms of these numbers in terms of our RWA numbers, so just to be very clear on that point. I think your second question then was actually around the time and restructuring costs. I would expect them to be accrued relatively evenly over the course of the next four quarters with the cost savings to flow through pretty much on a three to six month lag as we actually complete those measures. I just would reiterate, the reason we’re giving you visibility on this restructuring cost issue is just so you have transparency. The metrics remain reported.

And I think, Thomas, you outlined nicely why it was important to kind of ring-fence the various parts back in 2015. I just want to ask you one question. So you say here that reconstituting the Investment Bank is going to allow you to do a number of things, one of them is a more dynamic capital allocation. I was just wondering if you can actually contextualize this for us. What does that actually mean, right? Or a question put differently, what will Credit Suisse be able to do under the new structure that it’s not able to do today? And then the second question I have is on Page 18. So you lay out your new targets. But when we look at these targets, so you got a return on tangible of 10% to 12% and you’re at 12% today and 10% over the past 4 quarters; core Tier 1 of 12%, you’re above that; and core Tier 1 leverage of 4%, you’re above that. So I was just wondering, I mean, how should we think about the level of ambition that’s embedded in these targets? Or are you trying to tell us that the group is over-earning today and there’s going to be significant headwinds? I mean what makes this RoTE target of 10% to 12% ambitious or difficult to achieve?",

    "text": "Thank you, Jernej, for these two questions. So the dynamic capital allocation was not always so easy between IBCM on one side, Global Markets on the other then APAC Markets as a third component. The way we manage RWA, we have year-end targets, but we also have quarterly updates. And the way we have to manage it depends also very much on the overall market environment. There are times when the primary business is very strong and we want to allocate more business – more RWA to the primary business and there are times where the primary business is not very strong and we want to allocate more to the trading business, and that type of flexibility was much more difficult when you have two separate divisions. And now we have it as one division, so that will allow us to be more nimble and more, frankly, able to take faster decisions along the markets. And the RoTE question and the target question, it’s very clear that in some areas, we are above those, but RoTE last 12 months is 10.4%. We said at the Investor Day last year, we want to be 10% for 2020, and then 2021, 2022, 11% to 12%. And that was obviously before COVID. We have now, in my perspective, in my humble opinion, proven that our model works actually very well also in a financial crisis. And the ambition clearly is to still go to the 11% to 12% range, as we said at the Investor Day, and we are now at 10.4% on a rolling four-quarter basis. So we want to continue to improve. And the CET1 ratio around 12%, we just want to give ourselves a certain cushion and a certain flexibility also because you do not really – you cannot really plan that well in a COVID-19 environment in the short term. And in the mid to long term, we have FRTB. But our view through the cycle is for a business like Crédit Suisse, a 12% CET1 ratio is about right; and CET1 leverage ratio of 4%, which basically tells you a roughly 33% risk density which is more or less where we will operate on, so I think that’s the reason why we have those targets.",

I think that’s – but I think that’s appropriate in terms of where we are amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We have high levels of liquidity as well. Now I think, as I said, if we see a continued gentle recovery, then I think that will position Credit Suisse phenomenally well with this degree of preparedness to actually run off some of those excesses and to reinvest into the business. On the other hand, clearly, if we see a significant slowdown again for whatever reason in the autumn, then I think we’re very well prepared to withstand that as well. And I think that’s the appropriate place for us to be. And I think speaking where we are now halfway through the year, I think we need to be cautious and balanced in terms of what we’re saying.

And therefore, it gives us the ability to very much remain in that type of cost corridor. But I think we’ll probably be able to give you greater guidance towards the end of the year as we see how the environment actually shapes up because, quite clearly, I think we are going to see business opportunities at Crédit Suisse probably in Wealth Management as a consequence of the stressed environment we’re actually seeing and I think we need to be prepared to take advantage of that, and I don’t think we’d rule that out in terms of our steps going forward. But it’s about giving ourselves the flexibility to do that. Quite clearly, if things are difficult, then the cost measures give us that cushion. I don’t think I’d mechanically link it to 10% to 12% type thing. I think that’s a little bit too granular in terms of how we think.

Just trying to reconcile the two parts. Obviously, I appreciate there’s a difference between reg cap and seen out, but clearly, there’s still a bit of a differential there. And a second question, again, just on the cost savings and just the broader strategy you’ve kind of reached out for, in particular, on the IB. Just trying to understand, I mean, I guess, over the last three years since 2015 when the business was kind of split into the various parts, that kind of helped to drive better productivity and profitability and some of the cost reduction we’ve seen to date.

And whether it’s conservative or not, we are above these numbers at the moment. That’s clear. You saw that if you look at the four divisions, but at the same time, these are realistic ambitions, in my view. And I will obviously push Brian and the team to be above, 10.01%, maybe more like 11%, 12% or 13% in that area. And I know he has that ambition. And there are certain areas within the three Private Banking divisions where 20% is probably at the low end, like IWM, but typically operates more at the mid-20s in terms of returns, whereas in Switzerland, high teens. But that there are some differentiations within that as well. But I think that’s an illustration how we think about the business. The Private Banking business, clearly higher return, higher growth; the Investment Banking business providing us the scale and the capabilities. And in periods like we saw now in the first half, also very good diversification as we saw. If you compare our results with some of the pure-play private banks here in Switzerland, clearly, you see the benefit of having an integrated model.

Just firstly, just in terms of completing the maths on the Corporate Center, we’ve not been asked about the Corporate Center, basically, but I think you will have noted the Corporate Center number was, I think, higher than consensus. So I think there’s two points to note in there. One, there was just short of CHF 90 million of provisions in respect of legacy litigation issues associated with the former SRU, which, as you know, is now booked as part of the ARU within the Corporate Center. And two, we’ve obviously seen some snapback in terms of the volatility we saw in the first quarter. So actually, net-net, if you actually strip out the CHF 85 million, US$90 million, plus about CHF 150 million of volatility, you’ll see the Corporate Center is actually running just under the CHF 250 million guidance for ex vol and ex litigation Corporate Center numbers. So just to give you some context there. So I just would perhaps helpfully guide you to the Corporate Center. It’s – I would still expect it to be in the range of CHF 225 million to CHF 250 million per quarter ex volatility and ex litigation. So that’s just one factor. But the other factor clearly is we’re obviously talking about return on tangible equity. We’re not talking about return on CET1, as I think you know. But there is that material difference. I mean the tangible equity is just under CHF 42 billion at the end of the second quarter whereas our CET1 is only about CHF 37.3 billion. So there’s about 11%, 12% of the tangible equity, which is not effective in terms of capital utilization. So if you’re comparing the two, basically, that’s the difference, as you said, between the return on regulatory capital and return on that. So the CC and that has been the two factors there.

The first thing, and I did indicate this in my prepared comments, you have seen significant own credit-related volatility in the expenses between both the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter 2019, but more so between the first quarter and the second quarter. Remember, we had a gain in the Corporate Center as a consequence of the credit spread widening. And we’ve obviously seen that snapback basically in the second quarter. So if the first quarter costs, and we did disclose this at the time, was helped by own credit spreads, the second quarter clearly is harmed by it, so – just to be clear on that. And we talked about CHF 58 million on a 2Q year-on-year change number, but the number obviously between the second quarter and first quarter is actually substantially higher than that because we had an opposite credit in terms of that number. I think, quite clearly, in a very challenging market, our cost would be below CHF 16 billion, but it would be a very challenging market given we’re halfway through the year. But obviously, if we were to see a particularly bleak second half environment, the fact that we’ve taken a conservative approach in terms of our compensation accruals does position us better than the other way around would be as we look forward to the end of the year. But we’ll see where we go from there basically. Your second question was on capital return, I believe. Look, I think we’re standing by our existing guidance. I think at that point, that does mean we assume that FRTB comes in 2023 and we have some capital need in respect of that. I think at this point, that’s all I can really say. I think it’s quite possible that we will see the European Union potentially draw back on FRTB and some of the other Basel III reforms, possibly phasing and things like that. And generally, the Swiss approach has been to align to the European Union. But I think, again, speaking where we are now in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I think you should just say we’re assuming no change in terms of the mix as we stand today, but we’ll see how the situation develops over the course of the next six months to a year.",

Not a word I’d personally use, but it’s certainly true that Switzerland has taken a much more conservative approach to operational risk calibration than particularly the rest of the EU, which – where, generally, you will see that operational risk RWA as percentage of the total is a much lower part than it is for Switzerland. So Switzerland, I think, is probably more akin to the United States. And I think you have seen some rollback in the United States some of the operational risk assets. So definitely compared to EU, yes, I think you’re right and we’ll see how that develops.

So my first question is really about kind of risk weighted asset's trajectory going forward. You have kind of shown us the regulatory inflation from CA-CCR. You have also kind of shown us how the respective assets kind of grow from the perspective of underlying business. But of course, also, we have seen the reduction for the optimization of some of your Investment Banking balance sheet. So my question is kind of going forward, are we likely to see more of those? Are we likely to see kind of more efforts from a perspective of the actual optimization of the balance sheet? And if you could also kind of remind us if remainder of the regulatory impact, you're going to see that would be very useful too. And my last thing is, could you - could you summarize for us, kind of once again, and I know you've done it numerous times before, but why do you think 12% from now on, as the business spend is the right targets for you, particularly with those kind of very high kind of share buybacks announced today and I assume, being rolled forward, as well?

    "text": "Thank you very much and just a few points, then really. So I think in terms of capital going forward, we - I think just in terms of the [reg], we actually took about CHF 2.8 billion of SA-CCR increases in the third quarter, I think, you know? And I would expect something of the same order in the fourth quarter, which completes the phase-in of the SA-CCR process. And that will be the bulk of the regulatory impact in the fourth quarter. And to give you some guidance, we do not expect to see particularly much in 2021, which may be helpful. And I think in terms of capital utilization for the fourth quarter, I think there's two trends. I think one, I think, yes, we will continue to optimize some of our COVID exposure, we will continue to optimize the corporate bank. But against that, I think, we have seen a pickup in loan demand, obviously notably in IWN this quarter, we've seen continued growth in SUB. And if you look at APAC after deleveraging that we suffered for several quarters that essentially came to an end in the third quarter. So I would expect us to see some increase in the amount of capital we have invested in our loan portfolio across the Wealth Management divisions over both the fourth quarter and into 2021. And what does that mean, in terms of the CET 1 ratio? I mean, I would be very surprised to see our CET 1 ratio to drop close to the 12% in the next quarter. I think it more likely will be somewhere in the sort of 12.5% to 13%. I think that gives us a very comfortable position, both to finance the loan growth in our Wealth Management businesses, and to basically finance both the dividend plans and the share buyback plans. Now, clearly, you know the dividends for second half of 2019 has already been deducted from our capitalization has been for this year. And obviously, we've also deducted three quarters of the dividend for 2020 at plus 5% from what we've accrued already. So you can see where we sit from a sort of capital point of view. And is 12% the right number? I think it feels right, to me at this point, given the macroeconomic uncertainties in which we actually operate in. I think, there clearly is obviously negative news around COVID-19 infections as we can all see. And it clearly does create further economic uncertainties, which may well mean that our clients have more demand for our services than perhaps we expected, or we may see more volatility elsewhere. But I think therefore, I think guarding to a 12% floor, pre-FRTB etc., etc., I think seems to be a prudent thing for our policy at this point. And when we look at what that means, in terms of our share buyback, we think that's very much financeable in the context of our existing guidance and clearly starting at 13% is a good place to start with. And does that answer your question, Magdalena?",

Well would you that the comfortable capital ratio, particularly in relation to, calibrating buybacks as you go into next year? And then my second question is on Slide 38, your return on tangible equity targets, and getting up into the 10% to 12% range that you're very close to. And the slide indicates that this needs to come from the Wealth Management side. And I just wondered how confident you feel about that, at this point in time looking into next year, in terms of moving parts?

And I think, firstly, in terms of the share buyback, I already do have the approval from the Board of directors for the share buyback to resume in January 2021, at the target level of up to CHF 1.5 billion and a targeted minimum of CHF 1 billion. Both Thomas and I have clearly discussed that formerly with FINRA and we have received a statement of no objection from FINRA to this. So therefore, we are where we are in terms of the process. But and just to be clear on that particular point. And I think prudently, because I think we do have to recognize that we remain in an uncertain economic environment, that I think that's why I've said 12%. And as I said, to Magdalena, probably somewhere in the 12.5% to 13%. And I think from a Tier 1 capital point of view, I would attempt to run the bank something in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% compared to the current 18.3% Tier 1 ratio. Now, we can review that in the course of 2021. But I think there has to be a prudent balance between, I think first of all, paying our dividend commitments to shareholders, which is the most important thing. Secondly, providing the capital for the loan growth in the Wealth Management business and thirdly, finding a reasonable level of share buyback, which I do think the commitment of CHF 1.5 billion, minimum CHF 1 billion is about the right order of magnitude, as we said. And but that's what I'd say in terms of the share capital. I guess, Jeremy, we could run the CET 1 ratio lower. But I don't think that really seems prudent at this point, in terms of where we are in the cycle and with the uncertainties we actually have. And that's not implied, or required as part of our share buyback plan. On the second point, Thomas?",

    "text": "Yeah, so if you look at Page 38, you see the RoRC for the three Private Banking led divisions, IWM, APAC, and SUB with 21%, 20% and 16%. And remember that this is with elevated PCLs, provision for credit losses, which are over CHF 500 million for these three divisions. We see substantial growth in Asia, we see a very strong momentum in IWM in terms of NNA and in terms of hiring. And traditionally, both of these divisions have been operating more in the mid-20s in terms of especially IWM the mid to high-20s, in terms of RoRC. And I think that the SUB has the ability to be in the high-teens in terms of RoRCs or between 16% and 19%. And therefore, I think on a normalized basis, this is an absolutely realistic target. And in fact, if you look at the absolute targets, as we are finalizing our budget for next year, the 20% to 25% range is a very solid ambition that I feel comfortable with. And from that perspective, if you look at IB, we are 14%, clearly benefited from elevated levels in terms of trading in capital markets, but also in certain areas where we are traditionally on a relative basis at least stronger, namely credit [lessen] we've had relatively seen less activity. So from that perspective, we feel are well positioned there. And we have been hiring also in M&A and are seeing positive momentum there as well. So from that perspective, we have a clear path towards the 10% plus, in '21 and beyond.",

So, is that correct to you? Are you moving away from that 50% payout guidance and instead it's a function of excess capital? And the second question is on the gross margins, if I look at Slide 45, there has been a step down in IWM and APAC gross margins. Obviously, by looking at gross margin, that should ease out some of the FX adjustments. And within that your transaction, transaction remain fairly resilient.

So our policy does remain unchanged in terms of that. But I think we felt it would be most important for our shareholders to (a) I think have clear disclosure on our dividend policy, both for the 2H19 dividend and for the '20 dividend and (b) an indicated indicative amount of how much we'd actually spend in terms of the share buyback program for next year. So I - we thought that would be most helpful. And I think there's more clarity to our investors, basically. I think on the second point, in terms of the gross margin, I mean, I think that the key points, so that was a balance sheet question really around preparing this transactional, this NII. I mean, I think clearly, I think you - I think you're more focused SUB, on IWM and APAC. Clearly, just on SUB, the weakness in the recurring margin is due to the drag from Swisscard, which unsurprisingly, given the obviously limited amount of travel people are doing at this point, we're obviously seeing a lot lower spending on Swisscard than we normally expect to see at this point. And that comes through in terms of the recurring line as it's a 50% joint venture with American Express. I think if we look at the other numbers then in terms of IWM and APAC, and I would suggest we go to the more detailed slides at the back. So if we could actually turn to slide 43, if could have that one, basically, then you can see recurring was down about 9% in the Private Banking business, that's almost exactly the currency fall. I mean, there's other factors going on but it's basically that is driven primarily by the currency fall. And if we then go to Asia Pacific, in terms of their numbers, which I think that is also primarily currency driven as well, please. Which was down in that point, but so I'm sorry, let me just get to the right slide. Yeah, I mean, the recurring was down 11%, so 9% of that would be currency and 2%, we did see some fall in banking services. So that's what I'd raise around recurring, I think. I think clearly the growth in net new assets we've seen, obviously most notably in IWM but I would point out that we saw positive net new assets in all three divisions. We'll be hopeful for future business flows including recurring income. But I think it's been a bit swamped by currency this quarter.",

I think we're well positioned. 2020 is a little bit of a transition year. We are now restructuring some of the operations and also restructuring some of the strategies. But overall, I think we are very well positioned. We have no intention to do any M&A at this stage in Asset Management, but we are - we have been addressing selected underperformance of certain alternative strategies, which in the short term has a little bit of a drag on our P&L. But overall, we feel we have the right strategy with being more alternative and alternative light focused. And that's how I would answer the Asset Management question. On Wealth Management, it is true that we had, if you take the first nine months, and especially the first half negative loan growth, actually it was a result of deleveraging, especially in IWM and in APAC, but this has started to reverse. And we are very much focused on loan growth. We see a lot of opportunities, a lot of demand by clients.

    "text": "Well, actually, if you look at the margins, we are making in our Asset Management business, and as I mentioned, also, the growth momentum we had between 2016 and 2019, I think they are very strong, also in comparison to our peers, especially because two thirds of our portfolio is in alternatives or alternative flight. So from that perspective, we feel we have a highly attractive and profitable business. But there are some areas where we need to do some restructuring. And from that perspective, we are also satisfied with the performance in some of the funds. The two we're mentioning here are more in fixed income, and in some of the equity strategies, but also some of the alternatives like in CIT, where we are doing extremely well. So and we have now, for example, launched the partnership with the Qatar Investment Authority. This will be a private credit platform, direct private credit platform, and there are further projects we have in high yield and other areas where we're trying to ramp up our fund business. So that's on the Asset Management side. In Wealth Management, in M&A terms, I think in emerging markets, or let's call it more in the APAC and IWM side, we want to grow on an annualized basis between 3% and 5% per year. And in Switzerland, it's more between 2% and 4%. And that's really our goal. But the way I look at it is more on a client business volume. So it's not only NNA, which only relates to AuM but it's about credit volume, it's about AuM volume and it's about custody assets. And if you add them up, we've been growing steadily over the last few years. But I would like to see an increase in there, as we have some very clear strategies for each of the SUB businesses be it in Asia, for example, in China, in Korea, in Vietnam in other areas, as well as in the IWM area. Whether it's the Middle East, Latin America, Western Europe, and we had some very positive hiring momentum in some of these SUB regions. And in Switzerland, we have now launched CSX to also have more growth on the retail and affluent side, in addition to a continued positive momentum on the premium clients and upper high net worth side where we are working very closely also with the Corporate and Investment Banking colleagues, as part of our bank for entrepreneur strategy. So I think generally we are actually very well positioned to continue on this growth pattern.",

And then also kind of, you're talking about loan growth to offset, whether there is enough loan growth to offset that on it on a multi-year basis, rather than just for next year? And then on expenses, clearly, FX translation is a topic for the quarter. You've given guidance for 2020 on expenses, the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion. I know it's a long way out and there's a lot of moving parts, but would that range potentially come down into next year because of the translation effect on the weaker dollar? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thanks very much. Good questions. Thanks, Adam. I think it says the net interest income. I mean, I don't think I think I've generally given guidance before but often in Q&A, but I thought, just in case, nobody asked that and actually included in the script this morning. I think as I said, if we look at our net interest income for 2020, we clearly are seeing significant pressure from the falling U.S. dollar rates. And you see that across the businesses. And that's why basically I'm saying I'd expect our '20 net interest income to be roughly the same as it was in 2019. Because the measures that we took in 2019 including the dollar-ization of op risk, but also the other measures we took here in Switzerland, are being offset by that margin pressures. So there's clearly quite a bit going on in '20 as you'd expect, in terms of absorbing that. If I look at '21 and as I said, I think in terms of the residual margin pressure across that businesses, I would expect that to be offset by loan growth. That's - I think that's straightforward and what I can't commit to at this point, and we'll do our best to give more guidance as we continue, is well that loan growth will be sufficient to fully offset that CHF 100 million as that swap portfolio runs off. Remember, I think we announced this project back in the fourth quarter of last year. I think I said at that point, we termed out two years. So clearly, the bulk of this effect will be in 21 but it's not a cliff type thing, they're actually spread out. We actually see some in the short term, and then it phases through. I would have thought basically though but by '22, that essentially loan growth will be more than sufficient to offset the residual effects. But I think I just wanted to be clear, around '21 compared to '20 in terms of this. And I think on expenses, I think, the - as I said the - I guess the annualized run rate at this point is somewhere around CHF 16.4 billion of adjusted operating expenses if you take the first three quarters and multiply it up. So that would appear to be the top end of our range of CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion. You know, I think clear caveat on that in that, we have continued to accrue relatively conservatively for compensation. As I said, the 3Q20 comp across were up meaningfully compared to 3Q19. I feel the actual outturn will depend on just where compensation actually lands this year, which will depend pretty on performance and it will also depend on what we see across the peers. And I think also, the approach that we, as a bank, choose to take around the payment of variable compensation during the middle of a COVID crisis, which is an important factor for us. And I think looking towards 2021, I think we've been clear. There was a slide in terms of how much restructuring, which should yield benefits for next year. Although I would point out the bulk the benefits, the CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million only comes through in 2022. I think we'll have to make decisions as we go in through '21, which is how much of that we choose to reinvest and how much we release in terms of the expense number. And I'm not going to add more to that now. We are - we've announced obviously a Capital Markets Day on the 15th of December. And we'd obviously look to give more guidance at that point.",

We've obviously had a very volatile period these past few months, but your LCR stayed quite steady actually at around 109%. So, is there an opportunity to reduce this more towards peer group levels or is it the case that subsidiary liquidity requirements necessitate that the LCR has to be this high? And then the second question is revisiting the CET 1 ratio debate. So you said you're comfortable with 12.5% to 13%. If we take your capital return policy, consuming about 50% of net income, and then also organic growth, you know that organic growth, if it was management lending that tends to obviously be very light on the risk rate density. So it does seem to me that going forward, even with organic RWA growth, that you should be growing that 13%, rather than seen that fall into the 12.5% to 13% range. I just wanted to see how you think about that?",

    "text": "Thanks Andrew, thank you very much. I mean, I think on the LCR and I would merely say that, it's obviously been an uncertain year. We've had an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. We've seen a lot of, shall we say, central bank type responses to that. And I just personally think and I think it's a view shared by Thomas and by the Board, that maintaining a reasonable liquidity buffer at the parent and I think just seems that the prudent thing to do. And that's actually why I'm holding surplus equity at this point. I think as we get through '21 and we see how this situation actually develops, then we'll obviously review the size of liquidity buffer, I want to hold at the parent compared to that in the subsidiaries. But I think we have done some optimization, but definitely, at this point, I think having a central liquidity buffer, just seems the right place to be basically. I mean, I think and it's an uncertain world and I think it's a good - good thing to have at this point. It does clearly inflate our leverage. That's clearly the case. And it's noteworthy, you've not seen the improvement in the leverage ratio that you've seen in the CET 1 ratio and that's because we have elected to hold that liquidity buffer in the center. But I think - I think certainly for the next few months, maybe the next quarter or two, I think it seems the right place to be and I don't intend to revise it in the short term. As we go through '21, we can think about it. I think in terms of the CET 1 ratio, I don't disagree with your mathematics. I think it's all, I would say, I think we've given a pretty clear guidance about what we think the reg drain is going to be next year. But we also have to think around the FRTB impact in '23 and is it delayed at that point. But I think, - I think at this point, I think it's about the right balance for shareholders, you know, to sustain, to pay the second half of the '19 dividend to sustain our policy of increasing dividend by 5% per annum and then to relaunch the share buyback in January of 2021, I think it seems the right balance. We can review that as we actually go through the year but I think where we stand today, given the uncertainties, I think it's about right. But yes, I don't disagree with your conclusions. And obviously, it would depend on the level of Wealth Management growth we have. I mean, you know, quite clearly, if we do see opportunities to grow our Wealth Management business higher than targeted rates, then I think that's something we would definitely want to execute on. It's an extremely good business, we have an extremely high return on tangible equity, it would clearly drive RoTE more, the greater proportion we have, the faster growth we have. So if we can find opportunities to invest in that business, then I think that's something we should do.",

Could you maybe give us a hint about what may have changed to now put this towards the upper end? And in particular, are you from today's perspective, seeing anything that you may have to do on the Investment Bank's comp accrual in the fourth quarter? Also considering that your peer next door has actually relaxed its vesting criteria for deferred compensation? And the second question, and I guess it's also related to the real cost from your largest peer. UBS came up with the idea to accrue for share buybacks, which you didn't do. But you probably thought about it. Could you maybe talk about why you ended up not booking [indiscernible] accrual for buybacks, please? Thank you very much,",

    "text": "Stefan, good morning. And thank you for your questions. Look, I think in terms of the cost cutting numbers in terms of our cost guidance and I mean, I think we've been up front. There's obviously been a net FX cost in excess of CHF 100 million for PTI for the third quarter. But that comes through as an impact on revenues and a benefit to the OpEx number. And you're correct, essentially, and that's in there. And we've clearly seen more of that FX effect in the third quarter than we've seen in the first half of this year, when we gave the CHF 16 billion to CHF 16.5 billion guidance. That said, I think and clearly what we are seeing is a stronger performance in the Investment Banking part of our bank, which has a higher payout ratio than in the Wealth Management. That's just the facts of the matter. And I think we do need to be competitive in our compensation to reflect that, basically. And as we noted, we have therefore accrued more in the third quarter of '20 than we did in the third quarter of '19. So, I think that's just is where it is. I mean, clearly, we will need to see how the fourth quarter shapes up. First, in terms of performance when I - and I think as I said, I think we do expect to see levels of trading and transaction activity remaining elevated in this environment because there is strong client demand for hedging transactions in this and we - I think, as we've said, already, we have significantly rebuilt, leveraged finance pipeline. So these are all positives. But I think we obviously also have to be cognizant that there's a compensation cost for that as well. And that reflects both our own performance and that of our peers. And we don't have any particular views at this point, around changing deferral rules or voluntary comp or all the measures that that UBS took. So I can't really comment on what they chose to do. But we certainly don't have any plans at this point to make any changes. I think your second question then was actually, Stefan, was actually on the share buyback. And I mean, I can't really comment on UBS's decision to deduct $1.5 billion, I think it was dollars from their capitalization. I've not seen that done before, it seems to be unusual, at least. But I mean, I would point out that for UBS, they're actually going through a significant change in their distribution policy. So to my recollection, but you would know the numbers better than me, I think the dividend was something north of $0.7, $0.73, something like that per share, and they've actually reduced that dividend and replaced it with a share buyback. Now, dividends, as you know are deducted from capital as they actually occur. So we've already deducted the capital cost of our '19 dividend and nine - three quarters of our 2020 where the share buybacks are normally charged as they're actually incurred. So I can't - you know, I can't really and I think you should ask UBS why they chose to what they choose to do. But they're obviously in a different situation, having gone through a dividend cut, replaced them with share buyback, as opposed to Credit Suisse. I mean, our dividend policy and share buyback policy now dates back several years, we kept the dividend low, we started CHF 0.25, we said we'd increase it by at least 5% per annum. And it is super important to us that you know our shareholders approved the second half of the '19 dividend and they receive that dividend and that we accrue the '20. And we've always said share buyback then provides, shall we say, a more volatile component above and beyond that in which basically we can manage our capital. And I think that's the good, that's a good basis in which to actually manage our capital position. But our position is different from UBS's and that's all I can really say.",

So I think that pretty much everybody including ourselves is forecasting that credit losses fall sharply in 2021. But I think as you rightly pointed out at the beginning, the situation is fluid, we seem to be going into another phase of a lockdown. And I was just thinking like, in your mind, can you even construct a scenario whereby the credit loss is next year, pretty much on par with the credit losses this year?

    "text": "Two questions and thank you very much, Jernej. And first, in terms of the litigation charge and we know - we, as a matter of policy, we would not comment on specifically on any matter that's involved in litigation. I would say that the bulk of the charges in respect of one our cases, and those cases are all disclosed in our full year accounts and in the quarterly. But it's not just one. I mean, I think as you know, we look at all of the progression of our litigation book, and we make an appropriate provision at the end of each group, depending on where we are in terms of that process. And I think, my view, Thomas' view, remain as we - our general counsel was that it seemed prudent to increase that litigation reserve against those cases, basically, this quarter. So but I'm not going to comment on exactly which case it was, I'm afraid. And I think in terms of credit costs and I mean, I think clearly, central case is that CECL is a conservative accounting standard, more conservative than IFRS 9 because it does require lifetime loss accruals. And therefore, the standard has the impact of front-loading credit provisions to a greater impact than IFRS 9 does. And clearly, to a greater impact to, shall we say, traditional pre-CECL, PFS line in which you would see a pickup in specific provisions later in the cycle. And so I think our central case would be that and you see, at least the stabilization, potentially an improvement in the economic environment in 2021. And at that point, you would expect to see some of these CECL charges actually continue to reverse. But equally, you would expect to see some increase in specific provisions, as you see positions moving into RMI at that point. And I think that's the case, Jernej, you described. Now, clearly, if we were to see a reversal of the improvement in forecasts, it doesn't mean any reversal improvement in economies, because clearly, it's a forecast basis. I mean, clearly, we are still expecting for 2020 certain factors in terms of MS and if we see a reversal of that, then you could see that CECL charges actually increased again. And but I would point out that the increase that you saw in March was due to - the cut was due to a - really a radical change in the economic environment. If you go back to January and February, the end of last year, clearly people were not expecting a recession of this scale, they were expecting a relatively steady year with some concerns around, U.S. election, I think would be a consensus view. And we went from that to a significant reversal in the space of three months. So it was a huge shift in terms of the economic factors. And that was compounded by the fact you saw significant drawdown of facilities across, for us and for most of our peers, which increased the exposure. So you'd have to see a fairly radical change in the economic environment for 2021, to see a repetition of what you saw in the first half of this year. But you know Jernej, clearly at this point, it would not - it would not necessarily be prudent to assume that you're definitely going to get a CECR reduction in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year. I think there is clearly risk around that. But to achieve your scenario, or your question to me, you'd have to see something pretty radical, given the pace of change we saw in the first half of 2020.",

It's something that we have looked at in the past, I think about three, four years ago, we decided to stick - to stick to the Swiss franc reporting currency. But from that perspective, it's not something we are now doing because just we had one very strong FX headwind quarter but it's certainly something that we remain open in the mid to long term. But there are no intentions to change reporting currency at this stage before I go to the IB question, anything you wanted to add, David?",

If you look at Page 52 of the presentation, then you can see that whilst the U.S. dollar is our largest revenue base, it's also our largest expense base as well. And the Swiss franc basically is our second largest. So if you're - if you switch into U.S. dollars, you're then going to have volatility around your Swiss franc base at that point. Now, you might argue, as you said, well, the dollar is bigger, so let's do it. But I think it is important to remember, we are a Swiss bank. And I think there are many advantages to the Swiss franc. And it's certainly something that customers appreciate. Clearly, it does make for a more complex experience. I mean, ultimately, our shares are actually listed on the SIX and we trade in Swiss francs. And we have to earn Swiss franc earnings, and they buy back Swiss franc shares. And that's going to be the case, basically, regardless of whether we report in U.S. dollars or in Swiss francs, is all I'd add to that one.",

    "text": "So on the Investment Banking revenues, if you if you look at Page 11, you can see that we also show 2018, third quarter, and you can see that we had, for example, fixed income, very strong quarter, we were up 55% from 2018 to 2019. So 2019 was actually a pretty strong quarter and the plus 10% is in comparison to a strong quarter there. And in equity, sales and trading, we also had a strong improvement last year, 13% from the level of 2018. And capital markets, I think we did plus 33%, we are - we're doing very well. And this includes the advisory part. So it's true that we are traditionally more a search for yield, credit heavy, fixed income organization, which, is at the moment not benefiting as much as others from the volatility we see in rates and FX. But as hopefully, we will move towards a more normalized world, this volatility could die down at some point and we could benefit from that. And on the capital market side, whilst we do have very strong positions in equity capital markets in IPOs, especially, but also in the more investment grade DCM business, our [international] sponsor business has not benefited as much as the other two capital markets, businesses from the market development in the last two, three quarters. So from that perspective, I think we are extremely well positioned and with the new setup of the - both from a product perspective, but also geographic perspective, including Asia. You know, we think we have very, very good momentum.",

So on the point you made on offsetting margin of loan growth, if I look at your loan portfolio in the first quarter, the loan balance actually fell by around 2% or 3%. And on the group basis, and it's falling in most divisions. I guess part of this is driven by currency and would I be right to say that underlying loan process may be positive 2% or 3% because of that? And looking into 2021, when we talk about loan growth, do you think - where do you think this growth would come from? Would it just be a continuation of the loan growth in Private Banking? Or maybe the last question suggesting, would it be quite Investment Banking biased? I mean like just in terms of how the mix of dividend growth would look like? The second one is just a clarification regarding the structural swap positions of CHF 100 million negative for 2021? And is there any sensitivity to this with respect to the rate environment or and also whether there's a specific timing in terms of maturity of the swap position, in terms of whether it is a 2021 situation or 2022? If you can give us some color on that that will be helpful. Thanks.",

So look, you're right, the loan growth was rather modest, even in the third quarter, but it had stabilized.

But the biggest rate of change will be in 2021 because we see some this year, the majority next year, and then a minority in 2022. So I mean, I think it's certainly possible that loan growth will be sufficient to offset that. But I think it's worth highlighting that that is definitely a risk for 2021.

Firstly, on the bonus pool comment that you made, did you say that was in Swiss francs or in dollars, that you reduced the bonus pool by 7% year-on-year? And how do you see that move, is that a sort of one-off impact reflecting some of the one-off charges in the year or is that a sustained realignment of the profitability in that business in the direction that you need to go towards your targets? So that's my first question. The second question really was a slightly broader one of the Wealth Management side about flows where there was weakness in the Swiss business and in Asia in the quarter. But even just looking at the year as a whole, relatively modest flows I'd say so largely around sort of 2.5% net new money. And I just wondered how you saw prospects for flows in 2021, whether we can expect a little bit more growth than that in terms of inflows?",

    "text": "Okay, very good. Just wanted to make sure the technology works. So bonus pool, yeah, it's 7% down in Swiss franc, which in dollar terms is probably about flat. We clearly, we paid up in Investment Bank, we paid down in some of the divisions outside the Investment Bank or flat and Corporate Center somewhat down. So, overall, I think we have to pay for performance. And we had kind of a mixed 2020 in the sense that we had strong underlying performance, if you look at our PTI excluding significant items, we're up 6%, despite higher credit provisions and despite FX headwinds. But on the other hand, we had some one-offs and especially in the fourth quarter, legacies to address and that's why together with the Board, we came to view that the minus 7% is the right number. And we will continue to pay for performance going forward. So this is not a trend or anything, it's just the way we look at the bonus pool. In terms of Wealth Management flows. Look, I intentionally included a slide, Slide 17, which shows you more on the longer term, the client business volume, and that's the way I have always looked at the business, be it in my old role as Head of the SUB division, be it now in the Group role because this is really how you should look at the Private Banking franchise, namely Asset under Management, custody assets and net loans. And as you can see that we've been growing 4% in Switzerland over the years. And if you look at IWM and APAC, and these numbers here are in U.S. dollars, which reflect also the fact that 25% only and I think it's only 4% or 5% in APAC, are in Swiss francs. So in these two divisions, so it's much better look at U.S. dollar, we have been growing by 6% in IWM and by 14%. And that's why mid-single digit is the right target for SUB, mid-to-high single digit is the right target for IWM and double digit is the right target for APAC. You can also see some deleveraging going on in Switzerland, because if you see the loan in Switzerland, it went from CHF 160 billion to CHF 118 billion. But the custody assets went up from CHF 43 billion to CHF 54 billion. And for example, in Asia, we also had quite a lot of deleveraging USD 57 billion to USD 107 billion in terms of custody assets, but net loans went down USD 47 billion to USD 44 billion. So there was definitely some deleveraging going on. And that's for us an opportunity to grow and to increase our lending business in all three divisions actually. But this is the way I think one should look at Private Banking business. So you look at all three elements AuM, custody assets and net loans.",

The best on Slide 32, under the transaction column, you flag two things. One is that you've got a very tough comp in first half '20, given the elevated transaction levels that we saw. On the flip side, you suggest you're seeing a 34% increase in WM-related revenues in collaboration with GTS. I'm interested to know or how you think those two things were into play going into 2021, as one is, obviously somewhat of a headwind versus the second being a tailwind. That will be the first question. The second one I just wanted to turn to the Investment Bank. I know when we talk about it on the Investor Day, you talked about focusing on profitability and returns rather than market share. You also made a point about your business mix, namely, in equity you're overweight cash and derivatives and underweight prime and in fixed income, you've been underweight macro. But when I looked at Q4, there was obviously some degree of normalization and a lot of those business mix shifts, rates particularly pulled back and credit was actually stronger and yet for the third consecutive quarter, you've underperformed the peers pretty much in every business line, fixed income equities and primary. And so just to about the momentum kind of stalled a little bit there, so perhaps you could just elaborate on your thoughts on Investment Banking, more broadly in 2021? Thank you.",

    "text": "My pleasure. I mean, I think your question Andrew was around in terms of how we see the comparables, I think, and then obviously, the performance with GTS really because obviously, we saw strong growth during 2020. I guess your question, Andrew is, so what do we expect for '21, is it going to be up against that 2020 comparable, given the structural growth? Or how does it come together? Look, I think that was the point. But I, please correct me if I'm wrong, Andrew. But my answer to that would be, we clearly have seen a strong start to 2021 in terms of our GTS businesses. And that's what we're really reflecting, obviously, in terms of the comments we've made about the very strong January that we've had. Clearly, those comparables will get more tough as we actually move into the, as we now move into our one-year anniversary of COVID and you saw the market volatility picking up in March, April and May. So look, I think last year was very strong in terms of structural activity and it was strong in terms of volatility, and it will become more difficult to show that progression against that comparable, but it's certainly been a very good start to the year. And I think there is clearly a fundamental demand by clients in a market where it's difficult to earn net interest income, because interest rates are kind of zero or negative in most locations. And at that point that's leading to two trends. One, I think clients are looking to alternatives, they are looking investments to actually made to generate those returns. And clearly many of our corporate clients are also concerned around hedging risk, and how do they actually hedge some of the volatility, it's still a very uncertain market. And I think that does mean it's a favorable market for GTS. And it's a favorable market for transactions across the Wealth Management division. But I'm not sure I just want to get into a forward-looking view for how I see the next 10 months of the year against the comparables we saw for 2020. But it's certainly been a very good start for the year.",

So I think overall, we have despite the fact that we have less exposure to macro, for the full year, actually performed more or less in line with the market. We outperformed the market in capital markets and in M&A, as you can see also in one of my slides, equities was somewhat slower, that's true, but we've also had probably less market share on the equity derivative side. We have had quite solid performance with plus 12% in equities. And especially on the on the cash side, I'm quite satisfied. But also in equities, you should probably look at it a bit more holistically. And if you include equity capital markets, and look at the whole equity business in the fourth quarter, for example, I think we were up 44%, 45%, very much in line with our U.S. peers. So and, from that perspective, I'm not worried at all. Quite the contrary, actually, if I look at January, we've had a very strong start.

So far, we continue to see big demand for specs, not only in the U.S., but increasingly, also in Asia, and to some extent, also in Europe. So, at least in the short term, we don't see this to slow down. It provides an alternative to private equity and traditional IPOs. And it's something that is certainly here to stay, whether it will - is here to stay at these levels in the mid-to-long term, we'll have to see. But I also think that if you look at the overall macroeconomic situation, there will be a lot of companies that will need to raise capital in the next two, three, four quarters. As we come through this crisis, and people see opportunities, some sectors have been harder hit than others.

    "text": "So just first, on the buyback? Yeah, we obviously started the buyback in January. I think what you said is exactly on the money. You know, as Thomas has already remarked, I mean it's an uncertain 2021, COVID-19 we're still in the pandemic, we don't really know yet, what's going to be the extent of government support and stimuli. I think it's early to make forward looking projections around credit provisions, although I do accept that we're lower in '21 than '20. I think it seems prudent therefore, to aim for around about the CHF 250 million a quarter for the first quarter. And then we'll see basically, once we've actually got the first quarter behind us, and we say how the second quarter shaping up, at what level do we actually want to pace it. But I think that's certainly our strategy for the first quarter in terms of how we see it developing. And clearly, the first quarter start has been very promising, shall we say and let that continue, is all I'd really point there. I think in terms of recurring, I'd go back to my Slide 32, if you wouldn't mind, actually, Benjamin. You know, the point I wanted to make there is, if I look at recurring, there's obviously you saw the first as you might say, post COVID quarter 2Q20, we saw the drop, unsurprisingly, because you saw the sell-off in portfolios in March of 2020. That flows through to recurring margins on a recurring fees on a month plus one basis. So unsurprisingly, 2Q was the low point. And then you've seen a steady increase since then, notwithstanding, clearly the strengthening of the Swiss franc against some of the currencies, we earned these revenues in, particularly APAC and IWM. So I think it's been pretty good to see that actually heading up. The other factor in there, we've been explicit about for is clearly the Swisscard investment, which is booked towards recurring revenues in the SUB. You know, I think given the importance of foreign exchange fees to the Swisscard joint venture, I think it's unsurprising that that remains depressed right through 2020 and today basically. So that's clearly a fact, which is very dependent on COVID-19. The balance is beyond that, so, but I'm pleased about the trend in recurring commissions and fees, you can see why it stepped up and if it hadn't increased, then I would be worried. So I think a good trend there in terms of at what we're seeing. And clearly on net interest income, I think whilst you can see the bottom in recurring was 2Q20. I think we would hope that the bottom in net interest income was 4Q20, you could see the pace of decline is dropping. That's obviously been driven by both dollar interest rate move but also around the Swiss franc appreciation. I would certainly expect to see that stable to up. Stable probably in 1Q, up later in the year as we expand our lending initiatives on the basis that the Swiss franc remains around current levels, i.e. we don't see a further precipitous sell off in the dollar or anything else. That's just a slight caveat in terms of that but that's probably a fuller answer. I think your question was more on recurring Benjamin.",

    "text": "Thank you very much. Can you actually hear me well? Okay, okay, great. And so I've got two questions. One is on your lending franchise, and another one is on the kind of pace and direction of investment. So on lending, and I think I'm going to refer to I think, your Slide 17. And so in 2020, the actual growth or the actual kind of lending growth was pretty kind of lackluster, in quite a few places and not growing at all. But of course, when you talk about the holistic business volumes, when you talk about the defense of NII from let's just say mid-year this year, of course, the loan growth is a big part of that narrative. So could you kind of let us know, where do you see the opportunity, I suppose both geographically and on the product level and also whether you have to make any changes. Thomas, I suppose it's a question to you whether you had to make any changes from the perspective of the organization of the kind of lending franchise across Credit Suisse to kind of prepare for that medium term plans of kind of single digit growth in lending across the Wealth, in particular? And my second question is on your investment budget, kind of but more holistically. Could you tell us kind of where over the next two years, your investment budget is likely to get spent? And I'm not only talking about the gross savings, which you will invest, but in general, when you think about where in the business, you will still continue investing? Because of course, in like 2019, 2020, we from that next step outside, saw the kind of big changes to the Swiss business overall. And of course, with the launch of CSX as well, so yes, so where's the investment? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Magdalena. So on lending, what we saw was, especially in the first two quarters, significantly leveraging. We started to turn the corner in the middle of the year. But I still think that we have substantial upside in terms of our lending growth, into 2021 actually, in all three divisions, and in particular, in Asia, where you can see we have reduced our lending volume almost by 10%. So and it's really across the board. So whether it's traditional kind of mortgages here in Switzerland, whether it's single stock loans, whether it's traditional lombard loans, whether it's corporate loans in Switzerland, or also in IWM, and APAC, where we have invested in our corporate franchise, and obviously also in the U.S. and in our Investment Bank. So it's partially also M&A related, it's partially more traditional lending. So the opportunities are across the board. We have clear plans for every division, how to go off these opportunities. And from that perspective, I'm optimistic that we can increase our lending growth, which we have been a bit more cautious about, let's call it this way, in 2020. On the investment budget side, again, we have clear plans in every division, starting with our Group efforts around digitalization, IT, online banking, digital offerings, in every of the three divisions on the Wealth Management side, but also on technology and risk systems in the Investment Bank. And then obviously it's about certain products, whether its ESG products, whether it's Private Markets, whether it's in mandates. And then finally, expansion of footprints in certain regions, in particular, in Asia and the Middle East, where we see significant opportunities, but also Brazil, for example, and in other areas where we have hired teams and relationship managers, and where we will continue to invest.",

The second question very briefly, U.S. dollar, my model report in dollars now that you are saying, you're talking about Asia going to be reported in dollars, I'm just a bit confused how this will all work. And in that context, if you don't want to report in dollars, why not start hedging some of your earnings. And lastly, in terms of Slide 7, if I look at your phases, so clearly now, as you say in the growth phase, but you still produce adjusted profits. And clearly, the slide is on adjusted profits. And really what we want to move to post 2007, 2008, 2009 subprime crisis really to a level of stable profit clearly, as that drives the book value. And I was wondering, when we see Credit Suisse focusing on stated book value as of 2021? And if not, why not?",

    "text": "Thank you, Kian. Let me take those different points. So firstly, in terms of cost ambition. You know, we obviously ended 2020 at CHF 16.6 billion, which was slightly above my guidance, primarily, because I think, as Thomas has said already, given the generally strong trading performance we'd seen, I think it seemed relevant to keep the investments going. These are important for us to deliver our numbers in '22 and beyond. And in terms of the '21 numbers, I think we said at the Capital Markets Day, the range of between CHF 16.2 billion and CHF 16.5 billion, depending on how much of the CHF 600 million of investments we actually choose to make. And that roadmap remains intact. And although clearly, I think if we do see a continuation of the strong start to 2021, then I would expect to spend the bulk of that given what we want to do in the Wealth Management businesses. But that the guidance is intact. And those are the factors actually driving this. And I think in terms of FX and currency reporting, I think you know this is as well as you can, we have reported the Investment Bank in dollars since 2015 because the bulk of its revenues and its costs are actually U.S. dollar related. So, it's always been clear to do that and we've said that, that way in our slides. I think of the other three divisions, I think it makes - would make no sense to report SUB, in dollars. It's a Swiss franc business, has Swiss franc cost. It's based here in our home market. Whereas APAC does generate just over two thirds of its revenues, actually in dollar and dollar linked currencies and also has the bulk of its expenses in the same expenses. So I think it's probably easier to make the comparisons to show those numbers in dollars for everybody, because I think then you can compare the peers more easily. I thought a lot about IBM. But we have to remember, you know, the bulk of IBM's costs are here in Switzerland as well, even though essentially it does have a much broader exposure to dollar and non-Swiss franc currencies than some of our other businesses. And therefore is most exposed to the economic challenges that come from a strengthening Swiss franc and a weakening dollar or weakening euro for that matter. And that's why we're going to keep carrying forward that in Swiss franc. So that's how we're doing the divisions, I think so it's more transparent, and you can make the comparisons to the peers. That then breaks a broader question, which is, should we look again at moving our reporting from Swiss franc to U.S. dollars? Look, I think we looked at it with the board back in '19. We decided not to move from that, Switzerland is our home market, we operate in Swiss francs. And that was something that, we did discuss with central bank and other people basically, and I think it was a decision that was very much supported. It is, I'm not sure it's a bad thing to report in one of the world's strongest currencies. It's a bastion of safety and it's something that's important to us to our clients. And I would just remind you, the reporting currency doesn't affect the economics. It's just how you choose to present things. And at the end of the day, we're listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange, and we buyback our shares in Swiss francs. So we have to generate Swiss francs to actually deliver this. That then gets to your next question, which is okay, what about the economics? I think, generally speaking, as a bank, we're quite well balanced. The only open exposure we have really is actually to sterling, because we do have a sterling cost base, but there's not these days a great deal of sterling revenues in the world markets, essentially. So we generally do have a short sterling position, which has been obviously favorable post '16, marginally less favorable in the last year or so. And we'll see what happens next. We have looked at hedging that occasionally. But I mean, in reality, it's the economic base of the business and hedging basically only smoothes the FX effects rather than anything else. And I don't think it really makes a great deal of sense to do it. But it wouldn't make any sense for us to hedge the Swiss franc dollar, given our liabilities are ultimately in Swiss francs in terms of how we actually operate. So I have given it some thought. You know, it clearly, as I said, I think that the division is most exposed to this economically is IWM. It's a challenge in terms of the currencies and how they actually choose to work. And your next question, then I think was around adjusted was reported. Look, a few points. Firstly, our primary metric remains reported PTI. If you look at the LTI metrics for the [Exp], it's reported, is the reported RoTE that we actually report that sits out there and that's how it actually works. The secondary measure, which is the tangible value of share is adjusted only for FX and own credit volatility. Because I think otherwise, you'd be creating incentive for Credit Suisse to have a lower credit rating, which would be not the right thing to do. So that does remain our primary metrics. When we announced the restructuring measures last July, we said for the period of this time, it made more sense to focus on the adjusted numbers because otherwise, you'd see the reported trends disrupted by the restructuring costs. Clearly, the restructuring program comes to an end at the end of the second quarter. And there afterwards I think it will be our intention to move back towards reported numbers. But we did say for this period, what we're doing it, we'd actually look at the adjusted numbers. And as I said, clearly, as I said in terms of your final point about adjusted tangible value per share, the adjustments are purely for FX and for own credit, there's no adjustment for restructuring costs. There's no adjustment for litigation or anything like that, in terms of how we see it.",

So and I guess just with, I guess, so far, a large part of the AuM growth is driven by the market performance. Just wanted to understand a bit better, what that means for the margin going forward and in terms of the assets that you have, which don't really generate the kind of reoccurring fee margin, how that's going relative to AuM that does generate reoccurring fees?

    "text": "Well, look, just a few points Amit. I think we've made this point before but the banks do not have the same AuM definition. We went through a number of changes back in 2012, 2013, which I think you know as well as we did. And we went for a very tight, narrow definition in terms of what actually qualifies for AuM, you know, we limit the amount we give for lending, we have restricted in terms of the amount of single stock positions, and we have a firm criteria around guidance and advice. That's one reason why AuM is a smaller subset of our total client business volume than it might be for some of our peers. I think that's right, because essentially, that means that, we're actually looking at assets where we're actually actively earning fees. So you're not going to see the dilution of gross margin, from actually recognizing more AuC in terms of this. So that's just a sort of point in terms of comparison, and myself or any of the IR team be happy to talk through this. This is something I review regularly with the Audit Committee. It's an important control metric for us. I think then for turning into Page 32, really, I think, rather than giving you a margin guidance, because I think it comes down to the different trends, the businesses, I'd just summarize what we think, which is, I do think that we are at the bottom. So long as exchange rates don't move further downwards against the Swiss franc or the Swiss franc doesn't appreciate further in terms of our net interest income, particularly as we'll see lending growth. And I'm just making that comment sequentially clearly, not year-on-year, because, you had a completely different FX rate in the first quarter of 2020. But I think we are sequentially we've seen the bottom in terms of that. Recurring, I think the fees we're talking about are linked to the value of portfolios. So that will come through on a, as you said, a month plus one basis, so typically flows through into the next quarter. And transaction, we've said what we said, I think our comments around the strong start to January should not be interpreted as just relating to the Investment Bank. It's certainly true, the Investment Banks had a good start. It's certainly true, though, that our APAC business and we are generally seeing transactions being strong across the bank. So I think that's what but certainly, I'm not trying to guide you to lower net or gross margins.",

    "text": "Good morning from my side as well. Actually, I have only two questions left. It's always tempting to look at operating performance and excluding all the one-offs, I guess, but then it becomes problematic when these one-offs become recurring, to an extent. And I just went back and I looked at consensus estimates for the litigation charge at Credit Suisse, at the start of January of last year. And it was CHF 58 million. And it ended up being CHF 988 million. The consensus for this year is CHF 68 million. And for '22, it's CHF 36 million. And I was just wondering, so just two questions. And I think to an extent they go back to Kian's questions as well on stated versus underlying. To what extent do you think consensus is accurately capturing what you expect for litigation and non-operating charges more broadly, for this year and next? And then Thomas, a question to you. To what extent were you surprised in your new role as CEO by the extent of non-operating charges that keep popping up at Credit Suisse? And then the second question is just very basic. So on Page 5, you quote, low bond yields as one of the factors affecting or pressuring this year's results. I think we can see from your chart very nicely. How this trend is reverting? And I was wondering if you see that as a potential tailwind to your results this year. Thank you very much.",

    "text": "Okay, I'll take the first one and then maybe, David you can take the second one. Look, it did only partially come as a surprise. I think we said on various previous sessions with you, for example, that we are looking at some of the positions in Asset Management and clearly the situation about York was something that we had discussed previously and was something we wanted to address, I wanted to address in my first year. And the legal expenses or the legal provisions around our RMBS docket was something that we knew at some point will materialize. These legal cases sometimes have their own timeline and their own dynamics. I'm very happy that we managed to address the MBIA case. And I think it's also appropriate what we have done for the balance. I'm not going to comment on whether the consensus is right or wrong. But I do definitely think that what happened in the fourth quarter was necessary, was the right thing to do in my first year, to address some of these historic situations. And from that perspective, it didn't come as a surprise. But it was also actually it was interesting that both when we announced the York situation as well as the MBIA, the share price went up. So I think actually, investors are appreciating that we follow through on our promise that we want to address legacies and work through them. So from that perspective, I think it was the right thing to do, it gives us a much better and clear platform now for '21. And we have solid momentum in the first six weeks in all four divisions. We are focused on growth in all four divisions. And from that perspective, we can really now focus not only, thanks to the addressing the legacies I mentioned, but also on the back of what we announced in the summer, namely putting the two Investment Banks together, putting risk and compliance together, creating SRI on the group level, addressing the Neue Aargauer Bank here in Switzerland and launching digital offering here in Switzerland, the new one together with reducing the branch network. These were all measures that were done in the middle of COVID-19 in the summer, which I feel very good about because now we can focus on growing the business on all dimensions. So that's how I would answer your question on operating performance versus one-off and whether this was a surprise.",

    "text": "Perhaps I could just make a few supplementary points Jernej on this one, I think, firstly, the reasonably possible loss disclosure at the end of the third quarter was CHF 1.2 billion. So and I think there's been very full disclosure around the RMBS docket and other litigation risks in all of our reporting. I think the second point, the MBIA case obviously went to trial last year. And we obviously received an adverse judgment on the end of 31st November, and we made an appropriate ad hoc statement there afterwards around it. I think that judgment was probably worse than we expected. And therefore, it was not something we wanted. But I think we reacted appropriately, both in terms of the provision we took in respect of the MBIA case, and the broader read across for the rest of the year. The book we actually took as a back of that and I think it's good though, actually I mean, if you go back to what we said in the 1st December, we talked about a risk of $680 million in respect to the MBIA, you can, so we actually closed it out at $600 million. I think it's an interesting question, which we could discuss, has it been right to actually fight these RMBS cases since they go back to 2005 to 2007? I think the answer is yes. I think if you look at the settlements that are reached in some of these cases by other banks, in the 2011, 2012 period, they were clearly a great deal higher than this. So I think it has been the right thing to do. But I just would just caution, there's not been - no lack of disclosure around these positions in this risk in terms of that. And I think we have, as Thomas said, made the appropriate read across to the rest of the book in terms of our fourth quarter provisions. Secondly, I'd also point out that the significant items do include some positives. And obviously, you've had the two tranches, the gains on Allfunds. And that does remain, I think, conservatively marked, compared to some of the speculation we've seen around this asset. And secondly, I think, obviously SIX continues to be a very well-run bank utility, and I think has generated gains for us. And that's come through as well. So there are positives as well as negatives. So I think the issue for '20 is in 2019 you had a net credit from such write-downs whereas in 2020, you had a net debit in terms of that, just to make a couple of points. So then the next point, really just in terms of long bond yields. And I think we've probably said as much as you want to say of net interest income, which is, I think we have, we are at the bottom and I think we should start to see it improve as we build lending sequentially. Clearly given the FX moves. I think that'll be much more challenging on a year-on-year basis. But if FX rates do remain at current levels, given the lending initiatives, I don't, I think we'll probably won't see too much of a shortfall, maybe something in the CHF 50 million to CHF 60 million on a constant currency basis for 2021 compared to 2020. So I think we're coming through the inflection point around net interest income trends.",

And the reason for that is, as I commented before, there were certain items in the judge's order of the 31st November, which, I think were adverse to us. And we looked both in terms of the MBIA case and in terms of the read across to the rest of the RMBS docket, and we wanted to reflect that fully. It is what it is, it's a matter of fact, is clearly a number of other cases and other appeals going on around that. But that's why you see that balance, basically. And I think the second point in terms of the expenses, I think I was asked a question earlier on basically, by one of your colleagues. And I think it was Kian. And just to reiterate, our guidance does remain CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion, dependent on the level of the CHF 600 million investments we identified in the capital markets that we choose to invest. At this point, given the strong start this year, I think it would seem prudent to be making those investments to support the longer-term growth of our Wealth Management businesses in '22 and '23, particularly in fast growing markets. But clearly that's a decision which is constantly under review. And we'll see how 2021 develops. It is an uncertain year, we are not through COVID-19 yet, but it has been a good start.",

So the good side of CHF 16.9 billion, the FX neutral cost base is CHF 17.4 billion. Now, when we talked about expenses of 2020, the prior CMD, the upper end of the range was CHF 16.9 billion in a good year. So I'm just trying to work out where this additional spend come from. I know you're talking about investment budgets going forward. But can you sort think about that in a backward-looking sense? How much a business is investment in growth? And how much is this is rectifying some control issues or anything like that? And then, what should the J curve on this spend look like? When will the revenues come through?

Clearly, you're flagging strong transactional and trading revenues but clearly the year-over-year FX headwind is fairly sizable. Thank you.",

Firstly, in terms of the cost guidance, yes, it is complex because you will see in 2021 current exchange rate, a further drop in expenses due to the FX moves, obviously subject to how rates actually pan out. But I think in terms of things that we chose to spend on, I think, firstly, and we have talked before about the growth in China. Thomas has talked about it, that is critical for us. But I think Secondly, there is obviously everything else we actually want do in APAC because it is our fastest growing region. I think that's where a lot of the opportunities lie. I think but in terms of other things, yes, I think it's very important to maintain appropriate in terms of your control infrastructure. There's plenty of risks out there. And I think we're spending appropriately in terms of that. So that's what I'd say at this point. I think the expense what we gave at the Capital Markets Day, I think does very much remain intact. The interest, FX have moved a bit since then. But you know, I think that's all I'd really say in terms of the costs, really.",

We also addressed some structural opportunities in IWM and in other areas of the Corporate Center. Real estate is another area where we see some opportunities. But generally, I also think it's important to really manage, especially in the three private banking divisions, the cost base dynamically and in a cost income ratio basis and not absolute. We are investing, we are rolling out in China, we are investing in the Middle East, we are investing in Thailand and in Korea. So as we want to grow, we see huge growth opportunities in private banking, we made that clear in the mid-December Capital Markets Day. This is a market that grows 7% globally, and we want to grow, at least with the market. And if you open branches, like we opened in Riyadh, or we do a rollout of relationship analysis for onshore private banking in China, that costs money. But we are financing a lot of these investments with some structural moves, like we did in 2020 in the summer, that I feel very good about. We didn't see the benefit yet of those, but it allows us to actually invest in growth and self-finance a large portion of that.",

So we, it tends to be a sort of medium-term type swap book to reduce interest rate volatility. So we don't have the up or the down volatility that you see for some of the U.S. banks relative to the curve. And as I said before, I think I did give a general guidance a few minutes ago, which is, if I look at the interest rate effect for this year, and net of the FX move, I expect to be down about CHF 50 million for full year 2021 compared to full year '20.

But if you exclude that, there is a very clear correlation between Asset under Management and recurring revenues, which we have seen some degree of margin erosion. But at the same time, we are very much focused to increase our mandate penetration. That's our clear strategy in all three private banking divisions. I think with our performance we've had in our CIO office, but also with our efforts around ESG. And new mandates, be it for high net worth, but also ultra high net worth, which would include also private equity investments. So Platinum Mandate, as we call them, we are offering new opportunities for our clients to have tailor-made mandates depending on their risk appetite. And this is how we are planning to further increase our recurring revenues. And as you can see on Page 32, whilst year-on-year we are down and there is also some translation element in there.

If you were to translate that into dollars, we're actually up about 10%. So I think overall, we have a good trajectory, very healthy M&A in the business, if you took and analyze. I agree with you, the fourth quarter was a bit weak, but I don't look at M&A on a quarterly basis. This is more like an annual basis and it kind of shows some of the trends. But again, I can just come back to my earlier observation that the way you should really look at the banking franchise Private Banking franchise is client business volume. That really gives you the best sense of how the franchise is growing. But the CHF 8.6 billion in Swiss francs is actually higher on the like-for-like basis than the CHF 8.7 billion we had in 2019. Look and then with respect to the moral hazard, this is somewhat theoretical question, we had the legal strategy at the time in 2009, 2010. You can argue whether it was the right strategy or not, but, as David said, we chose that way and overall it probably was not the wrong strategy. But I can also say that unlike others, we have settled, for example, the RMBS case with the DoJ. That was done in 2016 and from that perspective, some good efforts were made by my predecessors. And some of these litigations have their own, as I said, their own tactical considerations with respect to when do you settle and when do you actually go to court. And each bank has to do that, as they see fit, depending on the case. So that's all I can say to that.",

I have a couple of questions on the Wealth Management and related businesses, mainly referring to your disclosure on Page 17, where you said that the client business for them is an aggregate of AuM custody assets. And I know that is something that you commented on before. The two questions on this, firstly, on the especially strong growth in Custody A asset in APAC, and also to a lesser extent in SUB compared to the steady performance in IWM for custody assets. Is this primarily a reflection of the transaction nature of the businesses in APAC or whether we should expect custody assets to fluctuate around the transaction volatility? Or can I look at it another way whether it could be a temporary parking space for the money, there's some expectation of this converting into a more profitable AuM elevator stage? A second question relating to this is that if I look - looking ahead, is it fair to say that you're steering us to focus on from AuM to this broader client business volume as a better reflection of your Wealth Management performance? And I guess, then, in terms of gross margin, would it give us a better forecast or estimate, if you think about it separately, like NII margin on loans, recurring fees on AuM and transaction on the asset would it gives us a better feel for it?

One, that we saw some deleveraging, as I said earlier, but also, there are quite a few of them which are single stock positions with performance, strong equity markets in Asia, obviously. So we saw both trends. In Switzerland a bit similar but with less I think the equity exposure, single stock exposure in custody assets is probably proportionally smaller. There's also a lot of cash in there, there's some gold in there, etc. So these are single asset class positions where we have low or no revenues, which we define as custody assets. To your second question, you could definitely make the argument that you should look actually at your margins in percentage of the overall client business volume. Obviously then, we would deviate a bit from the industry standard, which is to relocate a percentage of the AuM. We are currently not planning to change that but we are planning to be disclosing client business volume going forward because, as I said before, I think it's the right way to look at the franchise.",

And the fact is that we can build on a very strong operational performance in Q1. We have taken the measure with the mandatory convertible to strengthen our balance sheet. We want to take any discussion on capital off the table. On a pro forma basis, we are back at 13%, higher than we were at the end of the year last year. And this was really the basis now for us to look forward and to move forward and to be back in business. So that was really the key.

As one would assume, that shrinking in prime will also weigh in directly on cash and derivatives as well in your equities franchise.

The Board supported us. And then we went ahead with that placement. So there was no request by FINMA in any shape or form. But with this, I would like to hand over to David to go through your 3 questions.",

    "text": "No. I'd just second what Thomas said. I think we previously guided to a minimum of 12.5%. I think we really wanted to take the capital question off the table. So I think getting to an implied number of 13% with -- including the Allfunds credit, I think it was a very important thing. It also boosts our leverage ratio to 4% too. And as Thomas said, that was very much our decision. We discussed it with the Board, and we executed against that. And we're obviously very grateful for the support of both our existing and new shareholders in this. Just in terms of your detailed questions then. So there were 2 FINMA-related capital add-ons, one which I actually mentioned in our annual report, which is a Pillar 2 add-on of CHF2 billion. And that basically increases the minimum requirement from 10% to, I guess, 10.6%. That is in respect of the Greensill supply chains funds matter. The second is the one we actually show on the capital walk slide, which is the add-on, which is proportionate to the size of the residual positions that we hold in respect of -- on behalf of the U.S. hedge fund. And as those now declined towards 0, we've shifted obviously -- just over 97% of them. That buffer actually reduces proportionate to that. I think in terms of operational risk, You're correct. The op risk charge that I'm alluding to in the capital walk is in respect primarily the RMBS matters when we took -- the charge we took in the fourth quarter of last year. That's going through the process at this point. The number is not yet final, but I wanted just to remind you that we will have that impact in the second quarter. Yes, I clearly can't preclude any other add-ons. I think it would be wrong for me to do so. This is, though, a credit risk event regarding U.S. hedge fund, not an unauthorized trading issue. So it's not strictly speaking op risk point. But at this point, that's all I would want to say at this time. So I think those were your 2 questions in terms of capital. By the way, I just should note and you may have seen it in the press release that we have announced the settlement of the single largest RMBS case today. That's the so-called Euphrates Case for USD 500 million. That's exactly in line with the provision that we took in the fourth quarter. So there's no incremental charge in respect of either the first quarter or the second quarter of that. I think we're pleased to have resolved a matter which I guess must be now about 15 years old. Now moving on to your second question, which was around prime. I think I'm helpful and unhelpful, I think, if I'm being honest. Just to give you some idea, that $35 billion leverage reduction is about 1/3 of the total leverage we have deployed in prime. And I would expect clearly our prime revenues to fall as a consequence of that. But I think in terms of the actual revenue impact, quite clearly, we will be focusing our prime business around clients that have multiple connectivity to Credit Suisse, i.e., important across our businesses and obviously defocusing on clients that have much less connection across the banks. So one would clearly expect we'll be, at that point, reducing the lowest ROA businesses, but it does move prime to being more of a utility to actually support the overall bank as opposed to a stand-alone business model, which I think is the right way to go. But yes, we will see some revenue reduction. It's going to be difficult to estimate it given those 2 constraining factors. And that will obviously come through as a reduction in our equity sales and trading revenues going forward. In terms of SPAC number, I might have to ask Kinner to help me in terms of outstanding balance. But I think just to put the numbers in context, there was about CHF280 million of SPAC revenues out of the CHF1.4 billion of Investment Banking, capital markets and advisory numbers. Actually, I don't think we've given the de-SPAC before, so I'm not going to give it now basically. But as you rightly say, Andrew, we recognized just under half of SPAC revenues on issuance and the other half is dependent on the successful conversion or de-SPAC-ing of the entity normally within the 2 years following issuance. But yes, I'm not going to give the actual pipeline now. But what is clear is that more than half of the issuance revenues are still waiting there, subject to the appropriate due diligence and completion of the de-SPAC-ing, which may not always occur in the case of all of the SPACs, just to be clear.",

Can you -- you've got about $5 billion cash but also about $5 billion remaining exposure in those funds. And I just wondered if you could put a number on how much of that $5 billion remaining exposure is to doubtful borrowers, including obviously, Gupta, but also some of the other doubtful borrowers who seem reluctant to pay? So that's my first question. And my second question is on the other painful episode, I'm afraid, on the Archegos situation. Could you walk us through the mechanics of how that loss came about in terms of what the outstanding gross exposure was at the moment of problem? How much margin you had? And the sequence of events in terms of where you slowed to sell down? Or how do you assess what happened? Those are my 2 questions, please.",

    "text": "Okay. So I will take the lead on Greensill. So the CHF5.4 billion you mentioned, and we have very good visibility, I would say, on up to CHF7.5 billion. And then the rest, as we announced a couple of days ago, roughly CHF2.3 billion relates to 3 distinct situations where we have very strong legal positions. We also have discussions with insurance coverage around these situations. And these will take several weeks, if not months and quarters to resolve. But this is something that we are working through. This is our asset management team that is working with advisers, with the advisers also to Greensill and to the underlying companies. We have constructive discussions there. And it's simply premature now to make any estimates what the ultimate outcome will be, but we have very constructive discussions. And this is the -- under the lead of Credit Suisse Asset Management.  On Archegos, look, as you know, that this was a very special situation around the family office that was covered not only by us, but also 5, 6 other brokers out of Prime Services with a lack of disclosure, which I think also regulators now are looking into that had explosive growth over the last 12 months. And we are not commenting on detailed exposures, but we clearly had issues there that we are now looking into as part of our investigation around the absolute limits around the margining, around Delta One and the situation around the underlying concentration risks. So this is something we're all looking into and ensure that this cannot and must not ever be repeated. But it's too premature now to go into more details.  I'm very satisfied that we have essentially gone out of the exposures now. We have, as we said, reduced the exposures by over 97% to a very moderate number now, which we are managing through for the coming weeks with the clear intention that we'll get as quickly as possible to a 0 level.

We reduced our position in a lawful and orderly manner, I think with respect to the challenges we actually faced. And I think as far as I can tell, in terms of looking at the prices we achieved compared to the other prime brokers, the exit prices were broadly similar over the period of time. That's the point I'd make first.  I think the second point I'd make is, it is an exceptional event. I think the last time the industry has seen anything like this was LTCM in terms of its size and consequence, it's an industry-wide issue. But that said, I think, as Thomas has summarized, we've obviously conducted an immediate read across to anything similar, any other immediate lessons learned to ensure that, that is not the case within the rest of our prime portfolio. And we're obviously very focused on the investigation review that the Board of Directors is leading in terms of the longer-term lessons to be learned around this particular position.  But as Thomas said, clearly, this is likely to be a broader industry issue as well, given the number of other prime brokers involved and some of the disclosure requirements relating to these types of funds.",

Because, of course, you have described what you've done so far, you've described today, the Board investigation. But kind of when you look back and that's particularly at the risk framework, the decision-making, the communication between executives, are there any kind of early learnings that -- or any kind of additional color that you can share with us to kind of to make the understanding of the situation, and is more helpful not only for yourself, but of course, as you said, on an industry level as well?  And my second question within that is that, how do you see this particular credit event? Is it isolated? We've talked about kind of your review of Prime Brokerage. But within the broader risk management at the IB level, are there any other businesses that you would be reviewing as well as a part of a kind of broader potential rethink of the business? So that's question #1.  And question #2 really is about IWM and the revenue trajectory there. Because, of course, we have seen very, very strong kind of net new money numbers. But of course, when we look at the kind of underlying revenues, we're of course seeing kind of weakness in NII, but also on the kind of transactional and recurring fees are kind of broadly flat. How should we -- and I know that there's a question about mix, there's a question about effects within the numbers, too. But going forward, how should we kind of think about that revenue trajectory within that part of your wealth business?",

    "text": "Okay. I will take the first one and then maybe, David, you can take the second one. So on Archegos early learnings, clearly, one of the early learnings is that the disclosure has to be improved around especially family offices in that business. Secondly, I think we have to look at absolute limits much more carefully, about margin limits, about how we look at Delta One and correlation between short and long positions and we have to look at concentration risk management. So these are all elements that we are extremely focused and on which basis we have done the first analysis of the entire book. But there will certainly be more learnings to come through as we go through the next few weeks in terms of the review that we are doing internally, but also that will be done as part of our excellent review with our regulators.  Is it an isolated case? Look, I definitely hope it is, and I think it is. But we are obviously reviewing the entire bank now just to make sure that our risk processes and systems are where they should be. And clearly, the -- historically, the prime business has not been subject to major losses, and that is now our prime focus. But we are, together with Christian Meissner, the first line of defense, but also the second line of defense, our Risk -- new Chief Risk Officer and the Head of Risk for the Investment Bank, doing a special effort now to review the entire division.

    "type": "answer",
    "text": "Sure, of course. Magdalena, I think a few points to make really. I mean, firstly, as you know, the primary currency in terms of which IWM operates the largest single one is actually -- in revenue terms is actually the U.S. dollar. And if you look back to the first quarter of last year, beginning of the COVID crisis, you saw the dollar trading substantially stronger against the Swiss franc, which we report in compared to where it actually is now basically.  So what you're seeing is twofold. Firstly, the adverse impact on translation of those dollar revenues into Swiss francs. And then secondly, because of the importance of the dollar to IWM, you've obviously seen a very sharp reduction in U.S. dollar interest rates, which were at a peak a year ago. So that translates through into lower net interest income.  Now the point we've made before, though is sequentially, that is stabilizing. And even before the slight appreciation we see in the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc in the last 4 months, and some pickup, but limited in terms of longer-term U.S. dollar interest rates. So that's the point I made to start off with.  And clearly, in terms of recurring revenues, you see the same trends. Now generally speaking, transaction revenues across the whole Wealth Management business were substantially up compared to last year. They're down in IWM partly for the currency effect, but also because the first quarter of last year was extremely strong for IWM. And I think I'd just refer you, Magdalena, to Pages 38 and 39 within the presentation. What you see there basically is the gross margin trends within IWM PB. You can see it was a high of 114 basis points in the first quarter of last year, a low of 95, 96 and 97 in the second half of last year, now ticking up to 99. And in net terms with some of the cost measures, obviously, it was 37, down to 23, back up to 37 in terms of that.  I think the second point I'd actually make is actually on the following slide, Slide 39. And you can see that the growth in client business volume, which I think shows the expansion, both in terms of assets under management, but also in terms of net lending activity in IWM, which I think does support what we're seeing in terms of the sequential improvements in terms of that business. But transactions in IWM were particularly high in the first quarter a year ago, Magdalena.",

    "text": "Sure. Yes. I think just to summarize, basically, if you look at page -- as you say, Page 11 of the earnings release and then the capital walk on Slide 22. So in essence, as I said already, there was a USD 2 billion Pillar 2 add-on in respect to Greensill operational risk basically which was imposed by FINMA in March. And I think we -- and as I said, we disclosed it in our annual report. There's then this add-on in respect of the U.S. hedge fund positions which is a proportion of that, which I've actually included on Slide 22. And then as you say, basically, I've made it clear that the operational risk number, which I've included towards the right-hand side, that is primarily in respect of the RMBS matter. It's not in respect of anything else at this point. There are certain other methodology changes I put in there as a sort of precautionary matter in terms of that. But I've not included an operational risk charge in respect of either.  But I think in terms of -- I think it's difficult to truly speculate on this because this is clearly sort of a developing matter, and we'll see how this changes over time. But I mean, quite clearly, because Credit Suisse itself has not suffered a loss, operational or otherwise, in respect of Greensill apart from the CHF30 million impairment of the fair value loan, so there's no basis for an operational risk charge to Pillar 1 pending such a loss.  I think in terms of the U.S.-based matter, as I said, this is a credit charge. It's not an operational risk failure. But I think quite rightly on Page 11, it's a risk factor. I can't preclude that as the -- both the Board investigation and as the FINMA investigation projections, we don't have some kind of add-on in future. But I'm not aware of such an add-on at this point, and it's impossible to estimate what that would be basically. So -- but I think it is appropriate we disclose it, Daniele, in the risk factors.",

    "text": "Actually, not really, actually. I mean I think there were 3 reasons why we wanted to have a 13% ratio and to actually reach it quickly with the issuance of the mandatory. I think, first, I think there's been obviously an extensive amount of media coverage about Credit Suisse. People have raised questions around the capital ratio, particularly before we put out the release at the beginning of April. And I think that's unhelpful. I've been here before. And I think, particularly unhelpful to our Wealth Management business. And I think taking it off the table is exactly the right thing to do in terms of the sort of capital security of the bank.  And I think that's true both for the CET1 ratio, but also the CET1 leverage ratio because, as you know, Switzerland has a relatively high floor in terms of the leverage ratio requirements.  I think the second point basically is, I think that whilst we are reducing capital in the investment bank, I think given the momentum we've seen in the Wealth Management businesses, I think allowing that growth to continue in a prudent and disciplined fashion I think is the right thing to do. And I think if we hadn't raised the mandatory and had a 13% goal, then I think that could have imposed undue restraints in terms of that.  And thirdly, and I just would caution this is more of a sort of personal view, I think there's a lot of volatility in these markets. And I'd rather basically operate with the bank at a 13% ratio, and that was a discussion we had at ExB and recommended to the Board, and the Board supported that. And I think that's the prudent thing to do in respect of 2021.

The second question is related to, if I can come back to risk. Where are you on reviewing the total risk book of the firm of the group? And in that context, when are we going to expect a new Head of Compliance and Risk Officer, I assume there will be two separate positions, if you can confirm that, and will that be coming from the outside?

And that clearly addressed some of the issues, the structural issues we had.  Now look, the IB overall size as well as look is now clearly addressed in a second step now, primarily now with focus on Prime Services. And it's something that after an event like this, it's understandable that you asked that question. But we have some tremendous franchises in capital markets, in M&A, in SP, just to name a few. And as you can see also in some of the charts that I showed, we've had significant market gain -- market share gains in various areas.  So -- but this is clearly also something we are now going to discuss with Christian, with Antonio when he's on Board, and we'll have a further review. So this is certainly something that will continue to be discussed also internally. But we have definitely made a lot of progress in the business.  And as the first quarter numbers have shown, we were really on the right track. With 80% revenue growth, I think we have pretty much outperformed everybody else in the first quarter. So to say that everything is broken on the IB, which I kind of imply from your question, is a bit unfair, I think, against this background.  With respect to risk and compliance search, we have started that search. We have obviously very strong hands on the table now with Jo Oechslin and Thomas Grotzer. Jo Oechslin very clearly said, this is something he's prepared to do, but only on an interim basis, and he's very experienced, and he has already had very positive impact on the business. But we will now move forward with that search. We have not decided yet whether risk and compliance should be 1 or 2 functions. This will be also part of the outcome of the search. As you -- if you look at the top -- the largest 10 banks, maybe the largest 6 banks in the U.S. and the 4 -- largest 4 banks in Europe away from us, you can see that about 50% have risk and compliance together, and the other 50% have it separate.  We discussed it at the time with the regulator, with the Board. We have clearly some very good reasons to keep it together, including technology and other areas, anything that has to do with nonfinancial risk. So -- but there are also -- clearly now there was a need given the short-term nature of the need to have a comprehensive review across our group on all the risk positions that we wanted to keep it separate for the time being as far as the leadership is concerned with Jo and Thomas. But we kept certain areas together like technology for the 2 functions, that continues to be one team, and they're supporting both sides. And we will take a decision on that together with the Board of Directors over the coming weeks and months as we go through the search.  In terms of NNA, look, it's early days in the first quarter, but there have not been major flows in either direction. So it's too early to comment on NNA at this stage.",

    "text": "Alastair, I'll take the question. So firstly, I think, as I said in my presentation, you can see in the compensation and benefits line, it was about CHF109 million lower this year than it was actually last year. And that was primarily almost entirely due to reductions in variable compensation. So that gives you one measure. Now if we're stepping back and saying, given the improvement in revenues that we actually saw in the first quarter ex the U.S. hedge fund issue, would comp and benefits have been higher than last year, the answer is, yes, they would. But they wouldn't be higher anything like the amount you've actually said.  I think I step back and we have obviously CHF3.6 billion of 1Q PTI, excluding the U.S. hedge fund loss. I think you could basically say there was CHF109 million contribution of variable compensation in that. You might want to add a bit more in terms of how much I might have accrued. But I have to say every which way I actually looked at the first quarter number, it comfortably exceeded CHF3 billion excluding that. And I think the number that was reported in one newspaper, I think, around a much bigger comp reduction was erroneous in terms of that.  I mean the brutal truth, Alastair, which you know better than I do, is that banking is a fixed cost business. And when you have a very strong level of revenue growth like that, you do not see that degree of marginal cost increase coming through. It's really just the variable cost line plus some BCE type costs, basically, Alastair. And so that's, I guess, point one in terms of the point there, but I would certainly strongly dissuade you from thinking about there was some number like CHF1.5 billion or whichever in terms of marginal cost that didn't flow through. That's not the case.  I think in terms of the balance this year, I think we'll obviously be conscious of the need to retain and motivate staff. I think, conscious of the need to continue to execute well in the balance of this year and to sustain this momentum. But I think it is also appropriate that if you have an issue like this, then there needs to be a prudent approach in terms of variable compensation, and that's a line that we're trying to walk between those 2 things. And that's -- I think that's all I can really say at this point, Alastair.",

And which particular aspects of the prime business was I think you felt needed to be addressed in terms of derisking?

    "text": "Well, I think if we take the first one, I think I don't want to prejudge the work that Christian needs to looking at prime nor the work that we'll be doing together with our new Chairman in the second quarter. But I think we did want to set an initial target based on the overall book in terms of the leverage reduction, and that's what we're getting now, basically. I think that you should see that as a minimum, not a maximum basically. I think it does, as I've indicated, indicate a significant refocusing of prime away from being more of a stand-alone P&L center, albeit with a lot of connectivity elsewhere to be seen instead as a utility to actually support the rest of the businesses, which I think does mean we'll focus on clients that have the maximum connectivity to the rest of the bank as opposed to any sort of stand-alone type customers. And I think that's the right thing to do.  So I can certainly commit to at least that CHF35 billion reduction, but it may end up being more than that, Piers, as we actually look forward. I would just remind everybody that prime is a relatively low ROA business. And I think that we can actually deploy that leverage at higher returns elsewhere in the bank, and I think that's what we're going to do as well as boosting our ratio to above 4%.  And I think in terms of sort of immediate actions, I'll be candid, it's what Thomas has said already. The immediate action is to look at any time, some immediate lessons learned from the U.S. hedge fund matter and make sure that those are addressed as a priority. That may include the Delta One business, which does not come through in terms of leverage as opposed to this being primarily a leverage goal. It's a risk-reduction exercise as well as being a leverage goal. So just to be clear on that particular point.  I think the second point in terms of Wealth Management loan growth. I think we've been clear that we did see some reduction in our lending growth last year, which I think hitherto had been, I think, a steady and accretive growth for the bank over a period of about 5 or 6 years. Thomas was heavily involved in looking at that exercise with the Wealth Management business. We do have a very broad range of collateral across the Wealth Management businesses, some of which has absolutely no lending against whatsoever basically. There is client demand for that. And I think, therefore, in a disciplined and risk-controlled fashion, I think it's important to continue that lending expansion. And obviously, I think we've been generally pleased with the risk/return reward from that.  I think, yes, there'll be some pause in the growth here or some slowdown in the growth there because we are obviously looking very carefully, obviously, primarily at these -- the U.S. hedge fund and the Greensill matter. But obviously, the investigation, we will look beyond that. But I think one reason which we wanted to raise the mandatory, I think, was to ensure that we had sufficient capital to actually facilitate that in a steady, orderly and progressive fashion.",

Do you think it's possible and maybe this is a bit too early to ask, but do you think it's possible that this could produce a very fundamental reset in how your IRB credit risk models work? I mean you have only CHF20 billion to CHF25 billion of counterparty credit risk-weighted assets on literally hundreds of billions of equity swaps and repos, et cetera. That's question #1.  Question number two goes back to the tax treatment of the Archegos-related loss. I'm not quite sure I understand what's happening here. It looks to me as if you have taken a tax credit of at least 30% against the loss in the first quarter. But there has been no increase in your deferred tax assets. So it seems that you're really assuming that you can fully offset this against taxable income during the rest of the year. Do you expect there to be an uptick or an increase in deferred tax assets later during the year? And is that what is reflected in your capital waterfall on Slide 22? Or is there no such issue?  And I was also wondering as an add-on, in which legal entity did you actually incur this loss, please?",

But quite clearly, I think you're going to see a very substantial reduction in such Delta One type positions. And so it may become a slightly moot point, I think, Stefan, in terms of that.  I'm not sure I expect to see a broader read across in terms of this, but I'll defer that to the work that we'll do in the balance of this particular year.  I think in terms of tax treatment, it is complex. In essence, I mean just to be clear, the -- to answer your third point, the Credit Suisse International, which is the U.K. entity phased off to the U.S. hedge fund and therefore, had the credit exposure. But the risk was actually booked in a U.S. entity called BD Light in terms of the acquisition. But the client relationship was actually owned by CSI because the U.S. hedge fund dealt in both U.S. and non-U.S.-based derivatives.  Now that's relevant then to the second question really, which is in terms of the entities, you can actually offset the tax against. It clearly cannot be offset against CSAG or against Credit Suisse Schweiz or some of the other legal entities, the bank or the Hong Kong branch or anything like that. Therefore, it has to be offset against the entities that this actually relates to. And that obviously limits the tax asset that I can actually include in my balance sheet to the level I can expect to recover that over the foreseeable future, not just this year but over the longer-term future. And I don't have an expectation at this point that I'd have sufficient profitability to fully offset the tax loss that actually results from the U.S. hedge fund matter basically.  So what we're actually reflecting is the component which I actually expect to recover, not the amount. I mean to be helpful, well, sort of helpful basically, we're basically reflecting about CHF650 million of a tax credit against that sort of CHF4.4 billion. So essentially, in practical terms, it relates to just over half is something we're actually reflecting in terms of a deferred tax asset and half we're not recognizing.  So in the context of the total loss, you've got just under CHF2.5 billion of a pretax loss, which there's no tax credit. And therefore, that pushes up the effective tax rate for the year and for the first quarter. Is that helpful, Stefan? Sorry, it's not a trivial matter.",

But this has to be our goal to maximize return on equity and continue to achieve a double-digit return on capital in the midterm.  On NNA, so first of all, too early to say, but there have not been major flows in either direction in the first few weeks in the second quarter.  And your question relating to capital. Again, as I think David said, there were really 3 reasons why we wanted to do this. First of all, we really want to take the whole capital debate off the table and really ensure that this is not a topic anymore, either internally or external clients or with clients or regulators. Secondly, we want to make sure that if there is a market downturn, that we have enough capital from a more defensive perspective. And the third is also to have enough capital to grow, especially in Switzerland, in IWM and in Asia. And those are the reasons why we did this.",

I guess one element that arguably is missing from the capital waterfall you've outlined is potential losses from Greensill. I know ultimately, we don't know what these could be. But at the same time, there's rumors doing the rounds about whether you will or will not compensate investors for losses. So I just wanted to see if you could set the record straight as to your strategy here, whether you will compensate investors or whether as institutional investors, they should wear all of these losses?  And then the other question I had was regarding your statement on Credit Suisse Asset Management. I guess maybe it's a bit surprising, you're saying perhaps quite early on that you don't consider a sale of the business here despite [indiscernible] out. I was wondering why you're so keen to say such a statement there and whether you would, in any case, consider a merger of any sort or consider a reduction in your controlling stake there?",

We've had a very good progress so far in terms of getting the cash back for all the others and have good visibility for a meaningful part. But through -- the 3 distinct situations that we have mentioned before are clearly going to take several months and quarters before we have clarity there. And therefore, there is absolutely no possibility at this stage to make any more comments on that.  Secondly, on CSAM, as I also said before, I always felt this should be its own division. And the issue around Greensill has accelerated that move and we created its own division and the leadership now of Ulrich Körner, as you could see from the first quarter, this business is actually doing very well with high returns. This is an important business for us. I believe very strongly that a global wealth manager needs to have strong asset management capabilities. So this is strategically important.  Having said that, we also had a very convoluted -- or still have legal entity structure around this, which is why we started the project already last fall to have a more streamlined legal entity structure around asset management. But structure follows strategy. And therefore, this is something that will take also a couple of quarters until we have that legal entity structure properly lined up.  As with other topics, be it IB, be it other areas of the bank, we will always have annual reviews, and this will -- strategic reviews, I mean, on the group level.

On Archegos, I don't think I was surprised by anything that you've said so far, apart from one thing. And I just want to make sure I got that right.  David, you received the question before, about the pace of the liquidation of collateral or positions. And I wrote down the response here saying that Credit Suisse achieved broadly the same prices as other prime brokers. And I wanted to make sure that, a, I got that right. And a, that the underlying implication of that is that the entirety of the CHF5 billion loss is due to poor collateral or poor margin management basically. And I think -- so a, is that accurate? b, is it true to say that the loss is entirely down to having held less margin than your peers?  And then the second question I want to ask you here. On the pace of the exit, on the one hand, you say that the pace of the exit isn't that different from everybody else. On the other hand, you say we still have 3% of our notional exposure that's outstanding. And I was wondering what is that 3%? I mean it's a month after the event. I guess, the reasonable expectation would be that at this point, you'd exited everything.  And the second question I have is on Greensill. And I'm just trying to understand this from the perspective, not of Credit Suisse, but of a client who invested in this product. So if I get this correctly, so if I'm a client and I bought 100 of Greensill, at this point, I've got 0.48 on the dollar back in cash. And I've got 0.52 on the dollar left in the residual exposure. Thomas, if I understood you correctly, Credit Suisse does not plan to step in and compensate clients at this point. I was just wondering, I mean, is there any other outcome here than to say, well, there's going to be extensive litigation, and we're going to be analyzing this for the next 2, 3 years as it runs through the court process?  And then two very brief numbers questions. Number one, David, on RWAs for the IB. If there is incremental RWA inflation from here due to regulatory intervention, does the point of RWAs will not exceed 4Q '20 levels still stand or could it be adjusted upwards?  And the second question, again, just a numbers question. On the capital issuance, what determined the size of the issue? Is it fair to say that you've maxed out on what was preapproved at the AGM and that any incremental issue from here would require AGM approval?",

Let me just sort of summarize what I said before, which is in the analysis of the position sales that Credit Suisse has completed on behalf of this U.S. hedge fund, if we look at the prices that we've achieved over the course of the last month as we've exited them, if we had executed those trades as certain prime brokers did in the first couple of days of this transaction, then I think the loss would have only been marginally higher than what we're incurring here basically. And that assumes basically that if Credit Suisse had acted in the -- to the volume we had in those first two days that any of the prime brokers would have been able to get out of those prices basically. So that's what I'm saying.  But you can't go from that only to your point, you're making around margining. Because although it's clear -- it would seem to be clear that the U.S. hedge fund had a number of concentrated similar positions across -- it would seem to be maybe as many as 8 prime brokers. It doesn't necessarily mean that they have the same proportions of that. So our loss could also reflect a different waiting a number in terms of position sizes to that owned by other houses. So there's more than 1 factor to actually complete that mathematic, so you can't make that direct link. Although clearly, the level of margining and collateral will be very much in scope for the review that the Board is conducting into the U.S. hedge fund matter, and it's clearly a risk factor in terms of this, but it's not a direct deduction from what you said. So that's the -- that would be my first point in terms of the U.S. hedge fund point.  Should I keep going on the other RWA points basically?",

    "text": "Yes. That sounds fine. I think your next -- well, I think question 4 was really around RWA for the Investment Bank. Look, I think we are announcing today both a constraint in terms of the IB RWA back to the end of last year as a minimum and an absolute $35 billion reduction in the amount of leverage doing. I think that's appropriate. It fits into our plans to downsize the prime and prime financing businesses. And I think that's the right thing to do and something that I'm very supportive of. I think in terms of any longer-term caps for the investment bank, I think that prejudges the review that the management will be doing. So Christian, Thomas, I, and also the work that we'll be doing with our new Chairman and the Board over the coming months, and we'll get back to you at that point. But I don't think it's really appropriate that I should bind or prejudge the Board in that decision until we've actually completed that work basically. So we'll get back to you in due course, Jernej, I think, so that's fine. Your fifth question, I think, was around the capital increase. I think to be clear, I think getting to 13%, including the mandatory on a converted basis and including the capital gain that we'll realize from the IPO today of all funds, I think, is the right level of capital for the bank to actually operate it. And I think to have a leverage ratio at least 4%, I think, is also a good thing given the calibration in Switzerland of the regime here.  I don't think necessarily that we like issuing capital at this price, and I think it needs to be done in a prudent and conservative manner. And that was something we did discuss with major shareholders going into this particular exercise. And I would say there was excess demand for this. But I'm not sure, personally, I say we would want to have issued more. But in any event, as you know, Jernej, that also matched where we were in terms of our authorized capital and in terms of our mandatory. But there was another motion to the AGM which we've now withdrawn, which would have allowed for more basically. So there was always options there. I think bottom line, I think it was the right thing to do in roughly the right size. And I think it was important it was executed quickly to take this question off the table as we've said already.",

And of course, part of it or a large part of it was Prime Services. But is there any other kind of some business line or any other, yes, business that you would like to highlight from the perspective of the residual of that deleveraging to be coming from? And my second question is really around the risk-weighted assets fall quarter-on-quarter also within wealth. We have seen your risk-weighted assets coming down. We have seen your loans coming down quarter-on-quarter, particularly in APAC as well. Could you give us a sense what was happening kind of there apart from your kind of derisking that you have mentioned? And then so could you give us a sense, when you talk about this reduction in risk appetite currently, what does it actually mean? What sort of constraints are you operating on from a risk perspective?",

I think in terms of deleveraging, the primary focus was the resizing of the prime business within the Investment Bank. And as you know, it was partly offset by an increase in HQLA, but there's nothing else particularly to highlight, Magdalena. I think in terms of risk-weighted assets, within -- across the bank overall, I'd just refer you back to the table which we showed on Page 27 of the deck basically. So what you see here is, obviously, is -- and this is in Swiss franc terms, is a CHF 19 billion reduction in the Investment Banking RWA and a CHF 3 billion increase in SUB, IWM, APAC, Asset Management and CC. But you are correct because the CC number includes, as we've noted, opposite, a CHF 6 billion increase in operational risk RWA, which we've warned about before and flowed through. So net-net, the Wealth Management division was slightly down year-on-year. I mean, I don't think there's anything specific I'd like to highlight. I mean, I think one point I did bring out was the fact that we did review very carefully the businesses across the entire bank. There's been a very thorough risk review, which is being conducted by the tactical crisis committee of the Board of Directors. And that has included the Wealth Management operations as well as the Investment Bank. And we did basically result -- that did result in $4.2 billion of net new asset outflows within APAC, relating to certain clients where we did decide to significantly restrict our activities. But there was nothing broad in terms of that. I think it was fair and appropriate that I think following both the Greensill episodes and the Archegos issues, that we did do a thorough review of our risk appetite, which was led by our interim Chief Risk Officer, Jo Oechslin, and in conjunction with the tactical crisis committee of the Board, and we then continued a thorough risk review across the bank. And I think that taking that more conservative approaches has been the right thing to do in the second quarter. But clearly, the bulk of the reductions have clearly been borne by prime and by the Investment Bank.",

But at the same time, as you can see, for the first full half, we are actually up in terms of transactional revenues, and we expect this to normalize again as we go into the second half of the year. Recurring has been on a positive trend given our increase in assets under management, and we continue to expect that. And we expect net interest income to stabilize where we are.

And as I said though, I think, to an answer to the previous question, I would expect the bank to offer at roughly constant levels of RWA and leverage through the third quarter. I think a few points really. As I’ve indicated, the drop in transaction activity in the Wealth Management business was primarily driven by GTS-related revenues, where we saw us much lower levels of client activity, but also given the importance of derivative products within GTS, a substantial fall in volatility in markets in which we actually operate in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter a year ago, which has a significant impact on GTS revenues. And I think I did note earlier that within the Wealth Management-related revenues in APAC, the IBCM component of that was actually down as well. So I think just looking forward, I said I’m not going to add to the outlook statement. I would point out that the third quarter is normally seasonally lower than what you’d normally see, and we’ll see how that seasonal pattern actually develops, but it’s always just worth remembering that. And I would also point out that whilst we do expect to see a more normalization in that, our transaction revenues per unit in Asset Management do remain comparatively high as a consequence of our business model.

We are having detailed sessions amongst the ExB as well on these different divisions and business areas.

In terms of the employees, to your question, yes, absolutely, this is the full picture of all employees. If you look MDs, we do have a slight negative net movement in terms of MDs joiners versus leavers. But again, we are very much focused on investing in the business.

But actually, June was positive inflows in all 3 divisions. And so the momentum into the end of the quarter was very positive. So look, this is something we had to do. We wanted to work through. We clearly also had some side effects from our more cautious approach to lending volumes. We had clear targets for each of the divisions, including Asia, including SUB and including IWM in terms of RWA and leverage for the end of the second quarter because we were determined to achieve our targets that we have set ourselves. And that is obviously one of the side effects that some of the NNA or AUMs that were linked to lending volumes also came down. But as I said, the momentum into the end of the quarter was positive.

Secondly, although in terms of the Prime Service impact, the $100 million that Thomas mentioned – alluded to in terms of the second quarter impact, I mean, let’s just be clear. After the Archegos incident, Credit Suisse, we moved, we focused extremely hard on, a, the resizing of the prime portfolio; and b, shifting any clients who are on static margining to dynamic margining. And those 2 things were the priority for the business during the quarter, and we moved as fast as possible in terms of that. So I think you’ve seen the revenue impact in the second quarter. We’re obviously not going to be resizing the prime business upwards going forward. So I think we’ve moved it to a new lower steady state basically. But I mean, this wasn’t a steady process during the quarter. We executed on this. It was fairly obvious what needed to be done, and we executed on that resizing as fast and as quickly as possible in terms of that. I think beyond that, as I said, I think in terms of the capital reduction reallocation process, we did complete that during the quarter. And as I said, I would expect to operate a broadly unchanged levels during the third quarter. And I think you’ll see more normal levels of activity beyond that. But I think certainly, second quarter, the priority was dealing with Archegos. It was dealing with the Greensill-related supply chain funds.

As you know, prime is a relatively risk -- low-risk density business, notwithstanding experience of Archegos. But we obviously did take a conservative approach to risk across the bank and particularly within the Investment Bank in the second quarter. And that did lead to some RWA reductions elsewhere, which clearly contributed to the RWA decline that we achieved in the second quarter. As I said, look, I think the Greensill matter closely followed by the Archegos matter, I think, necessitated a conservative approach to risk, necessitated a resizing of the risk appetite by our interim Chief Risk Officer and by the tactical crisis committee at the beginning of the second quarter. And I think that clearly has resulted in reductions in RWA beyond the prime financing business.

And on the asset sales, you indicated in combination with the IB risk-weighted asset reduction of 40 to 50 basis points. Are there more benefits from asset sales to come? And then secondly, on costs, you're running underlying at around CHF 15.9 billion in the first half. And I mean, I understand things have changed, but you've previously given us the CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion for '21.

    "text": "Anke, let me take both of those questions. Firstly, with regard to the operational risk update, that -- those process in that calculation was completed in the second quarter, and that added CHF 6 billion of RWA in the second quarter, and that is certainly complete. There is potentially another CHF 2 billion of methodology changes and updates, which might, but not certainly, might materialize later this year, and that would account for the reconciliation to the number you gave before the 35 basis points, I believe. But I wouldn't regard that as certain at this point. It's more of a prudence buffer I think about in terms of my capital planning. But clearly, either which way, I think the bulk has been done in the second quarter. In terms of asset sales, quite clearly, the largest asset sale was the reduction in the Allfunds position where we dropped below the 10% threshold. So what you see in Allfunds really is a number of factors. Firstly, we had a further gain on Allfunds post the IPO of CHF 298 million recorded across our Wealth Management businesses. Second, we've actually -- we sold down to below 10% in the IPO process itself. And thirdly, you're obviously fully aware that once you drop below 10% under the Basel III rules, the capital treatment changes from being deduction process to being an RWA weighted process basically. So that contributes or that -- those 3 factors resulted in the 28 basis point improvement in the CET1 ratio as a consequence of Allfunds, and that's clearly a very large single disposal-related type event. We do expect to realize further asset sale gains, particularly real estate-related later in the year, and that is still to come, I think, in terms of your planning and thinking. I think the second point then, just in terms of cost guidance, I think it's just fair to say that whilst we will continue to invest across the bank, and obviously, we were pleased to see a 50 net additions in terms of RMs in APAC, which I think is the largest single increase in RMs we've ever achieved and I think demonstrates the investments in the franchise. And we're obviously continuing to invest in our onshore China platform. Nonetheless, I think given that we will be taking a prudent approach to variable compensation awards in light of the loss that our shareholders suffered in respect to Archegos, I think it's fair to say that we will be at the bottom end of the range of the CHF 16.2 billion to CHF 16.5 billion cost guidance that we gave at the Investor Day last year. So I hope that answers those questions, but please, is that helpful, Anke?",

And I managed to find one of the passages that you quoted in this report that you published today. And it says here and you quoted is that this is not a situation where the business and risk personnel engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct, nor is one where the architecture of risk controls and processes was lacking, or the existing risk systems failed to operate sufficiently to identify critical risks. And I just wonder how that tallies with the bulk of what you have been communicating today. Because one of the key communications that I understood is that Credit Suisse immediately changed, for example, the way you margin in your prime brokerage, went from static to dynamic, and yet the report seems to suggest that systems are fine. Is that correct?",

This was already discussed by the teams in September, October. They had agreed that they would move some of the clients, including Archegos, from static to dynamic. It was rediscussed in early March. And if you read the report, they were in the process of actually doing that and reaching out to the client. But it was just not prioritized the way it should have been. So this is, to a large extent, really a series of human errors and failures by the teams. They didn't effectively manage this situation, and whether it was lack of escalation or also limit -- control of limits, which had numerous occasions being breached, but they did not act on it even though they discussed it and were supposed to do it. So this was clearly a series of failures, which is regrettable and which we have now addressed with a new team both on the first line of defense in Prime Services, Prime Services risk and on the risk management side. So that's really how I would answer this question.",

So the protocols were there, but they were not followed. It's clear that whilst we obviously can improve in our data systems, we can prove in the timeliness of those data systems. Nonetheless, the first and second line data systems did demonstrate the risks to Credit Suisse of Archegos. And again, those were not basically followed up as part of it.

One thing that I wanted to also add to the one of the previous questions on NNA momentum within the quarter and towards the end of the quarter is that the gross NNA flows are actually very similar to previous years. So clients are fully involved and active in the rare situations or in some of the situations of ultra-high-net worth clients who have asked for, for example, incremental lending, where we have been maybe more cautious. They fully understand that. They don't see that as an issue. You would also see that our assets under custody have increased. So in certain situations where we had a reduction of lending, the underlying collateral, it stayed with us. So we have very positive feedback about the way we have addressed some of these issues with respect to the risk-weighted asset reductions, the fact that we raised the capital immediately at the end of April and the read across from the lessons learned. So investors take a lot of -- sorry, clients take a lot of comfort from the fact also that we are increasing our capital ratio. So the client reaction is very constructive. Clearly, there are some clients, for example, those who were invested in supply chain funds that are having active dialogue with us, and we are keeping them updated on the cash redemptions, and we will continue to improve that situation. But they also understand that this is a process that will take some time. And that really brings me to your second question on the timetable of Greensill. We are paying out now another tranche, as we said, and we will continue to work through the book of work, both for the focus and the non-focus areas. The focus areas involves much more negotiations and also a number of people involved in these discussions, and this will also take a longer time. In parallel, we are engaging with insurers, and that's a process that will certainly continue over the next few months and quarters. We are keeping our clients fully informed about this, and they basically understand the process. And whenever they need any other support, we are there to do that.",

I think we have taken a very thorough approach to capital utilization, as I've outlined already, both in terms of the reset, the risk appetite and the bank-wide risk review, and I think that's been right and appropriate. And that has led to the CET1 ratio increasing to 13.7%. And that does, by the way, include the accrual for a dividend in respect to 2021, although the level of that will only be set by the Board of Directors as a recommendation to shareholders at the beginning of next year. And I just think that operating the bank above 13%, I think, is the prudent and the correct thing to do. I have to say I think the scale of the Archegos loss was shocking, a disappointment and clearly a cost to our shareholders. And I think it's an appropriate response. And I would certainly expect to operate in excess of 13% for at least the balance of this particular year basically. I think beyond that, I mean -- and by the way, the leverage ratio is always as important as the CET1 ratio. So the fact we're operating at 4.2% and 6% against the Swiss minimum requirements is as important as the RWA ratio. And I would just reiterate, I would expect to operate north of 4% for the leverage ratio for at least the balance of 2021. I think in terms of our longer-term capital guidance, I think we will provide a proper update to that as part of the conclusion of the strategic review once it's completed by the end of this year.

I mean, I think, look, I think quite clearly, the Archegos loss and the Greensill supply chain funds have caused reviews of our credit ratings by all the major agencies. And I think at least one of them actually has us on negative watch. And I think Moody's, as you know, did downgrade certain of our instruments early this month, although that was partly in the connection with a technical change relating to their treatment of certain AT1 instruments in terms of the subordination and treatment as equity or debt between the different layers of the bank. Now that's going to be, obviously, an ongoing process. And I imagine they'll be reviewing these results and also the Archegos report just as you are basically. And I think it's only appropriate, we do list that as a risk factor. I mean, as a matter of practicality, I would say, basically, if you look at the moves in certain management such as CDSs, they're really basically priced in such a downgrade some months ago basically. And the rating agencies now have to make their own decisions about this whole thing. But I think it's appropriate we list it as a risk factor just because it clearly is a risk factor. But I think it's probably priced in already. And I guess, we shall see and depend on -- and see how they choose to react to this report. Clearly, the capital ratios, in particular, are substantially higher than I think anybody was actually expecting, and that's obviously a key factor in terms of this. And I think it is worth bottom line in terms of pretax income on an underlying basis, it's about 11% lower than what was a very strong period a year ago.

Since the occurrence of the Archegos and supply chain finance fund matters, which we are taking very seriously, as I said, we have taken decisive actions around capital and risk management. We have learned and will continue to learn the lessons from these events, and we will ensure that we emerge stronger by improving our capital ratios and strengthening risk, compliance and control foundations. We have market-leading positions and strong capabilities across our client franchises in Wealth Management, Asset Management and in the Investment Bank as evidenced by the solid underlying results in the first half of the year. Our Swiss-anchored bank enjoys leading positions in our home market as well as in fast-growing economies around the world, and our integrated model should position us well to capture growth opportunities going forward. Finally, and most importantly, we value our deep pool of talented and dedicated employees, who are fully committed to serving our clients, whether corporate, institutional or wealth. They fill me and my colleagues on the ExB with confidence for our future, and I thank them immensely for the dedication and hard work.

    "text": "Thank you, Daniele. Thank you for your questions. So let me just kick off with -- on the point around regulatory changes, regulatory inflation. I think at this point, all I can really say is I think what you know already, which is that we have a Pillar 2 charge totaling USD 2 billion in respect of the Greensill supply chain finance funds matters, which was something that we agreed with FINMA during the first quarter, and that remains unchanged from now.  And in respect of the litigation provisions, which I've taken this morning, totaling CHF564 million, I would expect an increase in op risk RWA as it works its way through the system over the next couple of quarters of around CHF1 billion in terms of op risk increases.  I think in terms of other matters, just to anticipate the follow-on question, I don't have any more visibility at this point in terms of any other operational risk charges or moderated charges relating to the Archegos matter or, indeed, to the Greensill matter. So I can't update you on that basically, and nothing much I can really add. It's clearly a situation we're looking at very closely, but certainly the situation hasn't changed since I spoke at the end of the second quarter or indeed, for that matter, at the end of the first quarter.  Now I think Daniele, you asked a good question around the parent bank. And I just recognize that although this is in respect to the FINMA decree, which goes back to 2017, I think there have been a couple of good research notes written on this, including by yourself earlier this year. So let me just give you a few numbers.  So the group CET1 ratio, as you say, was 14.4%. The parent at the end of the third quarter was 13.4% on a transitional basis because I think you need to know that the decree from 2017 phases in over this decade up until 2028. And on a look-through basis, increased slightly to 10.7%. So just in terms of -- so those are the parent numbers.  Just in terms of capital requirements, the impairment looking forward because just to address the points which have been raised before, I think you know, we've said this morning, we're looking to maintain our CET1 ratio for the group in excess of 14% pre B3R in 2024. For the parent, I'm targeting a look-through ratio of around 12%, so that's the equivalent to that, which is slightly lower than the group number, really, for 2 reasons.  Firstly, the parent is clearly a subset of the group, and it reflects capital requirements that reflects the mix of activities actually in the parent, which are different from those in our subsidiaries, point one; and point two, which point -- I think you understand, which is the B3R impact, there is no B3R impact on the parent. In fact, B3R will actually slightly reduce the capital requirements of the parent because there's no FRTB impact actually on the parent. So the RWA for the parent actually goes down under B3R, whereas it goes up for the group as a whole. So that's why we set a stress-based target for the parent of 12%.  So you might ask a question. So you're at 10.7% now, how are you going to get to 12%? That requires retained capital between now and the end of 2027, beginning of '28 of about CHF6 billion. Just to put that in context, since '17, we have repatriated, with appropriate regulatory approval, CHF12 billion of capital, largely from the U.K. to Switzerland. In addition to that, we have received dividends, obviously, primarily from Credit Suisse Schweiz, but just recently from the U.S., totaling further CHF12 billion. So obviously, we obviously substantially improved the parent capital position since 2017 when the decree was enacted.  Looking forward, a couple of things just to be aware of. I think you're aware of this and it's been discussed before, but we've always, in the past, operated from 2 entities here in the U.K., Credit Suisse International and Credit Suisse Securities Limited, CSSL. CSSL is actually now decommissioned as a material legal entity, which means that there's about CHF8 billion of capital in there, a large proportion of which, again, subject to regulatory approval, we would seek to return to the parent in the near future. And then I think with regard to the United States, we actually passed the CCAR qualitatively, having passed it quantitatively as well, and that means we would be expecting to receive a dividend in excess of USD 2 billion from the U.S. subsidiary to the parent in the near future as well.  So I think you can see there's a number of measures in train to actually close that gap and essentially rebalance capital between the subsidiaries and the parent. So I hope that's helpful to that, and happy to take anything else on that point.",

And question number two, within the investment bank because, of course, you beat consensus numbers quite nicely and, of course, particularly within the advisory and capital markets arena.

I think absent any other changes, I would actually expect net interest income to stabilize sequentially in the fourth quarter. But I would just caution, I think you're aware that we have launched a goodwill program with respect to the supply chain finance fund matters, and that may adversely impact the net interest income, although I don't think the impact would be particularly material in the fourth quarter. But I would expect to stabilize, subject to that particular caveat, would be my guidance on that.  Clearly, as we move forward to the GSR movers and the expansion of lending implied then that, obviously, we'd start to expect it to increase, but that probably goes forward then into '22.",

In particular, we still have had, for example, deleveraging going on in Asia, which was more market-driven compared to the second quarter, where it was more our initiative, where, now in the third quarter, this was more market-driven. And we still have, I would say, significant upside in terms of lending, whether it's structured lending in IWM, whether it's more traditional Lombard lending in Switzerland to further fuel NNA growth going forward.

Can you just confirm that you have, on the risk-weighted asset rebate discussion on the parent bank, a permanent structure that this rebate is in place? Or are there any clauses that would lead to some kind of unwinding of the rebate?  And in respect to the upstream numbers that you gave, which were very helpful, David, in terms of capital from the U.S., what is the determinating factor besides CCAR and qualitative test?

So Kian, in terms of the compensation, be it bonuses or be it potential clawbacks, that's ultimately a decision by the Compensation Committee and will be taken during the fourth quarter as we approach year-end. So clearly, that is premature. It's also important to say with respect to the clawback that we've obviously had a change last year where we had global markets join IBCM. So there is a technical way also to look at this from a previous year's clawback perspective.

You may recall we had a similar goodwill write-down, again, relating to DOJ back in 2015 as the precedent for that. But that's all I'd add to what Thomas has said.  I think your second question, well, I think you referred to as a rebate. I think you're returning to what's called the regulatory filter in the parent capital regime. I think that's a little bit misunderstood. It was a core part of the '17 decree. And what -- all it does basically is it converts Swiss GAAP accounting, which is on a cost less impairment basis, to a fair value basis for the subsidiary entities. So in other words, they're actually treated at the fair value of the position as opposed to cost less impairment.  And the practical for that essentially is it means that the Swiss Universal Bank or Credit Suisse Schweiz, to be more accurate, the legal entity, clearly is valued at a premium to book value because I think we all know that Credit Suisse Schweiz is worth more than book value, and I can see that in your sum-of-parts calculations. And that's really what the regulatory filter actually refers to. So that's what -- how it actually works. As to its status, it's a permanent part of the 2017 decree, basically. So that's what it stands for.  Oh, sorry, you asked a question around the U.S. To my understanding, I think we passed the CCAR test, both qualitatively and quantitatively. So the process from here is that the Board of Directors of CSH U.S.A., which is the intermediate holding company, has to meet shortly, actually, to review the dividend in light of the results for the year and to make -- and declare a dividend on the back of that.

I said there have been 2 good research notes written on the parent, and yours was certainly excellent, Stefan. But just in terms of the decommissioning of CSSEL, so we have been working in London now for 6 years on the decommissioning of CSSEL because prior to that point, essentially, you had 2 entities in London, and CSSEL was actually the employer of the bulk of people, and CSI was the, as you might say, the operating entity. And I'm sure you understand from a resolution recovery point of view, that's basically a nonstarter. In addition to the complexity and intercompany capital regimes and fragmentation that results for having 2 such large entities.  So it has been a huge project because we actually had to move everybody out of one entity and into the other, including the pension fund, and actually build an entire securities infrastructure within CSI at the same time as doing Brexit. But I'm very pleased to say that we actually dropped below the key thresholds in terms of the percentage of balance sheet, percentage of RWA and importance of the operating systems. Actually, back in the first quarter of this year, we've continued to actually reduce the positions further because this is the key switch every year, and we no longer accept any new business in CSSEL from October. So it's definitely decommissioned as a material legal entity.  With regard to the Mozambique matter, the reason that Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited took the guilty plea because it was the employer of the 3 individuals who actually pled guilty in a U.S. court a couple of years ago, and that's why it took the guilty plea because that was clearly the precedent for this matter.  The deferred prosecution agreement actually relates to CSAG, not CSSEL. So whilst it's clearly very unfortunate, and we obviously very much regret the whole Mozambique exercise, it doesn't really pertain to the material legal entity status of CSSEL. So hopefully that's covered that point.  I think the -- I think -- thank you very much, Stefan. I think the second question, just in terms of dividend and payout guidance. I mean we're sort of crossing a bit on to the subject for later on this morning. But really, the Board's made 2 statements. Firstly, the dividend for 2021 payable following the approval by the AGM next April, that's a decision that the Board will calibrate once it actually has the full year 2021 results. The comment around the 25% of net income is a forward-looking statement relating to the Board's guidance for the expected percentage of net income that we paid out of 2022 in 2023, again, subject to the AGM or, at that point, basically, in the following year, Stefan.",

So for the 2022 period, as we also outlined at the Investor Day, the key drivers for growth will be in terms of transactional revenues -- sorry, in terms of recurring revenues, AUM growth, M&A growth which will be driven by a combination of organic NNA growth that we expect to normalize again and be stronger than in 2021. And also driven by more lending growth, which will both help our NNA growth as well as our net interest.  And in addition to that, our Relationship Manager hiring intentions across the regions.  And as far as transactional revenues are concerned, I would say that the slowdown we saw, especially in the second half this year was somewhat unusual, and we would expect some more normalized levels of transactional revenues in 2022. In addition to that, we are committed to further increasing our level in terms of private equity and alternative investments, as well as other initiatives around mandate penetration which should also help our recurring revenues.  These are some of the elements that we discussed in detail at the Investor Day in November. But maybe, David, you want to add a few things on the net interest income side?",

    "text": "Thanks very much, Thomas. Look, I think there's no doubt that the moves that we've seen already in U.S. interest rates and we expect to continue to see during the course of 2022 will be favorable to our dollar net interest income.  I mean, I think to give some numbers, if we look at the forward rate curve now, we probably expect to see about a $50 million gain in U.S. dollar net interest income in '22. And that rises to more like about $175 million in '23. So I think that gives some degree of the sensitivity due to U.S. dollars.  I think I should balance that, though, by -- Magdalena, I think you're fully aware of this, but the major Swiss banks are all subject to the exemption threshold that the Swiss National Bank operates, which I believe is broadly similar in concept to that, that the ECB operates as well. So at some point, I mean, I think it seems unlikely that the ECB is going to be at the front of this queue. I guess we're talking late this year, maybe in '23, we would expect Swiss francs -- Swiss rates to then follow that. So at that point, you'd expect to see some diminution in Swiss franc net interest income as we go back towards 0 interest rates in Swiss franc, which is obviously going to take some time. So that will clearly partly offset the U.S. dollar moves.  So U.S. dollar favorable. Clearly, we need to watch closely when the move in Swiss rates. And you understand perfectly well how the exemption thresholds work in Switzerland and in Europe, although it's slightly bigger, I think, there's a multiplier for Swiss banks, than it is for Eurozone banks.",

    "text": "Well, I think that's a very good question, Jeremy. And I wanted to be very open around the comp plan. I think historically we said wait until the comp pool comes out in a month's time. And we thought it would be more useful given the complexity this year to actually give the slides.  So just to recap, I think you can -- saw that we did have a very difficult balance to actually walk in terms of the compensation pool, particularly given the losses that our shareholders suffered in respect of the issues last year. So that was behind the decision to reduce the variable compensation pool by 32% to CHF2 billion.  But I think there's 2 factors then to keep in mind. Firstly, and this was something that we agreed on and also discussed with our regulators, we did pay those instruments with a number of deferred cash instruments, as I think has been widely reported. And secondly, I think as part of the implementation of the strategic plan from '22 to '24, we did also provide our Managing Directors and Directors with this strategic delivery award totaling just under CHF500 million, which is a cliff vesting instrument. That cliff vesting instrument, as you know, Jeremy, doesn't mean that the cost comes in '24. It's actually time weighted under U.S. GAAP. And we'd expect probably just under around 50% of that to actually flow through in '22. So that's half of the increase.  The other half of the increase reflects a decision which we've made to actually move to lower levels of deferral in 2023 than the past. So that's basically the driver of that increase in our guidance from CHF500 million to CHF1 billion in terms of the normalization of the compensation program.  Absent that, there's nothing else that you should be focused on. We obviously are very pleased to have now signed the procurement outsourcing transaction with Chain IQ. There's a number of other strategic cost measures we're actually pushing through, which I discussed in more detail back in November, so we're pushing hard on that. And certainly, driving efficiency from the new structure is a core focus for the Executive Board of Credit Suisse. And I think we would look to outperform against what we said before.  But I think in the context of the compensation moves, I wanted to be very explicit that essentially, I think we will be at the top end of our guidance for 2022. But also, as I said before, that I'm not changing our guidance for '23 and '24.  I think on investment spending, I mean, I think, look, I think we're very committed to our core expansion plans in Wealth and for that matter, in the Investment Bank, too.

    "text": "Look, I think we obviously discussed this in some detail back in November. And I think in light of that, we obviously wanted to just give an update on where we stood at this particular point.  To your specific question, the CHF6 billion increase I said before, which is the gap to achieve a 12% target ratio with the full phase-in of the step-up in RWA weightings by '28, is that CHF6 billion number, it's about CHF9 billion at this point for 2028, assuming no change in the valuation of the subsidiaries. I mean, I think, Stefan, a sort of unspoken question, which I'll answer anyway really is why did we see this rate reduction in the valuation of the subsidiaries, which we also touched on in the earnings release, you'll see in there as well, is that was a reduction in the regulatory filter that FINMA imposed, really following a review of the value subsidiaries post Archegos and clearly also post the strategic review. So it was applied at the end of December, basically, and that's what led to this reduction in the parent ratio to 11.7% at the end of December. And as I said, 11.4%, including the phase-in from the 1st of January. So that's the context. And in terms of that look through to '28, that would mean the GAAP increases from CHF6 billion to CHF9 billion.  Now in terms of the timing of capital repatriations dividends, that there's been no change is the answer. I mean, we expected to receive a significant dividend from CSH USA at the end of last year in December, and we actually received that dividend. But that was in the plan, which I discussed on the 4th of November. We are expecting to see some very substantial numbers in 2022, which was part of the planning.  Just in order, most notably, we have completed the decommissioning of Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited, which is the sister entity of CSI. That is now a nonmaterial legal entity. So -- and it has significant trapped capital in it. So that's obviously quite a complex program to go through as we actually do that. And that's something we'll obviously be in discussion with the U.K. regulators about during the course of this year.  Secondly, of course, we will expect to see further dividend from the U.S. I'm not going to comment, but it's probably somewhat material in terms of these numbers.  And then finally, we will receive, I won't expect, the normal dividend from Credit Suisse Schweiz, and then there's obviously other smaller numbers as well in the total of that.  I think in timing of that, basically, obviously, the Credit Suisse Schweiz dividend would come in first. And we would expect the U.S. dividend to come in towards later in the year and the restructuring of CECL, which I've talked about before, clearly would be subject to regulatory approval later on this year. So come way, I guess, somewhere during the year, but I'm not going to give an exact date.  But those plans are all the same as they were before, Stefan. I think the change for the 4th of November was that point I made before about the FINMA's decision to reduce the value of the regulatory filter as a consequence of the numbers of last year.",

Two parts. First is, can you just reiterate what the second half of the increase in compensation relates to? And with regard to that one-off award, how does the amortization structure then play out over 2023 and 2024 as well, please?  My broader question to Thomas would be on Slide 34, where you talk about 2 real aims accelerating the revenue momentum and strengthening the risk culture. Do you think those 2 things go hand in hand? And the reason I ask is usually we hear from companies saying, we're going to take on a bit more risk to accelerate our revenue momentum or alternatively taking down risk levels, but perhaps moving to a higher payout ratio or something along those lines. The 2 things that you are flagging sound almost slightly contradictory. So interested in your broad thoughts on how you can achieve both at the same time.",

    "text": "First, your first question. I think in terms of the deferral impact. The strategic delivery award is a 3-year cliff-vested instrument. So in other words, the Compensation Committee will assess the progress that's been made during the course of '22, '23 and '24 in terms of the achievement of the strategic goals, which does include the achievement of the risk and compliance goals. And we'll then decide what the uplift in the value is. There are certain knockout clauses as well in terms of that instrument. So that's the instrument.  In terms of the deferral treatment, as it's a 3-year cliff vest, cliff vest absent early retirement clauses, I'll come back to that, vest once -- run through the expense line under U.S. GAAP at 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. But because certain individuals would be eligible for retirement, that pushes up the recognition if they become eligible in that year.  So in practice, and it's a little bit of a complex calculation because it's population dependent, you'd expect around 50% of that CHF500 million to flow through in 2022. And then it's obviously a smaller proportion in '23 and '24. So it will be something like 50%, 30%, 20%, but it depends very much on the retirement calculations. And that's obviously different from a level vest, and I'd be very happy, Andrew, to talk to you about level vesting amortization under U.S. GAAP separate, but I won't waste everyone's time at this point, but that's how it works.  But you asked a very good point on the second question, the other half of the number, which I've given in terms of guidance. And that is that Credit Suisse has historically operated quite high levels of deferral above that of our peers in Europe. And we would like to move back to a more normal deferral table. Clearly, that doesn't change the economic cost of bonus awards over the lifetime of those bonus awards, but it does mean that more flows through in the first year of that. And I said that's about the other half of this.  Clearly, there's an important caveat on that, Andrew, which is what is the variable compensation pool in total in 2022, which is clearly indetermined at this point. And therefore, there has to be some uncertainty around that guidance. But I think it's material enough that it's worth talking about and making clear, that you understand that does push us towards the top end of our guidance range for '22. Hopefully, that's okay, but I'll be more than happy to follow up afterwards, Andrew.",

    "text": "Okay. And Andrew, to your second question, no, I don't think there is any contradiction to that at all. And I would like to come from 2 angles.  First of all, what we've seen really in Q4 was the result of a series of steps we've taken during the year in terms of strengthening our leadership and governance in risk management in terms of recalibrating our risk appetite and reducing our risk positions starting, obviously, within the Investment Bank and Prime Services. But across frankly, the Board also exiting certain other businesses like GTS, emerging markets, reduced oil and gas exposures and overall RWA and leverage reduction since the end of the first quarter, as we showed between 10% and 12%. And as a consequence of that, we really saw in Q4, a very low activity in new business, and that has been very much also influenced by slower markets and -- but also somewhat inward focus, I would say, of the organization as we immediately implemented the new structure -- organizational structure, which followed the strategic review that we presented on the 4th of November.  And then obviously, as a consequence of that, we are strengthening the risk culture with a much more disciplined approach around risk in both the first line and second line of defense, significant investments across risk and compliance, et cetera. And this all leads to -- or led to a real slowdown in Q4 and has now been really, I would say, embedded and has now laid the foundation for a very disciplined slow growth coming forward now in Q1 and beyond.  And maybe more conceptually, I mean, banking is about risk management. It's not about avoiding risk. It's about proper risk management, and that's really what the Executive Board and including myself, are telling all our troops. We want to have disciplined approach to risk, but we want to do new business. So that's very clear. And in that sense, we see absolutely no contradiction when we say on one side, we want to further strengthen the risk culture, but at the same time, regaining some revenue momentum.",

So essentially, -- so yes, as part of the assessment of the financial plans of the entities and particularly post the strategy review, we did revalue them by about CHF3.5 billion. And obviously, we've also taken into account in the course of the year, the adverse impact on the entities of the Archegos loss because obviously, that was actually suffered in our subsidiaries and not in the parent itself.  However, I think your point is more the application by the FINMA on a cap on the regulatory value for capital purposes. FINMA is entitled to do that under the 2017 decree to put a cap or to provide a different number then valued by us. And that was something they did do on the basis of the numbers projected forward, and they employ an external assessor to do so. I don't think you can read anything more into it than that. Clearly, that does reduce the value of the Clearly, that does reduce the value of the subsidiaries for capital purposes at the end of the year. That's the 11.7% number and then 11.4% reflects the phasing of the decree basically there afterwards.  Clearly, that does obviously provide a reason why what we've talked about before in terms of the distribution of capital being very important and why the redistribution of capital within the bank is also important, too, which is really comes back to what I said to Stefan earlier, which is clearly, Credit Suisse Schweiz has been a regular source of dividends over the years. But essentially, we obviously need all of our subsidiaries to pay capital back to the parent, basically, and that's a critical process. And incidentally, by the way we have been very successful in terms of that.  I think go back to the comment that I made back at in the fourth, I think we've seen about GBP 12 billion of dividends and about EUR 12 billion of capital flowing back into the parent over the last 3 or 4 years. But it is obviously important that we complete that during the course of the current year. And as I said, in order of importance, it is the CECL, which is now a nonmaterial legal entity and has quite substantial capital balances. I think you can dig out the accounts and see them, but the order of CHF6 billion to CHF8 billion depending on how much we need for the dormant activities. And then obviously, the U.S. numbers and then Credit Suisse Schweiz, which, as I said before, has been a consistent dividend payer since it was formed back at the end of 2016. So I hope that helps answer the question. Kian, do you want to just have a follow-on that? Just in case there's anything else I can help with before we move to the second question.",

    "text": "I was just going to tackle that second part of your question. So where do we stand? So as we said, 2/3 of the balances have been reduced. And in terms of your related question on market share development and how we see it also into the Q1 and '22, I would say the following. First of all, if you take the full year, I think our market shares and relative performance market shares and relative performance versus our peers was, I think, very strong in SP and more broadly in credit. Left in equity capital markets, M&A was very solid. But clearly, on the GTS side and within that, some of the macro and FX businesses probably underperformed.  And then there is obviously the whole equities business where starting from the second quarter, we have not only reduced our prime balances, but also had some negative effect on cash equities. We had a very strong performance in equity derivatives for the full year. And I would say equity capital markets was obviously strong for a long time up to, I would say, second, third quarter in IPOs. But then clearly, fourth quarter, the SPAC -- or I would say, second half, the SPAC activity really slowed down quite markedly. And as a consequence, on a year-on-year comparison, the fourth quarter to fourth quarter last year or fourth quarter '20 was clearly an underperformance because of the lower SPAC activity.  So going forward, I think we are very well positioned in credit in SP as well as in M&A and where we continue to invest. LevFin, we do think that we are also very well positioned. But with the higher interest rates coming, we think that there will be some slowdown in financing and LevFin activity. And otherwise, in equities, we continue to invest in our technology and AES business as well as in equity derivatives, where we continue to see a good momentum.  So that's how I would say we are developing in terms of investments and market shares. Anything you would like to add, David? Okay.",

And then secondly, you mentioned the Relationship Manager hiring APAC but it was good, IWM is down.

And we've obviously covered CV in some detail.  In terms of '23 and '24, I just cast your mind back to the Investor Day. And we did include the same numbers on Slide 27, which is the structural cost measures we're pushing through. It's just the nature of these reorganizations that you don't see that much of the benefit in the first year. The prime benefits in terms of the cost reductions will only really start to flow through later this year as we actually complete the transition of our clients off the platform. Until then, we need to maintain that platform for the benefit of our clients whilst they're finishing it.  Equally, the procurement savings coming from the Chain IQ deal, yes, they start this year because the whole relationship goes live later this quarter. But they only actually build up over time, and they continue to accrete in '23 and '24 as we actually move forward. I think beyond that, and I think we obviously will give updates later this year. But I think it will be very important to talk about the benefits we expect from the centralization of IT and some of the other organizational measures, all of which really only flow through in '23 and '24 from a materiality point of view.  And if you look back what we said, we're talking here about structural cost saves of CHF1 billion to CHF1.5 billion by '24, of which CHF300 million comes through only in this year. So that's, as you might say, is the mathematical underpinning or the result of that basically. So I think that's why we can make this comment that I think we are going to see pressure in '22 as a consequence of the CV effect from the deferred compensation awards and the normalization of CV. But there afterwards, basically, I think we are reiterating our guidance for '23 and '24.",

So 40% to 50% in APAC, about 25% to 30% in the former IWM regions, that is Middle East, that's Europe, that's Latin America and the rest in Switzerland.  Now clearly, the slowdown that we have seen in the last few months in Asia will probably mean that the growth in 2022 in terms of hiring, we'll have to look at and we have to see how the market will further develop. And I cannot exclude that we will be a bit more flexible about the hiring in that region in 2022. But the plan is a 3-year plan. It's a long-term plan. And we'll have to see how China and the rest of Asia will develop over the next few months, and we will adapt accordingly.

So as part of the work we went through over the 9 months, I would say, since April to the end of the year under the leadership of the Tactical Crisis Committee, initially, that was with the former Chief Risk Officer -- sorry, the former Chair of the Risk Committee on the Board and then subsequently under the leadership of our former Chairman, we really had 3 themes that this Tactical Crisis Committee looked at. One was Archegos agreed across, one was supply chain funds and agreed across and the third one was the risk review. And the risk review was really a very systematic review of all balance sheet items and off-balance sheet items. It was really a very detailed analysis so to speak, vertically through the balance sheet and -- but then also looking at each of the divisions and regions, looking at special themes, special businesses, whether it was in Investment Banking, whether it was in Corporate Banking, whether it was Level 3 assets, et cetera.  So this -- these 3 themes really were part of our work that we went through with the Tactical Crisis Committee week-by-week in the first phase and then every second week thereafter. So the risk review was really separate from the supply chain fund. And all 3 have essentially been completed.  As we said already earlier, the Archegos -- with the Archegos report coming out, the Paul, Weiss report at the time, then the risk review was completed in the fourth quarter, and we have now also completed the review by the Board with respect to the report on the supply chain finance fund, which was commissioned to Deloitte and a Swiss law firm. So all 3 themes have really been completed. And from that perspective, also the Tactical Crisis committee is now essentially being phased out. David, the parent?",

    "text": "Yes. On the second point, I mean, I think this is the other -- so as I said in answer to Stefan's question before, the look through capital required to be accumulated in the parent by '28 has increased from CHF6 billion to CHF9 billion. That means the equivalent look-through ratio is, I think, somewhere between 9.5% and 9.6% actually, Daniele. So that's the look-through ratio as of now, basically, in terms of that, so just below the 10% level. Clearly, it's the transitional ratio, which is the 11.7% and 11.4%, which is relevant in terms of the capital measures.  I think your second question then was around the Pillar 2 add-on in respect of Greensill supply chain funds. That was, as I said, applied originally by FINMA to the parent. It's still sitting there as well as the group. So that for them means you still got a 60 basis point increase against the 10% minimum for the parent, again, on a transitional basis for that, basically, that's still sitting there. And I think at some point, that will have to be decided where it sits within the legal entity structure, but it's still sitting there at this particular moment.  In terms of your third point, which is around the Tactical cyclical add-on, which the Swiss National Bank has decided to reimpose with effect from September, you're absolutely correct. Because there's de minimis residential mortgages booked in the parent, it has a minute impact of 0.2 basis points to be exact of the [indiscernible] cyclical add-on, whereas the [indiscernible] cyclical add-on for the group is about 24 basis points. And obviously, for CS Schweiz, it's obviously considerably more than that because that's what actually sits, but it does -- it doesn't affect the parent requirements.",

And that clearly does include the RMBS cases, but I think it's also fair to say that we did sweep up a larger number of smaller cases, shall we say, if that's helpful.  I'm not sure I'd necessarily define it as an entire change in terms of litigation strategy. But I think what we have seen in some of these cases are very long standing. And I think there has been a willingness on both sides, as you might say, to reach a resolution of these things at levels which are, shall we say, more satisfactory. And therefore, we have accrued towards closing out those transactions. So yes, I think that you will see the number of active cases actually dropping. But there still is some significant litigation outstanding.  And I would just draw your attention to the fact we have disclosed the RPL in our earnings statement, that is 0 to CHF1.6 billion.

But just to dimension it, it's not actually a fair value, that's the par value. And the upside on this award is plus 50% and it's -- but it's -- that's at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. And basically -- and we will give more detail on March 10. But essentially, the criteria fall into delivery of the risk and compliance and control goals, point one. And obviously, delivery of some of the other key profit metrics, point two by 2024. So that's the upside in terms of this. It's not for those, obviously, you have a history of us, it's not a multiplier type instrument that you may have seen in the past, basically, but there is upside and it's clearly linked to both the risk remediation, risk culture point as well as the profit goals we actually laid out in GSR.  And I would say there are also knockout clauses to the downside, but we'll give more details on that on March 10. So hopefully, that helps you in terms of thinking about that instrument basically.  I think your second question was really about the sort of start of January. Look, I think we're still in it 4 or 5 weeks into the year. What certainly occurred to me, I think, is that there was a sort of weak start in terms of financing activity at the beginning of this year, and that was really kind of true across the bank. What we've seen, obviously, with this volatility is a pickup in terms of some of the sort of trading lines, the stronger performance by GTS and obviously, a stronger performance by equity derivatives, which is exactly what you expect in the circumstances. So it has picked up. But certainly, I think we're always to January starting very strongly, and that was not the case this year, and I think we did want to make that clear.",

I mean clearly, if we're talking about our total investment spend, we're obviously talking more around CHF3 billion in terms of IT, for example, each year. So that's the additional investments we expect to coming through the expense line. Because as you know, certain investments are capitalized and then amortized. So that's the guidance, as you might say, to how much the cost run rate we'll incur as a consequence. I mean, and we are very focused on driving cost efficiency across our existing infrastructure and therefore, releasing reserves and resources for that investment program. So there's very much a bifurcation how we think about costs between these 2 components and these 2 elements.

And I think we feel it is only appropriate to operate at a ratio above 14% and around 4.5% on leverage ratio because I think we have to be seen as unquestioned in terms of our capital position, and that's very much our capital strategy.  Quite clearly, we've outlined the plan to actually reinvest. So we're obviously reducing capital investment bank by CHF3 billion, of which CHF2 billion has already been accomplished, obviously largely through the exit at the majority of prime. That does release reserves for the Wealth Management businesses. But I think we were very clear back on the 4th of November that we would expect that to be delivered in a measured and balanced way compatible with our risk appetite and risk goals. So it's not all going to come out and we're going to go back in again. That would not be. But clearly, we do have capacity to support that Wealth Management growth provided it meets our risk criteria.",

So other areas like FX, where we have clearly more volatility, which is a good thing, I guess, for our business. And the same is true for some other GTS businesses we have. And equity derivatives, we think, will continue to be a source of opportunity in these volatile markets. So that's an area where we had already very strong results in '21, and we continue to see a good opportunity there. And then there are certain macro businesses that will probably also benefit from more volatile markets around interest rate hikes.

Just to be helpful, I don't think you should take CHF28 million and multiply it by 4 for '22, that would not be correct. I would expect the number probably somewhere between, say, CHF50 million and CHF100 million, maybe let's pick CHF75 million at that, difficult to be exact. And that's mainly because, of course, as clients' losses or potential losses in respect of the SCF fund are actually absorbed, obviously, the program becomes irrelevant at that point.  And that's clearly very good because I think it is good to see the take-up. It does, obviously, I think, demonstrate our support for clients, and this is very important in respect to this matter. But clearly, essentially, it's also resolving this issue, which I think is actually important in terms of that.

    "text": "49:59 Yeah. Thank you. Magdalena. So first of all, as you can see on Page 7 in terms of the wealth management, derisking measures, they touched really on five areas, cheap financing, exit of sub-Sahara Africa markets, then the Russia related derisking, concentration risks and client risk review. And if you look at some of the lending volumes that we have, also shown in David sections, for example, on Global Wealth Management, the reduction was quite significant in terms of lending volume. So you can see, for example, net loans are down 14% since the first quarter of ‘21, you can see that on Page 23. 50:52 And what we are really have not yet seen is a rebound of that, it's actually quite the opposite. As you can also see on Page 23, net loans went down a further CHF6 billion from the end of the fourth quarter. And this was partially impacted by Russia, and partially by deleveraging in Asia. So in terms of the milestone through the wealth management normalization you could see in our chart also on page six, for example, that the Russia and AFG impact was about CHF130 million to the adjusted PTI of CHF212 million for wealth management. 51:38 And then as you go through the second, third, fourth quarter, we clearly expect and would like to drive reversal from what we've seen over the last 12 months. Namely, a reduction of lending volumes, but also clearly a more proactive approach, generally with respect to some of the transactional revenues that are related to larger transactions for our ultra-high net worth clients. So step-by-step over the next few quarters, we expect to move back to a more normalized return on regulatory capital towards the 18% that we have as a target for 2024. This will not be achieved in the next one or two quarters. But clearly, as we move over the next two years, we are moving towards that 18%, that's clearly our target under the leadership of Francesco and his team and we are fully focused on that. 52:45 Secondly, on your question on M&A. You say it was positive, yes, it was positive, but it's not nearly there where I would like it to be. It was marginally positive in every region. It was mainly positive in Switzerland and in Asia. But -- and also in our external asset management business. But I see substantial more opportunities, particularly also, for example, in the Middle East and in other area. So I have never been a big fan of quarterly NNA, because they are volatile by nature, but this will clearly be the mid-term target of Francesco and his team, both not only for assets under management, but more the entire client business volume, which was always my preferred metric, which includes also assets under custody and especially lending volumes and that's where we want to grow the business and where we see mid-term substantial growth opportunities.",

So the first question I had is regarding the cost guidance that you have provided, you gave us guidance of adjusted cost of CHF17 billion for this year. Indeed, if I annualized the adjusted cost you printed for Q1, this is the run rate we are heading too. The only issue is that the adjusted revenues has been running around CHF18 billion of annualized run rate, in the past two quarters. I understand that part of the cost guidance has to do with variable compensation in the investments that you talked about. I know the environment has been tough the past two quarters. The only issue is, it could remain so for the rest of the year. So the question, I wanted to ask you is, do you stick to the CHF17 billion cost guidance, no matter what the revenues end of being this year, which means you could be hardly profit making on an adjusted basis this year with your core Tier 1 ratio just below the target? 56:15 And the second question is actually on capital whether you could just elaborate please on any capital impact that you think could come for the rest of the year, whether you expect further increase in op risk RWA, further impact from model changes. So any other element you have in mind as of today’s standpoint on capital would be helpful? Thank you.",

    "text": "56:35 Okay. Thank you very much. Let's take the two questions in turn. Look, I think there is limited cost flexibility in 2022 for two primary reasons. Firstly, I think, if we look back at ‘21, our response to Greensill and the Archegos matters was to reduce both the absolute amount of variable compensation, but also to increase the amount of deferrals. And that's what drove our cost down to just over 16 billion last year. That was the right thing to do in the circumstance. But it's not sustainable for long term and it's why I guided when we spoke earlier this year and indeed back at the Investor Day. But we'd expect to see it about 1 billion increase in our expenses. 57:23 Now that's not to say that I'm giving any particular guidance over the economic value, the total value of awards for 2022. It's much too early in this year to make that kind of statement and clearly is, flexibility in terms of that. But I think sitting here at the first quarter, I think it's appropriate to be prudent in terms of what I say about that. I think the second reason is, if we think about what we're doing in terms of risk compliance and the IT to actually support it. I think clearly, those are necessary investments we need to make as we address the issues that caused so much damage in 2021 to our results and everything else. We are obviously executing a substantial strategic cost program. So I mentioned already the outsourcing of procurement to 150 million of cash savings that should generate. We're also putting together all of our operating IT, --- operations and IT functions on Jo, so moving back to the sort of pre-2016 structure. And that should yield very significant savings, but to be clear, majority of that actually flows through in 2023. And ditto, the exit from prime. We will save money from that. 58:41 But at the moment, we're still in the rundown of that particular business. So there is whether we like it or not a significant delivery of short term inflexibility in the cost base for 2022 and I think we've warned about that before in terms of where we are now. It doesn't mean there's no flexibility. But I think that's why I'm sticking to the guidance of around 17 billion for this year. We're working very hard at this. We're considering what we should prioritize, what we should deprioritized, but there are certain things particularly around the risk and control investments that really do have to actually happen. But I think that's all I can really say, at this point early in the year, there is clearly some flexibility around variable compensation, particularly with a much lower level of deferral. You understand that the gearing through to cash is therefore higher. 59:31 I think in terms of capital, I think our medium term ambition was same. We want to have a CET1 ratio of the group of at least 14% before the Bal IV transition in 2024. We've obviously dipped slightly below that this quarter, mainly due to the 600 million increase in litigation provisions, which mathematically just drops you almost exactly by 20 basis points. I think I probably expect the ratio to rain somewhere in the 13.5% to 14% for the next six months, depending on the level of cash generation, other issues we actually deal with and how we actually allocate capital but I'd expect our CET1 ratio there afterwards to actually improve at and above our 14 % medium term target in terms of that. I think you asked specific question in terms of methodology, I think I said, back in February that we expected about 6 billion to 7 billion of methodology changes this year I think that's still the case, but clearly there will be some increase in op risk RWA above and beyond that, as we work through the impact of the litigation provisions that we took two weeks there, but I don't have a particular view at this point in terms of that number and that's something I'd expect to see in the second half of this year not in the second quarter. 60:54 So, I hope that some help. On the cost point, we are super focused on moving to a more flexible structure. But as I said, a lot of this comes through in ‘23, rather than ‘22.",

Look, I think the target setting for the 14% is clearly in respect to the inflation we expect to see when we finally get to the B3R transition a couple of years’ time. And we want to make sure that we have sufficient buffer for that and we don't have a rerun of what we saw with the B3 transition a decade ago. But nonetheless, I think we set a medium term ambition of 14%. I've kind of said it could be in the range of 13.5% to 14% for the next six months. I think there is a balance in terms of that, in terms of putting money to work within the Wealth Management lending business in particular, and we obviously like to see that, but I think it is important that we remain prudent in terms of the group CET1 levels that we actually operate at. So that's the balance that I'm thinking about really in terms of how we actually operate. 63:12 I think we have taken some tough decisions in the first quarter, particularly around the litigation provisions, but I think those were the right things to say. And if the cost of that as we dropped to 13.8% then it is where it is, I guess. But I think it is important to really put a dent into this.

As you also saw the total AUM have also reduced given market performance and other factors. So, broadly speaking, those top number has marginally reduced, but not too much. The terms of how we deal with Russian clients, now obviously, you have the sanctioned clients and there, you basically can't touch them and basically, it's just sitting there. And then you have the other Russian clients where they are legally not sanctioned, but the fact given the rules in Switzerland and the EU, which are broadly the same is basically that they cannot bring any new assets so, but they can obviously retrieve assets. And that's really the situation that we have at the moment with those non-sanctioned Russian clients of which some of them are living in Russia, some of them are living in the west. So, but they are all subject to the restrictions that we see in the EU and in Switzerland. So that's really how it works and we do not really have any new business with Russian clients at all. 66:31 With respect to the IBCM market shares in EMEA and APAC. Yes, they were marginally up and we had some good transactions, but it's also fair to say that the overall market as you know is down significantly. And we always also see that the U.S. usually is 60% to 70% of the market. So, and we have traditionally a strong leverage finance in ECM and M&A practice and especially, leveraged finance in ECM was down more. And DCM investment grade, capital market is the market where we have lower market share. So that obviously that mix was not helpful in this first quarter.

I think so far in terms of revenue impact, it's probably similar perhaps less than what we talked about back in November either hasn't been that much of a multiplier impact. And clearly, there was a cost aspect this as well. But realistically those cost savings will only come in late in the year and into 2023 because we obviously need to ensure that our customers are actually dealt with fairly and properly as we actually transition this business. 69:20 I think in terms of Prime Service, and Thomas you may have to comment, but I have a first crack at the leverage finance type point. I think our market share and leverage finance obviously did drop in the fourth quarter of last year. I think we're just outside of the top ten. It's improved to about fifth, I think in the first quarter. I think what we are seeing as a consequence of the volatility and interest rates and to lesser extent credit markets in the first quarter is the market of shifted away from the sponsors business and perhaps more to corporate issuers. So it's slightly adverse market shift for us. But I think you can see in the numbers we've given one of the appendices is that we've got about 7.4 billion of leverage finance pipeline, and that's increased and steadily over the last few quarters. But I think as we commented in the outlook statement, I think, clearly, we are hostess to fortune in terms of the stability of markets to actually how well work and how fast we can actually execute that business. But Thomas I don't if you want to.",

    "text": "72:55 Yeah. So if you look at our fixed income sales and trading and the various components, so with securitized products and GTS, then you can clearly see, if you compare the Q1 significant reduction, but if you go more back, let's say the first quarter ‘20 then the -- but basically, we are up in securitized products. We are up about 30% compared to the first quarter ‘20. So had a very decent performance there. In other credit products, as you can remember ‘20 was a very strong quarter in terms of credit trading, there we are down and GTS was, which is mainly driven on the fixed income side by financing on our side as well as by FX and macro businesses, which are clearly much smaller than some of our competitors where we are also down to that comparable quarter. But It is clear that we have not the exposure that others have to certain interest rate trading business with a macro FX or commodities that some of our other peers have where they saw some benefits after dislocation created by the Russia innovation, which we do not have. So we did obviously have the benefit as we actually predicted in our 2020 Investor Day, we said that 2021 will be the year for Credit, and that is exactly what happened in the first quarter, 2021, where we saw an absolute record in our fixed income sales and trading of 1.6 billion compared to the 800 million that we now saw in the first quarter ’22, so we are half, basically of where we were. 75:05 So I don't think that the first quarter ‘22 is necessarily the right basis to look at for where we should be maybe in ’23, ‘24. The first quarter 20 was more in the 1.3 billion area. We are now at 800 million. So there's clearly upside from where we are now, but the same is true for capital markets, whether it's ECM, whether it's leverage finance where we had a very, I would say slow quarter in the first quarter like many of our peers as well. So one thing is the business mix, clearly, we have much more geared towards credit to capital markets, M&A and much less to macro. And the second is that we foresee clear improvement in some of our market shares through the investments we are making, especially around M&A and capital markets.",

I think, as I said, the level of compensation into -- I mean response that we decided in response to Archegos and Greensill was to reduce the overall level of variable compensation as you know and we've summarized that in the comp report and the annual report. But what we also did, which we’re also clear about is we actually reduced the amount of cash and increased demand of deferral last year for many reasons, which as you know. 77:04 Now moving into ‘22 that level of deferral was not sustainable. And as you said back in November and again in February, essentially, we want to normalize that. So that's what we've actually done unless we've accrued to in the first quarter. As I said, I'm not making any particular statements around the economic value of awards for compensation this year. I mean, if you want to push me a bit, I think I've used a basis of something similar in both conversation and the strategic delivery award as the plan for the accruals. But clearly, that's at this point in the first quarter just a place market shall we say, but then I'd use that the low deferral levels to actually calculate the cash accrual, which I think is the a prudent thing to do, and I think it's the right thing to do. But clearly as we actually work through this year, we'll have to decide what is the right level for economic value and that's obviously going to depend on our performance and on the conditions in which we actually operate. 78:00 There afterwards if you're asking the question around 2023, you're right, we will then have had that step change and then we move forward basically. I don't think the banks intention necessarily will be to change that deferral plan in ‘23 compared to ‘22. But that'll will be a decision to made at the time. But I think clearly once you actually get into ‘23 then some of the cost pressures that we've seen away from this in ’22 fall away. We have clearly the savings from the integration of the technology function, which will be substantial and we'll discuss that in more detail in the deep dive and later on this quarter. And we'll have some relief elsewhere in terms obviously have the accelerating benefits from procurement outsourcing and some of the other reengineering benefits, and we'll also have the cost savings from the Prime exit, which will help the investment bank numbers. So I think certainly from a cost point of view, I think ‘22 is perhaps the most challenging year to be dealing with, provided that we manage things well going through the period.",

So first actually just going back to the redivisionalization and the kind of updated numbers that were released also a few -- I guess few weeks back. It looks also like the redivisionalization was slightly different to what was initially presented at the Investor Day and in terms, some of the business movements. It seems like obviously, the sub-high net worth businesses retained within the Swiss Bank and it seemed like there's a higher IB contribution or revenue contribution than previously anticipated. Just wanted to understand some of those dynamics and whether that changes also some of a divisional kind of aspiration or target? 80:14 And the second question just relates further to restructuring and parent co-capital levels? So just wanted to understand better as well whether or not parent co-capitalization limits your ability to do further restructuring at some of the businesses, if it potentially impacts further participation values?

    "text": "80:41 Should I take the second one and then pass back to you Thomas for the PBS change. But I think in terms of the parent, I mean, I think what we've done so far in this -- in the year is pretty much in mind what I said back in February. So, I think you may recall that I was talking about something like 10 billion of dividend recap to dividends and capital repatriation to come out of the subsidiaries and into the parent to basically strengthen the ratio from the 11.4% that we had basically as of the first of January this year. And so for this year, we've moved in about 2 billion from both Switzerland and from CSH USA, and that's obviously increased the ratio to 11.8%. 81:31 And I think if we look forward to the balance this year, I think the other dividends and capital restructuring are on track. They do remain subject to regulatory approval and some of those approvals do have to go through a process that takes several months. So as I said before, I would expect those to come through primarily in the second half of this year rather than the second quarter this year. But I think, so that's really as per our plan. 82:02 I think in terms of your other question, -- which is, the answer is yes, clearly, if you have to reduce the value of those subsidiaries without further capital repatriation that has an adverse impact on the parent ratio. So it does act as some constraint in terms of what we can do basically. But I think equally if we actually think about the bank overall, when we talked about shifting 3 billion of capital from the Investment Bank to the Wealth Management businesses that's a clearly an overall MIS sense. 82:32 But in order to actually accomplish that, given that more of the investment banking business is actually in the subsidiaries compared to the branch shares. We also need to move capital to actually support our Wealth Management ambition, Amit. So I hope that's of some help at least.",

So, out of the three businesses which we originally were planning to move into the global wealth, we moved in indeed two, namely the Swiss Premium Clients business, which is the ultra-high network business and the Global External Asset Management business in Switzerland into Global Wealth. 83:26 But the Swiss high net worth business we decided to leave in the Swiss Bank because the collaboration between both that business and the corporate bank on one side, but secondly also with the retail bank is just too close and is in addition to that, they share, for example, the mortgage centers and they are in all the 109 branches as we have in Switzerland. So for all these reasons, we came to view it's much easier if they stay in the same division, but Serge Fehr, who runs that business, he's also on the Global Wealth Management, Management Committee. And he's very closely also liaising with our global high net worth strategy because some of the successes we've seen now in Switzerland also with CSX, for example, is something that he can also help build out internationally with the Global Wealth Management team, but we are and we'll continue to show our volumes in terms of AUM and net new assets for our Global Wealth Management business including that business going forward as well. 84:43 And in terms of the investment banking revenues. I think they are pretty much in line with what we showed already in November. And obviously, they were – through the finalization of the restatement, we had to finalize the numbers for GTS and for AFG, especially those the AFG is the Asia Finance Group and the split between Wealth Management and Investment Banking and for those two businesses went through a finalization, iteration in the first quarter, but broadly speaking there and absolutely in line with what we had already presented on the 4 of November at our Strategy Day.",

And obviously, Francesco, who started in the 1 of January, was before he joined fully aware of all these targets and fully bought into this before he joined. So three out of the four divisional CEOs were indeed already there when we presented our presentation and Philipp Wehle, who is now the CFO of Francesco planted the numbers and plans. So there is very much continuity and I would not agree with the statement that we have different CEOs now executing the strategy. We have broadly the same lineup. 88:39 Secondly, we obviously did strengthen and appoint some additional ExB members for risk with David Wildermuth, who started on the 1 of January as did Jo Hannaford for our technology and engineering effort and they have very much had a very busy first four months since they joined reviewing the strategic plans, reviewing also what it means for both technology engineering for Jo’s and for David Wildermuth. He has had a lot of positive impact on our risk management approach. So, this is the reason also why we will do a deep dive for you guys at the end of June and to really go into each of those businesses with our new ExB colleagues with Francesco, with David Wildermuth for risk with our technology effort with Jo and Rafael from compliance all four will be presenting to you and you will be able to get a feeling about the progress.

But if I speak more generally, then I think it's clear to say that we had some positive developments on a number of the cases, where we have visibility to be able to settle and dismiss or reduce the scale number of those things and that reduced the RPL. 91:27 However, we did have certain adverse developments during the quarter and I think we've talked about those publicly already, but I'm not going to add to what we've said already. And therefore, we have generally reassessed our reasonably possible loss in terms of that. So there's a balance of things going on as you might say, in the RPL disclosure. And I think that's probably all I can say given the live nature of these actions. 91:54 I think more generally, I just would repeat what Thomas has already said, which is we have been making a very determined and proactive effort to seek to resolve dismiss, reduce the scale of these cases. Things such as the RMBS case is clearly date back to pre-2008, which is a very long time. And we managed to get more than 80 dismissed over the last two years. We've settled another 12.

I mean it's supposed to be year where it's a transition rather than a big restructuring year. And I wonder just feeding on from Kian’s question, how you think about opportunities for different business lines improving for the remainder of the year? And if not, where actually some businesses could be delevered further. And you’re notably in structured products securitized products and leverage lending and whether you think about these products actually being synergistic with the rest of IB, or even synergistic with Wealth Management and whether these could be delivered? 93:56 My second question is on the CET1 target that you have a 14%. We've discussed this before, but this -- I think it's worth we're revisiting again. It's optically quite high versus peers, especially Swiss peers of yours -- and I wonder whether you think -- whether this could be lowered, perhaps like 13% or whether there's some kind of like steady state where all regulatory changes have been implemented, are other charges can be taken into account and that you feel comfortable bringing that down to a lower level or not?",

And I think we got that point correct me anyone here, but to about a 35 billion to 40 billion increase in RWA. And I think we wanted to make sure that there were no questions around the capital ratios in the bank for that particular transition. 95:09 And I think that very much remains our position. I think if we get to 2024, and the impact is less or things have changed, then that's the decision we should make at that point, but it should be driven by a, that regulatory change, and b, let's be clear by the stress calculations we make in terms of our capital needs, and that's what will I think guide the board in terms of their views on that. But I think for this point, nothing has changed materially to justify change in that being where we want to be for that ambition.

I realize we'll need to wait to hear the conclusions, but I wanted to hear about how that review is being framed. And in particular, the cost target you're indicating seems to be a relatively limited change in the scope of the group. It's described more in terms of efficiencies rather than a change in scope, so I just wondered whether you're effectively ruling out significant changes in the shape and the scope of the group as you go into that review. And then my second question is more a numbers question for David, if you could just walk us through -- you talked about the RWA movements, but I wondered if you could talk us through the capital movements because capital reduced quite a lot less than the loss for the quarter. So I just wondered if you could talk us through the moving parts and what helped capital in the quarter.",

As we hedge forward about 65% of our equity into U.S. dollars, you'll see an appreciation in the capital base. So it's the point I referred to in my script. We neutralized the group CET1 ratio, but as the parent has a different ratio, we can't neutralize both at the same time, so that will boost the underlying group equity.

Firstly, if we look at the current perimeter, the current -- of the bank, then we believe it is perfectly possible to operate this on the [basis of the analysis] we've done at less than CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term. Clearly we need to do our remediation programs. Those are clearly critical, but on the basis of the current structure of the bank, we think a cost target less than CHF 15.5 billion is perfectly achievable. That clearly does not preclude, and I'll pass back to Axel and Thomas, any changes in the perimeter. Clearly, if we changed the perimeters of the bank, that cost target would actually change.

I think, as I said before, there's been quite a lot of work that's been put into the cost program and actually very detailed benchmarking at -- in every aspect of the bank to actually support this analysis. I think that has indicated significant potential even absent the strategy review. And I think quite clearly, I mean, Thomas has very much led this. I think you know we actually have outsourced our procurement function. And I think what has been clear from that outsourcing is that there are significant potential in -- for savings in some of our supplier relationships, and that does include some of our managed servicing arrangements. So I guess, brutally, Magdalena, we're paying too much. And I think, as part of the pressure around the procurement function and the outsourcing, we do see savings there. And that will give us the ability to offset to a degree at least, because one has to recognize the inflationary pressures in the system, what we're seeing outside. And it's -- that's -- I guess it's a problem, but in that sense it's an opportunity to actually achieve that. I think the second point -- and Jo Hannaford spoke eloquently about this at the Investor Day back in June. I think we made the right and brave decision to put IT and operations back together as a single function. That's transformational in terms of what it can actually drive us in terms of scale benefits, but I think -- beyond that, I think it brings back centralized IT control, which is the right thing to do, and the ability to actually drive our IT much more effectively, so as you can guess, I'm very supportive about this. And I think it does give us potential, so I'm not decrying the cost pressures we see in the system, but I think we can, I can see 2 large levers there. And when I look at the much more detailed work that we've done across the rest of the bank, I can see how we can drive towards the CHF 1 billion to CHF 1.5 billion total for our current perimeter. And as we've said, I think that really takes us in 2 directions, one, as Axel has and Thomas has said already, in terms of the strategy review. And I think, two, basically we will obviously need to deliver gross savings in excess of that net target in order to allow for our investment plan and [to a degree] to offset the inflationary factors you're referring to, Magdalena.",

I'm not going to go into detailed P&L and cost metrics today. What I would say is this is a business that Credit Suisse has a long track record in. Clearly it's our origins lie in mortgage securitization, but it's expanded well beyond that into asset finance. That is a business that is seeing structural growth, particularly with the growth in private debt. There's a lot of appetite for those types of products. I think our ability to actually finance that in house is -- clearly has limits and notwithstanding the sustained profitability of this business and its high returns. And I think, therefore, it is the right thing to do, to actually consider third-party capital for this to allow us to basically maximize the potential of this franchise and, I think, without basically distorting our overall asset allocation. So we like this business, but there has to be a limit to how much capital you can actually organize. And I think there will be demand for this, and I've already received one e-mail this morning already. I think -- but it does -- it has -- this is a sustainably profitable business which does cover a very broad range of asset financing. I think, just quickly on the Russian-related outflows. Look. I think we've had outflows in -- both in respect of sanctioned clients, which we obviously do treat as a structural change because the money is locked -- and then in terms of non-sanctioned clients, we had about a CHF 1.4 billion outflow. I'm not going to comment. I think clearly it's an evolving situation, obviously, [where it's changing with] geopolitical situation. It's very uncomfortable and very difficult. [I mean just note] that we saw that in terms of those numbers. I mean, yes, I think, in terms of the third quarter -- and look. Brutally, we're only 3 weeks into the third quarter. I'm not going to comment on net new asset outflows 3 weeks into the quarter. We'll see how this quarter develops. Just do note we've had positive inflows for the first half of the year and, I think, clearly in what is a very challenging environment.",

Or does that really ultimately depend on the measures you'll take and probably also the impact or expected impact on parent bank given that restructurings often result in impairments there? And secondly, just on profitability. Obviously we will all guess how the go-to profile looks like over the next 3 months, but I mean you mentioned the CHF 15.5 billion like-for-like cost base. You had a 10% drop to your target in the past. One could argue that the business will be even more capital light going forward, so it should actually be higher than that. So I mean, taking a 40 billion [TNAV], that would probably imply like a net profit of 4 billion or revenues north of 20 billion, which you probably think could be a sustainable base given the current profile.

And a 13.5% CET1 is one of the highest CET1 ratios we've actually ever reported, so we are in a strong capital position. And our leverage ratio is equally strong in terms of that, so I think the bank is well funded in terms of that. What I have said in the course of this morning is that I do have continued AT1 plans. I think you may note that I've given guidance of CHF 2 billion to CHF 4 billion of AT1 issuance this year, of which I've only issued [1.65 billion], so clearly we are looking to add to AT1 capital, if that's helpful, Daniele, in terms of your thinking and analysis. I think, in terms of the parent capital ratio, the drop from 11.8% to 11.4% is primarily due to FX. And I'm happy to expand on that, if you like, Daniele, but just quickly: We clearly neutralize for the group. And therefore, moves in the dollar against the Swiss franc in particular do not have an impact on the group ratio, but because the FX weighting of the parent is different from that of the group, that means that a higher dollar tends to reduce the parent capital ratio. So if we had FX rates similar to where they were at the end of the first quarter, it would have been probably closer to [11.6 or 11.7]. And then the balance basically reflects the net losses, but as you note here, I've actually seen about 1.8 billion of capital repatriations and dividends, of which $1.2 billion came from the U.K. entity CSSEL which I've talked about before, Daniele, which you know very well basically. There is an ongoing repatriation request in respect of CSSEL, and that's something we're clearly discussing with regulators. I'm not going to comment on that, but there clearly is excess capital in CSSEL because it is now a nonmaterial legal entity. And you know our plan is to repatriate the bulk of that to CSAG in due course. I think -- in terms of strategy, I think, Axel, there's not much we can really add, but...",

Is it fair to assume that those savings will be spread across the divisions? And how does this cost efficiency drive, help to transform the Investment Bank into a less-complex and more capital-light entity? And also does it come fast enough given that the unit is losing about 1 billion underlying pretax in the first half of this year?

So there's a limit to what I can actually do, Stefan, in terms of DTA, I'm afraid. And I think we're taking a prudent approach around tax. I think -- on the first question. Look. I think -- fair points. I think, as we've said, this cost program is an absolute priority for the Board and for the executive management of Credit Suisse. It has to happen. The work on this is advanced, but I think -- and it's -- but I think it's clear, given what Jo said at the Investor Day in June, that's probably most advanced in terms of our technology operations. And I think she gave a very good summary of what can be achieved there in terms of the efficiency of our IT programs, the integration of IT and what [she's] actually bringing to this job. And I think it's got off to a very good start in terms of actually providing very effective and clear leadership. Procurement program, as I said before, is something -- the outsourcing, which something was -- Thomas was very much behind in terms of driving this. And I think that's heading in the right direction. I think it's perhaps a little bit embarrassing. The savings are what they are, but I guess it's an opportunity. But I think we do want to make the point that this cost program is not limited to technology or procurement, which just to answer your question specifically, Stefan, does accrue across the whole group because essentially majority of this is the corporate functions. And it flows out through the allocations, but it is not limited just to those things. It is a complete review of the costs of all divisions and all corporate functions of the bank and will include savings across all of those.",

    "text": "That's a good question. Thanks, Chris. Just to take the 2 in turn: I mean I think -- in terms of compensation costs, Chris, I think you know that last year, as a consequence of our response particularly to Archegos, we did go for a much higher level of deferral. That was an appropriate decision we made in conjunction with what -- which we made. And clearly, this year, we are actually going back to much more normal levels of deferral, so therefore, the [CVA], the cash component of the awards is substantially higher than before. I think -- in terms of the outlook for compensation costs overall, I think clearly it's a radically different investment banking environment this year than it was last year. I'm not going to prejudge how this year closes out, but I -- it doesn't seem to me like it's going to be as good a year for bonuses in 2022 as it was in 2021 across the industry. So yes, we'll look at it, basically, but the year-on-year change is primarily due to deferral changes. Clearly we have looked at this as part of our program, but it's not the primary driver in terms of what we need to do. We're talking about sustainable improvements in efficiency that we need to achieve that go far beyond compensation changes. I think, your second question, in terms of the mark-to-market on the unrealized, in particular, component of the leveraged finance. Well, it was $245 million. Would it be better in July? Well, look. Yes, you're right in the sense the indices have obviously [rallied] in the first few weeks of July, but I think a lot of wood to chop in terms of market volatility before one can make these comments. And I would be inclined to be still prudent about this. As I've said, we clearly take our marks continuously. It's not just done at the end of a quarter. It's done on a regular basis. And that reflects both deals that have actually funded already where we've exited but also marked to market against future funding commitments. So I think that's a protocol which, I would say, I've followed since 2007; and I think it's the prudent way to think about it. You're right. The indices have narrowed, but just history from the past basically says you can't always judge specific trades by moves in indices basically. So I would still be cautious, Chris, in terms of this. I think there's -- we're still in the course of a very difficult market environment with very radical changes in the interest rates structure. And it clearly has a -- and clearly, Chris, as I said in my prepared remarks, there does have to be a much increased chance of a significant recession at some point in the next 12 months.",

And those are trades which my treasury function has actually been conducting, so we are beginning to lock that benefit in. It's not just a forward curve projection, but I did want also to basically disclose that, clearly given the moving credit spreads across the market, across the banks and for Credit Suisse, for that matter, it seemed prudent to basically guide to the adverse impact to funding costs as a consequence, both for those moves and, of course, the increase in the AT1 guidance which I've given this morning. Clearly what the funding costs will be in '23 or '24 will obviously depend critically on what our credit spreads are at the time [we actually issue].

Do they roll off at some point? So I guess my question is, if you keep on making losses, would you see your CET1 ratio drop lower? So that was my first question. And then my second question is on retention packages that have hit the headlines lately. Could you explain in detail how these are expensed through the P&L?

    "text": "Well, firstly, I think, just in terms of the CET1 ratio, I mean, I think clearly there's clearly a number of moving parts there. Obviously we did reduce our business usage. And that was clearly part of the plan we actually had last year, so I think that's to be expected, primarily in the IB clearly, but I think clearly we also had the leveraged finance losses [Indiscernible] overall performance of the banks and including litigation charges. So there clearly is a number of volatile items within that. I think it seems prudent to give a range of 13% to 14%. I'm not really going to add to it beyond that. As I said, I think it is a very high capital ratio for the bank, certainly compared to historic norms. And indeed we did include a comparison at the back of the deck against many of our peers. So I think that is worth keeping in mind. On the FX point. It's we continuously roll the -- roughly 65% of our CET1 forward, so they don't have an expiry date in terms of that. It's just part of our normal treasury management. We've run it continuously on that basis. That's separate from my term-out strategy for the shareholders' equity which I mentioned before, which I think you may be alluding to, where we have been keeping it relatively short for the last couple of years, typically around 2.5 years. I think [we're weather right to] these sorts of events coming at some point, although they've been clearly much, much more marked than I would have expected. And we have been seeking to -- we have been terming that out in the course of recent months basically, as interest rates have actually moved up, to actually lock that in. And those are typically termed out to somewhere between 4 and 5 years. [Andrew asked that] question, but there are 2 separate things. One is my term-out strategy for the equity. The other is my FX exposure management -- sorry. And you asked a technical question around retention and recognition and -- well, look. I think this -- I don't think I can add too much in terms of details. If I talk about the program we did last year, to give you some idea: Typically speaking, those were 3-year instruments; and they vest roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 basically. So it's a time-weighted basis, so it's -- if they were awarded for 6 months, it would be 1/6, 1/3, 1/3, 1/6, depending on when they're actually awarded. That's how they work.",

And then secondly, on the securitized products business. I mean, when you think about that business and if we got to a point somewhere down the road where you looked either to do a disposal or some form of exit, do you think there are interlinkages with other parts of the IB that you intend to maintain as -- in their current format? And I guess the reason I ask the question is because we've sort of seen with the exit of Prime Services that there can be unintended consequences for businesses that you retain, in terms of spillover effects.

I mean, as you say basically, we were not anticipating the $200 million charge in respect of unapproved electronic communications. I think you've obviously seen that across the industry, but I wasn't expecting that at the end of the first quarter, so that was a new case. It had no RPL associated with it and doesn't have any RPL associated now, so unfortunately, I've had to increase my provisions by [200] with no impact on RPL . I think the balance -- I mean I think you know that Markus Diethelm took office as our General Counsel. He's been doing a full review of our legal case. He has made and continues to make substantial progress in resolving a number of these cases, and that really flowed from that review of those cases. There's nothing particularly new that's popped up to drive the RPL number. I think, on the second question, just on SP. I just would guide you against from -- kind of assuming that this is an exit from securitized products. This is a very successful platform. It's been core to the bank for a very long time indeed, firstly, in mortgages, and now in terms of asset financing.

And that's really what we're looking to actually do here, frankly, so I just want to caution against this is an exit from SP. It's not.

Quite frankly, that follows a legal entity simplification strategy that we've been investing in over the years, that's contributed in the region of about CHF 18 billion of efficiencies to date. We will continue investing in that initiative over the next three years, and we'd expect that to free up more parent capital during that period as well. On the deposit front, what you have seen in the third quarter as we show on Slide 9, is really that a combination of market moves and NNA outflows have led to a reduction in AUM in the third quarter. Net new asset outflows were in the region of CHF 13 billion in the third quarter. As you know, the negative social media news around our name at the beginning of October did lead to outflows across our franchise.

But could you give us a sense of how concentrated those outflows were versus more broad-based. And we've seen the outflows I think, because you've provided us with so much information but there seems to be outflows in APAC and MENA, but for example not in EMEA. Would you be able to kind of give us a sense of kind of what actually happened during the quarter and maybe in the beginning of and maybe in October as well to kind of for us to be able to assess how to look at them going forward.",

And you rightly put it which you then see reflected in the transaction-based income line as well. Our Wealth Management business is very strong as you know in APAC in emerging markets that has impacted that clearly as you said. If you look at the CHF 6.4 billion it's a combination in the third quarter of deleveraging and derisking if you want to so about CHF 3 billion comes from deleveraging another like CHF 2 billion is a proactive call it derisking and then some additional deposit outflows.

And how should we think about the trend into the fourth quarter in terms of advisers and in that context this clients do you need to increase deposit rates in order to retain i.e. should we think about NII changes in the Wealth Management business in terms of impact from deposit remuneration that you might have to give. And then the second question is just on funding. Clearly your funding costs have changed quite materially lately.

That's on a full year basis versus last year. You've seen the uptick in spreads across the entire industry including on our name. And the idiosyncratic effects in October have resulted in wider spreads on our name as well. Look today's announcements that we'll speak about during the Strategy Day, the actions we're taking on the investment bank, the lower leverage and RWA footprint that we will run with, the reduction of our risk profile and exposure through the Securitized Products exit, all of those items I think will be conducive to a tightening of spreads over time, and we think that would allow us to reduce our funding costs as we get through the transformation. In terms of deposit rates, we would be looking to regain our market share and would be competitive as you'd expect us to be. It's not lost on us that look you did see in the US as a result of really liquidity in the system contracting especially from central banks that you did see large reductions in deposits in the United States as well.

And so it was pretty strong and probably at the highest end by peer standards. That of course has gone down as we've indicated in our disclosures through the month of October. And that's partly related to the previous question that I got around funding from Kian, which is we will then commence funding subsequent to the announcements today. We had self-selected to be out of the capital markets during the month of October given the strategic announcements that were coming today and we'd be once again commencing funding activities. The second is just what you'll hear about later and you'll see -- and I won't go through all the detail right now is that the leverage exposure reductions and balance sheet reductions that we have as part of our strategic announcements actually reduce our funding needs greatly over the next few years.",

That is at least what the colleagues here in the firm tell me being here longer than 30 years. So -- and I think it has shown and has developed very good momentum and, hence, the figures I gave for January. You asked concretely about pricing. So, we try to be competitive, call it, like many of our competitors as well, so to be in the game, but we are not buying assets, just to be clear, because that would not be very smart going forward as well. So, what is also the fact, and I think that is something which all my colleagues in the bank and myself felt and the many, many clients interactions which we had nearly on a daily basis, I would say is that the client support which we get from them is really overwhelming. And I mean this something which is absolutely, for me and my colleagues, is absolutely fantastic.

    "text": "Andrew, I'll take the second, and thank you for joining the call. The SPG transaction, as you know from our previous announcements, part of our strategy to reshape and rightsize the Investment Bank. That portfolio had in the region of around CHF75 billion approximately of assets at the end of September. We've derisked two-thirds of that portfolio overall through a combination of transactions with Apollo and the first close yesterday and other third parties in the market. And so, we're making rapid progress in reshaping the Investment Bank starting with the SPG portfolio. And we'll continue to enforce capital efficiency and balance sheet efficiency in the Investment Bank. The other leg of that stool is, of course, the Capital Release Unit, which, as I mentioned in my remarks, came into being on the 1st of January. We've moved with pace in advance of that in the fourth quarter to derisk as well. Regarding your question on First Boston -- CS First Boston, CS First Boston, we are reshaping that business as we speak to be capital-light, balance sheet efficient, as well as rightsizing headcount, as Ulrich had mentioned as well. And so, to the extent that we have synergistic businesses, they, of course, will fit well in Credit Suisse First Boston, but I would use those criteria at the outset, which is looking at cost efficiency and balance sheet efficiency as two main criteria for which businesses would fall into SPG -- into Credit Suisse First Boston. The second point I'd make is that with our macro and our markets businesses, we have rightsized those businesses. We've refocused them and, of course, aligned them towards our Wealth Management and our Swiss Bank franchise, which is a key pillar of our strategy at the outset. We will, of course, reflect our restated financials once we set up the CRU, so you'll have a better idea at that stage of the relative splits and what our new segmentation looks like.

So, I would say, with respect to your Wealth Management question, what is important, that's why we gave these indications from January, the group overall, as I said, is positive on deposits; Wealth Management, globally, positive on deposits; Asia Pac, positive on deposits. And I'm reiterating that because, as you are fully aware of, the deposits are these kind of assets, so to say, which leave first and have the fungibility to reenter first. So -- and I think that is important to bear in mind. As you immediately understand, Magdalena, we do not give you business plan figures. But you can assume that in the Wealth Management plan is a fair chunk of rewinning lost volumes, lost business with our clients. And important to note here is as well that we hardly lost any client. I think that is also important. That shows you something about what I said before in terms of the relationship which we may have with our clients. Seems to be, for me, very important. In terms of the cost and, Dixit, you might add, a couple of points from my side. With respect to the CHF1.2 billion target, which we stick to, as you are aware of, for 2023, 80% of this cost reduction has been initiated and this in execution already in the fourth quarter. So, I think that is something very positive, which you need to bear in mind. So, you will see the effects coming in, obviously, quarter-by-quarter as we speak in 2023. To better understand, I would say, the overall program, I mean we are doing in forcefully, as I said, everything which we would do in that situation to reduce the cost with the more, call it, classical measures like as we were alluding to getting more efficient, therefore, leading in less headcount, reducing contractors, consultant spend, and there is room to go. This is absolutely no question, we are looking at the usual things which you apply, like how many levels in the organization, how many direct reports, all these kind of things we are working on. Having said that, and I'm saying that because this is what I would think is, call it, the first phase to get into new Credit Suisse. And then, obviously, and we are working in parallel on that one, is that we are asking ourselves and developing our new operating model for new Credit Suisse, and that needs some more work over the next few months. But I think that is important for the second phase of cost reduction, because the new operating model in itself must be designed in a way that is much more agile and much more simpler. That's why we talked about that in connection with new Credit Suisse several times.",

The second point I'd make is we will keep focusing on optimizing our legal entity structure, which also has upside for our cost base. And the third point I'd make is that I mentioned in my remarks that our cost targets are very much on a constant perimeter basis. And so, for example, as we progress towards the final close of the Securitized Products transaction, we will, of course, once that's closed, also then adjust our targets accordingly. So, I think what you're going to see from us as a management team is that we will leave no stone unturned.

You said that you'd had further outflows in Wealth Management in January, but at a reduced level. I just wondered how we should interpret what you mean by reduced level. Is that relative to 15% in 4Q or relative to where you were in December? That would be very helpful just to understand what you mean by a reduced level of outflows.",

If you look into October and November together, it's more than 85% of the outflows stemming from these two months, and that was exactly the reason. And you are aware of, before our strategy update end of October, we are not in a situation to communicate. That made it so hard in October. And that's why we started immediately at October 27, literally, our client outreach program, which travels with us -- traveled with us throughout the whole year and travels with us right now and as we speak. So, it has not stopped. So, more than 85% from October and November, which tells you now how the development was also in the last quarter. With respect to your second question, net new assets, in particular, we said we are positive, which is very good, because that's a very proactive region, growth region. We are positive in APAC with a good number for January also in comparison to other years. We are positive in Switzerland, also with a good number overall here. We are positive in a couple of smaller other geographies, but we are also still having some outflows in other regions. And that's why we gave this guidance to say, look, it's not at the moment the case yet that we can say we are all over and in every market and in every region already positive on net new assets. That's how you should read it. But again, as I said, in my eyes, the situation has completely changed from last year.",

    "text": "Alastair, thank you for the question. And I'm glad you've noted that because it is a change from, as you can see on the chart from the previous years, certainly the last two years where we've had a greater issuance requirement than we've had redemptions. As we simplify the balance sheet and as we execute on our strategy, and I hope you're seeing that now in the fourth quarter, certainly, as we've taken the size of the balance sheet down, the intentional pieces where we've delevered the SPG transaction, the early start of the noncore unit, you're starting to now see some of those funding efficiencies come through, and that's now reflected in this issuance plan. We set out, we said, up to CHF17 billion. Of course, the funding plan is dependent on the evolution of the balance sheet through the year, and one has to be somewhat responsive and nimble as you get through the year. But at CHF17 billion of indicated issuance versus a CHF22 billion redemption, we're starting to now really turn the corner and start setting ourselves up on a trajectory to eventually reduce our funding costs through time. A couple of things I'd highlight. In response to what you've just said around Slide 31, it does lead to the reduced HoldCo issuance, which is, at CHF2 billion, much less than our expectations would have been, let's say, at some point during last year for this year. And again, that's a reflection of the strategic actions that we're taking. On OpCo, we'll be opportunistic, as you'd expect, through the course of this year, but we've already issued CHF4 billion of an indicated CHF9 billion. And then, of the overall issuance plan, we've come out of the gates quite fast with an issuance of around 25% of the entire full year plan in January. So, we'll be responsive, but what you're going to see is a much more efficient balance sheet over time as a result of the strategic intended actions that we're taking. I hope that's helpful.",

Now, when it comes to really AT1 and HoldCo, of course, this is in the list of our regulators. That said, we will continue transforming the balance sheet in a manner that I think would be conducive towards lower issuance needs. But of course, that's in the hands of our regulators as well.

Nevertheless, part of that is also to be seen in the light of increasing productivity, goes without saying. So, looking ahead, I would say, very much depending on how we develop step by step to coming back into Wealth Management profitability and, most importantly, into growth, which we will, I think that might then turn around and we might add again on the RM side to the equation into Wealth Management. Let me also clearly say, we have -- I must say, we have no issues to hire, be it on the AM side, be it on other very significant and important positions. If we feel we need to hire, we have no issues to hire. A lot of people also outside from Credit Suisse are strongly buying into that story of new Credit Suisse and where we are going. And I think that is important and helpful. In terms of cost, the overall development, which you are alluding to in 2022, certainly not where it should go. I was also saying before, we have reduced headcount by like 4% already in the fourth quarter. And the cost program, which we are running within Wealth Management, is obviously an important part of the overall cost transformation program. So, if you look into 2023 and beyond, certainly 2023, you can expect lower costs in Wealth Management, both if it comes to direct costs, but also when it comes to allocated costs from Corporate Center functions.",

And it should be put in light of the wider derisking as well as the repositioning of the Investment Bank and resizing of the Investment Bank. So SPG, of course, is one part of, call it, capital release and business repositioning. The other is the non-core unit as well. And on both those counts, we will be giving you clearly more visibility as we do the restatements and, in the case of SPG, once we get to the final close of the transaction, which we're anticipating in the second quarter of this year. We've given some highlights on the elements that we're able to. The first one being the capital benefit yesterday as a result of the gain on sale, which approximately is in the region of 30 basis points. The second is the OR reductions with, as I mentioned, some clear guidance on the forward trajectory without being able to give you the magnitude as at the state, given that would be an active regulatory dialogue. But we have, as I mentioned, strong expectation on the direction there. The third benefit would be liquidity and funding efficiencies. And you've already seen that come through over the last quarter as we've been de-risking in the SPG portfolio, and there'll be some further efficiencies through the course of the next quarter. And then lastly, I'd mention that the, really, the reduction or the impact on our financial plan from the exit of the SPG business was built into the RoTE target that we had set out on October 27 last year. And so -- and I would also mention that our cost targets will get amended accordingly as we progress towards the final close on the transaction.

And if you put that all together, what I said about the overall flow situation and so on should be pretty clear, and what we are, and hence, a good question. So, assume throughout this year, we are rebuilding further the LCR ratio to an extent different levels, which is obviously, as it's immediately clear to you, driven by the whole derisking, deleveraging, which we are doing and Dixit was talking about. What we have not yet fully defined, so to say, what should be with respect to new Credit Suisse an adequate and sensible target ratio for the long term, this is certainly something which we will do once, but not yet, too early in this year because as you also immediately understand, it has a lot of questions tied into legal entity structure and so on where we are also working on. And once we are more progressed on this kind of topics, then we will be certainly in a position to say, look, and very sensible, very comfortable target for LCR should be X or should be Y.

And it's not just the U.S., but it's elsewhere as well. As we look at simplifying the organization, the derisking and simplification will lead to further opportunities for capital repatriation and efficiency. You've seen that, for example, in the U.K. entities over the last few years where we've created much capital efficiency as we execute on our legal entity simplification program. The other is I'd point you to the parent capital ratio, which as you saw was at 12.2%, partly as a function of some of the simplification benefits we've seen over the years.

Yes, on 2023, I mean I'll try to give you some of the building blocks, again, not in a position to give you full guidance for '23 in detail, but I'll point you to a couple of important data points. One is that the Capital Release Unit has targets for this year to deliver on our RWA and leverage efficiency and free up capital. And as you know, we built de-risking costs in respect of that into our plan. So, I would say that's the first item. The second is for businesses that we buy, the discontinued exit, as you know, as is the nature of Capital Release Units that we've seen before at our firm and elsewhere is what you have is revenues dissipate quite quickly and then you attack the cost base and that takes more time, but it's effectively a drag on PTI, which is also what we indicated to you in October with some estimates of PTI out to 2025. And so that would be the second drag we expect. And then, the third is just broader restructuring. We'd indicated that we would try and front load to an extent the restructuring expenses. You saw CHF300 million, just north of CHF300 million in the fourth quarter. This year, we've estimated around CHF1.6 billion. That was the guidance we gave in October for this year. And for next year, it's about CHF1 billion. So, you'll see the P&L absorbing those restructuring expenses as well through the course of this year. Again, we'll give a further update as we begin -- as we get through the rest of the year, but we're really three months into the execution of our strategy. And really, so when we say we'll be loss-making for this year, it's to absorb all of those costs. You asked specifically, is it the IB? It's a combination, actually, for example, our cost reduction program, it really goes horizontally across the organization. So, it really affects all of our business units and all our infrastructure areas.",

As Ulrich mentioned, more than two-thirds of the flows occurred in October and more than 85% in October and November. And in our disclosures, we were pretty fulsome in October around some temporary breaches that we had. So, I'd highlight the word temporary because, as you say, were they resolved? Yes, absolutely. As you know, when we're operating multi-legal entity construct, we would try and retain the appropriate level of liquidity in each of the entities, but not necessarily excesses at the entity level. We would retain those excesses in the group. And then, our group treasury would rebalance in the normal course of business on a daily basis depending on flows. And so, you make an instances where you have a momentary need in an entity and then that gets cured within a day or two or three. And so, pretty comfortable with how that was dealt with, and we're in a pretty good position right now, as you're seeing from the turnaround through the quarter as well as in January. On the second point, on funding costs, and perhaps I'll address it through your deposit point first, which is that we have seen the central banks have pulled back on liquidity through the last year. We have seen a more competitive environment for deposits more generally across the industry. And so, we're also competitive in that respect on pricing. We've also wanted to rebuild our deposit base. And so, we will flex our pricing accordingly, very comfortable with the pricing levels that our RMs and our teams are going out with. And the other is, look, just once again, a recognition that deposit funding is still, on a relative basis, our cheapest source of funding and will remain so. We're pleased that we've been able to reduce, as a result of the actions that we're taking on the balance sheet, as a result of our strategy, we've been pleased that we've been able to reduce the quantum of capital market funding that we have. But as you can see, it's CHF17 billion out of a much larger balance sheet.

One of the key pillars on the strategic update at Q3 was the pivoting of the business back to profitable core. And at the time, you mentioned the Wealth Management franchise is sort of an 18% to 20% RoTE business within those 2025 targets. But given the reduction in AUMs, and you've highlighted the business is expected to be loss-making in the first quarter, is there now a sort of a strategic decision to be made as to whether to either sort of, a, run the business as a profitable franchise at current AUM levels; or b, to try and regain assets and deliver the level of absolute profit contribution, which was embedded in that strategic plan? I appreciate the comments you made earlier on this topic, but I just wondered whether those two options are essentially mutually exclusive from a cost perspective. So that's my first question. And then, the second one is just on the strategic update, you had the objective of around $3 billion of revenues in the Markets business. And I just wonder whether that's still an objective now.",

    "text": "Okay. Chris, let me start with the first one. Thanks for the questions. So, we laid out very clearly, as part of the transformation, three main blocks of actions by the end of October, as you might remember. The first one, as you put it, the radical restructuring of the Investment Bank, and we talked about some various important elements over the last few minutes here. The second one is the cost transformation program with very, very clear guidance on the cost reduction targets, again, as Dixit was saying, excluding exits and all these kind of things that comes on top of it. And that's important to bear in mind. And the last one, which we very clearly said is we want to do that transformation out of a position of capital strength, hence, the capital raise, which was successfully -- and other measures, which was successfully concluded in November, as you are fully aware. So -- and we are executing currently against all of these main blocks of measures and, as we said, very focused, very decisively. And you see that we are in many, many aspects, if you go through the presentation, we are ahead of our plan. Second point to make here is, and that is something, as I was alluding to at least, something we are also in parallel working on is to really fill these new Credit Suisse, how we put it, bank, which will evolve here over the next couple of years with content and then, obviously, doing the same with CS First Boston on the other side. And this is something which we owe you, so to say, but it needs a bit more time as we are traveling through 2023. And once we are there, we will update you in terms of what it means then really going forward. Having said that, and that's intuitively clear to you, if new Credit Suisse is based on our Wealth Management business, our very strong businesses in Switzerland, complemented by Asset Management and by the Markets business in a resized form, I think it's intuitively clear where this business, if it runs, so to say, in the way we want to run it going forward, will end up in terms of shareholder returns. So, there must be a very, very attractive proposition for our shareholders. Wealth Management, I think it's -- if I understood the question correctly, it's not -- it's a tricky question, I would say, if you allow me. So, it's not the idea to say, okay, we lost these assets and then we take what we have and, therefore, resized the Wealth Management firm to make it reasonably profitable again. I think we do two things. We do all what is necessary on the cost side, and there is room, as I said before. On the other hand, Wealth Management is the growth engine or one of the growth engines of today's Credit Suisse, but also of the new Credit Suisse. And that is why I said we have a relatively clear plan, the client outreach initiative which we started is part of that certainly in the short term, i.e., last year and 2023. And I said it has started to create good momentum. So we want to win back all the assets, and if not more, which we lost, that goes without saying. Secondly, the growth focus in Wealth Management, strategically spoken, is very clearly on the stable high net worth business; secondly, recurring revenues, and there is enough room for us to improve, goes without saying; and then last but not least, and you know that we have super strong positions in different geographies of the world here, also regaining the ultra-high net worth wallet share. So, I think that's the overall package we are working on. And that's the way how we push back Wealth Management into profitability and into growth mode.",

The Markets business is an important alignment to our Wealth Management franchise.

On higher NII, on October 27, when we indicated, I think we said in the region of around CHF900 million to CHF1 billion for 2025 as a result of the current term structure and market implies at the time. I think interest rates right now are slightly higher than where we were on October 27. But of course, we have a lower deposit base as a result of the events in October. On balance, it comes out roughly to a wash with around -- still around CHF900 million for the three-year period. And that's very much what was embedded into our RoTE walk as well. On the second point, on the loss for '23, as I said, look, we're focused on really restructuring our businesses. We want to take as many of the actions that we need to create the new Credit Suisse early on in our transition path. We're three months into the restructuring. We've already started, as you can see, in the fourth quarter results as well, largely premeditated intentional actions to execute on our strategy, and you're seeing that come through in the results. We'll, of course, be doing that during the course of the year in a way that is sensitive and capital accretive as possible or economically responsible for our shareholders. But we do want to move as quickly as we can on repositioning and restructuring the firm. Ulrich, if you wanted to add?",

You've talked about cost reductions across the whole group, but I'm just trying to zero in on the Markets division here and seeing what the core profitability might be if you take into account the cost expectations?

    "text": "Andrew, hi. Look, on the first on really Markets and your question on the cost base, as I mentioned before, the initiatives that we're undertaking as part of our cost transformation program are really across the horizontals. And so, of course, at the one level, we have the strategic repositioning that we've done with the exit of the SPG business. We'll have the carve-out of the Credit Suisse First Boston business. So, we have a simpler mix, and we'll exit cost along that journey. But then, we have really all of the horizontal initiatives that we've been driving for cost reduction, which will also impact the Investment Bank. So, I think what you'll see, as you're starting to see through from last year, is you're starting to see the efficiencies slowly come through, because the headcount reductions that we've undertaken in the fourth quarter will feed through into the bottom-line and going to the cost base as the quarters go along, but won't be visible in the immediate quarter necessarily. What I would say is that, look, we're committed to taking the actions that we needed to, as you're seeing, and to move with speed on those to rightsize the businesses as well in response to the revenue environment that we've seen as well. On the second point, on CS First Boston, we can't give you a specific capital impact today. Suffice to say, one of the pillars of the strategic reasoning here is very much capital efficiency as well as to generate and free up capital for the organization and for the shareholder. And that's certainly the path we're on as we work towards the carve-out and an eventual IPO for that business. Step one for us was to ensure that we commence on the initial planning for the carve-out, which we're now doing and is underway. Step two, as we've announced, was the acquisition of M. Klein & Company, which we announced this morning as well, which was an important pillar on this part of the carve-out, and we'd love to give you more details as we progress on this journey.",

And I guess what I'm trying to get to is, what clients are open to returning based upon what they see in terms of progression around your restructuring plan?

    "text": "Okay. Tom, let me take that. So, as we said -- or as I said earlier, we feel that the declines are overwhelmingly supportive. What we have observed, I would say, since October, in particular, and then early November on all these client meetings, at least where I was participating and doing, as I said, typically several a day, I would say there are three groups of clients. The one group which we started to come back very quickly already last year, so after a successful capital raise, they came back, they brought money back and so on. A second group, which I tend to believe is a very large group, at the end of the day, which was a bit more careful, so I look -- let's look at that, let's look at how you are doing, how you are executing and so on, which will come back over time, I'm not saying in a run, but over time. And there's a third group, I would think relatively smaller group, which says, look, we stick with you with what we have now. After reductions, we like you, but we want to observe you a little bit longer than just, let's say, the next, whatever, a few months. So, I think that's what I felt at least from client meetings. So, to your concrete question, how much is coming back, I would like to know that as well, as you can imagine. As I said, the Wealth Management colleagues are pretty hopeful that we bring a fair part of the outflows back already in 2023, and the rest will come later. And as I said also earlier, obviously, our target is to bring all and everything back and then go beyond that.",

    "text": "Adam, hi, sure. We wouldn't traditionally break down deposits necessarily within term, site, et cetera. I mean what I'd say is, look, we're looking at deposit efficiency, of course, on our balance sheet. So, step one for us was really ensuring that we'll restore confidence with our clients and customers, and you're starting to see, per Ulrich's remarks, you're starting to see that come through. A core part of that was to ensure that we tapped the capital markets, undertook private transactions, restored CET1 to a higher level, all of the actions that I mentioned that we did in the fourth quarter, and that's now starting to come back. I would point you to the LCR ratio. Look, that's ultimately a combination of both deposits and other measures lead to us managing the LCR ratio. And the LCR ratio, as you see, is up from the lows in the quarter to an average of 144% for the quarter and, as we've indicated, has improved in January as well. So, we're three months into the restructuring. We're taking all the necessary steps. And we're starting to see, as you can see, positive momentum on deposits in January. The second question was really on really deposit costs. And I would say in the NII guide in the first quarter, it's partly why we've guided to a loss in the first quarter for Wealth Management as well is we have a reduced deposit base compared to what we had in September. You see that impacting the NII, of course, in Q4 as well, and that will also have a knock-on impact into Q1 as well. That said, the evolution from here will depend, of course, on both factors, both volume of deposits, but the other is also the evolution of interest rates through the course of this year. The corollary to this is also funding cost where, as I've indicated, we're working hard on optimizing the balance sheet and ensuring that we can squeeze as much as we can out of it and reduce our funding cost. And step one on that path was to derisk in order to reduce our funding needs and then to be able to issue less in the capital markets, which you're now seeing through our issuance plan as well. So, a combination of all of those would lead to NII efficiency.",

Today, when we remodel our balance sheet, we have lower balances, actual balances at the end of the year, but rates are slightly higher and the net outcome is roughly the same at around CHF900 million for NII uplift.

The -- generally, the way to think about our CAT load is to say that P&C in France, in Europe and XL Insurance, that's roughly the same cat load, around 0.6%, 3.6%, 4.7%. And the difference is made with XL Re, which, by definition, has a higher CAT load given the nature of the business. And that's how you get to the 4% overall.   On the discounting impact, so when you compare France and Europe, bear in mind that in Europe, you have Switzerland. And Switzerland obviously has lower interest rates and therefore, the discount and the unwind is made at a lower level. And on the XL -- one second -- yes. So on the XL's rate for that, you should -- have in mind that XL is a business which is more heavily reinsured than the rest of our P&C business.   And therefore, the unwind applied to lower reserves and therefore, as such, is lower than what you would see typically in France and Europe. And on your last point on the reduced duration gap.

And then finally, likewise from me as well, thank you very much for the concise and clear financial supplement. I think I'm right that you've given us analysis by line of business and by geography, but not the sort of the granular detail of P&C lines of business.  So for example, I don't think we have French commercial, so it's great to have a concise and reduce things up, but I guess the downside is that it makes it difficult to build a bottom-up model that simultaneously forecast both line of business and geography. So I guess the question is there, can we assume maybe that going forward, your focus might be a bit more on liner business? So we maybe don't have to worry so much about forecasting geography.

    "text": "Okay. Thank you very much for your questions, Peter. So on the duration gap, it was 0.5% at the end of last year, it's 0.3% now. But what you should have in mind is the way we think about duration gap is the economic one between our assets and liabilities. What we don't hedge, what we don't take into account in that duration gap is the management of the risk margin or the fact that some of our SCR and parts of our SCR are sensitive to interest rates. And so because we want to have an economic hedging of our interest rate risk, we don't take the risk margin. Therefore, even with such a low duration gap like 0.3%, you still have a sensitivity coming from the variation of the risk margin in our solvency or that if our SCR.  I hope that explains the difference, which also means by the word that, at some point, we could move to a duration gap where assets would be longer than liabilities, which is not the case today, which, to some extent, would cover also the sensitivities that I just mentioned from risk margin. But today, our assets are slightly shorter than our liabilities.   So on capital management -- and I'll start with debt gearing. On that one, you saw the range that we gave. That's until the end of the year. In early next year, we will give you our next plan. I don't think the debt gearing should change as a target, but we will give you more on this next year. I think we're comfortable with the level of gearing that we have today. On the lower SCR, I'm not sure exactly what your question was. ",

    "text": "Thank you. So the lapsed experience, the general answer is no change to our lapsed experience, but for two small pockets, one that's in France some corporate business that we have. So it's not corporate pension, to be clear. It is the fact that in the past, we used to have some corporates generally family holding companies that would simply invest their cash into insurance policies.  And so they are pretty sensitive to the interest rate that we can offer and as they can find better rates elsewhere, there were higher lapses there. But it's a small business and the remaining reserves on this are EUR 3 billion. So you see that it's not an issue. The other place where you had higher lapse rates that was in Italy, in some of the business coming from BMPS for somewhat identical reasons. In other words, the customers of BMPS, like of other banks are offered Italian government bonds that have a yield higher than what we can offer. And there again, you saw some increase, but nothing alarming. And at the end of the day, it's a rather small business for us.   In general, we don't see, as I said, an increase and that's mainly for two reasons. One is the focus that we've had over the years is on long-term business for our customers. They are saving for their pension generally. And therefore, their insurance policy is not like a bank deposit, and they would not move every time there is up and down on the interest rate. And very often, they also have a unit-linked policy with that.  And the second aspect is that most of our business is done through preparatory distribution. When I look at France, for instance, 80% of it comes from proprietary distribution. And there, we are able to give advice to our customers and they see the value of that advice. They see the value of having an insurance policy, notably with tax benefits and so on. But that's why we haven't seen changes in our business. Now in P&C pricing, so the first part of the answer, which is simple, is that everywhere we have seen price increases that were sufficient to offset or more than offset inflation. The only exception to that is North America professional lines where there, there is a significant competition and prices are down.  That being said, the line is still very profitable even with that kind of price pressure. So let me now take you through something I also gave you in the other times we talked about inflation, which is a comparison between the claims inflation that we had in Motor and the pricing measures that we have taken.  So what you see in Q1 '23 is claims inflation growth of any element, any actions we take to offset it, which is around 7%. It's 7% in France. It's probably 6% in Germany. It's 8% in the U.K. In Switzerland, it's less than 2%. But if I take the example of France, so you have that clear installation of 7%. As I told you the other times, we take some measures like procurement, orientation and so on, which allow us to reduce the cost of that inflation by 2% points. So we're left with 5%. Frequency in France is relatively neutral. It is a headwind in Germany. It's a tailwind in Belgium. But overall, in Europe, it's neutral.  But coming back to France, you have those 5% points of claims inflation. You have minus 1% point coming from business mix. And then are price increases that represent 4% points. So all in all, we maintain our margin in France. I gave you France, the same is true for Germany, for Switzerland, for Belgium. The -- obviously, the country which is remarkable is the U.K. for many reasons. But on that one, because price increases are very high.  We're talking about north of 25% year-on-year, which means that today, I believe our -- the business that we write today is profitable on an underwriting basis which was not the case last year. ",

Second point is, again, going back to the comment you just made to Will on pricing with inflation. I mean, you gave the impact of France is broadly neutral. Do you think your combined ratio overall at the group level is going to expand in '23 and '24 due to pricing versus inflation. So do you see a positive margin impact in 2023? And then two very quick questions, really sorry. But the discount rate effect in P&C, how sensitive is that in '23, we've seen yields come down. How should we think about that?

    "text": "Thank you, Farooq. So operational capital generation. So yes, in nominal terms, there is an increase. I think if we say that we are at 25 points over the year, that's -- which is the low end of our range, that's 5 to 6 points above the previous range.  And I would say 1 to 2 points comes from the fact that the SCI is lower and the rest comes from the simple fact that we generate more capital in absolute terms. On the combined room.  So as I said when I talked about the guidance, I think the pricing environment is supportive. And so overall, I believe that, yes, there is room for improvement in our combined ratio. I'm talking undiscounted combined ratio, everything else being equal, and leaving aside obviously, CAT volatility and so on, so yes, I think it is supportive.  Third, on the discount rate impact, so I'll give you two things. The first thing is the fact that we use rates on a quarterly basis in one quarter in advance, i.e., at the end of December of any given year, you will know the rate at which we will discount Q1 and so you have those rates in our documents that we gave you for Q1 and Q2. So that already gives you half of the year for -- as far as discount is concerned. Then I will give you my own rule of thumb on how I approximate discount. Fundamentally, so the discount applies to the net claims of the year.  So if you start with a hundred of premiums, you have 55% of net claims at AXA in P&C. And the discount applies to the part, which is nonpaid.  And the part which is nonpaid is another 55% of those 55%. So that's the basis to which you should apply the discount. And then the duration of those claims is around 4 years. So with that, I think between the rates, the duration and the basis you have everything that you need to approximate the discount impact on any given year. To be clear, that's my rule of thumb. It's not the precise calculations, but that's reasonable enough. And on CSM release, the -- as we said, what is stable and growing, obviously, is the amount of the CSM release.  And that's because it's done on a real-world basis. So if you have a higher stock of CSM, then probably the release ratio will be lower and if you have a lower stock, then the release ratio would be higher. And what matters, obviously, is the new business contribution year after year. That's what will drive in the end, the amount of CSM that you will be able to release. I hope I was clear on all those technical issues. ",

    "text": "So on the first one, the discount and the unwind, the way we think about it, the unwind will increase as we will pilot, so to speak, generations of different discount rates year after year. And given the trend in interest rates, that will increase. That being said, it should be offset by the increase in the investment income because we will also invest at higher investment income.   There is a specific effect in '23 that I mentioned quite a few times on private equity funds distribution, but that has nothing to do with the fact that our investment in fixed income also done at a higher rate year after year. On the discount impact, this is obviously a very sensitive assumption in our business. There will be some volatility. Now there is -- there are other aspects of the P&L. I'm thinking of PYDs, for which there can also be some volatility up or down. And so I don't think that overall, we should have too much volatility in our earnings. And very clearly, our aim is to provide our shareholders with regularly growing earnings and cash generation. So that's the philosophy of our strat planning.   On the technical margin -- on the technical margins versus savings. So on technical, the combined ratio that I have on health is independent from interest rates. And so for a given level of combined ratio that will be projected, the earnings will be discounted at a higher rate and therefore, will be worth less. Now when -- interest rates are higher for Savings business.  You know that the discount rate in a risk-neutral environment is the same as the investment rate. And therefore, what you have is a better yield, better theoretical yield on your assets with higher investment rates, which, in particular, means that the value of your options and guarantees goes down. And therefore, in many instances, for savings business, the higher interest rates will be -- will have a positive impact. So it's more positive for savings than it is for protection and health. I hope it's reasonably clear.  And your third question, sorry, I'm not sure I got it. ",

    "text": "On the -- you're talking about pricing in France, I didn't -- I'm looking at your press release. The figure, I see in personal lines is not 4%, it's 1.9%. So I'm guessing I'm reading something wrong. Maybe you can explain the mix of your businesses in France and how that -- how you see that?  And the second is on the operating capital generation. So we've spoken a lot about that. So you're kind of saying it's now beginning to convert with earnings, which is I think what [ Jamie ] was saying, what you are saying maybe we're getting close to EUR 7 billion and EUR 7.5 billion. But within that, I had a question. The feeling I have, and this was from the previous conference call today, is that in a period of rising interest rates, you do have -- because the discounting comes before the unwind of the discount, which interest rates were higher than last year. However, that you do have earnings which is slightly above the normal run rate. Would that -- is that roughly fair? Will that explain the difference between the underlying earnings and the operating capital generation?  And then the -- I had one silly question and one even silier question. So the silly question is the deals. I'm not sure if you can speak about that, but 217% sounds you've got plenty to look at such and I just wondered if you can give an update on what's happening there? And then the final question, and here is really [ it's the annual planning ] means that is a really simple company to understand that.  Thank you very much. And -- but does it mean that machines can do it. I was speaking with somebody and they said that the LSE has a program of building models automatically. And I was thinking \" Oh, that means that  I don't really have a job anymore.\". How do you see that? ",

    "text": "Okay. Thank you, Michael. On the first one, no, I understand your question on the reconciliation of numbers. The 4%, I mentioned is the number you mentioned on the price increase divided by the loss ratio. In other words, what it's -- as if you dedicate the full amount of price increases in France to claims. And why do we do that? Simply because the expenses are addressed separately and we put a lot of pressure on expenses so that they do not increase with inflation. So that's -- that approach is specific to France, not for the other countries. But that's the reason why we say it's the 4% price increase in France because that's the part that goes to claims.  On the convergence with earnings, so there is a slight impact coming from the higher discount and that's what I highlighted as well. So I agree with you. But the main impact in our greater capital generation comes from the fact that underlying earnings, notably on the P&C side, are extremely close now to solvency capital generation and they were not in the past because of that distortion coming from excess reserve release. On the 217%, I guess, you were alluding to some potential capital management initiatives on this as we said in February, the Board looks at our capital management, in particular, at share buybacks once a year. And so don't expect another share buyback this year except the one to offset the dilution coming from our German Inforce transaction. And on the fourth one, I'm not completely sure what you meant. ",

So numerical questions, what was the rate decrease in North American professional lines? And secondly, in Euros, millions or billions, what was the impact of elevated fund distributions, both in the P&C and Life businesses last year? So did you get that right for this year. Thirdly, I just want to see, obviously, people's Solvency II coverage ratios are going to go up. You obviously beat in the first quarter, and now you're looking at higher levels of operating capital generation. Does that flow through to higher levels of cash remittances to group level so that we can then have a look at the amount of buyback, which is annually possible.  And finally, I'll reiterate what Michael said. I think it's fabulous. You've got this thing, the financial spent down to 23 pages. And one bit that I would like to see or a couple of bits I'd love to see is, one, a reconciliation between underlying earnings and operating capital generation by both, I understand what you said I just meant to get that you're very much aligned on the P&C, will be good to have that.

It's important, but not to the point that line is not profitable any longer or that overall, our pricing would not be above loss trend. And it was really very profitable in the past. So I don't see that as an issue. On the fund distribution, I think what you should have in mind is a couple of EUR 100 million difference between '22 and '23.  On cash remittance, the -- obviously, the fact that on the P&C side, our earnings are made of best estimate PYDs, gives us comfort on the fact that the remittance can grow and you know that we said it will grow. So we have full confidence in this year to be at the upper end of the range we had given you, which was EUR 5 billion to EUR 6 billion cash remittance for '23. And we believe that it can grow further in the following years because we grow earnings because of what we've just said.

What creates solvency is new business and unwind of discount and additional investment income in excess of risk-free rate, whereas what creates earnings is the release of the CSM.

    "text": "Thank you, Anu. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining the call today. So I'll start with the key highlights of our 9 months '23 results.  AXA continued to deliver high-quality revenue growth, very much in line -- very much in line with our strategy and consistent with the trends that you see in the first half. We continue to see strong momentum across our technical lines, in particular, in P&C, plus 7%; and protection, plus 3%. And growth in Health remains also strong, up 7% if you adjust for the nonrenewal of 2 large international group contracts.  This has been partly offset by actions taken to rightsize businesses that has been deprioritized and that you know well, that's reinsurance property cat and traditional general account, and this should be completed by year-end.  Overall, our total revenues increased by 2% to EUR 79 billion. Our balance sheet remains very strong with the Solvency II ratio of 230%, driven by strong organic capital generation, and we are very pleased with this level. We also remain confident in delivering our in-force management target of EUR 30 billion to EUR 50 billion by year-end. And apart from those results, we've also recently announced 2 transactions.  The first one is the closing of the acquisition of Laya, the leading health insurer in Ireland with 28% market share. And second is the agreement to dispose of our live joint venture with Bharti in India. So these are in line with our strategy, which is to focus our footprint on our core markets where we have leading positions, while we exit -- sorry, noncore markets.  So going back to 9 months '23, let me now go through the key numbers of the press release, starting with P&C. P&C revenues were up 7% overall, with growth in both Commercial and Personal Lines. In commercial lines insurance, which excludes AXA XL Re, we saw a very good growth of 9%. This was driven by both price increases and volume. And at AXA XL Insurance, prices were up 4% on renewable or 7% excluding North America Professional lines where conditions remained challenging. This was mainly driven by favorable price effects in short tail lines with notably North America property, up 19%.  Overall, price increases remained above loss trends, in 9 months '23. And we remain very disciplined on pricing, and we have tools to manage the cycle. In France and Europe, we continue to see favorable price effects at 5% and 4%,  respectively. On volume, customer demand remained strong, notably at AXA XL Insurance in Property and Specialty lines and in Europe.  Moving to Personal Lines. Revenues were up 5% with growth both in personal motor and personal non-motor, up 7% and 3%, respectively. In Motor, price increases accelerated further in the third quarter in Europe, except in Switzerland. Overall, we believe the price increases in retail are sufficient to offset claims severities. But you know we are also vigilant on the frequency side, which is higher than expected in Germany and Ireland, which we had flagged at half year. And in those countries, we are taking further pricing actions.  And finally, in reinsurance, as you know, we've reduced our nat cat exposure again this year by circa 35% and in line with our strategy, and that was offset by price increases in Casualty, Property and Specialty so that overall revenues in reinsurance were down by only 3%. One last point on P&C regarding nat cat. In the first half, we had a relatively benign nat cat experience with 3 points impact on our combined ratio. That's below our 4 points load.  In the third quarter, we experienced several storms across Europe and the U.S. And despite this, at the end of September, we were still on track to be within our 4 points nat cat budget for the year. We currently estimate losses for -- from Hurricane Otis that made landfall in Mexico in October to be around EUR 0.2 billion before tax and net of reinsurance. And obviously, we need to see how the rest of the year plays out.  Let me now move to Life & Health. In Life, we see once again a positive trend in protection, up 3% and from higher sales in protection with unit-linked in Japan and sales to Mainland Chinese visitors in Hong Kong. Unit-linked premiums were down 13% reflecting volatile market conditions, albeit with some recovery observed in the third quarter. And this was largely offset by good performance of capital-light general account, up 12%, which was driven by the continued success of our general account at maturity product EuroCroissance in France. In France deal, which is our main Life carrier given this capital-light proposition of EuroCroissance and our Unit-Linked performance. Overall, we are up 10% on the savings side.  Once again, our strategy around this complimentary offer has proved its relevance, especially in these conditions. And lastly, traditional generic on premiums were down 13% and in line with our strategy to reduce our exposure in this business. So overall, Life revenues over the first 9 months were stable.  On Health, premiums were down 7% and that's largely from the renewal of 2 large international group contracts in France that you know well. Excluding those contracts, we had organic growth of plus 7%, and that's across all geographies and this reflected notably favorable price effects, again, across most geographies.  So next, on the net flows. So we see continued outflows in traditional general savings -- general account savings which is in line with our group strategy, and that's partly offset by strong flows in Protection & Health.  Moving to new business. So Life & Health, PVEP and NBV were down 8% and 4%, respectively. This was largely attributable to the increase in interest rates, which will reverse positively with a higher unwind over time. NBV margin, which is what matters to us, was up 0.2 point. New business CSM was up by 2%, reflecting a better portfolio mix, notably with a higher contribution from EuroCroissance. Overall, our business mix in Life and Health remains of high quality, and we will continue to grow from there.   And finally, in Asset Management. So average assets under management decreased by 5%, but that reflects unfavorable market conditions because net flows were flat. We have, as you saw, strong inflows from third-party funds, both in our core and our OGS platforms. And specifically in real estate, where we've had good momentum. And this was offset by net outflows from AXA insurance companies, which is obviously linked to the negative flows in general account that I had mentioned earlier.  Revenues in Asset Management were down 2%, driven by lower recurring fees from the reduction in average assets under management.   Moving on to Solvency II. So our Solvency II ratio was 230% at the end of September, and that's down 5 points from the first half. And this was mainly due to a combination of different factors. First one is minus 4 points from the early redemption of subordinated debt, which we had decided not -- which we have decided not to refinance in line of our strong cash and capital position, minus 3 points from unfavorable market effects, driven by lower equity markets and higher implied volatility and plus 7 points of normalized capital generation, minus obviously, 4 points of accrued foreseeable dividends. So at the end of the first 9 months, our normalized capital generation was plus 23 points. And as you see, we are well on track to achieve the 25 to 30-point guidance we gave this year.  Overall, we're happy with our strong Solvency II ratio. It reflects our more capital-efficient business model, and that allows us to grow without the need for more capital. So one word on our full year '23 outlook. We are on track to deliver our earnings outlook of above EUR 7.5 billion underlying earnings in '23. A few things to also keep in mind for the second half.  As you know, we always report more than 50% of our earnings in the first half because we have higher investment income in the first half, and there is also a small seasonality in discount. And we expect several headwinds in the second half which should already been known to you. So that's the higher health claims frequency in the U.K. We have still elevated lapses in Italy. And as you saw, we have higher Q3 nat cat losses. So as a conclusion, I think fundamentally, the group is in good shape. We are disciplined in our execution of our strategy, and that will continue to deliver strong results.  We have a balance sheet which remains strong with a high level of Solvency II ratio at 230%. And therefore, we are well placed for our next plan, which, as you may have seen, will be announced on March 11 next year. I'm now happy to take your questions. ",

    "text": "Thank you, Andrew, for your questions. So on nat cat budget, as you know, it's 4 points overall. And we think 4 points of combined ratio, obviously. And we think about it across the year. So what we meant when we wrote the press release is that we were at 3 points at the half year. And given the number of small but intense natural events that we had in Q3, we are in line with the 4 points for the full year.  Now it's true that with Hurricane Otis, which as you saw, is around EUR 200 million, I would say, that's a bit less than a quarter's budget, it's around 40% of the quarter's budget. On XL, specifically, I mean, we think about our nat cat budget at group level. The Q3 was more -- was rather balanced between Europe and the U.S., XL Re was not particularly affected. And Otis is really AXA Mexico, and that does not effect XL very much, if at all.  And on the Professional Lines, I think we -- so we see the same sort of trend. It has not changed in Q3 compared to the first half. And we don't disclose the amount of business coming from North America Professional. But there is no change in trend. And very importantly, it is still a very profitable line. But given the fact that it was extremely profitable for the whole market. And given that there is less business notably because you've seen fewer IPOs, for instance, there is more competition on for a smaller cake, and that's what puts pressure on the business, but it's still very profitable.

    "text": "Thank you, Peter. So on lapses, so I will leave aside France because you know that it's small portfolio specific. And on the rest, we see no change compared to last year. In Italy, I think it's not so much Eurovita. Obviously, Eurovita has some impact on the whole market but it's more the competition of BTPs designed for individuals and sold notably through bank branches. It's more that competition that creates that elevated level of lapses and also a reduced level of premiums because people would go more to BTP than to Life insurance.  And therefore, I don't see, at this stage, a foreseeable change in that level of lapses given the environment. Will that have an impact on our assumptions and therefore, on our CSM in Italy? Yes, probably because it means that the business will have a shorter duration because we will have -- we have more lapses.  Asset Management in Q3, so the -- we -- I think we have with AXA IM Core and AXA IM Alts a very good platform on a number of businesses notably fixed income in core and real estate infrastructure that notably in Alts. And I think what's quite remarkable is that, obviously, the real estate market is not doing that great currently. But nevertheless, you see strong net new money on that front because we are recognized as probably the strongest or one of the strongest platforms in Europe. So we expect good net inflows going forward from third parties.  And last on our own reinsurance cover, you know that the way we think about it is outcome driven. In other words, what is our risk appetite and what is the cat load that we would like to see. So you shouldn't expect a significant change in '24 compared to '23 in terms of cat load. We are looking at the way to design our reinsurance program. But what we see is that on a risk-adjusted basis, prices should not move significantly. We are between 0% and 5%, most probably. ",

First one is the net outflows from the life companies and asset management were, I think, EUR 13 billion. The figure we see for a general account is EUR 6.8 billion, and I think there's just under EUR 1 billion from Unit-Linked. So there seems to be a big gap. And I just wondered what is that?  The second is -- and I sort of asked this in half year, but the benefits of discounting less the unwind, full insurers not particularly factor, but it's true for you as well is it's a very, very big benefit this year. I can't remember the figure, but I think at half year, it was about EUR 0.5 billion. So it's probably unfair to annualize it, but it's probably not going to be [ passed ] over to EUR 1 billion for the year. And if you say, well, over EUR 7.5 billion it's a big chunk of the earnings. How are you -- how should one think about managing the drag as this difference between discounting and unwind kind of slows down going forward?   And then I was hoping you could give a little bit more on cash because clearly, if you're not refinancing and you've actually spent a little bit of money on layer and stuff. You must be even more cash rich than before. And I just wondered, maybe you could explain where it's coming from or any kind of qualitative would be very helpful.  I had a last question on the last -- sorry, MPS, if somebody breaks on contract to a EUR 1 billion, which would, I guess, would be quite nice, what's the likelihood that MPS is sold to a party where you would effectively say well, now there's a break clause?

On the first one, which is the reduction of the outflows from AXA IM and that's the EUR 13 million, you wanted to reconcile that, sorry, with our own outflows. So obviously, there is the Life one. There is also the fact that on the P&C side, on a net basis, reserves that's also a bit decreased. And there is always the impact also that the dividend we pay because the dividend we paid made of the dividends paid by the entities, and therefore, it's also a bit of assets that is withdrawn from AXA IM.  On the discount and unwind, you know that it's not exactly the way we look at it. We look at unwind versus investment income because those 2 should evolve in parallel. I think going forward, you will see more investment income. You will see also more unwind. The net was still probably a net negative going forward, but something that we'll be able to manage overall.  And there, again, we'll give you more in March with the plan. But don't forget the investment income part because that's a very useful component these days with higher interest rates.  On cash well, I think we will have to wait until February before I can give you more. But effectively, and that's what I also said to Andrew, we have the right amount of cash at holdco and by the level of solvency and therefore, no need to increase our debt. And On MPS, well, look, we are looking at what's happening. We -- our preference, obviously, is to keep the good distribution agreement that we have with the MPS but it's not entirely in our hands. And as you well said, we have, I think, a contract which protects us well. But again, our preference would be not to use that close. ",

We've seen this acceleration in rate increases in a number of European personal lines in the third quarter, which is good. Does that automatically imply improved combined ratios from the moment it's happening?

In terms of frequency, we were surprised in 2 countries, Germany and Ireland, for which we are taking additional measures and those measures will also be taken in the first half, notably in Germany because you know that they book a significant part of it renews at 1/1.

Is it the contractor [ turning ] owners? And in particular, is this if as you describe, alban, that the trend hasn't changed -- if the trend of center remains roughly stable, should we expect a similar effect in 2024?   And the second question, capital generation, 7 points of operating innovation is great. And it's the middle of your -- it's roughly the middle of your range annualized. If I remember correctly at half year, Alban, you said that don't expect quite a strong capital generation in the second half than compared with the first half, but you're still there in the middle of your range. Should I infer that Q4 has a sort of structural headwinds to the capital generation? Or would you expect another 7 points roughly?  And then last question, not really to do with the results, but there's a lot of regulatory attention being paid to private assets at the moment within life insurance portfolios globally. This is clearly a part of your portfolio. And private assets are really an obviously important part of your third-party asset management portfolio. So I just thought I'd ask a few reflections on the regulatory attention being paid to this asset class how you feel about your allocations here and indeed whether there might be any adverse impacts on asset management flows, if there is more international pressure on this asset class?

You have so-called group of contracts in our Life carriers. Those group of contracts in Italy reflects generally the funds that we have. And it might be then one can turn onerous, but it will -- if that's the case, it will have a nonsignificant impact. The real impact is on the CSM as you pointed out.  On capital generation, I think if I remember well, we were at 16 points in the first half, and therefore, above the 25 to 30 points range annualized that we mentioned. So what we just wanted to say was that there is seasonality in our earnings. And therefore, there is also seasonality in our capital generation. You shouldn't expect Q4, everything else being equal to be weaker than Q3 to put it that way.  And on private assets, we honestly -- we haven't had much regulatory pressure on this so much regulatory attention. I think regulators across the world are probably a bit more attentive to liquidity, notably on the life side. So private assets are part of that equation. But there is no strong pressure, no particular concern from regulators that we have seen.  And you saw that we had good net inflows at AXA IM Alts, notably on real estate. So that shows that investors are still willing to put more money in illiquid assets. Obviously, you have the denominator effect for a number of them which reduces their appetite for illiquid assets.

But what's the cash impact of the Re deal?  Secondly, can you explain what the market conditions were that made you happy to keep it. I'm presuming it's interest rates. What would it take for you to look again at this back book? So either to sell it or to reinsure it, what would it take for you to sort of strategically change your mind on that?  And I just wanted to also ask about the commercial pricing momentum. So it feels like it's still kind of declining even if you take out U.S. professional lines in terms of the kind of the difference between pricing and loss cost trends.

    "text": "Thank you, Farooq. So the cash impact of the transaction on AXA Life Europe is that we'll be able to release EUR 250 million of capital that will be freed up by this transaction.  On the German transaction, so as you remember, the transaction was signed in '22. Over '22 and still in '23, interest rates increased, and we had discussions with Athora. We both honestly wanted to do this transaction, but given higher interest rates, there is more value to the book to us. As I also said, we managed to close the duration gap. And so expectations on both sides didn't meet. And at the end of the day, it was better for everyone to call it a day and to say, we're not anymore on the same lines. So let's decide to terminate.  So we find with holding the book but all our options are open. If somebody comes with a good price, the -- we wanted to sell 2 years ago, we might sell if we have a good offer. But as I said, given higher interest rates, given the right ALM and closed duration gap, it's not an issue if we keep the book.  And third, on the Commercial line pricing at XL, so the -- it's quite similar to the end of last year in the sense that, yes, U.S. professional lines are soft. That's very clear, which means that we are focusing on profitability, we are focusing on our current book of business, and we have increased the retention of our books of business. Because obviously, you have better profitability with your current customers rather than looking for new customers in such a market.  But for the rest, for all the lines, we see very good momentum. Bear in mind that at XL, there is obviously a biased to Europe in the first quarter. And the pricing momentum in Europe is good. And you saw it, around 5%, to make it simple. But it's even better in the U.S., where you see property still up 15%, like it was last year. But you also see some places in casualty also up significantly in the U.S. So that's why I said that overall, with that pricing dynamic, excluding North America Professional lines, we are slightly above loss trend still.  So what should we expect for '25? I don't see why the market should change abruptly in '25. We are coming to a place where prices increase with loss trend slightly above, could be in line. I don't see competitive pressure that would take the prices down or below loss trend at this stage, then '26 we'll see. And you know that, for the plan, our assumptions is that -- are that we maintain our margins at XL, playing with the various cycles of the various lines of business. ",

So we -- the price increases that we have implemented allow to correct for the drift that we had last year without additional drift this year. So we are in line with our expectations. And I mentioned frequency because that was the issue last year, but we have no issue on severity here this year.  On nat cat and large losses. Large losses, before we had the Baltimore bridge claim, that was also a good quarter. And so nat cat plus large losses is also a good quarter. And on the reinvestment rate, so obviously, it's a mix of many currencies and notably, if we not forget that we can also invest in Japan and Switzerland. We invested at 3.8% overall over the first quarter. And obviously, it's a small positive compared to our expectations.  But if I broaden that, I think the way I would characterize the first quarter is that we have a good number of small positives, small positives on the reinvestment rate, notably on the dollar side, and therefore, on the discount rate; small positives in the pricing on retail, which is slightly better than expectations. So it's only Q1, obviously. But nevertheless, I think we -- as I said, we're off to a good start, thanks to all this. ",

    "text": "Well, thank you, Andrew. So on your first question on the Baltimore bridge, so what we said about having a loss of less than EUR 100 million, it's based on the assumption that the industry loss is around $1.4 billion -- $1.5 billion in total. That being said, if the loss was to creep up to, say, $2.5 billion or $3 billion, I estimated that it would still be less than EUR 100 million for us because of the policy limits that we have. The only increase that we would get in our loss is the increase in the Reinsurance reinstatement premium that we would have to pay. So it is, in any case, capped to a low level.  On the new business value, this is new business, CSM at AXA France, if I understood correctly your question. A good part of it comes from the health part, which is in the NBV, but not in the NBV, [ ENV ] CSM. And on the NBV part, we have significantly increased prices and therefore margins. And that's probably the main reason why we increased the NBV in France. There's also a bit in Protection in volumes. But that's Health, which is really the issue -- no, not issue, the cause of the improvement.  And on the XL Re, I think what we want -- what we don't want to increase significantly is property cat. We want to be cautious on casualty reinsurance in the U.S. because we want to make sure that pricing -- local pricing reflects the profitability and the risks.

    "text": "So my first question relates to capital return. Clearly, profitability and capital formation was better than expected in the first quarter. Previously, you've commented that the timing and size of potential share buybacks here would be dependent on getting clarity on the size of regulatory model headwinds and the macro outlook. And today, you've said that you've initiated dialogue with the ECB. So what updates do you have on those headwinds? How comfortable do you feel on the macro backdrop? And how far are you with the ECB discussions? And what does that all mean for the potential timing and size of share buybacks this year? That's the first question.  And then secondly, perhaps to Christian, coming back to Slide 7. If we look across those three pillars, cost, capital and revenues, could you talk a little bit about what these measures really mean incrementally to the 2025 strategy and targets? What are the key timing points regarding progress in those areas? And are you in a position to upgrade any of those targets at this point?",

    "text": "Chris, it's Christian. Thank you very much for your question. And I'm sure James will jump in. I'm going after both questions, and again, James will contribute.  Look, on your first question, I think it was very important for us, for the Management Board here and for James and myself that we wanted to see the first quarter development. And indeed, this development is not only important but gives us all the confidence and all the tailwind we need when it comes to the further trajectory of our results.  And you really look at the composition of our results. That's what makes me so positive and confident that is the stable business development in the Private Bank and in the Corporate Bank. And if you then think about that what James already outlined in the previous calls and what we always refer to that kind of the real tailwind in the interest rates is coming in the Private Bank only in the outer years in '24 and '25. With the momentum we see right now already in the stable business, that was obviously the right starting point now to change gears and to initiate the discussions on the share buybacks with the ECB.  Secondly, to take a step back, I think also in the aftermath, it was right actually not to do this end of January because we said on purpose, we would like to have a better view on the economic development, the volatility in the market, the turbulences we see. And look, we did not know what happened in March, but you could see that also the way we handled that situation. Again, the stability now with a step up of 13.6%, not even talking about the strong liquidity number of 143%, all gives us now the confidence to say this is the right moment to start.  Thirdly, I do believe that the environment, the economic outlook for Europe, particular for Germany, you may have seen the guidance of the German Economic Minister yesterday that -- and we agree to that, we don't see a recession in Germany coming in '23. It's slow growth, a minimal growth but actually far better than that what we thought could happen at the end of 2022 for the year '23. Also there, clearly better visibility when it comes to the economic outlook.  And James will give you more details when it comes to the model changes, but also there, we did a lot of progress and have far better visibility, what it means. And in this regard, we concluded based on this, in our view, really good number -- quarter 1 numbers that it's now time to approach the discussions, initiate the discussions with regard to timing.  In line with that, what I said on February 2, we believe that the share buybacks will happen in the second half of 2023. There, I used the word optimistic. Now I use the word that I'm very confident that this will happen in the second half of '23.  And with regard to the amount, look, I think we need to have the discussions with the ECB. But James and I are both believe in consistency. If you think about the kind of the increase in the dividends, which we proposed for the year '22 versus the previous year, I think for consistent reasons, we should also think about such an increase when it comes to share buybacks.  James, potentially, you step in on the model before I take the second question.",

    "text": "Sure. Happy to do that. So Chris, remember in the February call, we were talking about the model impacts. There are a number of different items, one big one, which is what we call the wholesale model review but then many other items, some of which are netting. And so there is a range of outcomes. But at this point, with better visibility into the discussions, we'd probably say that range is between 40 and 60 basis points of capital.  If you take the midpoint of that, which is a pretty good place to be for modeling purposes, that 50 basis points actually represents about the capital -- the organic capital generation that consensus would suggest we earn in the balance of the year. Now obviously, we'd like to do better than that. But if you use that, essentially, earnings for the rest of the year would offset the model impact. And that leaves us sort of the gap to 13.2 to fund growth, a buyback and any other events during the year, uncertainties in the first two numbers, which we feel pretty good about. And to give you a sense that, therefore, the range of outcomes that Christian refers to, we think at this point is affordable based on the information we have.",

    "text": "To your second question, and Page 7, look, again, first of all, I really would like to say it is nothing else Chris, than the continuous development of our strategy and the confirmation of the strategy and the trajectory which we have taken over the last years. But of course, when you are in the middle of that, you see the client reaction, you see the momentum I was just talking about before also in the stable business. the foundation and the resilience, which we have found in the Investment Bank, and obviously, you always reconsider what else can we do.  And let me start on the business side. So on the right-hand side of the slide. Number one, yes, momentum in the business is so important because it goes back to something which I always try to outline in this call and which I think sometimes gets still underestimated, but that is all about our people. If they see these results, when you think about the momentum, the passion, the spirit in this bank, you can see that, in particular now in the Corporate and the Private Bank, it goes only into one direction, and that's what we want to build on. We see growth rates, which are higher than that what we initially planned.  Now then there are market opportunities. Also, as a result of the events which we have seen in our competitive environment also here in Europe, which obviously we would like to bank on. And you have seen the one or the other announcement over the last weeks that we will start to do some selective hiring. Very important either in the Corporate Bank platform or in capital-light businesses like the advisory piece. You also see that we are actually focusing on additional markets. We have hired a team for Latin America in the O&A and financing business, which is important for us because a lot of German clients, corporate clients are actually there who want to have our help. So market opportunities are there.  And all that gives us actually the opportunity again, with the momentum we see also when I look forward, and obviously, with the tailwind of the interest rates that we think the revenue growth numbers which we put forward are not only achievable, but we have a real chance to outperform that.  Now secondly, obviously, on the cost management side, if you work on those EUR 2 billion, which we always laid out and where we gave details in last year's IDD, and we always reconfirm the numbers, you then go deeper, you see there is more room. And therefore, we also changed the governance in the Management Board. We have a clear allocation of cost management now in the management board, front to back, which will create further opportunities. And I think we also don't only think about long-term or more long-term cost changes, but the reduction in force exercise which we kicked off in March, which will be actually then fully implemented in Q2 is something which shows you that we see now with all that what has happened with the sharpening of our businesses, but also implementation of front-to-end processes that we have more potential than we saw before. And hence, we believe that the additional EUR 500 million is the target and a goal which we should achieve.  And thirdly, capital efficiency. And to be honest, to criticize ourselves, I think we have done a very good capital management. But when it comes to capital efficiency in each and every sub businesses, we can further step up. And what I like about this exercise, which we, in our view, bring approximately EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion of risk-weighted assets over the next couple of years in risk-weighted asset reductions while not losing revenues over that is actually a more disciplined capital allocation. And that is on 2 or 3 items.  Number one, yes, we will act on items which we see, for instance, in the German mortgage business. If the countercyclical capital buffer has been increased like it was, we obviously will act and will move capital out of this business and either shift it to higher rewarding businesses or we give it back to the shareholders. Secondly, we have found ways to increase hedging securitizations. And thirdly, discipline is not only on the cost side. It's in particular on the review of each and every individual reward when it comes to lending. And there, we need to step up.  And I think that there are areas in our banks, also in the Corporate Bank, where we can do better when it comes to risk reward, that will be implemented. James will be all over about it. And those three items on top of that, what we have seen in Q1, and I really would like to focus on that again. It's an 8.3% return on equity. But if you , so to say, the SRF, we are at 10%. We know exactly what happens with the SRF payments. It will go down. And we still have something in plan for '24 and '25, but it will go down.  So the 10% RoTE in the first quarter is a really good guidance because the first quarter is not an outlier quarter. If you now think about these three items, obviously, it is our target to outperform that in '25. And this is the confidence we have. And with all that, what we really see in numbers in the first quarter was the whole trajectory, I'm really excited about that way and hence, very positive that we can achieve that outperformance. James, I don't know whether you...",

But could you just give us a sense of how that evolved throughout the quarter, particularly in and around that market period? And maybe further out, what are you seeing quarter-to-date? And how do you see those deposit trends developing throughout the year? Secondly, you're sticking to your revenue guidance. I'm just wondering what gives you the confidence that target still holds, given the miss in trading, given what we're seeing quarter-to-date there? So maybe you could just provide a little bit an update by division, quarter-to-date dynamics, that would be helpful.  And one final quick one. I'm interested in your discussions with regulators around the CVS issues and the wider banking crisis. Do you envisage any change coming maybe through things like liquidity coverage ratio, definition changes or some sort of additional levies to ensure a wider scope for deposits? Any sense where you see change would be great.",

    "text": "Sure. Thanks, Tom. It's James. I'll start. Maybe I'll start where you finished, and we'll come back to that with the liquidity metrics because we manage to the liquidity metrics rather than do absolute levels of deposits or funding, and I think it's important to emphasize we were able to travel through a difficult quarter and especially March, while maintaining and, in fact, improving both ratios -- liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio. And so it's important to understand what that means.  We ended the quarter in as good or better position to withstand a 30-day or a 1-year stress environment than we were at year-end based on that strong deposit base as well as the secured and unsecured funding position we are in. And we think that's a significant achievement for Deutsche Bank but also for the industry. I'll talk about this when we go to your third question, but I think LCR and these other tools have withstood the test in the month of March.  Turning to deposits. You mentioned the reduction in the deposits over the course of the quarter. The average deposits were down a little less than 2% over the quarter. And as you've seen, the spot level was down 4%, excluding FX. And that, as we look at sort of banks that have reported so far, we think is -- and some market -- sort of industry data through February is reasonably in line with what you've seen on both sides of the Atlantic so far.  Now as we've talked about, there's a lot going on in the deposit books. Normalization in our case, from very high levels of deposits that we finished the year with. There was sort of a run-up in December, which is one of the reasons for the variance between the average and the spot. You've also seen a pickup in competition for liquidity as central banks did drained liquidity from the market and you do see some price-sensitive deposits leaving the bank. We're just disciplined on pricing. And so that represents, if you like, a strategy outcome.  We have seen clients shift deposits to higher-yielding investment alternatives, including but not limited to money market funds. And some of that, as we've pointed out, within our own system. So it didn't leave the bank. It just went from deposits to other products.  The other thing that happens in our deposit base is sort of usual ebbs and flows. So if you're a very large cash management bank for corporates and institutionals, there's a lot of movement throughout the quarter which means that your specific question is a little bit hard to pinpoint. But I would -- and what we've talked about is sort of 2/3 coming in the first, say, 9 or 10 weeks of the quarter and then 1/3 in the last 2 weeks, including the sort of episodic or idiosyncratic noise around our name. We think that 1% or 1.5%, which is what we'd estimate over those last 7 or 8 sort of business days of the quarter actually underscores the resilience of the deposit base and the relative absence of what I'll call hot money at DB.  Where did you see it? It was in the portfolios that are typically the most price sensitive and sensitive, if you like, to sentiment. So in a sense, it's not surprising to see that amount of reduction. And as we come back to your LCR question, I think it proves its value as a tool because the reality, why did the ratio stay constant, we don't apply liquidity value to the -- those funding sources, including deposits that are most likely to flow out in a stress scenario.  So if I put that all together, Tom, we feel pretty good about the experience and the way we were able to manage through that environment. And credit to the teams. The communication, the client outreach and engagement, the work that was done in preparation, we feel quite good about performance through that period.",

    "text": "Some to the other question on the revenue guidance, high confidence in the midpoint of EUR 28 billion to EUR 29 billion. And why? Because I'm really drawing a lot of comfort actually from the stable business. If there is even room for improvement, it comes from the Private Bank and the Corporate Bank. And if I give you sort of say, my numbers, which I have in my head, even if you say the first quarter in the Corporate Bank was a stellar quarter where potentially on the deposit better, we may see some reduction. But clearly, the Corporate Bank will be well above EUR 7 billion of revenues for the year.  I mean we started with the EUR 1.9 billion. And again, if I all see the forecast and the momentum we have there, it will be clearly a number well above EUR 7 billion. The Private Bank, in my view, very stable. And again, think about that what we always said before that the real impact of the tailwind is still to come. So if I look at last year, if I look at this year, if I look at the first quarter, kind of a number well above EUR 9 billion is well achievable in the Private Bank.  Asset Management, again, a EUR 2.5 billion number with all that, what I can see well achievable. So I think the stable business will be well in excess of EUR 19 billion. If you then think about the EUR 28.5 billion, it's approximately EUR 9 billion, which we need from the Investment Bank.  Now again, I think James said it in his prepared remarks, very strong business actually in the Investment Bank. The episodic items, which we recorded in the first quarter of 2022, we always knew that this is not repeatable, but the underlying flow in the Investment Bank is strong. I just told you about additional investments, which we did also Latin America and so on. So I think what we need to achieve just in order to come to the EUR 28.5 billion would be something like a EUR 9 billion of revenues in the Investment Bank. We took EUR 2.7 billion in. That would mean, on average, a EUR 2.1 billion quarterly, which we have seen and where I'm highly confident to get there, again, based on the momentum. And hence, you know what, the guidance stands, and I'm confident.",

    "text": "On LCR, we'll always back test. I think the industry and working with regulators, we'll back test what we call the outflow assumptions or the liquidity risk drivers. We'll incorporate what we learn into our own internal models and discuss with regulators as an industry, whether there are changes to LCR that are necessary.  I'll tell you that the experience of the last several years, the COVID crisis in 2020, the impact of the inception of the war in Ukraine last year, now the banking sector turbulence, all of those things have actually proven out rather than disprove the severity of the liquidity risk drivers. So we feel really good about what the tool tells us.  You mentioned the CDS market. We think CDS is an important risk management tool as well, helping banks and counterparties manage credit risk. That said, it's an illiquid market, relatively speaking, and is prone to movements that may not reflect a realistic assessment of default probability. And so I think it probably does bear some scrutiny as to how that market works and whether there are ways to improve it.  Let's be clear, I think institutionally and speaking personally, we think short selling is a viable activity. It provides information to the marketplace and is not something that we would criticize in and of itself. The question is, is there a possibility for crosstalk between different parts of the capital structure that really doesn't represent information in the marketplace. And hence, it's something that does bear some -- As I say, we went through this period, which was an idiosyncratic focus, I think, well. In a sense, we were tested, and we showed ourselves to be a strong, stable bank without the vulnerabilities that the market was concerned about. And in a sense, that's a good thing that clients and investors and counterparties were able to see that. So I'd probably leave it there, Tom.",

Is there a risk that we don't end up on a flat adjusted reported cost basis? And in that respect, just confirming the EUR 500 million restructuring costs are incorporated in your flat cost guidance.  And then if we travel from '23 to '25, is that like essentially flat trajectory as well? Or when do the EUR 2.5 billion cost savings come through and other EUR 500 million like an additional saving in your cost path you modeled?

    "text": "So Anke, thank you for the questions. I'll dive in and Chris, you may want to add. I'll go in reverse order, if I may, Look, as we've talked about, the EUR 372 million this quarter is probably higher than we would have expected, and in particular focus is on the around EUR 120 million that we recognized on the two -- these two individual exposures in the IPB. If you take that out, EUR 250 million in the quarter, is actually a sensible run rate and would certainly deliver on the range and guidance that we've given. We're not seeing indicators at this point of weakness in credit. So as we look at the forward-looking indicators, ratings movements, Stage 2 events and all the metrics we look at, we're just not seeing it yet. We are obviously mindful of the environment that we're in and watching carefully. But to your question about, do the trends support the range, yes, they do. So we're comfortable there.  The question on the path to '25 on cost income ratio, what's the lever? The lever is operating leverage. What we highlighted back in February is that the sort of the cumulative, if you like, the compound rate of operating leverage improvement over the 4 years from '18 was 5% a year. Now we may not achieve that every year, but it doesn't take 5% a year to get us to 62.5% from 67%. And so that's also why we've defined the strategy as we have and why we define acceleration as we've done.  If we can find ways to accelerate revenue growth and at least manage the expense base flat with some of the additional measures that we're taking, at least offsetting additional investments and hopefully bringing a little bit more to the bottom line over that time, we think the math to get to 62.5% is very solid. And as Christian outlined, we'd hope to be able to make that a more easily achievable target, and as I say, potentially create room for reinvestment.  The '23 path, as you say, is one where, as other headwinds, there are always headwinds. We are making investments, whether it's in technology or controls. We're seeing inflation. And we need to work to offset those things. The initiatives we announced today are not that meaningful in terms of '23. So they might help us to the tune of around EUR 50 million in the back half of the year. But they step up over the next couple of years. And so the run rate that we think to the various initiatives that we're talking about should achieve by '25 or if not dribbling a little bit into '26, would be about EUR 250 million. So we think it's a meaningful sort of contribution to the EUR 500 million goal that we have.  We're seeing a number of things. Obviously, in the expense base we've talked about, we're going to continue to fight through now in the second quarter. Work hard to keep the company at that run rate we've talked about. In the second half, we actually start to harvest some benefits of things we've been working on for a while. I think notably, as we complete the integration, while it doesn't immediately happen, we start to harvest the benefits of that investment.  We've talked about the linearity and nonlinearity of certain elements of the EUR 2 billion. So we will continue to work and harvest those. So the short answer is, of course, it's always challenging to manage a company in an environment like this with so many moving parts to a run rate. But we think we've got the tools and the measures in place to do that, and we've got an intense amount of management focus on it. And as Christian says, even more so with Rebecca's expanded responsibilities.",

    "text": "Sure, Stuart. It's early days with respect to LCR and the items that you mentioned. I mean, yes, we've learned a painful lesson about the speed at which information and arguably, in some cases, misinformation travel in a social media world and the relatively frictionless movement of funds that we have. I think the important lesson is confidence in banking institutions is critical. I think that confidence arises from banks getting the basics right. We think we've got the basics right at Deutsche Bank. And those are -- deposit bases and funding, managing risks carefully, ensuring that you're really adding value for clients. You have a sustainable business model.  And all of these elements, does it affect how you think about LCR? I think LCR is misunderstood in the sense that it is very conservative. And because the banks have chosen since it was introduced to manage to buffers that there's room in that ratio. I think it's important to understand, if a bank hits 100% that -- in our case, we have now 43% margin against the 100%. But at 100%, we're still able to extend a 30-day stress and come outstanding. So it's a conservatively constructed ratio.  You have to remember also that things that flow off the balance sheet affect both the numerator and the depositor -- and the denominator. And so you have this dynamic nature of the ratio on the way down. So it's -- there's a number of interesting features about that tool that would suggest it's -- as it is, it's a very sort of powerful stability driver in the industry.  That doesn't mean we won't examine it. We won't examine individual risk drivers, but my hope is that a combination of the basics and the tools we have today are -- put us in a good place.",

    "text": "Theoretically, yes. And we're mindful, Stuart, that there is a cost to holding these buffers, right? That our shareholders essentially are paying for that buffer. It needs to be there. Let's be clear. The sustainability of a bank, which is engaged in maturity transformation relies on that buffer being there. But you want to calibrate it to a level that protects safety and soundness in essentially all market conditions, but then isn't so inefficient that it's an unreasonable tax on shareholders. So that balance is an interesting one, and I think we need to continue to examine.  In general, by the way, banks -- we've -- since the crisis, we have this behavior of preserving buffers. So banks manage now not just with buffers, but with a disincentive to see buffers used. And so I think that whole edifice, in a sense, can be discussed and examined.  But -- and I just want to draw a line under it, in a positive way, the stability and the tools and the post-crisis regulation I think, should be understood as a success based on what we've learned over the past 8 weeks rather than the opposite.  Briefly on commercial real estate, we don't actually look at it in U.S. terms around criticized necessarily in our IFRS accounting.

Look, we're not at a point where -- I'll start with the Investment Bank because that's where our investors tend to start. I don't think we're at a point of sort of peak revenue potential in the Investment Bank. Because just if you think about where we are, for example, right now in Origination & Advisory, that's still sort of recovering. So we think there's scope to improve there. As Christian mentioned, I think we've got scope to invest in that area and improve our market shares, leave aside the market wallet performance.  Financing is doing quite well, both in volume sort of -- or market opportunity terms and in spreads. And then I think our markets businesses have been strong performers and also risk managers. Of course, in that business, we're going to ride a little bit the volatility and the volumes in the marketplace, but we feel good about the way the business has come together under Ram's leadership. So all of those things would tell us we can at least sustain and perhaps improve on the Investment Bank.  The -- Christian mentioned earlier, Private Bank still has a way to run in terms of the momentum that interest rates deliver, let alone assets under management, loan and deposit growth in the case of loans at loans outside of mortgages. So we feel comfortable there's a good path there. And while some of the -- I think we're probably past peak lag, but we're not past the generalized improvement in the rate environment in Corporate Bank.  Lastly, I think the Asset Management business by executing the plan Stefan Hoops has laid out has a clear path to growth in assets. Obviously, it will ride the market a little bit but is also not anywhere near sort of its peak revenue potential. So all of those things, I think, feed into '24 and then '25, and there is sort of a sustainable momentum built into that.  Your second question was liquidity in March and what can we do? Look, we're acutely aware that -- I don't think we were singled out uniquely, but we were in a group that were potentially perceived as vulnerable to the issues that arose. As I said earlier, it's gratifying that the market can very quickly identify that those vulnerabilities did not exist with us or, frankly, our peers in Europe that might otherwise have also come in to pressure.  I think the answer to your question is the more we execute on our strategy, the more we deliver sustainable profitability but also the more we put historical issues around control failures and other events in the past. I hope that what I would -- some call muscle memory will fade in the market and the sort of the beta nature of Deutsche Bank will fade.  As a management team, I think we're all very committed to achieving that goal. It lies in our hands to some extent around execution. It lies in investors' hands in terms of their support for our securities.",

    "text": "So Adam, I'm not sure I follow all the questions, but let me start with NII trajectory. What I do is refer you back to Page 26 of the February 2 materials. Now we're not going to update the NII trajectory sort of every quarter. But I would say that the assumptions there on Page 26 are still pretty good assumptions. There are always movements up and down in how NII will perform. But this idea that we would put on at that time, 900, I think it's actually a little bit better than 900 given assumptions have improved relative to our expectations at that time this year is still a really good assumption.  So we did EUR 13.65 billion of net interest income last year. If that grew by EUR 1 billion or more, that would be a good assumption. There might be sort of a plateau or even a small dip in '24. And then as you see, there's another leg up in '25 as the interest rate characteristics in the Private Bank come through. So that -- I think that guidance still holds.  Now one thing just to advise you, if you look at interest income in Q1 and attempt to annualize it, you won't get to that number precisely because as we highlight, there's been a swing in the characteristic of the revenue recognition. Think of it a little bit like trading NIM in the U.S. banks, more of the revenues were characterized as fair value through P&L in Q1 than would be typical, and we can get into the reasons for that. But -- so don't be concerned that there's any difference in the guidance from that sort of anomaly. We're very comfortable with the guidance that we've given. And actually, at the moment, we're seeing, based on the curve and the funding profile, we see a little bit of upside to our earlier guidance.",

But clearly, we also believe that with the increased profitability, which we expect and with that capital efficiency, which we outlined on Page 7. And by the way, again, this has not been only a top-down but bottom-up analysis, which we even curtailed a bit top-down. So there is real potential. Of course, we will think about how much of these additional savings we can also hand back to our shareholders.  So I think if you ask me today, it will be a combination of reinvestment into those business, which is really then capital rewarding and where we have a very good story for our shareholders and investors, but part of that will be also given back to the shareholders.",

Think of the EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion as being a net reduction from that guidance. So we would expect, based on everything we know right now, to be somewhere in the low 400s, 400 to 410. And so that can give you a sense if you're building your model based on organic revenue generation, the Basel III impact that we've talked about of about EUR 30 billion of RWA gives you a little bit of sense of where it can provide, at the very least, additional support for the capital trajectory that we've laid out already.",

    "text": "Yes. Thank you, Kian. And look, let me try to start and James will jump in. Look, it's always hard to talk yourself about why we are perceived in the market as we are perceived. This is actually a question I would like to always hand back to you guys that you tell us what we can do better in communicating.  Look, I give you three items and one of that is not meant in any defensive way. But I do believe that if you just think 14 months back, where we stood in February 2022 before this awful war broke out, I think, at some point in time, we were a share price around 14 30 or something like that, not that this would be our ultimate goal, as you know. But you could see that actually people started to think about this is going into the right direction.  Now I still believe that the overall uncertainty -- the geopolitical uncertainty is a drag for us and that we are still kind of suffering from that. That is point number one.  Point number two is clearly that we have to show and we also hear it on this call, and I think it's only delivery, but you have two very resilient people here on this call. And we will drive this resilience, and we will show you quarter by quarter, week by week, month by month and day by day that we keep the ship exactly in this direction. But the composition of Deutsche Bank of the revenues completely changed.  We have 66% of revenues from the Corporate Bank, Private Bank and Asset Management. And if you would listen to me for another 2 hours, I can tell you these revenues in these businesses only have one direction. And it will -- this 66% will be kind of the ratio potentially, it even goes into an even more favorable number if you think about balanced versus -- a stable versus less stable business, it even goes into an even more favorable number.  So we have a bank which is now that balance, that stable from a profitability, from a sustainability of revenues that I'm very, very confident that we can show quarter-by-quarter a very sustainable development.  Now to the Investment Bank, to be honest, I think we are -- and again, potentially we need to do a better job, and I'm the first one who tries to learn. But I think the inner stability of the Investment Bank with all the changes we have done over the last 4 years is far stronger than potentially the market thinks about it. James just talked about the financing business, a very stable business. I think it's a financing business in the Investment Bank, which is, in my view, among the top 3 in the world. Also from an underwriting standards, if you think about the value chain from the first line of defense to the second line of defense.  I think it's a business where even others outside people of Deutsche and saying, this is -- honestly, this is top of the -- business. That is a business which is constantly there, continuously there with about EUR 3 billion of revenues. We have reconfigurated the trading business under Ram to one of the leading trading businesses. Again, if you look at Q1 and take out the idiosyncratic items, I'm just mentioning the name, which we talked about in '21 and '22, a lot, which obviously is not something which comes back every quarter, then the underlying business in the Investment Bank in 2022 in the first quarter -- 2023 in the first quarter was actually stronger than in the first quarter of 2022, despite it was a very strong quarter.  We will see now a comeback in the O&A business in the Investment Bank. We do some selective investments there because we see the market opportunities and we will be awake for these market opportunities. So that I think you have three very stable business with the interest rates still to come in one of our largest business, which is the Private Bank, with revenues above EUR 9 billion, clearly above EUR 9 billion. So that I think from a pure revenue point of view, I think this bank has completely turned around, and we are playing there where the clients want us to play and where we see the momentum.  Secondly, on the cost side, yes, we are now in the second phase, and I'm grateful for your question, Kian. We're in the second phase of real cost takeout. And that is a cost takeout, which now goes in particular, front to back, that we see the revised processes where we have invested a lot in the front offices, which now need to go into the infrastructure because we need one process from the originating to the infrastructure. And for that, we decided that all COOs in the infrastructure functions are now sub summarized under Rebecca so that we can do the changes in one process from the front office into the various infrastructure functions.  Secondly, when you have invested so much into controls and we are keep doing this, at some point in time, obviously, automation and machine learning, artificial intelligence, but in particular, automation will also lead over time to reduce cost. Unity will pay off as we said.  So what you now see in the second phase of taking cost out is not like in the first phase that we exited business, and we took those costs out but it's actually the smart takeout of cost, plus a constant revenue also of our workforce where we need to do something. So the reduction in force action is something which we have done now. And I'm sure we will do similar things in '24, '25 again. That is a constant review of our organization that's all now under Rebecca. And I think with one person driving that, we will even have more force on it.  So I think it's a normal development in transforming an organization but with the robustness and resilience of the revenues. And that discipline on the cost management, I do believe that we will show now quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year that this bank is on the right track. And at some point in time, I'm sure that also the investors will see that. If this is then even joined by hopefully, and this is, I think, the most important we should all look at that this awful war comes to an end at some point in time, I think that also Europe will be seen differently. And then latest then, we will also have relief from that side. With your medal item, actually, I will bring that message to Berlin.",

But then obviously, the last buyback was about EUR 300 million. So I'm just trying to get a sense of are you thinking of -- or have you asked the numbers in the kind of EUR 750 million to EUR 1 billion range? Or is it kind of closer to what was previously done?  And then the second question, just a follow-up on the LCR ratio. I guess in the end, I suppose I'm just wondering, are you going to continue to target 130% and trend down towards that level? And -- or are you going to look to keep the LCR similar to where it is today? And do you have a benefit in your plan on revenues for bringing that LCR down to 130%?",

    "text": "Thanks, Amit. Look, your math is right. So the 40 basis points would represent something a little shy of EUR 1.5 billion, so use EUR 1.5 billion. As Christian indicated, we look at last year's buyback at EUR 300 million. And given the progress we've made -- and by the way, I don't want to be committed to a specific number, a specific timing, and it's too early, obviously, and we need to go through this with the supervisors in presenting a new capital plan. But a step forward on last year's number would be consistent with the guidance or the capital planning that we shared with you back in March of last year.  And as Christian mentioned to maybe give you a sense of ranging then, a 50% increase in dividend if that was mirrored also with the -- an increase of the buyback of a similar amount, it would give you a sense of a range of what we think it might be sought by us.  I will say that given the starting point of the 40 basis points, that's why we think it's -- this type of ask would be affordable. There' uncertainties in the environment. You would expect us to remain prudent. But as we say, with the buffers we have, we think we have space for something like that.  In LCR, we were very conscious as we went through Q1 that we had a high print at the end of December. That was frankly an accident. The average last quarter and the average this quarter are both almost exactly where you'd want it to be in this low 130% range. If we're targeting 130% then you'd expect us to be a little bit higher than 130%. I would -- I think for this quarter, we'd probably target a gentle decline. We are mindful that the risks in the outlook haven't entirely abated. But I wouldn't want you to be surprised if the number started with 130% next -- when we're talking with each other again in July.  As to the cost of that buffer, obviously, it does play a role, but it is very dynamic. So I wouldn't tie a specific revenue better or worse number to a ratio better or worse view. I hope that helps.",

And I just wondered how much of that was deliberate -- sort of deliberately steering the balance sheet smaller in a choppy environment versus kind of lack of opportunity to deploy? So that's my first question.  And then my second question really just on the capital surpluses, uses, et cetera. Is 13% CET1, or 13.2%, is that still the right reference level in a world where the market is nervous, not just the market, but the world more broadly is nervous around banks? And there's things like Basel IV to be funded, some banks are prefunding that, et cetera. So is 13% still the right reference level to be talking about for capital?",

Remember that in our capital plan, we will be building to Basel III final framework and in this plan, because of the model adjustments, higher LED floors and various items, that 13.2% has been getting steadily more conservative in how we're capitalizing our risks. So we do think it is appropriate to continue to target that level.  As you say, there will be a bubble in '24 that sort of goes away on 1st of January '25, all things equal that we need to build into our planning. But we feel comfortable with the buffer at 200 basis points above MDA. As I say, it's getting more conservative steadily.  On capital management and the deliberate nature, to be fair, it actually wasn't deliberate. Are we looking at risk appetite carefully and extensions of balance sheet in this environment, of course. But actually, the usual seasonality was a little bit less than we might otherwise have expected both on leverage exposure and RWA. And we do think loan growth is probably a little slower in the coming quarters than we might have expected given credit conditions, the possibility of recession, all the features in the environment today.",

Richard's with me in the room here, and we look forward to talking with our fixed income investors tomorrow, but nice to have fixed income topics on the equity call.  Look, we were -- we came into the year, as we mentioned, cautious about the environment. When we saw the market opening in the first few weeks of the year, we decided to move quickly, much quicker than our original funding plan might have suggested. And so we were pleased to have done all that, not just senior nonpreferred, by the way, but we did covered it, and we did a Tier 2 issue before the end of February. And we've done an AT1 deal late last year, which might look like expensive capital, but it gave us real comfort traveling into an uncertain '23 that we were making the right decisions for the bank.  We haven't really gone to the market since the turbulence started in any meaningful way. I think we may have done a covered bond in the interim. But the reason is not because we don't have access to it, but we don't like the price. And prefunding, therefore, was, I think, economically sensible and has actually given us, to the earlier question, from Chris, I think, has given us a slightly better funding profile than for this year and going into '24 than we might have other expected. Sorry, it was Adam's question, on the path of net interest income.  On AT1, we think the market healed more quickly than we might have expected after that Sunday. Look, the instrument sort of -- the instrument had challenges at inception as the market was being created. And I think it has now established a good convention with good investor understanding of what the various triggers and what have you are in it. And I think it will survive in this for. It's conceivably will be a little bit more expensive for banks to issue AT1 securities. But -- and I think it's worth a look at that, but our sense is that it will continue to be a viable instrument going forward.  For us, again, given we were conservative around our issuance -- we don't have a call date until 2025. And as I say, we're in a good place on our funding plan for this year. So we feel, overall, very constructive about where we see. As we stand, our hope and expectation is spreads will narrow again in the coming months.",

And to be very honest, I think the discussions we have also after these events are done in a very constructive way that everybody looks at potential loopholes still or weaknesses that is clear, and I think this should be done like we do it if there -- if something is happening on our side. But I can tell you that these discussions are really constructive, and I think the regulators, in particular, in Europe, should look back and saying, very stable system.  In this regard, I also do hope that from an SRF point of view, from a deposit scheme and from the single resolution fund that we don't see a different direction. And to be honest, I'm not hearing this. And again, one should also not only think about the single resolution fund, but also that we have national schemes, which worked in the past.

There's a nuance in it, which has to do with what collateral is posted in the TLTRO program versus unencumbered. So it is a support to the ratio. But one that we're -- we have a funding plan to wean ourselves off of over time. And it actually does give us some flexibility in how we manage collateral across the bank. . In CB, in round numbers, we were sort of flattish on fees and commission, a little bit up. Volumes were -- depending on whether you're looking year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter, flat to up slightly. So what you get is right now a significant impact of rates and within rates, the lag.

    "text": "Sure. Happy to Vishal to answer the questions. So there's a lot in that sort of recourse lending portfolio. So there can be, for example, senior revolvers to real estate investment trusts. There can be sort of working capital. Sometimes construction lending to corporates that are recourse in nature, but where you have lean on property. There's a bunch of things there that -- also, by the way, wealth management, where you'd be lending to wealthy individuals who are investing in either their own businesses or in commercial real estate investments on their part.  So it's -- as a -- in terms of the nature or the riskiness if you like, and the underlying exposure, it is very different to the nonrecourse portfolio. And hence, our own sort of focus versus the rest portfolio distinction. And the losses in that -- in those portfolios have been negligible historically, just negligible.  On the LTVs, what we provide is the most recent. So our practice is to have external valuations no less frequently than once a year. Our internal views are updated no less frequently than every 6 months. So you do get, if not a real time. There is, of course, a little bit of a lag in that, but you get relatively speaking LTVs that adjust over time.  Your beta development question is an interesting one. We look at it both by currency and by portfolio. As you'd expect, the dollar has moved more quickly and I think is catching up with the models more quickly, getting, I would argue, close on the retail side to what we might have expected and closer on corporate. The euro is lagging that in both cases considerably based both on the recency of the rate increases. And I think just the nature and structure of the European deposit funding market. So the euro continues to outperform, again, across both portfolios.  And while that beta also has a little bit of a lag in it, looking at March right now, the turbulence the industry went through, I think it had an impact. But I wouldn't say it was a dramatic impact, at least in our estimation on that beta trajectory.",

But in round numbers, if you take our guidance from the beginning of the year, which would have led you to kind of the mid-14s, maybe a little better and interest-earning assets of somewhere a little bit below EUR 1 trillion, you'd probably be in the 150 basis point range again, subject for the year, subject to some swings on the characterization that I mentioned. And we do provide, as always, the profitability by segment, including both net interest revenues and fair value through PT -- through profit and loss. So you see the total profitability, if you like, that the balance sheet produces with that.  In terms of the deposit base, the total deposit base, the numbers we gave you, I think, were 33% of the total deposit base under statutory insurance, 41% with -- if you exclude banks from that.

    "text": "Good morning, Anke and thank you very much for your question. Let me start and James will potentially add. First of all, on your description on the macro side, I agree, but I think it completely validates that what we have shared with you in the previous calls. We always said that 2023 will be based on a very weak economy, on a kind of a no-growth scenario. I even expect for the end of '23 technical or a very mild recession in Germany potentially also in the US. And that was always an exactly the foundation of our plan. And hence, Anke, there is no negative surprise in the macro economic outlook when it comes to our plan or to the underlying drivers, be it revenues, be it also risk-crossed. And that is also, I think, important, that from a risk point of view, our credit forecast was always built, exactly on that description of the market you just shared with us, and hence, we also don't see any downside to our credit forecast, which James just again reemphasised in his prepared remarks. When it comes to where do we see growth opportunities in particular for the stable business in such an environment, look, I really do believe that the global house bank strategy in particular in the stable business is exactly the right answer. And that's what we feel kind of on a day-to-day basis with our clients. Of course, we are benefiting from the NII and get back to that in a second, but if you think about what kind of discussions and mandates we win with our corporate banking clients around the world when it comes to reorganising their networks, reorganising their supply chains, making sure that we, obviously, then follow up with the cash management systems around the world, as an answer to their reorganised network, then this brings us a lot of new mandates, which, honestly, is even above our expectations. Of course, in this regard, also the most recent upgrades from rating agencies again help us, because whenever we get this obviously, it helps to increase revenues and new clients onboarding. In the private bank, there is a lot of ask, and you see that also in our development in the assets under management on the investment side. I think there we are seeing not only in Germany, but if I look in particular in other European countries in Spain and Italy, we are seeing, as the go-to bank when it comes to investment advice. And this is, if you talk to the clients in this scenario where inflation is still above 5%, where they think about how they secure their pensions. Now with having post bank fully integrated on our Deutsche Bank system, these people think about how to secure the pensions, and that is obviously our chance and opportunity, and that is what we see in the daily business on the investment business. And in the IB, I know that a lot of people are always thinking this is the more volatile business, but I think we shouldn't underestimate also in these days the stability of the financing business in the IB, again, shown in Q2, also year-over-year. I think the future investments we are doing in the O&A business, they will pay off, because we can see that, actually the trough in this business has been passed, and we see from the mandates we are discussing with the clients, that there is clearly an uplift in this business, and therefore I expect rising revenues actually in that business also in Q3, and in the following quarters. And I also think that Q2 has again shown that also in the trading business, we have done quite well and also compared to our peers and that we are actually maintaining or even growing our market share So if I take all this, I think the positioning of the global house bank with 70% of the revenues now coming from the private bank, corporate bank and the asset management, growing assets under management, I really do think we have the right answer in particular for the environment we are experiencing right now. Now coming to the concrete revenue question and not only for '23 or '24, let me give you some more guidance. A, the NII curve is holding up far stronger than we initially planned and I do believe that with regard to our own existing plan, we see positive surprises also in the second half of '23 And I do also think in '24. Let me give you one example in the private bank business, we see a modest three-digit million revenue increase potential in the second half alone versus our own plan and that is mainly coming from NII, but also from the growing assets under management. The assumptions which we had so far in the corporate bank when it comes to the decrease in NII, I would say we are too conservative and I would also predict that going forward, this would be slower than anticipated, it will come down, but it is slower. The growth in investment and other fee income, as I just said, is encouraging. It's not only the assets under management, but you have seen the announcement of relationship business we are doing. For instance with Lufthansa on Miles & More and to be honest, this is not the one-off, this is actually coming more and more as additional mandates. In particular, if I think about how the corporate bank is thriving, these mandates are coming more and more and therefore I really do believe we are building now the platform to grow in non-NII business with all the technology spend, which we did in the corporate bank, but also obviously in the other business. And therefore we did all the investments in O&A and wealth management, also in hiring the people because we see that business will grow, that there is the increased discussions we have with clients in particular in O&A and therefore we stepped up for that. So looking at all of this and with the starting base of €15 billion of revenues, look, there is clearly upside in the private bank versus our own plan in the second half and to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if we see the similar number in the private bank in the second half then what we have seen in the first half. I think very stable numbers in the corporate bank, potentially slightly lower because of the NII curve, but again, we have been very conservative in the past, potentially too conservative. Stable asset management and very robust IB was growing O&A revenues. So all this gave us the confidence changed in that we clearly can hint to a higher revenue base than the midpoint of €28 billion to €'29 billion. I think we can focus on the €29 billion number. And if I then look at the businesses we are creating, again in the non-NII, but also actually what we always emphasize here that the real uptick in NII in the private bank is only coming in '24 and '25, honestly, I'm very bullish on the revenue trajectory for '24 and '25. So I think we are exactly rightly placed from a revenue point of view from a positioning and hinted it placed into our half.",

    "text": "Thanks Nicolas. It's James. I'll take both of your questions and Christian may want to add. Look we've talked about the run rate as we -- it gives you a sense of what management is focused on and I think, the past three quarters, we've been able to adhere to the run rate and it's been an area of real focus given both the need to deliver on cost savings measures in order to support that and manage the investments in a phasing that corresponds with the cost takeout that we're -- that we're achieving. So if I think about priorities, look, our priorities on the cost measures are reasonably clear. We laid them out in March of last year and we're building on that and they are focused on particularly technology distribution platform and in private bank in particular, but not exclusively and then infrastructure support, can we make that infrastructure support more efficient and so we're very focused on that and the delivery. In terms of priorities on the business growth side, leave aside control investments for a moment where I do think we're near or at the peak of what is required in order to finish that control remediation agenda. We've been -- we want to be really clear that our focus is on the capital light product areas in the firm and the ability to grow fee and commission income going forward that supports both the return potential of the company and the distribution profile in the future. And those areas, Christians talked about wealth management being one, origination advisory being the second. In the corporate bank, the fee income sources in the corporate bank that go to technology capabilities, but also just growing our client footprint in some areas where we're a leader, I have doc custody for as one example. So we've been focused on those types of investments and I think we're making really good progress. Just going to the run rate, one thing, as much as we're focused on that range, we do see the pressures I've outlined coming towards the end of the year, Numis, as an obvious example, will give us about €50 million per quarter of additional expense and then the investment we make in front line bankers taking advantage of the opportunity in the marketplace, maybe a little bit more. So, if they're the exit rates per month is perhaps €25 million more constant FX, that would be a natural place, but I think we're, in essence, we've started to run downhill in terms of the -- our ability to deliver on those cost savings being derisked, if you like, and gaining momentum. The Unity project is one example that is behind us. And as we said in the prepared remarks, now it's about crystallizing the run rate benefits over time, but there are many more similar initiatives that will have a cumulative impact at which point our greater challenge is phasing of growth investments rather than delivery of cost savings. I just want to say one other thing, while we're on the costs, this nonoperating cost area for us, obviously, frustrating to have those exceed, especially those out of our control original planning. So I look to the second half, we would expect at around, say, €100 million per quarter, the remainder of the restructuring and severance costs that we outlined for the year to come through. Always uncertain on litigation, but clearly, we would hope to do much better going forward than in the most recent quarter. And then finally, one thing to just make you aware of, we alluded to a little bit in our disclosures it's early to talk about specific purchase price adjustments and what have you in the numerous closing process. But our current expectation is that we would impair the goodwill attached to that immediately on closing. So in the fourth quarter, producing about a €200 million item there also that we would think of as nonoperating. So for your models and awareness. On CLPs, I'll try to be shorter. Look, the guidance takes into account everything we know today. The environment on balance is in line with our expectations. And if I go all the way back to the beginning of the year, maybe even a little better than our expectations. We did have the idiosyncratic items in the first quarter in IPB come through, and that sort of pushed us up in our range. But otherwise, at the, call it, 30 basis points, we think it captures our expectations about the second half. And we see this as a slightly elevated but not a broad deterioration of the credit environment. So we're very comfortable with the guidance there.",

The pro forma CET1 is 13.1% post your headwinds, your capital generative. So would it be possible for a buyback to another leg to come as soon as the full year results. And then you're clearly highlighting €8 billion of total capital return through the '22 to '25 plan, of which have really done €1.75 billion. So just a sense of how quickly you need to accelerate capital return plans in order to get through that full GBP 8 billion, I think it would be really helps to investors. The €450 million is helpful, but people want to know what's coming beyond that? And then secondly, on NII, you're talking about the long-dated NII tailwind within the private bank. This makes sense given the nature of that business. But can you put some numbers to it? I think there's worries in the market around peak NII, but a sense of what that recurring tailwind in into '24, '25, '26 and even beyond, would look like -- would give us a bit more confidence about your revenue trajectory beyond this year? So a bit more color around volume of hedges or kind of the back book rate on those hedges would really give us a bit more -- some more to play with when we think about the longer-term NII story.",

Let me start with your capital question, and then I hand over to James, with regard to the NII question and some more details beyond the comments I made before. Look, on the capital, first of all, thank you very much for the recognition of the €450 million. It's, I think, hugely important for management to deliver that what we have promised. And so far, what we have promised we delivered. And therefore, 1 thing is clear, the €8 billion absolutely stand that is our target. And based how the company evolves, how actually the capital ratio looks like, if I think about the growth. You just heard from James, how committed we are on the cost line and hence to further increase the operating leverage, we have full confidence in delivering the €8 billion. I think, and we clearly understand that obviously, this should be a continuous trajectory. And therefore, I also said in the prepared remarks, it is clearly our aim to continue that distribution in '24. Now you will understand after we just published our share buyback last night that we won't give you the details for next year because this also always requires a detailed planning. Our planning around starts in September. Then I think we have such a constructive relationship with our regulator that warrants then the next discussion. But looking where we see the firm, it is our clear aim to continue this trajectory in I think we have gone on a pretty nice journey with an annual increase of 50% when it comes to dividend. We did this not only on the dividend side but also on the share buyback. And as we think this is exactly the right approach, one can potentially think that this is the management aim also to do that in '24. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of way forward. But clearly, it's not back-end loaded only in '25. We know what we have to deliver in '24. James?",

The hedging on the PB portfolio is longer than than CB and more euro heavy. So that effect will be with us for several years after '24. It's been a while since I've looked at this in this way. But my memory is that, that uplift is sort of between $200 million and $300 million per year for a period of time. So that uplift is considerable just on the rate side. If you've got volumes and sort of a spread dynamic, sort of more active hedging as well as capital benefits and improving unsecured spreads, there's a number of different features that can help support the NII of the group and the businesses over time. So isolating that item, good story. There's a sustainable growth that comes after 24 and actually already in '24, especially in the second half, but it's one of a number of supportive items. Hopefully, that helps give you some color on it.",

Is there any other factors that you think we should consider rather than this constant adjustment of the cost base? Can you share that with us as anything else, any curveball that we should think which could impact costs in '24/'25 going forward? And in that context, on a stated cost basis, can you just clarify what we should think of as a run rate severance and litigation expenses? You mentioned numbers in the past, but they might have changed based on the experience in the second quarter. And then the second question I have is regarding the private bank. You're running at a clean cost income around €76 million, still looks very high, considering how the higher rates have helped you on the NII.

    "text": "So thank you, Kian. Yes. 1.675 is not a bad place to think of in terms of exit rate. We'd be pleased to run the company out there over the course of next year. There are always curveballs in the expense world, but we -- and that's what I mean by running downhill, I think that are the tools that we have to manage those curve balls hopefully begin to expand. As we come out of a shrinking control remediation, repairing our technology estate world of call it the past five years and move into a growth and an accelerating benefit from initiatives under way world. Leave FX aside for a second because that'll obviously change the run rate going forward, but otherwise, I'd say inflation is tough, especially on the technology side. So how much inflation flows through. Again, I want to be clear because we have so much coming on the expense initiative side, it would then give us the flexibility to phase and time some of the investments in a way that gives us control and allows us to manage that. Obviously, we'd like to make the investments and investments that are high return low marginal cost income ratio is the direction of travel, but that gives us sort of additional levers. Litigation, sevens and instruction, obviously, the second is in our control. We would probably tell you that a typical severance year, if nothing else is going on, is maybe 100, 150 per year. So not gigantic and it really just depends on whether there are larger programs that we initiate and then put aside, but obviously, we'd like to get to the end of a period of time where major initiatives are necessary as part of the transformation of the company. And then on litigation, that's been hard to estimate and in fairness, there've been items that have taken us by surprise, both last year with the third party messaging, as an example, in this most recent quarter with a number of items. One always has the view that as you get through items, they're behind you, you've taken out the risk, and then, therefore, the forward list of matters begins to diminish, but it's -- and the run rate there, therefore, is hard to define properly, but we'd love for that to be sub-400 in a year, let alone in a quarter. On private bank, Christian will want to, want to add, but the operating leverage in private bank will be, we think, dramatic over the years ahead, and that's really the story there.",

    "text": "Yeah. So, well, you took my words, because, here, and I think you are right, obviously, we are not yet happy with the cost income ratio we have in the private bank, but if you see only on the cost side, what is still to come, just because of the finalization now of Unity, €300 million of costs will fall away in '25. We have branch closures further to come, I think, in the last quarter, or in the last two quarters, we close approximately 90 branches or 100 branches. That goes on, this is continuing. You have seen our announcement on the mortgage side that we are actually reducing, reducing there also, our people in that business as a consequence of our business mix and the capital allocation. So, I think on the cost side in the private bank, if I also look at all the key deliverables under Rebecca's wing, where she is now working with Claudio de Sanctis on, there is a clear cost take out on itself, and I haven't even touched now on the revenue side. On the revenue side, actually clear upside, I just gave you a little bit of number for the second half of 2023. This is not extraordinary income. This is just better revenues that we initially planned, that will continue also when I look at the plan in the year '24 and '25, also on the back of the NII comments, James made earlier, and all that brings us actually into a cost income range for the private bank, which is in the low 60s, and that in 2025, that is our plan, and we feel exactly on that trajectory. And I do also think with the announcements, Claudio made on making the structure now, after building up the private bank internationally and private in Germany under cards leadership now moving it together there is additional costs which we actually take out. So therefore, I'm absolutely confident that we can achieve this low 60s cost/income ratio than in '25.",

We had been working hard on that disclosure, and also to your question about definitions, what we were trying to clean up this is two things. One is the NACE code disclosure, which is a is an industry definition, but to be fair, not really how we think about risk managing the portfolio. And therefore, we wanted to bridge from the NACE at around $40 billion within the NACE definition, there is nonrecourse and recourse.. Ironically there's also some non-recourse outside of the nase definition in these numbers. So we're trying to give you, sort of reconcile if you like to some of the existing external disclosures. What I think is important though, is this, kind of the €33 billion of the old focus portfolio, the €34 billion of the new focus portfolio, what we're trying to give you is a sense of the size of the perimeter that is our focus from a risk management perspective, where we think, what is the portfolio that can produce losses based on its exposure to the current environment, that's a little bit different today than it was in the COVID time when we first created the focus portfolio, and so hence also a shift to that, but not a meaningful, difference in, in terms of total exposures.

We have the geopolitical uncertainties. We had an inflation. The economic forecast were everything between a hard recession and actually a growth scenario. And therefore, I think, rightly so, also with all that, what we could see, James decided and with my full support that we, for the time being hold off. And then we started well into the year. We had a far better forecast what is happening. We saw how stable the business is developing. And we saw we are making good progress. And that was the right time then also with the forecast into '23 and '24 to apply for that. And in this regard, I think we had very constructive discussions. And this is my own assumption and only interpretation. I do think that the regulator also actually recognized that we were on the cautious side at the end of 2022 when it came to the start of '23. And I think that also then obviously was at least not taken negatively.",

I don't think it really impacts us in a meaningful way. in terms of our business operations, potentially competitive positioning, given that, in our view, European banks have been at a capital disadvantage for some time. And then there's also at least the possibility that the timing of implementation could give us a bit more breathing room relative to the first of January 25. But beyond that, not much expected. I would not expect that the European legislator sort of reopens its discussions based on whatever they read in the NPR. And I think that's appropriate.

    "text": "Well, thank you, Timo. On the PB side, look, Claudio started 245 days ago. And let me -- let me start differently. First of all, I think Karl has done a wonderful job in actually making sure that the private banking business is becoming a profitable business. He has done a lot in order to make sure that we are on the trajectory to become a very profitable business, as we said also to Kian's question. So the trajectory, which Karl has laid is exactly the right one. Now what we will see actually in the private banking business is actually that the international private banking business and the German private banking business is moving closer together from a product responsibility from an investment responsibility also from an infrastructure and servicing responsibility. So you will see a more leaner structure, which we now can do after we have done the necessary steps in Germany with Unity. We can now actually put it under a more combined and efficient leadership together, which obviously will bring certain cost benefits. On top of that, I do believe that Claudio will focus very much across the private banking business on the investment arm on the capital LiDAR. You have seen that he has done that very successfully in the international private bank. And I do believe if I look at the long-term challenges in particular in Germany, if you really think about what the people are concerned about -- it's about the pensions. It's about the state pensions, which will come or not come in 10 or 15 years. And in this regard, there is in almost each and every client meeting, there is a question how can I actually plan for my own retirement in that time period. And for that, you need a first-class offering on the investment side. And that's exactly where you need the private banking experience, private banking expertise we have with Claudio, which we have with a lot of other people. And that's, I think, where Claudio is very much focusing on. Secondly, he would make sure that also this offering in a digital way will make its way to 15 million clients now all on the same IT platform that is really a meaningful step forward. So I'm very proud of what happened with Unity. So I do think the power, which we can now bring particular in the investment business to Deutsche Bank clients, but in particular, to 15 million post bank clients being now part of our technology, is simply outstanding, and Claudio will focus on that. On the miles and more, look, I haven't seen, by the way, from the competition and also from the deal in itself that the competition was not interested anymore in such a deal. That was a real race. We are super proud that we were able to be selected by Miles & More and by Lufthansa made the difference. At the end of the day, our clients can far better talk about that. I will not talk about that, the client took a decision. But I do believe that our shift four years ago that the corporate bank, the day-to-day business, the combination, the client centricity, which we have built between the private bank, the corporate bank, the way these two units work together and worked in that pitch made it different. We delivered on Deutsche Bank to Lufthansa. And one Deutsche Bank to Lufthansa is not only the best platform for miles more and the best technology, which, by the way, we started to invest already last year in order to be ready now to really do the migration. What we deliver to them is 15 million additional potential clients and that nobody else has and with the commitment of the full Board that the private bank and the corporate bank is as much as the heart of the Deutsche Bank business as our focused investment bank, I think the clients get it, and they want them to work with us. And I think that is the advantage which we can deliver. And I can tell you that is only the start because with that mandate, we will, I think, have a big, big chance to win other card businesses in Germany and in Europe.",

So maybe you could also give us additionally what that impact might be from the output floor. And then on Slide 9 of the presentation on net interest margin. I see that your average interest earning assets have been declining for a few quarters here. You've pointed to lower cash balances as a cause for Q2. But is there something a bit more persistent going on in terms of maybe high interest rates denting demand for loans or maybe also the contribution from the reduction in sub hurdle lending, maybe that has a larger impact here. So if you could talk about that in a bit more detail. And then the third question is a bit more technical. So you've got EPS of only €0.19 here. So I'm trying to reconcile the net profit that you've used to calculate this, it's only €402 million, which is a lot lower than the €763 million. So I'm trying to understand how you get to the 402 million. Both of these measures include the deduction of 81 coupons. So is there some other OCI impacts here to get to the 402 -- or €763 million.",

On the capital impact, I'd say we would probably stick with the -- with our earlier commentary, which I think was 10%, but it's been a while since we've looked at that incremental of the output floor then between 25% and 30%. And in fairness, that's all premitigation, business model changes and all that good stuff. So it's there's no update on that, but that would be orders of magnitude. And I think important to emphasize the capital measures that we talked about in April, I mean you can ask where they intended to support offsetting Basel III impact or to support the distribution same, same. They're really, I think, valuable in both respects to and to shift the group to more capital-light usage of the balance sheet. It goes a little bit to your NIM or interest-earning assets question. I'd be surprised if the next number in the series were as big as of a downward movement as the last albeit loan growth has clearly slowed down, and you're seeing the impact now of some of the decisions we announced in April around trade finance and lending as well as the mortgage book. So we would expect to see some impact in the loan balances as a consequence but we think that, that's the right decision economically in terms of supporting both ROTE and NIM going forward. And maybe I just -- I want to make sure I understand the reconciliation that you're referring to in terms of the -- was it a forward on capital that you were after? Or -- I wasn't sure.",

And then this is much higher versus consensus at about €9 billion right now combined for '24 and '25. So I'm wondering how -- what are the key drivers you're looking at to bridge that gap. So that's one. And then the second 1 is on your investment banking business. So you have clearly hired a lot on the front office side there. in both banking and capital markets, plus there's a demo deal that is underway too. So clearly, you're positioning for a potential rebound in banking and capital markets activity. So what I wanted to check there is if you have a target market share in mind in terms of what you -- where you want to see your banking business versus the global peers?

So we -- it's a little bit complex the way we do it, but we've said in respect of the years '21 to '25, paid in the years '22 and this would include a little bit of capital then returned in -- or a lot of capital returned in '26. So we think our -- on the trajectory that we're on, which you remember is sort of asymptotic if you go 50% per year, the increase is quite steep, and we think also prudent in light of our own view of the earnings growth potential of DB. On the IB item, and I'll focus now on origination and advisory, where the investments have been going they'd be more visible perhaps there have been investments into the FIC platform, which we think have performed very nicely in terms of our market share improvements from a low point in '18 and '19 to where we are today. We're very pleased with that progression. But in the corporate finance area where we've invested more recently, our market share has been bouncing around 2%. And we do think there's a significant opportunity for us there. We don't have a specific target, but I don't think there's any reason why we shouldn't be able to double the market share in -- again, with our in a disciplined way inside our client footprint inside our capital footprint. But by doing just much better in terms of closing industry gaps in terms of building more of the chain, for example, with private equity sponsors, both on the way in and the way out. There's a lot of potential that is, if you like, within our franchise perimeter that we really just haven't captured. So lots of upside for us there, I believe.",

We've talked about the macro weakening in lower volatility, and you've started to see that against a high base and one where we think we're executing well in terms of our client engagement. But in the language I've been using the micro coming back, especially credit and financing businesses and doing quite well. An interesting question, is there an environment in which the credit stays that continues to do well in the second half and going into '24. But because we find ourselves now on the other side of the cycle, increasing volatility as investors now begin to position for an uncertain path in terms of reducing policy rates and an uncertain path in terms of the length of time the policy rates stay at the terminal rate. So there's sort of an interesting environment that we see coming in the second half of the year. We'll see whether that comes to fruition or not. But what we -- what we're -- on Mac and his team, super focused on is just engaging with our clients so that we can participate both in the flow side of that activity as well as the structure.

I think Christian mentioned securitization and reduction in software lending potentially resulting also in some RB reduction. Could you perhaps quantify that? The second question is on the corporate bank. Obviously, the loan book declined about 4% quarter-on-quarter. I know sold down is intentional and coming from risk management and perhaps some impact of some current lending. But I'm just wondering to what extent do you see future demand?

And then 9 basis points for Numis, 12 basis points for the capital return. The other moving parts are organic capital generation and how much we use in terms of balance sheet growth, that should produce a year-end ratio probably higher than our original guidance for the year. So we'd like to -- we'd probably be closer to or further into the 13s, let's say, than just the 200 basis points margin to MDA, which would be $13.2 million. Within that, we do have embedded some assumptions about what additional support we can get from securitizations, optimization and other of the capital measures. Look, we -- I think if we outperform those assumptions or our own execution sort of path, that puts us in an even better position going into both for distribution and for the Basel III build.

Some of the lower loan growth or even decline is intentionally, by the way, not only from a risk management point of view because we have actually a very conservative and long-standing risk appetite, and therefore, we don't need to do so many adjustments in between. But of course, also we have sub hurdle relationships where we -- and we said that in April, where we want to go for an even better and more focused risk return strategy, and that's what we are doing. So that is one part. And secondly, yes, I think in particular, in Europe but also in Germany, you see that mid-cap companies, family-owned companies that you see a softening in loan growth and the reduction in demand for the time being, in particular, when it comes to long-term investments. To be honest, I don't think that this is something which is continuing for a very long period. But I would say that those companies would like to see where the next 6 to 12 months are going. And therefore, I would say this rather soft loan growth is something which we will see in the second half of '23, which is part of our planning and also which goes into the first half year of 24%. Nevertheless, and therefore, again, it is so important that we build the corporate bank on various engines. And the other engines are the fee income, our cash management mandates. The card business I was just talking about before. And that actually gives us all the confidence that even with the softening demand, which in my view is only temporary and will come back we can actually compensate that with fee business, and that is the reason why we invested into that so much.",

A, I really do believe, and I said it again and again, but the resilience of the family-owned companies and the mid-cap companies in Germany is bigger than a lot of people think. If I think about how they actually improved from the 2008 global financial crisis, if you think about how they actually increased capital, how they improve their working capital systems, their liquidity. This is a completely different picture than it was 15 years ago. And I'm saying it because they go with a different buffer into the situation which we have right now. And that's also what we are seeing not only in our portfolio. But if you actually look at the overall statistics, there is no such thing like a material deterioration in the credit worthiness of the German mid-cap companies. Now what is then specifically on us, and I do believe even go further back to Deutsche Bank's history in 2002 and 2003 when we actually had too many credit losses in that area. We completely changed the way we are managing credit risk also for medium and family-owned corporates when it comes to concentration risk when it comes to differentiating between, sort of, say, winners and potential companies which are more challenged in certain industries, we have a clear industry view and not only the specific company view. And by that, I think our risk management to the individual review of corporate is simply a superior one. And I personally just went last week through the -- for instance, the OEM suppliers in Germany. If I look at the portfolio, how diversified we are from a rating point of view, from a concentration risk point of view, i.e., that there are no big concentration risk. If we have larger risk, it's actually with investment-grade companies, who are actually themselves diversified globally in their business, then I do believe that there may be a little bit of deterioration in that portfolio, but I can't see that we are coming into a situation where I would see a material deterioration of our mid-cap portfolio. So looking at their own resilience and the way we have risk managed that, I'm confident that, obviously, our portfolio is in good health. James?",

    "text": "Well, good morning, and thank you, Nico, for your question. Let me take the first part and then I hand over to James. Look, let me start that this is a very important and I think very good day for Deutsche Bank, because I think what we show now also on the capital side is nothing else than further evidence that our long-term strategy and obviously, the diligent execution around it is paying off more and more and obviously more to come. To your capital distribution question and how we did arrive, yes, it's a good day for shareholders, with material progress on our capital measures and scope to freeing up additional capital of the mentioned €3 billion from now through 2025. And as both James and I said in our prepared remarks, we see the outlook improvements regarding capital efficiency and Basel IV is providing us with the opportunity to both accelerate and expand our distribution right path. Amongst other things, it gives us the confidence to go beyond our earlier expectations In terms of buyback potential already next year. The better than expected third quarter RWA optimization and the improved outlook are both relatively recent changes and hence and hope you understand that it is a bit too early to provide exact details of how and when, we will be in a position to accelerate exactly this distribution path. And Nico, as you would expect, we are obviously in discussions with our supervisor on the revised capital plan. As we have laid down though a very clear path for dividends, i.e., a 50% increase per year the next two years. Extra distributions would come in form of share buybacks and subject to further dialogue with our supervisors. We would expect a significant proportion of the incremental capital to be distributed to our shareholders. And for instance, one way to think about this trajectory, Nico, from here is that it gives us the opportunity to move to a 50% payout ratio sooner than we initially expected. So I think at this point, we can safely say that shareholder distributions is a key priority for Deutsche Bank and for more details, I hand over to James.",

    "text": "Sure. Thank you, Christian, and Nicolas, thank you for the question. So to give you a little bit of color on what is the optimization been that we've accomplished so far. You've seen us do three securitizations over the past couple of quarters including one on the Italian consumer portfolio in this quarter, and so that's been sort of quicker and more effective than we might have expected. And then when we talk about data and process improvements, the data is quite powerful, and by the way, this is where also we're getting the Postbank portfolio onto the same systems as DB is helpful, because we're able to apply, for example, SME support factors, infra support factors on the portfolio, in a way that we couldn't in the prior landscape. So it's enhancing the data, enhancing the way that our portfolio, if you like interacts with the rules. We think there's still a distance to go with that. And although we've worked on it for years, as rules change, one always finds additional optimization measures, so that's been very encouraging. If I think about, your question about input, output put floors on Basel III, we've really been focused on the 1125 impact and, as you've seen, dramatic improvement based on better visibility into the FRTB models as we mentioned. At this point, the output floor is still some years away, so I think of that as biting maybe in 2030. If you want guidance, we would probably stick with the 30 billion impact, at that point, but to be fair, we haven't really done this next round of mitigation in terms of portfolio shifts and what have you, so that's still a long way out. Hopefully, that helps, Nicolas, on your questions.",

    "text": "Look, let me start on briefly again on the capital question. And again, I think it's good order to discuss all the details with our regulator first. But I think you're right, the 50% dividend pass, we always said, and we also said that this is quite a good guidance for our past guidance on the share buybacks. So in this regard, I think you have a good assumption. And as I just said, I think with the scope now of the additional 3 billion. Obviously, we would like and we intend then to start increasing the share buyback already in 2024, beyond that what we already communicated in our previous correspondence. So clearly an acceleration and expansion that's our goal and that will focus now -- this is our focus in our discussions with the regulators going forward. With regard to the revenues, I will hand over to James for more details in particular when it comes to NII. But also here I think very good messages because the clear jump off point for 2024 is now the 29 billion in 2023. You have seen a good development in the third quarter. Again, a very stable development also by the way on the NII side in both Corporate Bank and Private Bank, We see that momentum going forward into Q4 and therefore there is a high confidence in delivering 29 billion number for the full year 2023. On top of that, and I think we refer to that in our previous calls already. The geopolitical environment, the economic environment is something where at the end of the day, the advice which is asked by the clients, on the private banking side, on the corporate banking side, also with regard to our investment banking services is increasing and increasing. And therefore, we also said in our prepared remarks a 40% increase in mandated deals from the corporates in these first nine months of 2023 versus the same time period of 2022 is just one signal how much we are actually and see the momentum with our corporate clients around the world to think about how to best position in these geopolitical situations where we are. And hence, in particular also the investments which we are doing on the corporate side, in the investment banking on the advisory side, the investments which we have done on the wealth management side, now the finalization of the Numis transaction will grow also the non-NII business in 2024 a lot. And therefore, seeing the stability actually also in the NII business in 2023 plus the growth we see from the advisory, our clear goal is to show a 2024 revenue number of 30 billion. Regarding the composition, James will outline further but we can see a momentum which is simply unbroken.",

    "text": "So, Adam couple of things on your comments, well let me start with the comment that our group NII number is a very noisy line and we've talked about it before the impact of the FX swap book and therefore the rate differential between euros and dollars plays a role here as does hedging results and other parts of the treasury piece, which is why it's actually I think more instructive to look at the net interest income and the margins of the businesses especially PB and CB. Now, there we show you margins that were actually reasonably stable quarter-on-quarter, some pressure in PB and CB rather. But interestingly this quarter the principal drivers were not the deposit margins. There was again noisy even at that level around mortgage hedging for example in the private bank, you know the excess of deposits over loans impacting the margin in the Corporate Bank, so things outside of the deposit margins. That difference was about 130 million if you take the two businesses together. We think Q4 will be about the same level, so flat to that. Really as deposit margins come in a little bit, but some of this other noise kind of clears through the system. So as Christian says, we feel good about the trajectory looking forward one even two quarters in those two businesses. And that of support, of course, supports our view going into to 2024. I think the other thing just briefly you mentioned on the timing of the buyback and distribution announcements, it's a fair point. It would take a lot of pressure off of us and the supervisors to do this more frequently and let's see is the short version. We want to -- the nice thing is if you split it out over the year, you can be a little bit more dynamic to the market environment and conditions. On the other hand, I think to some degree shareholders have sought the greatest degree of confidence as early as possible. So we're going to need to balance those two things but I could certainly envisage multiple requests in the year going forward.",

Could you give us a sense of the size of the inflation headwinds you were able to offset and underlying costs in the quarter and maybe also where you'd expect to end the year given the Q4 one offs you flagged and how that sets the business up heading into 2024? And then secondly, maybe looking a bit further out to 2025, obviously, the revenue momentum is working out in your favor as you just discussed, but there's also still a disconnect between your targets on cost to income ratio and return on tangible equity for 2025 and the latest consensus.

    "text": "Yes. Potentially, I start on your second part and obviously James shall add. Look on the difference in the 2025 targets I think it comes from both sides. Number one, a further increasing revenue line James just outlined, the 2024 pass, our confidence in the 30 billion in 2024. And obviously, we see that momentum also going then into the next year in 2025. And in particular in 2025 as we always said before, we have another NII tailwind actually in the private bank, which is not to be underestimated. So therefore, on the revenue side, Chris, further growth to be seen clearly. On the cost side, I'm really confident, because you know that we have given the goal of 2.5 billion, 2 billion already with our IDD in 2022. These 2 billion is actually based on our so-called key deliverables, i.e., the Germany optimization, the front to back, the technology architecture, the infrastructure efficiencies, real estate savings and so on. And there we really have a high confidence to deliver these 2 billion based on all the structural work which we have done over the last the 18 months since the IDD and we can see progress every quarter. On the remaining 500 million, obviously we are working diligently but also there good progress. We discussed with you the reduction in force program in April. We have actioned on that. We have 900 reduction delivering more than 100 million of annualized savings now from now on starting. James said it this morning rightly so. We have additional measures, which are now in execution and in flight that we further reduce our workforce. By the way, also with regard to the overall remediation which we have seen over the last years, we can see now that we think we have seen the peak in our workforce and we will further reduce. And this, if you want to mention it reduction in force 2.0 will be from a size and number bigger than the reduction we have seen in April 1.0. So that is the next part. And in line with our goal of achieving these additional 500 million, obviously, we are doing other things like third-party spending whether it's consulting marketing spending, which will save us a meaningful number also in 2024 versus 2023. We are obviously also with the peak in workforce which we have seen. We are obviously very selective and cautious also when it comes to new hirings. And in this regard, we have very good side on the 2.5 billion. That with the growing revenue number, which I just outlined. We are in full confidence that we can achieve the 10% or what we always wanted to do and where we still stand by to actually exceed the 10% RoTE in 2025.",

    "text": "So Chris just on your inflation question and perhaps a little bit more on the targets. So inflation, it depends very much on what you're looking at. Compensation costs, elements of non-compensation for example software, there can be quite varied impacts. But I would say we're facing across the world, probably 4% to 5% inflation on average in both comp and non-comp costs that we need to work to offset. So far, I think we've been quite successful, in both line items. You need to work very hard on workforce composition. As Christian outlined, we've got a lot of measures underway there whether it's internalization, location strategy or just managing with discipline across the Company. And then on the non-comp, you've really got to focus on demand. And that's where I think that, passing some of the what I'll call the inflection points that we've been passing whether that's you know technology implementations, whether that's, control investment remediation, it does give us more flexibility to manage the demand side there. And so that gives us some comfort. If I think to run rates which I think was embedded in the second part of your question. We've talked over the course of the year about run rates, maybe made it too complex for you, but we're trying to manage in that 4.95 billion to let's say, 5 billion per quarter in adjusted cost range. We've had some pressure this year not just in inflation which I think we've been successful offsetting but also some of the investments that we've been making. In the fourth quarter, we may have some additional sort of unexpected costs associated with Postbank remediation that may push us up closer to or perhaps slightly above the 5 billion level in Q4 with all of that baked in including the additional Numis costs. I think we've talked about 4.975 billion back in July. But overall, a continued sort of evidence of I think discipline and control across the Company. That would represent a good step off also into 2024, whereas you know the goal that we have and Christian just outlined is to continue to crystallize these cost savings measures in order to manage overall flat notwithstanding inflation and investments.",

Obviously, we want to work hard to put these issues behind us and sort of pivot to a very different customer experience and that's the focus of the management team there. You've seen, a cost of provisioning cost impact in Q3 that could also extend into Q4, but ultimately, we would expect to get that back as really we get back on track in terms of the collections activity where there's been some diversion of the operational staff. So call it zero or close to zero in those two lines when all is said done. On expenses, it's probably been in the high-single-digits in Q3, in terms of the remediation costs and if you kind of look to that in Q4, somewhere between 30 million to 35 million of incremental spend on the remediation, but we would expect that to tail off relatively quickly in 2024 as we put the operational issues behind us. And frankly invest in automation and improved capabilities going forward, so we feel it'll be a temporary impact. As it relates to sort of crystallizing the long-term benefits of the unity project, no change there, we're at work in app decommissioning and the various elements of the project that, particularly on the technology side, we're going to drive, the benefits, too early to make any comments on fines, frankly. We're working very closely with the BaFin, collaboratively with them and the monitor, and I think our interests are very well aligned that we want to put the backlog behind us and cease any disruption to our clients. On the liquidity and funding costs, it's interesting. I mentioned earlier that it's this excess of liabilities over assets in the corporate bank that can sometimes be a drag. The interesting sort of corollary there is we haven't yet seen a benefit in the NIM of loan growth. And so for the Corporate Bank in particular and then at the group level, we would benefit from putting the deposits to use. We're looking forward and believe that we should start to get some momentum in terms of loan growth going forward, and hence that imbalance can begin to help us. As it relates to TLTRO, you've seen that you've prefunded some of the maturities, the December maturities, and so TLTRO is becoming a less and less impactful, sort of part of our overall balance sheet and funding profile. Yes, there's a little bit of a drag going into 24% coming in that, but that, at this point is in sort of low very low double digits per quarter in the coming several quarters.",

The first one, I want to go back to the 3 billion potential additional capital freed up in the next two years as a result of Basel IV and an RWA reduction. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense to what extent do you expect actually to deploy some of that additional capital into the business organically or perhaps inorganically? And if so, what are the areas where you see perhaps and clear opportunities for that redeployment, and mindful that you mentioned that significant proportion is obviously for distribution? So that's the first question. And the second question is on the Corporate Bank. And I just wanted to pick up on the comment from you James on so far you haven't put those additional deposits into work. Yet we're seeing a very small uptick in loans in the corporate bank. So, the combination of the two suggests perhaps you have somewhat of a better outlook in terms of deployment and new lending, if you could just share your thoughts on that? Thank you.",

    "text": "Yes, Mate, thank you very much for the question, and it's a great question. We've spent some time looking at this actually, and I want to give you a little bit of sort of color looking at the last seven quarters of where the capital has gone. So on average, we've generated about 27 basis points of capital, each quarter over the last year and change, and this is what's interesting. About a third of that has gone to support the distributions that we've been making so far, the 1.75 billion. About a third has gone into the regulatory changes, and about a third has gone into the ratio improvement up to now close to 14%. Almost none has gone into the business so far, and one of the reasons we think this sort of inflection point is so important is, first of all, we think we can step up the profitability, so the 27 basis points doesn't, by any means, have to be the cap in terms of what we can generate. But I think there is scope to increase the business deployment beyond, where what we've been doing the past couple of years especially as that reg build falls away, and we're at a ratio level now that is entirely comfortable for us in terms of buffers. So, there is capacity both for business deployment and for significant, distribution increases. Now to your point about Corporate Bank, yes, revenue loan growth in the past year and change has been quite slow across both businesses. And we'd like to think that there's, again, some signs of life. You mentioned a small increase, about 1 billion in the quarter in loans in the Corporate Bank. We've been waiting for that to come. We'd like to see it, and we think we may see it already in the fourth quarter, but then extending into 2024. And with our loan to deposit ratio now again below 80%, we have the capacity to support loan growth both from a capital and from a funding perspective. So we do think, we're turning the corner in terms of the ability to redeploy in both of those senses. In private bank, perhaps a little bit more sluggish. As you know, we've made a decision, not to kind of, emphasize mortgage lending, in Germany both given the market environment and given capital requirements, but we think we have capacity to grow margin lending in wealth management as that comes back to grow unsecured consumer lending. So that may take a little bit longer to come back, but also in that business, there's potential to grow loans to redeploy capital. Lastly, and this came up in a recent conference, we are careful in how we manage the capital that's committed to the investment bank, so those are portfolios that while there is opportunity to grow within our risk appetite. We are careful to manage the capital to that business, devoted to that business within constraints that we set. And so while we think there are attractive lending, opportunities there, we're going to be cautious about growing especially in an environment where there is still some uncertainty in the in credit environment. So look, short version is real capacity now for deployment in the businesses while we're in a very different, environment in terms of distribution potential.",

    "text": "So, Stuart, it's James. You were cutting in and out a little bit, but I'll go with what I believe the questions were and you may need to follow-up. On RWA optimization, to be honest, so are we surprised, we've been, I'd like to think at the more sophisticated end of this type of balance sheet management over the years and to find more opportunity, is on the one hand encouraging, on the other hand you know suggest that there was something left on the table in the past. Now the securitization piece is a step change and what we're looking at and willing to do. But we've, as we've talked about before, we still like the economics of securitization. So we would estimate for example that the revenue to RWA relationship of the securitization we did this quarter was about 1.5% maybe 1.6% and so we can redeploy that capital at better, sort of equity margins call it than that. So there is still more to do. And as I mentioned earlier, you know, as the data environment improves more and more, we see scope to continue optimization. Of course, Basel III is entirely new, so the work on the models there, the visibility into the impact of hedging strategies that's also new. So it's a bit of an ongoing story. The redeployment I talked about a moment ago really to Mate's question. Again, there is scope to support growth in the businesses, but frankly the extra capital that we now have doesn't really change the growth potential of the businesses, and won't change our risk appetite. As you know, we've been disciplined about risk appetite. And we also intend to be different disciplined around capital allocation as I mentioned earlier, especially recognizing that that's a focus of attention around the investment bank. And finally, on the leverage balance sheet, we see them as sort of moving a little bit in tandem. So as our CET1 ratio goes up, so too is the leverage ratio. And while there's a bit more flexibility in managing the leverage balance sheet, we think we can very comfortably remain in the mid to high 4s, over time and if you like optimize the revenue footprint of that leverage balance sheet. So, hopefully, those answered your questions even though there was a little bit of signal challenge.",

If we take this year, it looks like your FIC revenues could land around the 8 billion mark with consensus expecting something similar over the next couple of years. But this is 2.5 billion higher than what we saw in 2018 and '19, and I appreciate the rent environment is very different. There's been a bit of balance sheet growth there as well. So what makes you confident that the 8 billion is sustainable given a pretty well documented normalization of the wider industry?

    "text": "Let me start. Look, what makes me confident on the fixed side that this kind of 2.5 billion higher than three or four years ago is something sustainable. It's 3, 4 points, but number one, the healing of the bank. I mean this is the most important if you talk to our institutional clients, but also to the corporate clients. And I cannot even tell you -- and that was our focus, the transformation, the healing and with that obviously the rating upgrades which we have received from all the major rating agencies. That resulted in a completely different way how we can deal with our clients and that a lot of clients actually return to Deutsche Bank. And to be honest, we are still in the documentations of clients who have returned after the last increase and improvement of the rating agencies because you know how long it takes to get the documentation is the agreements, right? And in this regard, I can still see the benefits from that. So the healing of the bank is one of the key reasons. Number two, I think it's the focus which we have given ourselves, and in particular, Ram has done in the FIC business, in the trading business. It was exactly right to focus on that, where we are strong from a regional point of view starting with Europe, then obviously going into our emerging markets franchise also covering Asia, but also investing very focused in the U.S. And Ram has a clear plan how to grow also our FIC business in the U.S. over the next 12 to 18 months, and he put the right investments into that. Number three, it's the front-to-end reengineering of our processes in FIC. Also that is obviously which is not only making us more efficient, but at the end of the day, front-to-end always results in one thing. This is client experience for our clients. And with that, obviously, we make ourselves more attractive to deal with us. So, I think it's the overall healing of the bank but also the real focus and reengineering of the platform Ram has done to the FIC business, which makes me comfortable that the €8 billion which we have seen so far is a very good number to actually plan for the future and, in my view, if I look at his plan to even increase from there. Nevertheless, always said, we even want to make the investment banking business more balanced and therefore the investments into the O&A businesses. And also in the prepared remarks, we said how stable actually within the FIC business the financing part is. It's 35% of the FIC business. And that is coming through year by year, I think, with a very good and solid underwriting scheme. Regarding government taxes, look, it's always hard for me to judge what is coming. But on this end in Germany, on this side in Germany, I'm very calm. We have clear statements that these kind of excess taxes, I think, is not supported, in particular not by our finance minister. There is really no active discussion on this one. And therefore, it is for me a non-topic.",

It doesn't seem like you're prepared to increase the €8 billion overall capital return envelope, but it does seem that you're more confident on reaching that 50% payout sooner rather than later. Is that the best way to think about it? So that €3 billion capital, that's being released as it were. That doesn't really become additive to the €8 billion? And then with that, if you look at your actions to optimize capital and RWAs, I guess that reduces risk weight density. And is that the way you see it? And so that being the case, maybe your guidance on the output floor there. Your comments earlier are that we should maybe stick to the €30 billion RWA impact there. And just very lastly, on the Corporate Bank NII, it does seem like the largest impact there is from the increase in liquidity reserve costs. What's your expectation there for how that should develop going forward, please?",

    "text": "So Andrew, the answer to the first question is no, that's not the correct way to think about it. So think about it this way. We had a capital commitment to shareholders of €8 billion at a point in time where our outlook and our step off were weaker than they are today. What we're not able or willing to say at this point is how much of that increment is going to come out to shareholders and how soon. We obviously owe you an answer on that in time, and we'll work through that internally in our capital planning and then with supervisors. But no, we would see it as incremental to the €8 billion. In terms of optimization, it's complex just because at a point in time, we're going to need to optimize around the output floor. That's not something that we've really done. Ironically, the impetus there would be to take on higher-risk density assets and so sort of optimize in that way. And actually, it goes a little bit also to Stuart's question. The -- what regulation asks you to do now is run this complex optimization algorithm across all of those resources in time. So, it's advanced approaches RWA, it will be standardized approaches RWA and then the leveraged balance sheet, And we're going to need to find the optimal use of the balance sheet under all three of those tests. In the case of the standardized, we have until 2030 when we think the out floor bites. I wouldn't expect -- just on the CB NII piece, I wouldn't expect that to change sequentially in the next couple of quarters. Again, a little bit depending on whether -- on how the loan and deposit sort of trajectory for the business go from here. We'd like to think we can continue to grow deposits and grow the loan balances, but it's the relationship between the two that really drives the question of the liquidity funding in the CB business.",

    "text": "Well, look, we've about this over the years, the P&L sensitivity, and I'd like to think. In fact, I'm confident that both sides of that equation have improved over the last several years. So start with the revenue side, as our revenue mix has shifted over time, I think our revenue sensitivity has declined dramatically, and not just because more of the revenues are coming from the businesses that we describe as more stable, but also because the revenue composition in the Investment Bank, I think has firmed up as well and our market position as Christian has outlined. So, I think that revenue sensitivity is lower than you might think, and by the way you also see us take relatively conservative decisions whether that's about risk type or on our interest rate risk management. So we manage that, it's not just an accident. And then on the cost side I have said over the years that that less is of the cost base is variable than I would like it to be. I think that equation is also changing for the better. Let's start with just the investment profile. As we shift from, I'll call them non-discretionary investments, investments that needed to be made in technology and in controls to a more discretionary profile, we can hit the brakes on those investments. And the other thing is that as we get deeper and deeper into the structural cost saves that Christian outlined, more of the cost base ends up being variable, and that can be variable compensation, but it can also be other elements of the cost base. So, the short version I think we're improving both aspects of that equation Kian relative to where we were a few years ago. On the cost of risk just in the detail there we had €100 million net on the Stage 1 and 2. Actually what that was a €100 million model benefit associated with the PD LGDs in the new wholesale and retail models plus about €30 million of FLI, forward looking indicator benefits, offset by about €30 million of in Stage 1 and 2 of portfolio changes, including sort of internal ratings and that sort of thing. Now why did the FLI improve? The point in time is always hard to remember, but the last time we booked this on a quarterly basis was in July where the outlook for the soft landing particularly in the U.S. was actually less optimistic than it became through the third quarter, so what you're seeing is a bit of a lag effect as to where things stood at that time.",

They benefit hugely from the resilience. I think I said it in one of the previous calls if I compare the situation of German Mittelstands clients with 15 years ago, we have a capital ratio, we have a liquidity ratio, liquidity position of those clients which is in much better shape than 15 years ago after the global financial crisis, they all worked on themselves. So, I think despite the no growth situation in Germany, we can really attest a very resilient portfolio. And hopefully with growth coming back in '24, albeit very low growth in '24, we then will also to see that there is obviously growth coming back into those slides.

First of all, I do believe that it's most important for our credibility that we achieve those cost targets which we have given to the market and we will do so. That's therefore, I ran you through the structural cost savings and that what we now put on top actually in order to get to the 2.5 billion. Secondly, of course, if this would happen, you have three or four layers, of course, where we can very quickly reduce the spending. That is the variable comp which means -- with regard to investments. Obviously, we are reviewing those investments on a quarterly basis. Also adhering, obviously, to the profile on the business side and whether the performance is the right one. I think we have a very good monitoring in place on this one. Secondly, yes, there is always the flexibility on the variable comp, which we obviously would adjust to the performance -- to the revenue performance. I think we have also shown that in the past that we are able to do this, and we will do this. So this is obviously, if you look at our variable comp, that is not an insignificant number, which we could reduce like for the CTB, i.e., change the bank investment. And then you have those items where Rebecca is going actively after already now but which also plays into this one, which is everything on third-party costs, which means also consultancy, which means marketing. And easily in this regard from a flexibility point of view, Kian, you are in a very high 3-digit million number. And in this regard, I would say this bank has clearly the ability to react.

On the DTA, I would expect and here it's a different geography from last year, where the DTA related to the U.S. I would size it today at about 5 million of opportunity in the tax line, potentially larger. It all depends on our forward-looking view of profitability in the UK entities and jurisdiction going forward. That's to the positive. The Numis goodwill, it's too early to give an exact number given we're going through the purchase price allocation process sort of as we speak. But to give you a ballpark, I would expect us to book about €250 million in -- as a non-operating cost around that Numis goodwill. The numbers that I can't really guide you on today would be, one, the restitution payment to the upside. And then as you all know, restructuring and severance and legal litigation items are always subject to some uncertainty. And so as we get more visibility, if we get an opportunity, we'll give you an update on that. I'd like to think the net of those four things is biased to the positive, but we have to wait and see how it all plays out.",

If I compare your level of provisioning, especially on the U.S. side with what U.S. banks have been seeing so far this quarter, it seems like you have -- your provisions are lower. I was wondering what gives you the confidence of these passively lower provisions in these markets specifically, especially for U.S. office, which seems particularly challenged? And then on Numis, I know it's early days. The acquisition closed 13th of October, I believe. But I was wondering if you have any early thoughts that you would like to share now that this is part of Deutsche Bank. And then a quick technical one. DTAs, with all these DTAs being written back, what's the benefit for the tax rate in the coming years?",

    "text": "Thanks, Julia. So I'll try to -- well, starting with CRE, it's just hard to say because we have no insight into our competitors' portfolios. And so we can tell you what we think of ours. And as we've said sort of consistently from the start of this cycle, we think we have a high-quality portfolio. It's -- to the extent it's concentrated -- obviously, there's an office exposure, but it's concentrated in Class A strong sponsors and what have you. And what we -- but we're happy to share this time in the appendix material is, frankly, the experience that we've had. So now we're sort of four, five quarters into this cycle in commercial real estate. And we think that the relationship between the loan modifications and the expected credit losses that arise from that speak to the quality of the portfolio. Now that, we're, call it, halfway through that. But you can see that if trends continue or even deteriorate a little bit, this should be an entirely manageable situation for that. Coverage is hard to measure on a comparative basis. But we think we're taking provisions and collateral allowance and collateral together. We think we're sort of reasonably in line with the peers. On Numis, we're very excited about the transaction. I mean, the first few days and the process with the Deutsche Numis organization have been very successful. Both the Deutsche U.K. corporate finance team going into Numis and the relationship with the Numis leadership and staff is off to a great start, and the client feedback has been extremely positive ever since the announcement. So, it's early days in terms of revenue production, if you like, but we're very encouraged by what we see so far. Ultimately, on the DTA, it doesn't really affect the tax rate. So you should expect us to advise an effective tax rate continuing to be in the sort of 29% to 30% range, going forward, always a little bit of variation in that. But the DTAs are one-off. And I would think of it as complete, if you like, this year when we revalue the U.K. tax characteristics.",

So I mean, when should we expect to see those costs coming out? So would that be more in the second half of '24 or into '25? Or could it be sooner? And then secondly, just related to that, I mean, if costs proved to be a bit more sticky, are you seeing potential distribution of the RWA efficiency savings as the other or another lever to help get to that 10% RoTE target or above? Or are these kind of just two very independent things? And then just one follow-up, I guess you just mentioned, obviously, on PB, the revenue tailwind in 2025.

    "text": "Sure. Thanks, Amit. Look, actually, the middle part of your question is a really good one. The RWA and the RoTE are, in fact, linked. And ironically, you start to have denominator problem and, therefore, a strong incentive to distribute capital in order not to have the RoTE dragged down by higher tangible equity. In fact, you're seeing that already this year. The biggest part of the RoTE decline in the third quarter versus last year was just higher capital. The tax rate played a big impact as well. But leaving that aside, it's higher capital. So we are incentivized to push out capital. If I think about the exit rate, yes, the 5% is a little higher than we'd like it to be. And to your point, to get to a full year number of adjusted costs in line with this year, we would need to start bringing it down in the second half. But look, if we're traveling in the 4.9 to 5 area next year in each of the four quarters, we think we're doing okay. And we will -- to Kian's earlier question, we think we've got more levers to help to drive that going forward. On the tailwind into '25, this is some distance ahead, but I would quantify it as €200 million to €300 million just from the deposit hedges kind of rolling over, so a nice tailwind for that business, for the PB business going forward.",

If I adjust that for the undershoot today, the extra savings, the Basel IV, it would come out more like €370 billion. Is that a fair expectation? Or is it likely to be higher than that with redeployment? So that's my first question. And then different numbers question on NII, you've talked a bit about deposit NII pressure in 4Q. If rates stay at this level and beta gets to its sort of medium-term resting place and also term assets re-price fully, what would we be subtracting and adding to NII? And I'm particularly focused on the Corporate Bank and the Private Bank.

    "text": "So Jeremy, on the RWA, I would -- in brief, I would anchor off of €380 billion rather than €370 billion. So, the walk was from, call it, €420 billion, which was the earlier consensus number for the end of '25, which we said was pretty close. We took that down to €405 billion with the €15 billion, and now the €10 billion and the €15 billion improvement should get you to about €480 billion. That doesn't account for the redeployment. So, we'll see if that number still holds, there may be more opportunity to redeploy than we had originally anticipated, which is why, it's early days in the capital plan. In terms of fully phased in, I'll be honest, I haven't thought about it in the -- in just the two deposit books. And as I say, there's a lot of noise in the NII number. But in round numbers, we've -- on a reported basis, we've held steady at 13.5. Some of -- most of the NII upside that we saw this year actually went into the noninterest revenue lines. if I look to a normalized level, you'd like to see it, frankly, at 13.5 or better, especially going into '25 and beyond given, in the answer to Amit's question, the uplift that you get in both businesses from the deposit hedges moving. So, whatever the dip is next year, hopefully small, we think that we're sort of currently traveling at a baseline that's a pretty good baseline to grow from into '25 and '26. And that's before all of the noninterest revenue upside that we see and that Christian went through in his earlier comments. So that underscores, if you like, the optimism we have for the revenues next year and beyond. And we don't see any reason why the compound annual growth rate target would actually step back significantly from here over the next two years. So a 3.5 to 4.5 is something that you'd like to -- I say, I think we can achieve from this point or even better.",

    "text": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everybody and thank you for your question. Let me start with the capital question and then James will take the cost question. Look let me go back to the Investor Day 2022 because I think it's important that – that we all understand the path which we have announced there, in particular also regard with the capital path and the €8 billion. Since then, since March 2022, we have consistently delivered on that what we have told you. And that is no different today. And our focus has always been on the execution of our strategy and the commitment actually on the one hand to focus on our clients. But, Chris, more and more what we have done in the management board of Deutsche Bank is actually to put the shareholders into the middle of focus what we are doing. Now with the investments which we have done, with the business how it develops, with the inflection point we see on regulatory remediation, taking the regulatory increases into our capital in and digesting it, we can clearly see that we are at the inflection point on our franchise, but in particular also when it comes to our capital position. And hence we can see that we have now the room to further step up. And that is then the result that we said already last year in October that we see based on the efficient capital management, the operating strengths of the business, the earnings profile, that we see €3 billion of incremental capital at our disposal. And, of course, it is our aim that a significant part of these €3 billion will be actually distributed to our shareholders. Again, also with the view that it's now the time that the shareholders go actually also into the center of what we are doing. Now what does it mean concretely? And also there, Chris, if we compare this year to last year, last year in the January earnings call, we did not actually talk about and had the approval for a share buyback. You see our confidence overall in the way the bank has done and on which way we are, and therefore we ask for the approval of the €675 million last year. We got the approval now. And that also means to your second question there on the way for 2024, in case, and I'm very confident just looking at January, in case our business performance runs as we forecasted in Q1, I think there is an opportunity and we should obviously aspire to go for a second approach this year. And that we already have the approval for the first one in January is I think a big difference to last year. Secondly, if I now look at the overall earnings capacity of the bank, how the revenues stack up, and also what James will tell you about the cost line, I really clearly can see that we can change the payout in terms of what we retain and what goes to the shareholders to a fifty-fifty. And it is clearly our goal that the 50% increase which we committed to in the last years, which we have done, is also something which we want to do going forward. Of course, subject to our earnings forecast, but again, we are highly confident. And that would mean, I mean, you mentioned the number, you know where the consensus is, that that obviously results in a number where I said, yes, I would like to actually go to consensus when it comes to share buybacks and capital distribution in total.",

    "text": "So, and Chris, it is James. On the expense side, look, Q4 was messy. We had advertised that there were some items that we were expecting. We obviously try to give you as much of a forward look as we can. But as you can see on Page 14, there was a bunch of things that sort of tumbled out that some of which caught us by surprise. I would say as a great example, the FDIC assessment, the way it was formulated and crafted, brought basically two years' worth of assessment into the one quarter. And if I go to another question that frequently comes up on these calls, what flexibility do we have to offset? While we think that ForEx flexibility is greater than it has been in the past, €50 million coming out of nowhere in late November, early December is not something you can really offset at that point in time. But your question is what comfort can we give you that the one-offs are coming to an end? I think our goal is to deliver a much cleaner, more predictable profile. And the last few years have been anything but that with transformation charges, obviously the bank levy that introduces volatility, some of the litigation items that have come at us that we hadn't expected to fall out the way they did. And while we can, you can never guarantee that there won't be new things coming up, if I look at the various risks and uncertainties that lie ahead, they're much fewer than lies behind us. And so I'd like to think that our path to normalization is close. There would be, I mean, if I look to 2024, we do expect some restructuring charges in 2024, perhaps €400 million, that's still an elevated level relative to what I would think of as normalized. And clearly our goal is that by 2025, we will have normalized in respect of both restructuring and severance and litigation. So one of the reasons our investment in non-financial risk is so critical in the control environments is, stop making ourselves vulnerable to those types of things. So we do think we're much closer to providing a normalized picture and also to having the levers in our hands to offset adverse developments better.",

    "text": "Thank you. Let me start, and then James will for sure add. Look, Kian, thanks for your question. I think on the trading revenues, we know it's obviously early days with January, but what are we doing? We are comparing it to last year. We are comparing it to our own plan. And we also look at the consistency actually of the day-to-day trading also with regard to our VAR. And it looks very healthy. It looks very kind of a consistent picture across the different sectors in the trading area. So it is broad based across the regions. And I would say one reason for the strong start is for sure that we have been investing and Ram has really built up the FIC business over the last five years, quarter-by-quarter. And of course, the latest rating upgrade by S&P also helps. I mean, these are all things which are then self fulfilling, so to say, you will remember my speeches that each rating upgrade also means that obviously clients are coming back, are doing different and more trades with us. We are changing the ISTAS [ph], all that is coming through. And therefore, we can see that, yes, January was good and nice and better than we expected. But I can see from the basis and foundation that in my view, this is a quite consistent trend. And I also expect. By the way, we said that 78% of the 2023 revenue year were recurring revenues, which is a pretty good picture. And therefore, I also expect, with all the investments we have done in the sort of say more stable business that we have a solid and strong start into January. On the fee income in the O&A. Yes, we expect a recovery in 2024. It is always very hard to say when exactly, but we have planned our investments last year in terms of the Numis acquisition, but also in terms of the hiring on the O&A side, with regard to a long-term development of the bank. We wanted to invest into our capital-light business and fortunately, we can now see the results of that. So also here, we can see a recovery in terms of mandates, a recovery in terms of market activities. And therefore, we do believe that we will see, compared to 2023, a nice uptick in the revenues. And the first results we have already seen also in January. But again, I know it's just the first 30 days of the year, but also they are very promising and that what we wanted to achieve is coming through. On the cost side, look, James just said it and he will give you more details, but, A, we have a full focus to Q4, showing you already in Q1 that we hit a €5 billion run rate in Q1. This has daily management, daily monitoring, weekly in the management board. And I'm very confident that we will achieve that number of around €5.0 billion in Q1. Now, why am I overall so confident on that? Because of that, what James said. I mean, if you take the €21.7 billion cost and we need to come to €20 billion, we will expect non-operating costs to decrease by around €700 million. We will again expect approximately a reduction of bank levies in the amount of €350 million to €400 million in 2024 versus 2023. That would bring us roughly to €20.5 billion. And now we are looking at that, what we are constantly managing with the front office, with the back offices, under Rebecca's leadership. And that means we expect that we have another €400 million net reduction from all what is still coming of our operational efficiency program. You know, the €2.5 billion of gross reductions, we have delivered savings, or expected savings of €1.3 billion, of which €900 million have been realized up to now. And the remainder comes from €600 million in Germany. In the optimization, Claudio is doing, in particular, on the business side, with all the rationalization, on the branch side, with all the investments which have been done into unity, and now we are getting the fruits out of this. We have on technology and infrastructure, another €700 million, which we will reduce application decommissioning and so on. And then you know that we are, for our core processes, we have invested a lot of money and we will do this also going forward in the front to back process redesign, where we think we will get another €300 million out. Now, against that, there is obviously some inflation, some business growth, but that makes us highly, highly confident that we can get the next €400 million to €500 million of operational efficiency net out. And that brings us to the €20 billion. The good thing is that is the long-term plan for 2024 and 2025. But if you see the bottom up plan for the first quarter, we will achieve the 5.0 on a rounded basis this quarter.",

In FIC, I would draw your attention to Page 47 of the analyst deck, where we tried to give you a little bit more color on how the FIC franchise performs on a daily basis. And relative to its VaR, and so it gives you a good kind of comparison as to what so far the quarter might look like compared to last year’s first quarter. I think the second thing to add the – in the corporate finance wallet, if you look at some of the external sort of providers of data on that marketplace, I think those providers would say that the will – that the wallet will grow sort of 15% to 20% this year, as Christian just outlined, that obviously still needs to happen, but we think the conditions are there. And as Christian just outlined through Numis and the other hires we’ve invested to participate in that. And then lastly on expenses, to give you a sense of what we would think is a significant – is a range of outcomes, 1% rather than 4% is that we have the discipline, and for us missing by 1% or €50 million would be a disappointment.

That would be by division and expectations by division, but also on the non-NII growth in terms of what you see in terms of fee momentum and beyond the – our NII piece, but also on loan growth as well, which clearly is baked into your NII assumptions. So some more color around revenue and revenue expectations on why we should be as bullish as you guys are with the great. And secondly, on cost and cost trajectory, you’re talking to €5 billion for Q1. Clearly the run rate for next year is going to be below that if you’re going to get to €20 billion.

    "text": "So I’ll – I can start. Christian, you may want to add. So on revenues, Adam, first of all, I – we provided the additional disclosure on net interest revenues or net interest income to try to sort of put that to one side. Hopefully, that’s helpful disclosure and indicates the relatively high degree of confidence we have on delivery against that, whether that’s by hedging out the remaining sort of curve or also indicating how conservative we think we’re being on, for example, beta assumptions and growth in volumes. But set that to one side and then that allows you to focus on the non-interest revenues. There to give you a sense, we think all of the businesses are poised to grow their revenues on non-interest side pretty considerably. When you just think of all the sources of non-interest revenues we have, I mean, start with a Corporate Bank, custody transactions, payments, the merchant acquiring business, the documentary custody business. We earn fees and across that business in lots of different ways that do cohere with the overall sort of performance and level of activity in the marketplace. In Asset Management and Private Bank, obviously the assets under management are the key driver and therefore our inflows are encouraging to us. It means our step off into 2024 is higher than the average considerably in both businesses that we ran at in 2023. And we also think in general investor behavior particularly in the international private bank wealth management business has been relatively muted. So we think there's growth opportunity as well. And that then leads you to the investment bank, we've talked about where we – what we see as a recovery in origination and advisory coupled with potentially market share expansion, given the investments that we've made. And that's encouraging to us. And we think there's also runway in FIC as we've continued to put investments in place across sort of, I won't call them, the adjacency. So within our footprint areas where we think we're underperforming our potential. And Ram and his team have been very deliberate executing on those investments. We think that also will provide a strong backdrop. In terms of – to give you orders of magnitude, obviously the origination advisory piece is the largest in terms of our expectations in absolute terms. But it's also the market in our view that has been most muted in the past couple of years. So there we think of it less as growth from a foundation rather than recovery. And that's something we see the preconditions as clearly in place for.",

Of course, we have already seen in the corporate bank on a monthly basis some kind of normalization on the NII, but that was always fully compensated already by fee income given our investments, which we have done. And we feel that this is also happening in 2024 given the mandates which we have won. You remember potentially that in October in the earnings call, we talked about the increase of one mandates with multinational corporates. Well, that is continuing and obviously this is helping us now a lot also to go against the NII normalization in the corporate bank. So it is actually a healthy – it’s a healthy distribution going forward. And if I then think from a starting point of view that we have, as James is just saying, €57 billion of additional assets under management in the private bank and in asset management. And what already that brings us at the start of the year, which we already sort of say captured, that makes us highly confident that we come to that number, which you just quoted, the €30 billion for 2024.",

It was basically €4.9 billion for much of the year and then it could crept up to €5 billion as we'd advertised. It did kind of go further than we expected, but we'd like to bring it back to €5 billion and if possible, below. What that depends on is strong execution of our initiatives, controlling, if you like, the throttling of investments so that we line them up with the crystallization of savings. And to Chris's point at the outset, the absence of surprises. But we feel like we've got the tools in our hands to achieve that and a lot of hard work lies ahead, but we've got a clear path. I do want to say as a proviso, all of that, one of the things we always found difficult in talking about absolute expense numbers is FX can move it around. So you have to keep that in mind.

    "text": "Thanks, Stuart. Look, the IB needs to be above 10% in 2025. Very simply, just it's a kind of law of averages that we have, and what gives us real comfort there is we've been going through some amount of transition as well in the mix of business, where as we shift to more capital light revenue sources, you should be able to see that a strong lift and the investment bank will also benefit from some of the cost saving initiatives that are there in their allocated expenses. So we think their path to that 10%, well above 10%, is reasonably clear. On U.S. CRE, actually, I don’t have a number to hand. We are continuing to work through, and I just want to make one distinction clear. There are maturities and extensions of loans and then modifications. And so we think there’s about €10 billion of either extension or maturity events to work through this year. Some of which will lead to modifications of various sorts and then applying the percentage that we show you of 4%, 4.5%, you’d expect some of that to obviously translate into credit loss provisions.

I would also like to mention that if you simply look at the market comparison of Deutsche Bank versus other peers and you look revenues over RWA, the investment bank is doing actually already an excellent job. So it’s now very much about the composition and the balance of revenues, which we are starting and started to address last year with our investments. And I can see that the O&A business is obviously coming back in 2024 and the infrastructure cost. So I think the investment bank on the top line versus RWA is actually already doing an excellent job.

    "text": "Sure. Nicolas, it’s James. Happy to take the questions. Unfortunately, as you know, we don’t give detailed information about what goes in and out of the litigation provisions. Your point is, it’s a large one and that is fair. I can’t say more, really. It’s a long standing provision that we’ve held and now taken the view there isn’t any more basis to retain it. On CRE, look, I could imagine that the next couple of quarters, Q1, Q2, could remain elevated, but I can also – and my own expectation is that it would begin to sort of ameliorate towards the second half of the year and into 2025. You shouldn’t be surprised if it were in line with 2023 as sort of a baseline expectation, and in an ideal world, it might be a little bit better than 2023. We will publish a revised stress scenario in our annual report. I’d say that’s probably deteriorated a little bit given the circumstances we see in the marketplace. And as you can see, cumulatively, we’re tracking closer to the level that we’d laid out in our Q2 and Q3 reporting. That said, and I think it’s important to say, as you think about our forward guidance, if you take out the €450 million across the various portfolios that we booked in commercial real estate in 2023 and take that out of the numbers, you can see a CLP level that is running actually in a relatively normalized range. And that’s in a year in which we actually incurred some losses, particularly in the Private Bank that went beyond what we would normally see in the Private Bank. You recall a couple of idiosyncratic cases in the first quarter and then in the third and fourth quarter some amount of, what I call, excess provisioning associated with the operational backlog issue. So we think that all gives us confidence that as this cycle in commercial real estate abates over the next six quarters, you should see a much more normalized credit loss provision emerge.",

Going back to the costs again, I hear a lot of conviction on €20 billion by 2025 underlying and one-offs reducing. So what is a sort of run rate for restructuring costs?

If I look to 2025, I think €400 million collectively for the two would be a reasonable kind of planning assumption, and we'd like to do better than that. Clearly, one of the things that we're working to do is put the remaining restructuring items behind us now in 2024, I've given you an estimate of what that looks like. And as I said earlier, one does looking at our litigation sort of portfolio, one does feel that it's changing in terms of kind of number and size of events.

    "text": "Sure. Jeremy, I think I got both of your questions, but feel free to follow up. Look, we would like to stick to the 50%. We think that's prudent and ideally not go beyond. By putting out the dividend guidance that we have, I think the indication is management is confident of its ability to grow earnings from here. If you think about 50% of our net income to common for 2023, that actually gives us still a fair amount of room against the €1.6 billion that we've talked about today. To your question about what is, if you like, disregarded in the ratio based on interim profit recognition, the answer is the €900 million, the 45 cents [ph] is disregarded in the December ratio, the €675 million is not removed from that. The €675 million we see as part of a discretionary program rather than the 50% payout ratio assumption, which in essence wasn't in place for 2020 – in respect of 2023. That €675 million would represent about 20 basis points. And so in the rounding, we'd be at 13.5, maybe 13.6 pro forma for that second buyback. In IB and CB costs, I do want to just remind that CB took the lion's share of the FDIC assessment, so there's noise this quarter on that, as well as last year in the fourth quarter, there was a – what I'll call a true up in the internal service cost allocation. So that's been a bigger feature in for CB than the others. And in IB, of course, we’ve – that's seen a fair amount of the investment in 2023, including, obviously, Numis in the fourth quarter. So noise in both. And as we strip away now in Q1, you should see what I'll call as a cleaner run rate in both of those businesses.",

    "text": "So I'll speak to the beta. Look, we sort of made a policy decision, if you like, not to talk about betas in specific terms externally. What we have seen, and I think we've talked about this before, our portfolios are quite varied. And by that I mean the deposit portfolio breaks out between private bank and corporate bank. And then in each of those businesses, really euros and dollars. And then, of course, there's a dynamic around what is site and what is term. So there's different sort of behaviors across those things. What we are thinking could happen is that with the expectation of the market now, that policy rates will start to go down, that the long-term interest rates have gone down. You may see a peak in terms of pass through, or we may have in fact seen a peak in terms of pass through, because now banks are reacting and our clients are reacting to a changed interest rate environment. And hence we could – can't say this was certainly, but we could be near a peak of the pass through associated with the rate increase cycle we've just been through. And now the question will flip to how sticky will customer rates be on the way down? So a completely different dynamic.  As I've said, our – and we said this in Q3, and I guess I'd reiterate this, our beta assumptions assume a continued convergence towards the models as though the trend was still upwards, although there's a possibility, as I say, that we've peaked and may run flat for a period of time before things start to move down. So an interesting dynamic around the betas. In terms of the split, I don't want to go into too much detail, but I would say relatively evenly split between private bank, corporate bank and the fixed income and currencies business. So producing, let's just say about half of the rise, if I would put it in rough terms and about the other half in O&A. And as I've mentioned, we see O&A as a recovery rather than a growth from a, kind of a steady state level and in that number you might see two-thirds of it be the market and a third be market share. But again, those are very rough estimates that we're sort of looking at in our planning. Lots of things can move, but I hope what you take away from that is how broad based the sources that we're looking at are. And as we've talked about, much of the revenue base becoming predictable around input drivers and output revenues that it produces alongside as we show you now a relatively predictable net interest income stream, including incidentally the breakout now of what we're calling the banking book businesses, which include the financing in FIC. So hopefully that's some good color on what we're seeing and is driving the raised guidance.",

    "text": "Hi, morning. Thanks for taking my question. So firstly, on that non-NII guidance that you've lifted, it does seem a large part of that is based on self help and investments, but I guess some part also based on market growth. So I guess my question here is what's your assumption for GDP growth backing your guidance here and in particular for Germany? And then my second question is back on your cost guidance you're guiding to €5 billion for 1Q and I guess about €20 billion for the year. But typically you've had about €5.3 billion, €5.4 billion for the 1Q and then a bit less than €5 billion for the remaining quarters to reflect the seasonality of stronger revenues in the first quarter. So just wondering how you're thinking about that now? What's happening with the seasonality through the year?",

    "text": "Yes. So, Andrew, thanks for the questions. So the bigger driver of the Q1 numbers has been the bank levy and we've had to go through the adjustment sort of hoops on that. And we think it was still to be finalized and determined, but we think that noise will be removed. And also, ironically we've had to book some bank levy in Q4 because of the way the dynamic works between the UK and the European bank levies. So in a sense brought forward some bank levy from 2024 into 2023. You're right that there is some seasonality, especially with variable compensation bookings, but on a relative basis to a big number like €5 billion, that is not a massive driver. But something we look at and manage carefully, given the importance of it to our business. On the assumptions of GDP growth, we just use a consensus view. And that consensus view obviously already reflects pretty muted GDP growth performance, especially in Germany. So zero, slightly negative, relatively muted in Europe, but in the United States and Asia, probably assumptions that right now are a little bit behind what the consensus views. To be fair, GDP isn't necessarily the main driver of the engines that we're talking about of the fee and commission income growth, I'd say it's more activity. And by activity I mean loan fees on trade finance, which has been relatively muted. I mean transactions in terms of issuance where we also in our Trust and Agency and Securities get business, get fees on custody and also transfer agency and the like. So it is activity levels that really are the driver and they cohere more just with corporate and household confidence than specifically GDP growth assumptions.",

    "text": "Thank you, and well-done on the results today. A couple of questions from my side. First, as a follow-up, you mentioned that the non-NII revenue growth could be perhaps coming maybe two-thirds from market growth and one-third from market share growth. Looking at this and the €32 billion implied revenue target by 2025, could you give us a sense what degree of flexibility do you see on the cost side? Should perhaps some disappointment happen? Maybe from the market growth side, what levers do you have to pull? Should there be a disappointment on revenues? Because clearly you are doing a lot to hit that €20 billion adjusted cost target. That’s the first question. The second one is on capital management and specifically M&A. I think we’ve heard you loud and clear that you’re focused on distribution mainly, but you’re also looking at perhaps accelerating growth in some areas and investing in the divisions. Do you see scope for perhaps bolt-on acquisitions along the lines of Numis here and there? And if that’s the case, where do you see opportunities? You can accelerate the organic growth and what would be your criteria? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you. Let me start with the last one. One cannot exclude that. And if there is an opportunity in one of our core businesses that we have an add-on acquisition, which makes sense from a content point of view, from a regional point of view, from a client point of view, and it fits into our culture, I wouldn’t exclude that. But it’s not the main focus of our strategy. And when we came to the previous questions and the headlines, I was referring to in particular the bigger M&A’s, which is not our priority. But if we would have an opportunity, I would always say we would potentially look at it. But again, we feel that with the existing platform we have, with the existing franchise we have, we are really on a good path to achieve the goals be it on the revenue side or on the cost side. I like your questions on the cost side with regard to the flexibility. Yes, we have clearly an ambitious road on the non-NII, but I can see already how in particular in the O&A business, our investments, both in Numis by the way, which is running really well, but also the hiring of the people, which we have done, is adding in terms of mandates and also revenues. Also when I look now at Q1, but clearly if it’s not coming, we have a dynamic process. And that dynamic process is that the business has to explain to the CFO, but also to me what they are doing if the revenues are not coming through. Now, to be very honest, we build it for the long term. And I think it’s the right decision for us to expand in that business. But clearly if revenues would lag, then obviously you have various levers, be it in that area also variable comp. We have other investments, which are part of our plan for those business, which we can reduce in this regard we would proactively, obviously countermeasure.",

First of all, the focus there was on origination advisory, and I may have inverted what I meant to say is two-thirds we think comes from market and one-third from market share growth. But again, those are estimates. I guess the one other thing just to point out on your capital question, Slide 17 of the deck, what we tried to indicate is in the last 25% block there of how we would apply the capital is sort of stuff. It is whatever we’re not able to offset of CRR3 through our capital management measures, then either ratio build more distribution would be built into that and also some leeway to pursue bolt-on acquisitions or have the capital impact of bolt-on acquisitions if we find the right opportunities. We’ve talked in the past what those opportunities typically look like, we’ve been clear that DWS, the asset management business, has been seeking opportunities and we would put capital to work there. We’ve looked at other opportunities over time. But I guess the thing to point to is just we would be disciplined about targeting investment opportunities that are, relatively speaking, capital light and strategically on point, as Numis was with our Global Hausbank strategy.",

Can you give us a little bit more of a split, how we should think about reaching this target by division in the context of the below €600 million NII adjustment this year. And then the second question is around cost. €20 billion of adjusted costs this year, stated €20 billion next year to get to your cost income target, there's a delta of around €600 million to €700 million.

    "text": "Thank you, Kian, and thank you for your question. Also thank you very much for the shout-out to Fabrizio and Ram. I don't have to do it any more and I even think that we took some market share from the U.S. banks, not only from the European banks, if I think about the performance in the Investment Bank. Look, to your first question, let me tackle that, and James will then go on with the second question and obviously, with further comments to question number one. Let me start actually on the journey in 2024 because it really builds up nicely then to the 2025 story. And it starts really with this good Q1, in my view, across all businesses. And if we now look how the business is progressing, then you can really see that the stable businesses, i.e., the corporate bank, the private bank and asset management that what we have seen in Q1 is actually a good number you can have in your mind also for the following quarters. And one item, which is positive for us, and James can give you some further details is that the NII is actually behaving even better than we thought and that what we have given you earlier this year. So in this regard, there is less headwind on the NII side. And on the fee-generating side, we are actually succeeding there where we wanted to succeed and where the investments are now paying off. You have seen the market share gain in the origination and advisory business. We gained market share by 70 basis points. We have shown a €500 million revenues in O&A this quarter. To be honest, it's a number which I would also see based on the mandates for Q2, always hard to then go for Q3 and Q4. But with the investments we have done in people but also in Numis, I think that, again, Q1 is a very good marker in the O&A business. We have done, as you said, a very good job in the FIC business. that is far more diversified, far more stable, far more robust. And with all the rating upgrades we have seen, obviously, it also helped to regain clients. And these are structural improvements where I would say this is, on the one hand, clearly supporting our market share gains, but also telling us that these kind of businesses and flow business we are doing there, is likely coming back also in the following quarters. So in a nutshell, if you take Q1 and you have the stability in the 3 business in Asset Management, Private Bank and Corporate Bank, potentially even with some upside in Asset Management. And you see the strong pipeline we have in the O&A business and also the market position we have regained in the FIC business I'm more than confident that we can achieve the €30 billion, just by adding up these 4 operating businesses based on the starting point we have right now. If I then go into 2025. The first comment is that there is the tailwind in -- on the NII side in the Private Bank. We have always talked about that. We have now for quarters and quarters, gathered assets under management like in Q1 in PB and in Asset Management. And that obviously is driving further revenues there. So the NII tailwind and the benefits from the assets under management growth is driving further the Private Banking revenues in '25 versus '24. Then in the Corporate Bank, actually, there is no NII headwind anymore in '25 versus '24, but we are benefiting from all the mandates which we are getting actually, not only here in Germany, but globally. You have seen in the script, actually, how also in Q1 versus Q1 last year, we actually increased our mandates, which we won with multinational corporates, and that is, again, a momentum, which I can see going forward. So a very stable revenue growth than in the Corporate Bank also next year. In the Investment Bank, to be honest, Kian, I absolutely further expect that we go to at least the 1% market share gain versus that what we had in 2022. We always said that with the investments, which we have done, we want to gain 1% market share. We have done 0.7% in Q1, but there is more to come. And I also do believe that in particular, in the O&A market, there is a further recovery. We can see the momentum in the M&A market, in the ECM market, it is starting, but it's not there where I can see the fee pool is in '25. And then obviously, when I go to the last point in the Asset Management also there, we will benefit, obviously, with the continuous inflow in assets under management. Looking at that, looking at how we have started now Q1, looking at actually the better-than-expected NII trail and that the investments which we have done are paying off. I'm not only confident in the €30 billion, but then obviously, with the build-out in '25 in the €32 billion.",

    "text": "So Kian, on expenses, we talk a lot about run rate, monthly quarterly run rates. We're obviously pleased that our focus on delivery achieved the €5 billion this quarter, we intend to continue that quarter after quarter over the course of this year and managed to an exit rate that puts us on track for our '25 numbers. A couple of moving parts. So first of all, bank levy, we probably expect to book about €50 million this year. That might be €150 million next year, but it depends very much on assumptions around what the SRB does growth rates in deposits and the like. Then there's the nonoperating costs. They've run high for the past several years, but we are -- we really think at the tail end of the work we need to do in terms of restructuring and severance, the litigation profile that we've talked about in the past. So I'd love to see that sort of in and around €300 million to €400 million in total next year, which would obviously imply a run -- an operating cost level in the high 19s. On a run rate basis, that means we need to be taking expenses down by, say, €50 million to €100 million per quarter next year to achieve our numbers. You asked about easy wins. This is all hard work and focus and attention execution. The starting point is really the delivery of the -- we talk about €1.4 billion of actions that are achieved but not yet in the run rate. The run rate reflects €1 billion. So there's €400 million to come that's already executed, which, in reality, makes your difference in terms of the quarterly run rate. So in essence, we just need to crystallize the existing items. In reality, we're going to have some inflation. We're going to have some additional investments that take place, and we then need to offset those with the remaining actions underway, the closing the gap between €1.4 billion and €2.5 billion, which is the total target. So the simple version of what's still to be done, it's still day-to-day execution on the glide path of those measures, whether that's branch closures, app decommissioning, headcount reductions, process simplification, front to back on data, all of the things that we've been talking about for some time now are on a glide path for delivery, and we're confident that we're set up to achieve the goals we laid out for this year and next.",

    "text": "Thanks, Anke. So look, the target that we've been working to is really a January 1 target with the Basel III impact reflected and a 200 basis point gap to MDA against that. So solve for 13.2% on January 1 with the €15 billion in it that we've talked about. And really what we have in the balance of the year is earnings, less additional stock buybacks and the impact of business growth, and then from a model methodology, all that stuff, think of that as neutral. We're working through that capital optimization to at least offset those pressures. Q1 is always a quarter where you'll see more burdens on the capital supply side. So I would not look at that as representative of the capital build that earnings can drive. And while Q1 is usually a high point in terms of organic capital generation, we've had a pretty good track record of generating sort of 25 to 30 basis points per quarter over the past several years. So that's sort of the walk that we would outline to you. On the loan losses, the -- we talk about sort of 3 things that are running high in the first quarter. Commercial real estate, which we expect to improve gradually over the year, the collections activity disruption that we expect to also correct and potentially see some recoveries in the second half and equally on the wealth management side. We've had a series of cases over the years where we hope as we move to work out, there may be recoveries there as well against an, I'll call it, underlying strong credit portfolio. So that reversion in the second half is one, but at least based on everything we see at the moment, we have good line of sight on. And so we need to, in essence, compensate for every basis point above 30 today, would need to compensate being below 30 in the second half, but we see the drivers that would drive us there. And lastly, commenting on part of your question, we've had a very deep dive into the commercial real estate portfolio over the last 4, 5, 6 months, sort of name by name and feel comfortable that with the provisions we took in Q1, we reflect the risks that we see in that portfolio. We have, as we mentioned, seen the firming in our portfolio that's visible in some of the market pricing indices and what have you. While that is, to some degree, rates sort of dependent, we do think that we're seeing a floor and are optimistic, at least based on what we see that, that will be preserved over the balance of the year.",

And hence, we are fully committed to the plans we have outlined to you, and that also means fully committed that we have a goal to actually distribute beyond the €8 billion, which we gave you earlier. Now with regard to timing, I think we are doing exactly that what we also said. We always said that we wanted to wait to Q1. We wanted to see that Q1 is running in line with our own plan that we show operating leverage, that we show further increasing revenues, that we have costs under control, exactly this has happened, and that gives us the confidence that we can now obviously also plan for the next steps and go into the discussions. But that is the discussion with the regulator. And that should be always respected. But as I said, we always said Q1 needs to be done. We are happy with Q1 and now we take the next steps.",

First one, just picking up on CRE again. the modified loan number that you show us, which I think is €10 billion here, that's been increasing from €8 billion and €6 billion over the last couple of quarters. Are you still happy with the nature of those modifications that these are healthy, constructive, they're not just extend and pretend. So is that process still okay as far as you're concerned? That's my first question. And then the second question, again, just kind of picking into the cost point. your adjusted cost ex bank levies were up about 2.5% year-on-year. Is that just noise? Or is that a source of pressure that causes you concern looking at the need to bring costs down as you've discussed. Is that increase year-on-year, any kind of concern to you?",

As we look at each individual property, we engaged in the discussion with the sponsors on refinancing. Often that includes terms, new equity, sometimes sort of concessions from the banks, and that's as it should be. I don't think of it as a giant extend and pretend process, but a healthy process of managing these assets through a cycle, you should expect the modifications to continue to rise. But if this is a cycle that as we think it is burning itself out, then the provision number as a percentage of that denominator should begin to decline along with the gradual reduction in CLPs on a quarterly basis. And so that's what we would expect to see going forward. A lot of work still lies ahead, but so far, behavior has been rational in light of valuations. On adjusted costs, that increase represents, if you like, the cumulative impact of the various investments we'd be making. We've talked about investments in controls. We've even talked about investments in technology also the front office investments we made last year and now the run rate impact of the Numis transaction as well fully in the quarter. So that increase is there. Is it concerning? No so far as it was deliberate actions and targeted investments on our part. But as per the answer to Kian, now the work needs to be done to take that run rate back down modestly over the next 7 quarters.",

We are comfortable with the trajectory, but we're trying not to get too far over our skis on it. We think it's supportive of the trajectory to €30 billion this year and €32 billion next year. And the way I -- to be honest, the way this will work, Chris, is the incremental NII that we expected to get in '25 would be compared to the higher base in '24. So that it would essentially just add because of the factors that I outlined being the drivers. So short version. This is incremental in '24 and carries over to '25. The numbers that donut on the -- in the appendix, that does move over time. There's no question. It's depending on the mix shift in the market environment generally. We think we've got a healthy portfolio mix in our, what I'll call fixed markets, FIC markets. We're describing here as FIC ex financing. But it's driven by macro and micro trends, client positioning. It's driven by the extent to which structured transactions are happening in any one of those product areas. So it does move around, but we think of it as a healthy portfolio mix.",

And secondly, I would say that going forward, if you think about the global house bank concept and the way how actually Fabrizio is tying up the day-to-day FIC work with the corporate bank, I would say that we have actually a really good chance also with that what is happening on the corporate side and how corporates are thinking that the emerging markets piece and also part of the macro pieces are actually further increasing. We can see that these discussions are happening each and every day. We have an initiative where we are actually targeting corporate within the Corporate Bank and tying them into our FIC businesses, and we can see the results. So I would say that in a normal development and now taking aside the comments James did on unique and particular transactions. But with the network we have, with the global approach we have, I could see that the emerging markets piece and part of the market piece are actually growing because the connection of the IB with the Corporate Bank.",

And secondly, obviously, I hope you respect that we are not going more into details when it comes to regulatory discussions. But we have said everything in writing. So for us, we can onboard clients. Number two, with regard to Wealth Management and the Private Bank, yes, it has been actually since Claudio has been with us -- it has been always our focus actually to go more into the investment businesses. By the way, not only in Wealth Management, but also in the Private Bank. We see that as a clear growth area and in particular, as a clear long-term growth areas. I think I said it before on these calls. If you think about what is one of the real sticky items also here in Germany going forward, it is what happens with the pensions of our retail clients. And the focus Claudio is giving to the investment businesses, where, obviously, we have an expertise which not a lot of other banks, in particular, in the home market have, is something which is now helping us a lot. It also helps us, by the way, that we got all the rating upgrades that we have a completely different reputation in the market. And the investments Claudio did in Wealth Management outside Germany, in parts of European countries, in particular, in Asia. You know that we invested heavily in the Middle East are now all paying off. And therefore, yes, we are happy with the growth, but it's part of the 2- to 3-year story and strategy, which Claudio built. Now as we see the success in particular in Wealth Management, as I said, we want to bring it more and more into the more Private Bank and Retail Bank business because there is actually the need for the clients. And therefore, I expect actually that we do see these kind of growth rates also going forward, which is again supporting that what I said in the first question from Kian, one should not underestimate the continuous growth in revenues actually in those business from the continuous accumulation of assets under management, in particular, in this business.

So if I kind of look at your guidance for the division, it would seem you're expecting quite a bit of a pickup over the next 9 months. So I suppose what is driving that relative to the first quarter? And then secondly, just looking at the financing revenues where you could have really a powerful slide in there in the pack. I mean, look, it's been a major source of growth for you, but also your peers, I'm just curious about what's driving that kind of growth differential kind of versus pre-COVID levels and how sustainable that is?

    "text": "So Tom, I just -- the way you think about fee and commission income in the Private Bank is it's sort of a client business volume measure. So as Christian referred to it as sticky. So as we build balances we build activity. You've seen a year-on-year growth rate of 2%, but now at a level in the first quarter that significantly exceeds any quarter last year, especially the second, third and fourth. And so we think that, that's going to continue to build on itself and create sort of more and more year-on-year differential. There is some amount that obviously depends on clients' investment activity, trading activity, if you like, in any given quarter, but the, call it, the stable revenue base that we're seeing in Private Bank and fee and commission income growth is very encouraging, and I think it's set to continue. I think in terms of your question about resources in the FIC business, we're -- we've been very focused on that sort of consistently over the years. We tend to look at it in terms of revenue production related to RWA. As you can see, market risk RWA relatively modest for us, so it is principally credit risk RWA, both in the balance sheet and derivative businesses. But we think we've got some of the best in the business at understanding and optimizing that. And the same is true of leverage exposure where we manage to the constraints of our balance sheet but work to optimize how we deploy that leverage exposure to support clients as well as the revenue profile. Sometimes, by the way, the business you do is leverage exposure intensive, but not RWA-intensive and sometimes the opposite. And hence, the optimization efforts that we go to there are considerable and sophisticated. So I would stop there. I don't know if you want to add that thing.",

But it also means if I look at the net going into this quarter's run rate, actually, there were -- there's probably more things pushing it up than pushing it down, of which FDIC was one. There's always some degree of volatility. VNT was a feature this year, certainly, year-on-year in the quarter, it was relatively more neutral. But reflected really changes in the interest rate curve. By the way, some of which we would expect to get back in the balance of the year through pull to par. Always hard to say, therefore, what the pretax profit impact is going to be. We talk in the guidance about what the shareholder expense is that we expect, what the incremental -- what the sort of, call it, run rate or annual treasury funding costs are. So for modeling purposes, I would go with sort of a quarterly version of that annual guidance and accept that there is some volatility in valuation and timing. Incidentally, we've been working over the years to reduce and minimize that volatility to the extent we can. So lots of work has gone into hedge accounting programs and other things to both manage the risks -- the balance sheet risks that we have, but do so in a way that is as accounting neutral as we can, and we've made some good progress in that regard.",

    "text": "Thank you, Chris. That's a Christian. Thank you very much for your questions. Let me start and as usual, James may want to chip in on your first question on revenues and on kind of your key question, both numbers for 24 and 25. The answer is a clear. Yes, and let me start with 2024 and you have seen the H1 numbers, to be honest, I'm really happy with that with the 15.4 billion because all businesses have actually delivered. And the nice thing is if I now go over the next quarters and let me start with the predictable or more predictable divisions, i.e., the corporate bank, the private bank asset management, you can actually see that the momentum and the numbers which we have seen in the first two quarters are very, very good guidance for Q3 and Q4. I would even say that for the Private Bank and Asset Management, I even expect a slightly better development in H2 versus H1, given also that what James said in his prepared remarks on NII, but also in particular, because of the inflows and the assets under management behave in a very satisfactory way. On the corporate bank, I think a number of you know, which is around 1.9 billion given all the what I can see from the mandates we win is something which we can also plan for Q3 and Q4 that I would really say those three divisions are really having a good momentum. And yes, we benefit a bit more from a better NI than we expected at the start of the year. But even next to that, the underlying fee business behaving very well on the investment banking side, I absolutely believe that overall the I think the trajectory which we have seen over the last years in terms of market share wins in terms of stability of revenues and in terms of also predictability of revenues. If you think about the financing businesses, which we have also show me that the second half will be a very satisfactory one. Honestly, July started so far, pretty pretty good in the Investment Bank. And what makes me confident in the O&A business could be that the summer is a little bit slower in terms of M&A business than what we have seen in Q2. But overall, the market will further recover. We have gained 70 basis points in market share in the first half year. We believe that this will also be the case throughout the year. And to be honest, the investments which we have done in the origination and advisory business are really only starting to pay off. So the new people which we hired last year, they are gaining more and more momentum. So to be honest, I even expect that we get more market share in an overall market, which from a fee pool is increasing over the next 12 to 18 months. So that makes me confident that starting with the EUR15.4 billion revenue number, that 30 billion is absolutely inside, and I'm highly confident that we achieve that. Now 25. The first thing I would like to say it's for the first time. So to say, Chris, other than '24 and '23, they're both kind of income streams. And I and fee income are both going into an increasing direction. So it's different than in the former years where we always had one of these streams, which was kind of decreasing in 25, we have sort of, say, two positive growing engines, and that obviously helps us as a start. Now if I there go and actually through the business on the corporate bank, we think that 25 would be another increase over 20 for Y. because we can simply see the number of mandates transactions we are doing and the investments which we had in particular in our platform business in our payment businesses are paying off. And so therefore, we gave you also in the prepared remarks, the wins which we had in Q2, all that and the feedback we have from the client's point into another increase in 25. And again, the ENI is behaving even better than than we thought at the start of this year. Private Bank. I'm clearly up next year why we always told you that we have a tailwind in NII in 25 over 24. Secondly, we are obviously benefiting from the constant inflows into assets under management. And we don't believe that there is any change in the second half of the year. So the starting point is even a different one, similar actually in asset management. Also in those areas like alternatives and passive, where Stefan, who accesses a focus on, we are growing. And on the Investment Bank, actually, I do believe we will grow in all three areas. Number one, we have made further investments into our trading business, in particular, regionally in the US. We have new people starting now as we speak and we will grow that business the trading business over there. Secondly, I refer back to the remarks on the O. and A. business. We expect the fee market share to increase next year further increase over over this year. Secondly, market shares will grow with those investments, which we have done also talking about numerous. And thirdly, the financing business is not only stable but if I look at the income and revenue streams, which we have planned for next year, actually also an increase, all of that from a very encouraging behavior in 2024 makes me absolutely confident that we can achieve the EUR32 billion next year. So the second question on the ECB, to be honest, a, you know, I have seen that portfolio, the leverage lending portfolio now for the last 15 years. And to be honest, it always behaved very well because I think our risk appetite and the way we have managed. Our risk has demonstrated that we are in very good control of that business. You also know Chris, and this is not a secret that a few years ago, we had started the discussions with the ECB. We got a capital add on at that point time of 20 basis points, which was reduced last year by five basis, five basis points. I know that there is a discussion between the industry and the ECB. I take it as a very positive signal that the ECB is now reviewing the comments and our arguments from the industry. And therefore, you know, also obviously, with all outside opinions, which we get for our portfolio, I feel very confident with the level of provisions we have with the way we manage it. It's a it's a key business for us. It's a core business of ours that will not change. And I'm sure we will also come to a solution there which shows that we have managed it in a fair way. I don't know, James, whether you want to add.

I was wondering if we could have an update on what is your total distribution targets? Because you committed to distribute above EUR8 billion of capital, but could we have a bit more clarity by how much you expect to exceed this 8 billion mark? And also timing wise, what should we expect notably for the share buyback is a top-up completely excluded for H2 and what about the pace in 2025? And regarding litigation, what should we expect regarding the litigation provision H2 through more globally? You have now reduced quite significantly turnkey or contingent liabilities. So I was wondering should we expect a lower litigation cost run rate for the future rates for the future years? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you very much. And let let me start, Nicolas and then James will I think comment on both question on the distribution because that is really important for me. There is no change in guidance. We will distribute more than 8 billion in the timeframe from 21 to 25. Nothing has changed, obviously, from a timing point of view, as we said end of April with the with the item on the Postbank provision of EUR1.3 billion, which we had to digest. We always said that we now need to have two quarters actually where we show operating strengths where we restore capital. And to be honest, I'm really happy of what has been done in this bank. We are at 13.5% capital. We have created excess capital. Also in the last quarter, we are clearly above, so to say the 13.2%, we have created excess capital, but I want to show to the market another quarter of this operating strength. And with the with the comments I just made on revenues with costs, which are absolutely in control, we are around the EUR5 billion we have our clear way to the next year. I'm absolutely confident that we show another very strong quarter in Q three, which generates capital. And then obviously we are back in the progress process and we will go back and enter into discussions. That is clear for me. But I always signaled that after the Postbank litigation, which the bank digested, we really powered through this we want to show too good quarters. Number one is done, and I'll tell you, number two will come.",

    "text": "Thanks, Christian. Nicola, thanks for the question. Look, I'd just echo Christian's comments. We've returned almost EUR1.6 billion already this year through the capital actions that we took in the second quarter. We were, I think, very successful offsetting the impact of the Postbank provision and our step off into the second half of 13.5% on the CET1 ratio is a good starting place. Your question about the trajectory going forward. If I refer you to slide 22 of our investor deck, we've tried to be as clear as possible on what we've referred to as baseline expectations. And so if you look at that on the dividend, we've paid out this year 883 and the $0.675 next year would be about 1.3 billion. The EUR1 dividend that we intend to pay out in 26 in respect of 25 would be another nearly 2 billion. And then if you trace the the buyback sort of trajectory forward. And let's just assume for a second, 50% increase a year, the next two numbers in that series would be about EUR1 billion and 1 billion and a half cumulatively that would add to slightly above 9 billion. And so that's what we're working to deliver to shareholders. As we, as Christian mentioned, build excess capital in the back half of the year, we want to be positioned to achieve those those types of payout. Now we did make a sort of an editorial change to the to page 22 really trying to kind of separate a little bit the share buybacks from the the payout ratio discussion because to some extent we look at the payout ratio as a minimum, not a maximum and hence building excess capital into the back half of the year can position us to preserve that buyback trajectory even if the payout ratio goes goes north of 50%. And so that's the hopefully clarity and on what the baseline expectations are. And just the last thing to say last time, you saw that slide there was this idea of top-ups. And obviously, the unexpected provision in 24, at least for now is taken away the idea of a top-up in 24. But we haven't given up on top-ups in 25 and 26. It depends on sort of all of the ins and outs in the capital plan. But I'd just echo Christian's confidence that we I think we've been able to show that the Postbank provision did not take us off stride, and we remain committed to the to the so the profile we show on page 22 if I go to your litigation question, look, obviously there's been a and a transition between the contingent liability number and the and the balance sheet provision driven by the Postbank litigation takeover litigation provision, but actually not only that provision of some other items also move between the two sort of the off balance sheet and the on-balance sheet accounts. As we said, last quarter. The profile has changed pretty significantly, if you like, of risks that are still unknown and we are committed to continuing the work over the back half of the year to put ourselves in a position for, I would call it dramatically lower litigation provisions and regulatory enforcement actions going forward. Really we'd like to be in a position at the end of the year to have what I call is as clean a slate as possible going into 25 and sustainably. So because if you like, we'll address the the unknown elements of the known items. And as we look to the future sort of the pipeline of new things coming in that we can see and by the way, the benefits of all the investments we've made in controls should should give us much more confidence about the outlook going forward.",

So more like 25, 30 basis points in the second half and what you've assumed on commercial real estate AmerGen, that number and as you sort of like set in 2025, you expect on loan losses to normalize. Would that be a 25, 30 basis points or that 20 basis points you mentioned in the past. And then just on CapEx, I just wondered if you can give us some more clarity on the expectation with the benefit from the delay of the FITB., what it could mean for for the 15 billion you previously guided? And would you consider this and your distribution as an extra benefit? And then sorry, just one last question on the dividend and the distributions, if I may. If you have a payout rate, if the 68 dividend per share, which corresponds to more than 50%, am I right in from your previous comments to understand that come the focus is the absolute distribution rather than the payout ratio.

    "text": "Thank you, Anke, and I'm happy to take all three, Chris, you may want to add, but look at the CLP. guidance change, I would think of it as more related to what has already happened in the year in the first half than then about our outlook for the second half. And we've had a number of events really to corporates default and then an overlay that we booked in Q2 that have taken us slightly north of what we'd anticipated when we spoke to you three months ago. And while you're always a little bit looking in a crystal ball. We've been we've been in a granular way looking through the portfolio, including commercial real estate to have a view on the second half. You'll recall that I've talked in the past of a 24 run rate closer to say, EUR350 million per quarter that we that we felt was sort of present and that in a sense is, let's say, EUR100 million of CRE. sitting on top of EUR250 million of ordinary course run rates that is in the portfolio. Now let's start with the last point, we still see the same stability in our own underlying portfolios in both the retail and the corporate portfolios. So we haven't seen a deterioration on top of that. We've seen, as I mentioned, a handful of defaults and also an overlay that we booked in CRE. I recall that we've seen a stabilization in 24 and relative to the deterioration that was taking place last year that actually persisted in the second quarter. What is perhaps a little bit worse? Is that the the sort of beginnings of a recovery that I might have expected three months ago. That hasn't happened yet. It doesn't change our view, frankly, of the direction of travel and that essentially over time, the new defaults and the valuation adjustments that remain in that portfolio begin to sort of burn out some CRE. If you if you go back to the fourth quarter results, we'd said to expect about $450 million in 24, consistent with our 23 performance that is probably worsened ever so slightly, call it 50, maybe EUR75 million in terms of our expectation, but not dramatically. As I say, the larger part of the change in guidance is what's already happened in the year around a couple of corporate items in the corporate defaults in the and the overlay and on FRTB, obviously good news for the industry in Europe because I think it would have put us at a competitive disadvantage if the U.S. were not to go forward and Europe to go forward. So we think it's a sensible change. It essentially cuts in half just simple math. We had given you say, EUR15 billion of RWA increase from CRR. three as of January 1st next year. I'd now build about 7.5 into the models and move the other $7.5 billion into the 1st of January 2026. So that's obviously helpful in our capital path. Helpful to us in terms of building up this excess capital, I just talked about I'm looking into the 25 distributions and then that feeds nicely into your third question, which is which is which is binding, we think of the 50% payout intention as you know, if you like a floor, it's what we would then accrue to during the year based on the interim profit recognition and because of the impact on profitability in 24 coming from the Postbank provision, that payout ratio, I think we'll easily cover our dividend and maybe some amount of repurchase. But what we want to do is put ourselves in a position of being an excess capital to to fund and then the rest of the repurchase in 25. And hence, to your point, we wouldn't view the 50% payout as being binding again.",

Tom, I wanted to come back briefly on cost in your remarks, Christian, you talked about the EUR4.9 billion run rate potentially at the end of the year. And I just wanted to see how you think about the flexibility that that offers next year to get your cost income guidance from? If you can talk maybe around is there flexibility to run below EUR20 billion in that sense, I'm considering you're indicating a lower number for the end of the year, even if it's adjusted versus stated and how that thinking is around and confident around the cost income guidance. And the second question is related to provisions again, I wanted to just dig a little bit deeper after anchors question. The detailed answer in respect to CRE. Clearly, the assumptions are that CRE will stabilize? It sounded like that come in 2025. And I wanted to just get a better understanding what assumptions you're making. If you can talk a little bit about the input assumptions, price, the price performance and CREU. S and default rates, are you assuming on a macro level in CRE? And so we get a better understanding. And lastly, if I just may on leverage loans, you kind of answered the question, but I also wanted to see if there's any leverage loan additional provision requirement. Does that mean there could be a buyback push back?",

    "text": "Perfect. Okay. And let me start with the cost answer. First of all, I think most important is that we stick to our target and that we show you that we deliver on that likely like I think we have demonstrated from Q4 23 when we started with the EUR5.3 billion of quarterly cost that we come down to 5.0, which we have done now looking ahead and what is in the pipeline of additional cost measures to be executed over the next quarters in terms of achieving the EUR2.5 billion of overall cost cuts. And I'm very confident that we will come to the EUR4.9 billion of quarterly costs at the end of Q4, Q4 starting of Q1. So this is for us where we are focusing on in this regard. We have obviously put all the cost measures into so-called key deliverables, which we are tracking on a biweekly basis in the Management Board. And we can actually see that with all the investments we have done with all the also headcount cuts, which we have executed in Q1 and Q2. We are delivering on that in Q3 and Q4. And therefore, I'm confident that the run rate of EUR4.9 billion, which we need for 2025 will be achieved, to be honest in this regard key. And just to give you a little bit of a seal the hardest core quarter to achieve the EUR5 billion was actually Q2, right from the start of the year where and why? Because all the salary increases actually came into Q2 we had a lot of the staff reductions to be done in Q2 where these people were still so to say on our payroll and both we have managed, i.e., you saw the number of reduced workforce, not only internally, but also externally what we managed to do in Q2. And secondly, we digested the wage and salary increases, i.e., the annual tariff increases which we which we digested. And now we are working down these key deliverables, as I just said. And that gives me all the confidence that we are coming to the run rate of EUR4.9 billion. Now what further flexibility do we have in that? The EUR4.9 billion is obviously then also correlated to sort of say our revenue aspirations and the revenue target I laid out, you know, from our previous discussions that there is always certain flexibility also on the cost number in terms of flexibility when it comes to less volumes when it comes to variable comp when it comes to technology investments. And obviously, this is all in our hand and therefore, I don't want to rule out at all that there is further flexibility. But for me, given there where the momentum of the bank is on the revenue side, I have all all eyes focused on the EUR4.9 billion. And here I can give you my full confidence that we will achieve that because or the underlying structural cost reductions are actually in time, in plan, in execution.",

    "text": "And turning to your question on provisions and the impact of CRE, I maybe I can draw your attention to Slide 34 and the and the investment in the IR deck. Now this is where I had guided that the next in the series would be down in Q2. And so as always, predictions about the future are a slightly uncertain science but we've sort of traveled more or less at the level we had in Q4 and Q1. So the recovery that I mentioned earlier didn't come as quickly as as I had expected and look, by the way, the one 30 in Q2 actually had some some impact of the overlay. So so if you take that out, we were at one 23 essentially flat for the last two quarters. Now what gives us confidence about the direction of travel here? Really two things. One is that the if we look at the portfolio in a granular way. So loan-by-loan, which loans in which loans do we see there a possibility of future defaults? That number is declining. And so so the if you like, the risk content that remains in the portfolio, it is declining. And but what drove the kind of missed my expectations this quarter was more that the existing the defaulted portfolio, our estimate is my estimation of lifetime losses increased in the quarter. So that also will find a level and stabilize it at some point. So I had hoped that and expected that we'd probably be closer to 100 in there in the second quarter. Let's see how this develops in the quarters to come. But given the way portfolios like this perform, you can the downslope can be can be quite dramatic. And then on leverage lending, look, we we believe our provisions or the allowance for loan losses is prudent and adequate for the risks we see in the portfolio. And we are always open to and taking on feedback from our internal AQR views, our auditors and also the regulators when they come into to review the portfolios and see. And at the end of the day, it is for us to determine on the basis of the accounting rules, what the appropriate provision is. We'll continue to monitor and adapt dynamic way, but we think our practices are good and we will continue to engage in a constructive way and with the supervisors on that on that dialogue.",

    "text": "Thanks, Tom. And two interesting questions. Look, loan growth has been more sluggish incoming than we'd expected as you've heard on our calls for the past year or so. That said, we did have loan growth in the second quarter. And so the kind of first encouraging sign we have $2 billionof loan growth this quarter. And we think that the kind of indicators of increasing activity are there. And there's certainly demand in some of the more more structured lending areas some. So we think that that recovery is starting. And in the retail portfolios in particular, there's still sort of a relatively slow environment in German mortgages and our portfolio have traded slightly. But again, there I think we've found a floor and can grow from here. And on the deposit side, really encouraging sort of performance, especially in corporate bank, but we also see in the private bank have a clear ability to raise deposits at a pricing that is that is attractive. And so you may see a leveling out a little bit of the deposit growth in the back half of the year. But but we think the volumes there generally are encouraging in terms of healthy growth, frankly, on both sides of the balance sheet going forward. If I look at SRT. look for us, some of our risk transfer programs are 20 years old. So we've been at this for a while and we have good structured programs, and we have a great level of engagement with the investors in our structures that have been with us for a long time. And we're sort of constantly on the lookout for portfolios where we think they can be more efficiently held off of the bank's balance sheet than on our balance sheet. \\ Therefore, I would say the scope isn't dramatic, but they're still there's still things we look at. And you've seen that as part of the, you know, program we've had for capital efficiency of where we were after 25 to 30, as you've seen in the past year or so, securitization has been part of that growing our SRT. programs or the funded credit-linked note programs we have is also being part of that. So I think a marginal contribution from here and we're always looking, but we have a reasonably sizable benefit as things stand from those types of tougher types of structures. One last comment to make at the risk of going long as we get into the CRR. three world and the impact of the output floor. Obviously, there's a there's a whole new sort of Vista, if you like, of assets that we may look to take off our balance sheet because we'll be solving for another variable. So in the past, it's been managing concentration risk and to a lesser extent, RWA going forward, it will be those two things plus plus the impact on the output floor of different asset classes.",

And actually, it's a first of all, a continuous improvement on the fee business, a grocer in the private bank. I'm kind of in particular, when I look to the future a quarter over quarter and why? Because we have a constant inflow in our assets under management, by the way, domestically as well as internationally. And by the way, also and this is very nice, not only sort of say in the private bank and wealth management business, but also in the personal banking business in Germany. Secondly, I think for the private bank. And if we if we think about the overall profitability, there is a huge focus. Now on turning around the personal banking business in the private bank in Germany, that obviously, given all the integration work, which we which we are doing and which we have done in particular last year with the IT transformation had an unacceptable return on equity. So far. But if I look actually at the strategy from Claudio, how we will digitalize this business, how we actually will make this business in particular for the investment and fee-related business a business, which is there for 19 million clients and in particular, for the 50 million Post Bank clients, I expect actually a good growth coming from this personal banking and at the same time, we are now realizing the fruits of integrating the IT, i.e., the costs are coming down. And here we are talking, like we said in the previous calls about a 500 million cost reduction just as a direct cost in the private bank as a result of the integration. So it's a constant, a growth across the subdivisions in the private bank. But the real lever is actually bringing the personal bank in Germany with a clear plan to an acceptable return on equity over the next 12 to 18 months, which is then obviously also a huge lever for the overall Group profitability.",

    "text": "So maybe I could add, and this is also a little bit in answer to Chris's question earlier, which was about sort of fee and commission engines outside the Investment Bank, obviously, just in the Investment Bank, a big part of the story this year and next year is is advisory and underwriting fees where we think the momentum, the wallet growth is there and there's an opportunity that we're executing on to increase our market share. But if you go away from the Investment Bank. As Christian just said, you know, the the private bank earns commissions and fee revenues in brokerage and investment management fees and commissions and asset management does the same on the investment management side and you have visibility into those revenue sources from the AUM increases or development over time. And then you can also you can also be helped or hindered by the market levels, but the visibility is there. And then in the corporate bank and you've got fees on loan inception, loan processing processing, you have payment activity, custody activity again, sort of an asset driven trust and agency services. And again, the visibility into those revenue sources is high, including based on the the RFP process and the implementation of new business that we win. And so so as I say, the visibility into these revenue sources is strong. And based on our current outlook, we can see some of these lines continuing the types of growth rates this year so far, which has been 12% each quarter and for the half extending into next year. On the and on the spread side, there, too we've been surprised to the upside this year, frankly, on both sides of the balance sheet. So as we've talked about, deposit margins have been better than anticipated as the pass through and continues to outperform. On the loan side. The same has been true. The spreads in the front book have been better than our than we anticipated to be fair a bit mixed on the private bank and corporate bank and investment bank. There's been reasonably healthy spreads and new lending in the front book. And those that's that sort of margin expansion has contributed to the to the better than expected net interest income than we had anticipated. And by the way, the other driver of the NI outperformance is also spreads on our unsecured debt. And so so all of those engines are helping sustain this year that net interest income line and contribute to the expected growth next year.",

    "text": "Yes, good afternoon and thanks for the presentation. I have three questions, please. First of all, on RWA reduction, I think you have achieved now EUR19 billion in total RAB reduction as a result of the optimization program. And could you give us a sense of the timing of the remaining reductions to get to your EUR25 billion targets. Is that largely coming through in the second half of this year or some of that should be in 25? And then the second question is on share buybacks. Just referring to your slide 22 and the 50% per annum growth in share buybacks, I think the original expectation certainly by the market was and a higher total amount of buyback in 2024 on which the increase into next year would have been obviously quite substantial. My question is, are we looking at a 50% increase versus the 675 million for the buyback next year? Or should we think of a potentially larger increase due to the scrapped second tranche of the buyback in 24. And finally, the last question is on the Corporate Bank loss provisions. And could you give us any sense of these single cases or single corporate events are they reflective of any deterioration in the overall asset quality in the broader corporate sector. Thank you.",

And, you know, broadly speaking, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, I would hope that we could achieve another 2 billion in Q3. And there I think we've got good line of sight to that, maybe a little bit more. And if we achieve the same in Q4, I would be pleased. So if we got to say 4 billion incremental this year, bringing us to 23 billion, maybe 24, that would be that would be good performance, which, to your point, leaves five or six next year to get to 30 and potentially there's upside beyond that. And that obviously is helpful in driving the excess capital creation that I talked about earlier. So So assume for modeling purposes, 4 billion this year and at least six next year.",

But I want to be clear the baseline was intended always to be off the in this case, the six 75 with potential top-ups, depending on the level of excess capital in each year. And so I want to reiterate the baseline expectation that something that management's working towards to deliver and and let's see what whether there's room for the top-ups. We certainly haven't given up on the idea that there wouldn't could be top-ups. And those top-ups would take us from the call it 9.2 that's implied by the by the the progression and to something beyond that again, it underscores why it is that we say we've got confidence and exceeding the 8.8 billion.",

It's actually sort of say, dominated by one case in Europe, but also here? Yes, we have to have we had to build a loan-loss provision. But I think overall, we should also not forget that the risk management overall has actually worked quite well because we have a substantial coverage actually from a CLO point of view, which again, brings me back to the point that, yes, you see a slightly elevated loan-loss provision number, but the real run rate if we take overlays out. And if I also take this into account, the real run rate of loan loss provision is, in my view, actually the normal stock of run rate of the EUR250 million plus a quarterly number, which always can happen. And you can now say it's 75, it's EUR100 million but that brings me also to the confidence because we don't see from a rating point of view from a watch list point of view from upgrades versus downgrades. We don't see any material deterioration, also not in the German mid-cap book. Brings me to the confidence that actually a number of EUR1.3 billion is a number where I'm absolutely confident that there should be a run rate for Deutsche Bank in terms of loan-loss provisions per year.",

And the second question relates to the valuation and timing differences in your corporate center, which have been mostly positive in recent quarters?

    "text": "Thanks for the question, Stefan. So briefly, I don't know the notional of the NPL sale, but but in round numbers, think of us as having a CLP benefit of about EUR25 million in the quarter on the sale, which was offset by incremental CLPR., continued drag from the operational disruptions of about the same amount. So the call it 150 that you see in the second quarter is a pretty good indication of the run rate and going into the second half of the year in the private bank, given we wouldn't necessarily expect will the drag from operational items. We do expect to go away and potentially reverse in the second half of the year and the P&L sale, the NPL sale wouldn't necessarily repeat either on the valuation timing differences, I'd really call out two elements. The first is pull to par in the investment portfolio. And that has has a short term and a sort of a more medium term element in the short term, some of the pull to par in Q2 was actually Q1 losses given given the market movements, and we expect some more of that to bleed into earnings in the second half of the year. So there's a short-term element. It's actually also. And given the way the hedges work, there's also a longer-term element which we expect to come out over a much longer period of time. So yes, in a sense. There's a there's a a positive balance, call it that way that is that is to come there. There's also the impact of our, you know, our swap funding book and which is which is helpful. It today represents it's driven by the differential between euro and dollar rates. That's remained by and large supportive. And how that trends from here will depend on the on the on the gap between the two rates. So So different parts, I don't see it disappearing in a heartbeat, but some but over time would moderate. Let's say in a two, three year time horizon.",

And so I'll refer you on the first question to page 42 of the of the interim report and the main driver that we're referring to is what we call the expected loss shortfall. And that's but but in that disclosure, you see the various regulatory capital deduction items. The LSF. has been something that's increased significantly year on year, reflecting the portfolio changes that we introduced last year and some of the I'll call it seasoning of those parts of those models and yes, it's one of the areas that we're now looking at and how we can mitigate and manage. And so that helped us on the regulatory capital deduction items in the quarter. Is just learning which exposures drive the LSF. and how we can we can mitigate that. And to your question about direction of travel, actually, the next step will be up as one more model kind of becomes live in that world. But then we, I think would be at a sort of a steady state level and we will work to to optimize from that. On Russia, we essentially booked offsetting provision and an indemnification asset. And so we feel we're appropriately the risk is appropriately reflected on the balance sheet and the fee evolution of the cases has been overall in line with our expectations. So we don't see sort of a change in the risk position there and therefore no change in how it's reflected in the financial statements. Our expectation is that that claim will be prosecuted and in a way that enables us to enforce the the indemnification claim.",

So 27 being larger is simply a function that are that are our hedge portfolio, you know, are less of it goes out that far in time. And what you'd expect to see us do as we roll over the hedges is bring more of that in and reduce the sensitivity further down the down the track and equivalently the 90 million in 27 on EUR, I would I would expect to see go down unless there's some change in our in our view of the, you know, of the likely future path of interest rates.

    "text": "Thank you. Anke, it's Christian. Let me start. And as usual, James will add obviously to all your questions. Let me start with the share buybacks because that also goes into the direction of, so to say, the most recent ruling of the Cologne court. First of all with the share buyback. As we always said after the full provisioning of the Postbank litigation case in April, we always said, we want to show to you two clean quarters, Q2, Q3 which we did. And even without the release which we recorded in the third quarter for Postbank, we have shown a record quarter for Deutsche bank in the third quarter. And that gave us then obviously the conviction and the clear path now to apply for a share buyback. By the way, I think with the 13.8 core tier one, this is also a nice step which gives us the confidence for the application. With regard to amounts and timing, we always do it like in the past. We obviously keep that discussion with our regulator. But I can tell you that there is full confidence with James and myself and the management team that based on the step off of 30.8%, based on the trajectory of our operating results, we are convinced of our distribution of above 8 billion for the time zone between 21 and 25. So nothing changed. Also, what I would like to emphasize is actually that today's ruling you have just seen that is not actually affecting our share buyback because we provisioned that amount in full and also in our capital plan going forward we did actually not assume further releases in our capital plan. So in this regard of course we don't like the ruling and now we have to analyze it and think about potential next steps. But for the capital plan going forward and for the share buyback this is no impact because we are fully provisioned. And in this regard we remain convinced and confident that we can deliver above the 8 billion. For us it was important to show two good quarters and solid quarters in terms of operating performance. And I think we see that from a revenue point of view, from a cost point of view and hence with the underlying result. Let me briefly go over to the loan loss provision question because I understand that that obviously raises some questions on your side. Look, I really think it's important that we look into the composition of the loan loss provision and what really drove the number to 494 million this quarter. And yes, we said that we see in the second half of 2024, a decreasing trend. Let me explain why this did not happen. Number one, I know you, you are looking with concerns to Germany and the commercial real estate with regards to both items. To be honest, I see robust portfolio quality. In particular, if I look at the corporate side and the private banking side and the underlying loan loss provisions in Germany, we don't see any material change. We don't see any material change in the portfolio composition. If you look at indicators like up versus downgrades, if you look like additions to watch lists, this is not a concerning trend. Now, what increased in the private bank is still the result of the backlog in the Postbank operations that actually we thought that this comes earlier down. It will come down. We even will see some bookings. That is, in terms of that, we will see releases of certain reserves in 2025. So the trend is coming down and we will see releases. But we hoped actually for a faster reduction in this regard during the year 2024. So that is one item. The second item, I think, which is underlying positive is on the commercial real estate. If you actually look at the underlying portfolio composition, the trend is coming down. It's for the first time that commercial real estate provisions have come down sequentially, quarter-over-quarter. And it would have come even more down if we wouldn't have done a portfolio sale where we got the first mark and where actually we booked an additional provision from the portfolio sale in the low double digit number, that is obviously capital accretive. But overall, the commercial real estate provisions are coming down, and that is, again, something which we forecasted at the start of the year. But to be honest, we thought that this is already happening in Q2, now it is coming in, in Q3. Now, if I take all these items, and the third item, sorry, I should have said that is one larger loan loss provision in the south of Germany for a corporate name which is, though significantly hedged. So if you see the net loss position which we have from that, it is obviously far less than the gross loan loss provision which we have booked in Q3 that was also, by the way, a name where we already booked the first loan provision in Q2. So if you take these three items, the Postbank item, which will come down, and we even see reversals of bookings in 2025, if you see the underlying rate in the commercial real estate, and on top of that, if you look at the one name where we had gross loan provisions, but which was significantly hedged, actually, we see also with regard to 2025, and that was that what James was referring to in his prepared remarks, a normalized run rate for loan loss provisions of €350 million. And that is actually where we see, based on the portfolio quality, we have the trend going. And in this regard, I do think that we have seen now in this quarter, the peak of the loan loss provisions, with that number coming down to approximately 350 million per quarter in the 2025 year.",

As it relates to incremental buybacks next year it's very early to make that determination. As we've talked about, there are lots of moving parts in a capital plan. Under the best of circumstances, next year we'll have CRR3 coming due in two phases, changes in the environment, potential upside in areas like, for example, the sectoral buffer that's been applied in Germany to mortgages. So lots of moving parts that at this point, one doesn't want to get ahead of. So we'll make that decision much later in 25 than today's application.",

    "text": "Yes, thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have one on NII and one on cost, please. So on the NII, could we come back, please, to the drop? We saw this quarter in the corporate bank. It's led the banking book and AI to be just 3.2 billion this quarter. And I think the full year guidance you have implies it would be, again, about that level in Q4. I mean, when I look at the slide, 32 and it's useful. Thank you very much for putting in that slide. I see you blocked a significant part of the hedge income already for the next two years, so that's very reassuring. I also see that you've used a ten year swap that would be 2.3 to 2.5%. That makes sense based on today's curve. But, the risk here is rather to the downside. So the question here is also, the light blue column, the contribution from the rollover of the hedges. If, you know, the ten year swap would go towards, say, 2% or 2.2%, would we still see, the rollover, contribute positively in the next two years, despite, on top of what you've locked already? So that's for NII. And then the second question is on cost. I think you were saying before, James, that to make your guidance for 2025 cost, you would need to get adjusted cost quarterly run rate down towards €4.9 billion. Obviously, you just had three quarters in a row where you've met the guidance for this year at €5.0 billion. So maybe could you talk a little bit into the capacity for you to get there already in Q4? And what gives you the confidence that you can get to €4.9 billion quarterly run rate for adjusted cost next year? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Flora. Happy to answer those questions. So, on the NII disclosure that we provide, you're right, there's, of course, some risk on the rollover of the hedges. We like that. We've locked in 90% for next year. And, yes, we use the implied forward curve to look at what the future might be. The dark blue is as I say what's locked in for the next several years. Remember, of course, that the gap is against hedges that are rolling off, that were essentially at zero or very, very low. So the idea that there may be a little bit of downside in the light blue bars, that's true. But the quantum is against very low hedges put in many years ago, as much as ten years ago in that rollover. And that actually goes to the first part of your question, which is the corporate bank. Yes, we had in the series sort of a low point in the corporate bank, but actually there are some hedges that now roll off in the fourth quarter into chunks, and that gives us some good visibility into the trajectory for the corporate bank. If I think about the two businesses separately, we are -- we think we may have passed the low point in the trajectory for private bank already now in Q3, and we'll be passing that low point in Q4 for the corporate bank. It's obviously early to make that judgment and we'll see how everything plays out, including the balance sheet growth, deposit growth betas and what have you. But we think we're on a path now to be rising in 2025, not just because of the benefit of the long-term hedges. So it's overall quite encouraging pictures as we see it. Going to costs. Yes, absolutely. We're focused sort of every day on managing the run rate down, and I think we've said in the past towards €4.9 billion that remains our objective here. The trajectory in the first three quarters of this year has been encouraging. And even in the third quarter, I can point to some things that are, that are of a non-recurring nature in the third quarter, I think so. I think we're close to or at the €5 billion level, but we need to continue working it down from this point. And that is the full focus of the firm. We have the projects and the initiatives in place to do that. So for us, it's just about additional delivery of our operational efficiency program. We've talked about it in the past. It's optimization initiatives in Germany. We've announced some more actions on the distribution network in Germany. We've been investing in technology and we're having harvesting some of the benefits of that. I think we have a very successful track record now on workforce optimization, because what you see in the overall headcount, as well as the compensation and benefits line, is the impact of reductions in force that we've implemented reinvestments both in the front office in technology and controls, all of which we've managed within the run rate and we think we've got a whole raft of initiatives of a strategic nature underway to deliver further on those run rate improvements as well as tactical steps that we've been taking throughout the year and will continue to take to ensure we deliver on the objectives. Hope that all helps, Flora.",

And maybe you could just outline a bit how we should think about your assumptions in a more difficult German environment, and I'm not sure what your German environment outlook is in 2025 in terms of reaching that €32 billion, especially, again, Corporate Bank 2025 and then Private Bank in 2025.",

    "text": "Thank you, Kian. Let me start with the revenues and James is then going to your capital question. Look, first of all, before we talk about 2025 and fully understood your question, I think it's very encouraging that we have full sight on the €30 billion for 2024. And again, I think we have established a track record in achieving our revenue guidance for the last years. And if I look actually where we stand at the end of the third quarter, how actually October started in particular on the trading side. You just heard James talking about sort of say, a potential low point in the NII in the Private Bank, then also where equity indices are and what that potentially means for performance fees and asset management, we are super confident that we can achieve the €30 billion, which is obviously the right jump-off your question regarding the €32 billion. Now when we come to the €32 billion, look, the first item is, again, a continuation of that for James outlined on the NII side because everything what we can see from our forecast, given our hedging profile, but also, in particular, looking at our deposit growth, which we see in the Corporate Bank, but also in the Private Bank, we do feel that actually, just from an NII across the bank and in particular, carried by the Corporate Bank and by the Private Bank, we do see an upside of approximately €300 million to €400 million on the NII side. By the way, Kian, that does not include the expected growth on the financing volume, in particular also in [Indiscernible] business in the Investment Bank. So that when I look at the forecast, just from the financing part in that area and the NII part, obviously, my starting position is then €500 million up, i.e., €30.5 million. And now let's go through the businesses and, in particular, look at the investments which we have done over the last 18 months to move the businesses, in particular in the non-NII area. There's, of course, the Investment Bank, and there the O&A business. You have seen with the last quarters that we clearly outperformed the market. We have grown market share. Actually, not everybody, so to say, which we hired over the last 18 months is yet obviously running at full speed. So this is still to come. So we actually expect in the O&A business further market share gains, and we also expect actually that 2025, with all indications we have from our from our mandates, which we see for Q4 and Q1 already, this will be a year with actually higher fees for the banks. And that means if you have a higher market share, which we already increased by 60 or 70 basis points, which we will obviously benefit. So we do believe that, just in the O&A business, we see upside of another €500 million towards the number which we are printing for the year 2024. Then we have invested and you have also seen over the last years actually to compliment here, Ram Nayak, we have seen constant increases in market share in the FIC business. I think we have done a terrific job over there. Now if you follow Ram's planning going forward, obviously, we have an eye in certain areas, so to say, business areas like credit. But also from a regional point of view, we invested quite significantly over the last 9 months into our U.S. franchise. So I would say, with the market shares, which we definitely also won again in Q3 with the investments we have done in that business, there is also further increases to come from the FIC business in the Investment Bank. Then let's turn to the private bank. So I talked about the NII profile. But obviously, the biggest lever, which we see in the Private Bank. And there, we see actually already a good momentum on the wealth management side. But if you look at the assets under management, which are increasing steadily, I think we are year-to-date in the private bank, approximately €27 billion or €29 billion assets under management. We will obviously benefit from that NIC [ph] to the NII I described before, similar, by the way, on the assets under management in Asset Management in Stefan's book. So that I also clearly expect a 3-digit million increase in revenues in asset management next year. And that leaves me with the Corporate Bank. I think the Corporate Bank in itself is a success story. This is, in the meantime, so to say, at the heart of the bank. Quarter-by-quarter, we are increasing the mandates we get from our corporate clients around the world. There is clearly, clearly, the trend of the corporates around the world to go for at least one alternative to the U.S. banks. They would like to have the European alternative. With the network we have and the investments we have done in our platform, payment platform business, as well into our digital offerings, we can see further increases in the fee business there. So all-in-all, starting actually at €30.5 billion with the hedging profile on the NII side, and looking at the track record, I'm very confident that the €32 billion is a number which we can achieve. And last but not least, if I really think about 2025, if you think about the walk and the normalized costs we have on the loan loss provision, clearly reduced costs on the legal side. James was just talking about all our efforts and also progress we are doing on the operating cost side. And we will have less restructuring costs. To be honest, Kian, but you know me personally, we don't even need €32 billion of revenues in order to go to the 10%. But that doesn't mean that I'm trying to put a soft touch on the €32 billion. I think you have heard my absolute conviction that €32 billion is definitely achievable.",

    "text": "And Kian, just to touch your OCI filter, the CRR3 rule that we're taking advantage of. I think the short answer is, because it's there. The time value of capital in our ratio, especially as we're often measured against a distance to MDA appears, to us to be valuable and hence, the decision to take advantage of that transitional arrangement. Remember that the 22 basis points could be a lower number when the time comes that the transition benefit is over. So the passage of time and the book of securities that are generating those unrealized losses, we'll see some attrition and then the interest environmental change. So it's a number that may be considerably lower than 20 basis points when that transition period ends. And therefore, we think it's valuable for our shareholders to be able to redeploy that capital during that 18-month period.",

    "text": "Thank you Chris. Let me take the first one and James just taking the second one. Look, on the M&A side and on the specific potential situation you're referring to in Germany, that doesn't change our strategy at all. I think we have a very solid and a very good footprint in Germany, both in the Private Bank as well as in the Corporate Bank. We have worked on, obviously, on two sites in Germany to make that even more attractive. A, you see all the work just done by Claudio, in particular, in the Retail Bank to make this business more efficient. We know that there is work to be done, but I can see how Claudio you is actually focusing on that to have an efficient platform to offer digitalized products to our retail clients. And honestly, quarter-by-quarter, also with the feedback we get from the clients, we see clear improvement. On the Corporate Side, I think, again, what I said before, it was the right decision to establish ourselves with an own Corporate Bank and to make sure that we are, sort of say, the bank for German Mittelstand family-owned clients and obviously the large clients to support them domestically, but in particular, when they go abroad. And in this regard, we feel that we are rightly positioned. And with all the efficiency programs, we can actually see that the profitability in the German business on both sides is further increasing and will further increase. Now whenever it comes to these kind of potential items, to be honest, Chris, we shouldn't underestimate the opportunities for us. Because at the end of the day, it creates uncertainty, it creates uncertainty, so to say, with the other institutions, but in particular also with the clients. And we are ready to act. And this is what we established over the last three years to four years, both in the Corporate Bank and in the Private Bank. And in this regard, we have a clear strategy that is delivery of 20%, 25%, 10% and in this regard, whenever there is an opportunity to gain market share domestically, we will do this.",

And that's particularly on an announced basis rather than a booked basis. If I look to the -- what we would estimate the market share to be in the fourth quarter based on the forward look of our pipeline and estimates of next quarter, we think we'll be back in the kind of 2.5, 2.6 range where we've been this year, and that's an encouraging step-up into next year.",

    "text": "Sure, Giulia, it's James. I'll take the both, and Christian, I want to add on the private credit side. Look, Postbank, the recovery from the operational disruptions that took place in last year's third quarter has taken us longer than we expected. Among other things, we were extremely focused on ensuring that we close out the backlogs of processes that were adversely affecting our clients. That was our focus. It was also the BaFin focus as they looked at the problem set. Hence, collections was an area that we waited longer to focus on improving. We've now made those investments, and we've hired the people, we've trained the people and that collections process is getting closer to normal. That took us longer than we expected this year, no question, which is why it's had the impact on the CLP guidance that it did. But given where we are right now and being up and running on that process, I think we feel much more comfortable that we're at the end rather than that there's still risk. The other thing is a little bit in the details, but the last model conversion of a portfolio from Postbank onto the DB systems and models on the risk side, that took place in the third quarter, that also influenced that number of €40 million. So why is it a topic? The sort of longer-term impact of the operational disruptions that is coming to an end as well as the models. On Private Credit, we see it more as an opportunity than as a threat. Obviously, there's a degree to which the banks face the risk of disintermediation. But I think that is -- that downside is more than offset by the upside of, frankly, a growing market, a growing ability to place risk in the marketplace and thereby increase our origination sort of business model, fees on origination and expand loan origination beyond what the capital on our balance sheet supports by itself. We also see opportunities sort of in collaboration with private credit firms to do more, collaboration with our own asset manager, DWS, to do more as DWS builds its strategies in Private Credit. So we aim to be here a participant not just as an originator, but also as a partner and a participant in managing private credit. So it is a change in the market. It is a disruption to some extent, but one that we're strategically we, at Deutsche Bank, feel we're actually well positioned on a relative basis globally and particularly in Europe, to be a beneficiary.",

    "text": "Stefan, thanks for the questions. I'll take all three. Again, Christian, you may want to add. I'd say it's too early to tell on your question of is there anything sort of extraordinary that we may book in Q4. And the reason for that is in -- when I think about litigation, for example, what's in our control and not either analytically or in actual settlement activity is always hard to tell. But certainly, and I think we've been consistent in messaging on this, we want to put ourselves in a place where we no longer have surprises like the Postbank takeover litigation item for shareholders. Equally, we're in the planning process, restructuring and severance, we're still working towards our €400 million budget for the year, you'll see -- you've seen that Q4 -- actually, we did less than we expected in Q3, I'm sorry. And so there may be a bit of a catch-up in Q4. If there are additional tactical measures that we identify, we may go a little bit further there. Another area I might point out is real estate, we're always looking at our real estate portfolio and to see where we can optimize further. In all of those areas, too early to say what actions we could find to take place. But I think it's a signal of a company always looking for ways to optimize, improve our run rates and then deliver on promises -- in a sustainable way, by the way, deliver our promises for next year. On the CRE portfolio, it was approaching but not quite €1 billion that we put in the market. Of that, a little bit is sort of approaching 40% with Stage 3, and then the rest, a mix of performing in Stage 2. We were encouraged, frankly, by the pricing that we saw. Remember that when you're doing a portfolio sale, does it the €23 million we book, is it telling us our marks weren't right or simply that we're placing somebody else's cost of capital for our own? I think more of the latter. And given how close the marks on the Stage 3 are to on the Stage 3 elements are to our bookings, we see that as encouraging and further evidence of our view that the commercial real estate is at least found a floor and is stabilizing. That transaction, incidentally, I hope we were clear, but we have not closed on that transaction, but we have now booked to where we think it leads us in terms of marks. So that's overall encouraging. On the hedges, it's in both CB and IB, and a couple of those exposures they were shared across the two. We call them sort of concentration hedges. Well, we have a programmatic sort of policy to ensure that our concentrations don't exceed certain levels. When they do in terms of the underwriting, we sell those exposures away into typically CLO structures, sometimes other structures. The accounting has an asymmetry and produces revenue. Actually, net interest income was smaller this quarter, a little bit more in the first half. In total, over the course of the year, that's amounted to about €200 million. So only 30% of the losses actually sort of went to capital given the benefit of the hedging. I think it's a sign of the prudence that goes into that programmatic hedging that we do. And actually, going back to Giulia's question, it's an area where the growth of Private Credit is obviously helpful, because we see improvements both in capacity and pricing in the market into which we sell away the risk that we're talking about. I hope that all helps, Stefan.",

So what we did was there was some what I think of as hedging of the convexity of the mortgage portfolio, which we historically had kept in treasury. This year, the decision was to push that out to the business where we think it appropriately belongs. And where -- by the way, one of the reasons to do that was the hedge programs that we're able to implement have improved. So that was the trigger for the change. And so that's meant that Private Bank on the surface has had a year-on-year comparison that's worse, both on revenues, by the way, and on costs than the -- I'll use the word, underlying performance would show.

    "text": "Hi, there, thank you. A couple of follow-ups. A lot has also been talked about. Firstly, on the U.S. CRE. I just wanted to check something that I think you implied, but your -- on Slide 37, you've shown the quarterly CLPs have now stepped back down to sort of €68 million. I think you're implying that that's the new run rate. We stay around that level going forward. I just wanted to make sure that I'm sort of understanding that right. And I guess it's a positive really that your modified loans are now €13 billion out of the €15 billion. So it sort of implies you work your way through the -- pretty much the whole portfolio, and I guess that supports that outlook. So first question is really just are we now expecting to go forward at that 68-ish run rate? And then the second question, I just wanted to press you a bit more on the M&A topic. You were commenting this morning on the Newswire, James, about Deutsche Bank positioned to play a leading role in European consolidation. The industrial logic makes sense, but you're just not ready right now. And I just wondered sort of how you view the scenario of someone like Commerzbank tying up with a different bank and effectively becoming unavailable, what remaining optionality would you have? Where else would you see opportunities for consolidation and for Deutsche Bank to play a leading role?",

    "text": "So Jeremy, thanks for the questions. So more or less the answer is yes. We -- if we had printed in Q2 what we did in Q3, I think we would have been congratulated for the foresight. But we are absolutely seeing a trend here, and it's based on the items that we've talked about for a while. So relative stability in valuations, which you see in the loan to value. The interest rate environment. Obviously, the external indices that you've seen. And now having tested the market with the loan sale, also the results of that market check. As you also alluded to, inside the €68 million is €23 million that is -- and you could also think of it as bringing forward. And so the underlying run rate was even better. Look, I don't want to promise a number, I think having leaned out a little bit far in Q1 about Q2. But the direction of travel is there and all of the drivers that I referred to are there and visible. And as it relates to the modifications, you're correct. I mean, look, some of this portfolio will have been modified and then have its new maturity and come up for an extension a second time. So it's not impossible that it grows beyond the 15%, but it is -- just as a metric. But it is the case that we've been through the lion's share of the maturity profile and potential for modification. As we said last quarter, the list of projects where we see kind of scope for new defaults is obviously declining. So the number of loans where we see a risk in -- that there are modifications or default for the next 12 months, declining significantly. So all of those things to us are encouraging. Given you referred to my comments, I'll go quickly and Christian may want to add. I think our language on the strategic environment in Europe has been consistent throughout Deutsche Bank. I don't think it's a God-given right, but given the business that we do, our size, our home market and our sort of global capabilities, we think we are well positioned to be -- to play a leading role in time. We've also been consistently clear that we didn't see that time as having come. And that remains the case today. We've been consistent in our messaging that as we look to 2025, executing on our strategies delivering profitability, demonstrating its sustainability, demonstrating the growth, we'll do more for our shareholders considerably than anything that's inorganic. And so I think we -- I want to just emphasize the consistency of our language, but also over time, the ambitions we have for the organization, but it's all over time. One last note to just make -- to your question, our opportunity set changes, no question. If, in fact, the combination that is muted does take place. But it's one of a number of opportunities that one could consider. I don't want to be drawn on what those look like or when, but as you can imagine, we've given thought to the question you posed over the years.",

And into next year, how does that -- how does the €500 million valuation timing differences, which we've seen year-to-date, feed into the revenue guidance for next year? And then secondly, it's been a whole [ph] based question, but does the general consensus that as long as rates stay between 2% to 3%, everything is fine.

In Q4, I'd say, well, one thing that is not built into the guidance that we referred to is potential performance fees on the asset management side, which they are -- the way they are accounted for, they're not certain until the year is done and final. We do see, as you say, sequential growth in O&A, that's encouraging and that would help against the 7.1 that we're looking at for Q4. And if I just kind of walk forward the momentum we've had so far in FIC markets this year that should also produce, I think, a very solid quarter and contributed to the run rate. So we're encouraged there. Look, the corporate and other lines are hard to predict just by the nature. Valuation and timing, the nice thing this year really in the third quarter, remember, in the first quarter, we had some losses and valuation timing that were -- because of their short nature, actually, the pull to par happen very quickly. There is some longer-dated pull to par that we can already see going forward. It's not a big part of what we're planning for 2025. And overall, I'd say 2025 would probably be a reversal to some degree, from 2024. But it's always hard to predict what goes in those lines. They're very market dependent.

To be fair, that's what the market expects in terms of a terminal rate in euros. Remember, though, that this is long-term rates. And so the scenarios of a steepening curve especially as you see less liquidity in the market, maybe higher fiscal deficits and other things, you could actually, in the long end, even in scenarios where the short goes down further see higher long-end rates. So it's not just the level, but also the shape of the curve. And what we look at this hard in treasury in our ALCO and ALM processes, how do we lock in as much of the future not just simply by rolling ten years, which is a big part of it for sure, but also by thinking about sort of option structures and other things that can protect specific sort of curve shapes over time.

So next, the Q1 impact is operational risk related. Q1 2026 would be FRTB related. The OCI filter item that I talked about with Kian would also be a feature then whatever that number is in 2026. So those are the build items that are still left ahead of us. I think, as I say, there are also the possibility of things taking place that give benefits against that future. I mentioned the sectoral buffer against mortgages in Germany, considerably a delay in FRTB. So is the nature of the beast here is that it's a bit of a moving target. But with all of the things that we can see right now, we feel very comfortable in our path. On the leverage, well, the AVA item, which I take to be the question, so the EBA Q&A on additional valuation adjustments, I'm not aware of any real -- any sort of movement there. I know there was an exposure sort of draft, as I might call it, a lot of feedback for the industry, but there hasn't been a reissuance of that. We do, obviously, have very strong views about the ideas that were laid out in the EBA draft. That would be a headwind to our current expectations in capital plan, but we also think that those ideas were excessively conservative and would argue strongly around that.

Look, what makes us confident is, first of all, the overall positioning and foundation, which we have built over the last 4 or 5 years as a Global Hausbank to our clients, the momentum -- the development in all 4 businesses, feedback from clients. To be honest, in all the last 3 or 4 years, we not only met our revenue targets, but even exceeded that in the years really makes me confident that from the offering we have from the positioning we have is actually the right starting point also for the next years. And that feedback, Nicolas, we get continuously back from our clients, be it institutional clients, corporate clients and private clients. And let me also say that, in particular, the geopolitical items which we are facing in this world, in this regard, to be honest, support us, people want our advice. Corporates talk to us on their amended networks. So the mandates we get from the corporate side, from the institutional side, is, again, something which really makes me confident and is on a level which we haven't seen before. Now to the bridge from €30.1 billion, to be honest, to €32 billion. What makes me confident and how do we see that? I would really kind of divide that in three parts: Number one, it's €400 million coming from NII, and that is obviously reflecting the hedging which we have already put in place. This will, in particular, come from the PV and the CV side. And on top of that, we see also the growth in our fixed financing. So that is approximately €400 million, which we will see also the good work which we have done on the treasury side with our business. So that is locked in. Now the next thing is, and we always talk about, so to say, the more predictable business we see approximately €800 million, if not even a bit more, from the more predictable business. And that, in particular, is the Private Bank, Asset Management and the Corporate Bank. Now in those, you have approximately €400 million from the Corporate Bank. That, again, comes from active repricing monetizing our existing clients, scaling the business which we have invested in. If you look into our investment, which we have done in '23 -- in '24, but in particular, looking at the investment plan for '25, a high degree and partially the highest amounts in those years and in particular, in 25% goes into the Corporate Bank to really scale up our offering. And you have seen the overall development of the corporate bank, which is at the core of our franchise. And therefore, I can see at least this €400 million of uptick in the year 2025. And again, if I look at the mandates, which we are constantly winning how the year started, I'm very optimistic here. The other €400 million is in particular coming from the PB and asset management side. And here, a lot of prework has been done. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about the growth in the assets under management on both sides, the private bank and the asset management side. So obviously, with the fees generated out of that, we will see higher returns. There is no drag on the NII side. I talked about the initial €400 million. So therefore, we can clearly see with the increased volume, higher revenues. Last but not least, I also said that in the discussions before, which we had on a quarterly side, there is a lot of momentum also in Germany, actually in the retail bank I think Germany, one of the biggest problems and challenges we have is actually with our pension plans in the next years. And more and more, this is -- these are the discussions, which we have with our clients. And again, then applying that to 15 million Postbank clients now being on our IT platform is a huge opportunity for us and [indiscernible] is banking on that. That brings us those €2 billion to €1.2 billion. So you are kind of at €31.2 million, €31.3 billion. Where is the rest coming from? €500 milion to €600 million, in particular, in the Investment Bank from the O&A business. I think James and I talked a lot about that over the last 18 months. We did on purpose the investments in the middle of 2023, not only Numis, but in particular, also the hirings of senior directors in the Corporate Finance business. I think we could show with the growth rates in 2024 that this started to pay off. I'm really proud what [indiscernible] has done in that business. Look at the Q4 numbers in the O&A business. We clearly outperformed the market. And I can see that this momentum is going on. So we believe that actually in the O&A market, we can increase our market share by approximately 50 basis points to approximately 3 percentage points. And then I also do believe that actually the fee pool, in particular, given what is happening in this world with the growth momentum we see in the U.S. will be higher next year. But the real impact the majority of the €500 million to €600 million is clearly coming from now that the investments are fully paying off and that we increase our market share. Now that already brings us almost very close to the €32 billion. I haven't talked about the FIC business because, obviously, in particular, [indiscernible] is not standing still. We have done significant investments, in particular, in Latin America, but also North America in our business. watch the credit trading business, also with the recent hires, which we have done summer last year and obviously, which we are paying off more and more. And therefore, I do believe that we have also a chance to grow there. So in this regard, that is the bridge for us from €30 million to €32 billion. Obviously, the confidence level, which James and I have and Fabrizio and Claudio is also sparked by a first good month. Now we know we cannot rest here, 1 month is 1 month. But the overall momentum in this bank to drive this, the feedback from the clients also last week in Davos is clearly telling me this is achievable, and I'm sure we can show you that already at the end of April. Second part on the share buybacks. Look, I do believe that James and I have also -- have always managed this bank in a prudent and conservative way, i.e., in particular, to your question, €1 billion to €750 million. First of all, I'm really happy with the starting point in which we start into this measurement here of 2025, 13.8% capital ratio gives us actually the ammunition, on the one hand, to grow business and have the right resources. That's all in our plans. But at the same time, obviously, also reward our shareholders. With the €750 million, which we announced and we should not forget that the 50% increase in dividends, we actually announced to the market already a distribution of €2.1 billion for this year. I think it's a wonderful starting point. And actually, if you move that up, we are now at €5.4 billion. If we think about our past, which we gave to the market in particular with regard to growing our distribution and also the dividends and you apply the next increase on the dividends for next year, you are already very, very close to the €8 billion. Now I think -- and that's what our approach is. Let us deliver on our business execution in the next month to deliver the 10% return on equity. Of course, we will review our distributions in the course of the year on the basis of our performance as, at the end of the day, we know that we also want to reward the shareholders, but I think it's a good and prudent start into the year. And let me end also with one thing, absolute confidence that we will do that what we promised to you to distribute more than €8 billion in the years '21 to '25, including the payouts in '26.",

And then on the -- how should we think about it at the divisional level on how the higher cost base comes through in terms of -- also in terms of the cost-income ratio target and in comparison, you previously provided cost-income ratio target at your previous Capital Markets Day. And then just the 62.5, is that now a target that's not in reach? Or does it remain a longer aspiration, something you might potentially discuss in the course of the year. And then last question, I mean, obviously, this is a bit of a disappointment on the Q4 performance. What should give us the confidence that Q4 2025 doesn't give us a similar disappointment. And then that aspect, I think the nonoperating costs at the €400 million looks relatively low.

    "text": "It's James here. A lot to talk about, but all the right questions on the cost side for sure. So let me go in a little bit of a mixed order. On the nonoperating costs, look, start with restructuring and severance. We have a significant amount sort of I don't know practically all, but we've come such a long way in terms of the transformation of the company that there is not a great deal left to do, and we control that number. When I say not a great deal, there's still some work that Claudio and his team are doing on the private bank, you've seen that. But of course, we've taken some into Q4 to enable us to take some actions already in 2025. But for practical purposes, we're through the major transformation of the company. On the litigation side, the way I think about it is that there's a funnel of matters that can result in outflows in any given period of time. And that funnel is simply emptied. Now not in the right way. Obviously, in 2024, we had some surprises and there can always be unknown unknowns. But of the known items, the funnel is simply empty or [indiscernible] empty and the risks that we can see are remote, both in terms of time and likelihood. So we feel really good about the trajectory now on the normalization of nonoperating costs, and that counts -- that goes for Q4 next year. Obviously, we're -- we have every incentive not to deliver another quarter in which there's a kind of a messy Q4 -- another year in which there's a messy Q4. If I go to the Investor Day numbers, and this goes all the way back to 2022. But there actually, I see really good progress. So if I look to the business sort of plans for this year or the business cost income ratios in our plan, really encouraging progress. Now these weren't formal targets, but definitely a guide for you. And we see the -- both Corporate Bank and Investment Bank within the range. Corporate Bank may be towards the high end of the range, Investment Bank towards the middle of the range and asset management also very, very close to the top end of the range. So really good progress in those businesses. The Private Bank at this point will clearly be above the range. But actually, the underlying performance of the Private Bank is very encouraging in absolute terms are coming in very close to what we had factored in at the time. But there carrying the burden of really two things that some of where the incremental investment of controls and technology has gone in the years. And also as we've refined our internal cost allocations, you remember we've talked about driver-based cost management, it's tended to be shifted some of the expenses to the Private Bank. So overall, we're encouraged by what we see and there's still work to do. We don't think the trajectory for the businesses or the group ends with 2025. That gets me to your second -- to your third question, sorry. No, we're not cashiering the 62.5 forever. We think that the operating leverage that we've built and will continue to see in the company will take the cost income ratio further down in the years to come. And so we absolutely think that, that is within reach of the firm, but not in 2025. And so that then gets you to what has driven the costs up to the -- our current view of 20.3 on the old FX. Look, it's a bunch of drivers. And again, cumulatively, since the last Capital Markets Day, I would probably bucket as 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. It's sort of €600 million or €700 million over that time, if you express it in cost/income ratio terms and about 1/3 has gone into business investments, about 1/3 into control and the further 1/3 into technology, if I give you rough rough numbers, probably a little bit more weighted towards technology in that math. Now you've seen us make those decisions. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we think they are the right decisions for the company. Controls are the license to operate. And back in '22, we relatively quickly recognized we needed more investment to close out the control improvements to meet our own expectations and those of the regulators and that investment has continued. On technology, that's been sustained over the past several years. And as you know, our business very much competes on the technology that you can provide across a whole range of activities, including the client experience. And we think it's the right decision, therefore, to continue and sustain that investment. On the business side, this really goes back to the 2023 investment opportunity we saw particularly in the investment bank at the time. And we like how that investment is paying off and will pay off in the years to come. And so it's, if you like, the cumulative impact of those things that have carried into the costs for this year, if you're in the deep detail of why now and what wasn't visible to us last year, look, as we went through a planning cycle I would say, in addition to all of the above, inflation has run maybe $100 million in express just in '25 terms, higher than we might have have expected at the time. And as I say, so cumulatively, those are the drivers that have driven us to where we are now. Again, a lot of that has been offset by the very good work we've been doing under Rebecca's leadership on the efficiency program. And as Christian mentioned in his remarks, we've made enormous progress towards the €2.5 billion goal in terms of cost takeout, and there is more to come thereafter because I said in the last call, it's like peeling an onion, we see more opportunity as we get deeper into the transformation and deeper into some of the process improvements that we make.",

    "text": "Great questions again, lots to go through there. Let me start on the easy stuff, and I'll give the harder questions. The FX impact, you're absolutely right to draw attention to it because what we wanted to do in our presentation was give you numbers that are consistent with what we've talked about for the past year. And hence, the presentation is largely -- is presented in what we would call plan FX levels, where euro-dollar was around [indiscernible]. And then we give you the translation into December FX, which was about [indiscernible]. And so that difference and creates on the revenue side, a number where $2 billion translates to about €32.8 billion. And on the expense side, as you say, 20.8 translates to 21.2. In the relationship between euros and dollars, dollar strengthening actually helps our margin just a little bit. And here, I refer to you to the currency breakout of revenues, expenses on Page 36, where you can see that there's a little bit of asymmetry in dollar euro, where we have more revenues than expenses expressed in dollars, and that drives, therefore, just a little bit of FX improvement on the margin. Now that relationship will change over the course of the year. So we'll continue to give you reporting that shows the year-on-year variances created by FX. One of the reasons we're talking about absolute numbers is always challenging given that change. And just to complete the picture, in case the question comes up, we do hedge the sterling risk. You'll see that there's also an asymmetry in sterling. We hedge that forward. It's rolling, so it's not forever. But the euro-sterling currency differences don't really change the in-year number is a great deal. Kian, you had a follow-up?",

    "text": "Looking on the Mittelstand [ph] Germany -- sorry, I was on mute. On the Mittelstand, Germany, a very good question. Look, there are 3 or 4 areas where we are obviously enhancing our business and also making sure that our portfolio with the Mittelstand not only growing, but the profitability of the portfolio, like indicated by the way, on Page 9 is further improving. Number one, we are going through this portfolio also from an SBA point of view. Clearly, one where we can do better, where we have done already action. And in particular, here, where our underlying process, which is also part of Page 9, i.e., how do we set up this bank front-to-back processes in the lending business making sure that we don't have different processes for the various financing or payment flows that we are streamlining this. This is one area where actually a lot of investments of the Corporate Bank going into the setup into the platform and the streamlining the German setup. So it will add just from an efficiency point of view, we will see a very positive impact there. Number two, of course, with the focus on the corporate bank in 2019, we also -- and I can say that here also with a little bit of pride, we absolutely regain credibility and trust in the German home market. And if I look at our market shares in not only obviously the DUCs company, but in the Mittelstand, be it the bigger family-owned companies, the Mittelstand itself, but also in the small business areas, we have actually gained momentum. We increased the revenues because the clients are feeling that Deutsche Bank wants to do that business. That was different before 2018. And with the constant improvements also process-wise, we obviously succeed. Thirdly, we have invested into our coverage. For Germany, if you want to really bank it in the best way, you need to be regionally. We have invested into our people here in order to make sure with the right coverage. And fourthly, yes, you alluded to that. Now obviously, I'm not talking in detail about that, but each situation in the industry is providing a huge opportunity. There is uncertainty in the market, you know what I'm talking about. And that obviously is a chance and opportunity for us, and we have started to work on this, and I'm sure more to come. So Mittelstand, Germany, is from a profitability point of view, efficiency point of view and from a growth, absolutely a focus. And let me also say, because I'm sure I'll get the next question, but we are not doing that at any price. We also need to take into account the situation, the economy. And therefore, we will not alter our underwriting standards because that would bite us and therefore, we keep the underwriting standards which we had. But doing this, we can see a clear growth here at home.",

It's what we can now work with over the next several years in a more fine-tuned way than previously, with each of the businesses looking at the drivers of their SBA or profitability against the resources that they deploy. It means we can grow revenues through things like repricing and just business growth. We can manage the expenses down, leveraging some of the tools we've built over the years, including driver-based cost management. And we can also work with the businesses to reduce the capital burden and there the efforts we've gone to create resources efficiency on the RWA side is also helping. To give you an example of where we are using these tools to make decisions, we talked about the mortgage product and especially in our home market and the deemphasis over the past couple of years of that product. It's part because at various prices, the product didn't meet its hurdles. Middle market lending equally in Germany is something we need to improve the profitability of, as Christian says, it's strategically critical. It needs to sort of carry itself from a profitability perspective as well. There are other portfolios all around the company that we're working with the businesses very closely on. And the level of engagement in this work is extremely high, which is -- which gives us a lot of optimism about how these levers can be pulled over the next several years to drive a very significant impact in bringing each of the units up and also the average.",

Are we talking just a few days? Or are we talking several months before this gets launched? And then on the questions, first is actually coming back to the CET1 trajectory and distribution plans. And thank you, Christian, for clarifying how the performance is going to play into potentially more distribution. But I also wanted to draw the attention on the regulatory risk here because my understanding is that the Basel IV first time implementation is now expecting to cost you just €5 billion additional RWA, so not the €7.5 billion that had initially been guided. Obviously, this discussion ongoing on whether FRTB implementation in Europe is going to be delayed. I know no decision has been made yet, but assuming this would get delayed by another year, could that mean also upside risk to your distribution plans for 2025 beyond the actual performance itself? And then a word on provisions that we haven't discussed too much yet. I think the guidance you provide for 2025 points to €1.4 billion to €1.6 billion of provisions. Consensus is right in the middle at €1.5 billion. So just if you could discuss where is the risk on that number, whether to the upside or the downside, what gives you the confidence, the visibility on that number with a special word also, if you can, on the U.S. commercial real estate portfolio, especially U.S. offices after the Fed is more likely now to keep rates higher for longer?",

    "text": "Also great questions. And for the others, I won't say great questions again. So don't be insulted if I don't repeat that. So briefly on the start of the buyback program. Look, every year, we start with the buybacks that offset employee share deliveries against previous year compensation. So it actually takes a little while until we complete that and so we would only start the €750 million once that is done. It takes a little bit of time, but we're in the market really for most of the first quarter with the former buyback. As is last -- was the case last year, I can see some of this amount slipping into the early part of Q3, but we would expect to get the bulk of it done earlier than that. On the -- I'll talk about the trajectory on CRR3. Look, it's more or less where we thought it'd be. And yes, there are a bit still to come. So there's a bit of a round trip in the first quarter. Because in the technical details of CRR3, the OpRisk RWA doesn't hit you January 1, but only really moderately first. But the net number of about 15 basis points down, there's a -- it's about 5 basis points up in our estimates on January 1 and then 20 basis points to come on OpRisk RWA. There are some modest adjustments also in and credit risk that come into it. That trajectory is encouraging. But as Christian says, we need to kind of seeing how the year develops and actually, the calculations are relatively new and fresh. And so it will take time for the systems, the models and what have you to settle a little bit, and we'll be back to you. On FRTB, that is an opportunity. Naturally, we need to plan with the expectation that, that will be implemented in January of next year, and we would stick with the estimate of around really €7.5 billion of impact in RWA from the first of the year, '26. I think there's a decent likelihood it will be delayed just because I think we all believe and so does some of the legislators that creating a competitive disadvantage for the European banks in this area, waiting until FRTB implementation comes to the United States and the U.K. would be unnecessarily damaging. And hence, we do think that's an opportunity. And at a point in time where it's more certain, it can enter into our capital trajectory and thinking. I would add that there's some other potential changes in our requirements going forward that can impact, say, MDA. And then lastly, on CLP, it's a relatively wide range. I think if you asked us today, we'd probably stay closer to the top end of the range, given that we still have to see, as you say, commercial real estate, the moderation take place, we're looking at the domestic middle market portfolio, as we've talked about in the past, in the economic environment that's still uncertain. But we do and hence, the confidence about moderation, we do think we're at the back end of this credit cycle. So from what we see today, we're quite confident about the improvement. €1.6 billion, so the high end would represent about 33 basis points, which as you know from our prior years and also prior guidance, would be relatively at a higher end for us. But obviously, there's a lot still to kind of water to pass under the bridge between now and the end of the year. Hopefully, that covered all your questions, Flora.",

    "text": "So Julie, I'll start with the first on MDA and Christian will talk to the private bank. Look, MDA, right, has gone up for us to around a little bit over 13.3%. And that, therefore, drives our views on the level of CET1 that we need to run at with an appropriate buffer against that. And of course, the 13.8% is a good place to be in that regard. There will be some changes, as we talked about FRTB denominator impact, but also potentially some changes in MDA. One example would be our OSII positioning might take a year. But given our relative score in terms of G-SIFI ness, call it, we would expect to be coming down in our G-SIB over time as an example. The second is inside our numbers, you have the mortgage sectoral buffer, which is already -- which is also impacting how we're capitalized. So my point is that the level of capitalization that we operate at now and the gap to MDA that's implied by it is a conservative point, let's put it that one on both numbers.",

And by the way, if we digest and really divide the private bank, the real challenge, which we are working on in Retail Germany. Now when you look at the levers, first of all, at the start, we see a good revenue momentum in the private bank, by the way, also in Retail Germany. So overall, the private bank will go by approximately €400 million year-over-year. Secondly, one of the largest cost takeouts also in absolute numbers is next year again in the Private Bank in Germany or that what James also said, where we put restructuring costs for the further fallout, so to say, in a positive way from the IT technology transfer from Postbank to Deutsche Bank is paying off. So also there from a cost point of view, it's another and not only low 3-digit million number where actually, Claudio is reducing costs in the private bank. And thirdly, James gave you another example from an RoTE point of view, we have certain portfolios or some portfolios in the private bank, where from an SBA methodology, we are simply not rewarding our shareholders. And at the end of the day, our capital in a sufficient way. And that is the third lens where with repricing, but also with reallocating capital, we are improving the picture. One bit only that you also see there is full attention on, and we are working on it. If you just look at Q4 2024 and you look at Claudio's private bank costs versus Q4 2023, we had a reduction of 9%. That shows you that there is full focus on that transition that we know we need to get the cost down. The plans are there. Implementation is underway.

If I look at solid performance in Q4 financing revenues, if I just sort of run rate that through 2025, that's obviously imperfect, but that would sell for effectively all of the €200 million increase year-over-year in the guidance. So just any kind of color you can give in terms of FIC growth on our line line basis? And then secondly, deposit growth was quite strong in the Private Bank in Q4.

    "text": "So Chris, the FIC financing revenues are in the more predictable revenue stream bucket, so the 40% in Christian's Slide 7, so contributing to that €800 million. FIC market, to your point, would be the €200 million or €300 million of contribution in the -- in what we characterize as the remain revenue streams. In FIC financing, however, there's -- as you know, it splits between carry and revenues. We're quite encouraged given the 12% growth we had now just in the fourth quarter about our ability to continue growing that revenue stream. So it should do at least €100 million, maybe some more in NII and then earn additional fees, I would think, fee growth. But just to clarify, in the buckets, the rest of FIC markets, so rates, credit and emerging markets would -- and FX would be the balance of the remaining revenue stream number. In terms of deposit growth, we've seen quite strong deposit growth. And actually, what's been encouraging is it has shifted back into site deposits from term. And that's, as we talked about, being helpful for the margin on the deposit side. We are expecting considerable growth in both of the deposit businesses in 2025. I can't give you precise numbers. But we see liquidity in the marketplace and the ability to put on liabilities at attractive prices and SBA. The one caveat I do want to mention, though, is we talked last quarter about a couple of relatively concentrated deposit levels. So we're sort of -- as those wind down, we are offsetting the runoff of a couple of concentrated deposits. And hence, you'll see the net of those 2 in the numbers over the course of the year. Also Q4, as we had a year -- actually 2 years ago, represents a relatively high print. So I would see us sort of recovering to the Q4 level over the course of Q1, maybe into Q2 and then more of that growth flowing through into the back half of the year.",

    "text": "Thanks for the question, Stefan. Just briefly, we love our asset management business. We think DWS is really well positioned in today's markets. And having now exceeded the €1 trillion or dollar level, we can see that it has scale and profitability and also growth prospects. And so while we obviously see what's going on strategically in the market around us, we think we're well positioned. On the market risk RWA side, you're absolutely right, $19 billion is correct and it represents a relatively low level. Two reasons. One is year-end is often just like seasonally below. And secondly, you will have seen in the VAR numbers relatively low VAR, some of which reflects the volatility in the market and not so much the book. And hence, we would expect some amount of recovery, if you like, or an increase in market risk RWA during the course of the year. As it relates to the credit hedges, I need to double check the number, but it's sort of orders of magnitude around $100 million, a little bit more, I think, in the businesses, mostly reflected in remaining income in the businesses. And some in interest income. So a bit of a split depending on whether you see it in the investment bank or the corporate bank. And those hedges, we've talked about, I think, $42 billion of total sort of, if you like, hedges. Those hedge volumes, we well, we'll look to grow from here given what we say, I said about SRTs and the market availability. But these are ongoing programs that we have.

And given you haven't changed the revenue guidance the $25 million, but you have the costs, what is the payback period on those investments. Do you think you're going to see that come through in '26, '27, that would be useful. And then my second question is just on that revenue bridge. Thank you for the very granular answer you gave earlier around the core divisions and see how that adds up to €2 billion. But at the same time, James also gave guidance on the corporate center or €200 million loss per quarter, which would see suggest you would have much lower revenue contribution from the corporate center, given how much that contributed in Q2 and Q3 of '24.

    "text": "Thanks, Andrew. I think it was slightly distinct the line, but I hope I caught everything. So in reverse order, the corporate center, and I think something interesting to point out on Page 5 of the deck, we talked in earlier quarters that there can be some volatility that's created by the corporate center. But I'd said at the time that it ultimately typically nets to 0 over the course of the year. And that was the case in '24, and we expect it to be the case in '25. So at the very bottom of the chart on the left, you can see that's our current expectation, but some of it is hard to predict, given, for example, valuation and timing differences are market related. But hopefully, that's a good indication. On the cost side, the walk I gave earlier to say it was about 1/3 of each of business investments, technology and controls was sort of a multiyear view going from our last Investor Day. More recently, what has been the places where we've put additional investment. I'd say the corporate bank, probably the first destination in terms of some plans that we've actually been working on for some time, but now have decided to implement, which is actually relatively broad-based in the corporate bank, but as an acceleration of some hiring and also technology investments that David Linn and his team have identified and are ready to execute and have begun the execution of -- in Private Bank, there are some technology investments that we had been kind of waiting to make decisions on, but feel are important to make, again, to keep pace with the industry where, as you can all see, in your own, I'm sure, personal lives, there's a bit of an arms race going on in terms of the capabilities for digital banking as well as some of the physical infrastructure there and then a little bit sort of a reacceleration of hiring on the RM side in that business. And then lastly, we've talked about O&A. We've -- I think we've largely completed the build-out of O&A, but there are a handful of additional hires that we've made and we've talked about also on the FICC market side, again, all of which we see as supportive of revenue, not just in '25, but in the years beyond. And so I just do want to emphasize that management's decision-making as we went through this most recent plan cycle has been not just about supporting performance in '25, but making sure we're building the company to be sustainably profitable and growing in profitability. In the years beyond, which actually one last thing to say. We look also at the 26 consensus where, as you can imagine, from the chart, especially Christian's Page 9 you can see an even greater divergence between what we believe the trajectory of the company is and what is currently in the consensus Mr. Coombs is still connected.

But you can work out the starting point average from our public accounts is about 1.5%, given all that took place in 2024, we think there's scope to more than double that average level over the next couple of years. And so that is, again, underscores a little bit the confidence that we have about the trajectory going forward. and the tools that we've built. Now some of that has to do with the costs, especially nonoperating costs from 2024 falling away. But a lot of it has to do with the levers for growth that Christian talked about steady kind of cumulative operating leverage across the businesses that we see. And then to your point, some amount of efficiency of the usage of the capital. We don't see though declining from here. So I just want to emphasize that if you're at around about $360 million over the years, we would -- especially given CRR3 and the other changes, that number would still grow by make up a number of $20 billion even with the efficiencies that we're putting through. So it is a significant amount of impact from operating leverage over time and all the other levers we've talked about.",

But obviously, a lot has changed in terms of the operating environment in the past few weeks. In some of the businesses, I suppose that's supported higher activity levels, but in other parts of the group, client activity would have cooled meaningfully. So how does that picture look for you across the group? And where are there, I guess, substitution opportunities for you? For example, let's say, a CapEx-related loan is delayed, but now the client needs additional short-term working capital finance. And then second, more medium term. On Slide 6, you outlined these kind of big emerging trends, which looks set to determine the competitive landscape over the coming years. I guess, simply, what gives you the confidence that following the transformation of the business, Deutsche Bank has the right footprint and the right risk and control set up to succeed against this backdrop, i.e., to take market share and to capitalize on those growth opportunities?",

    "text": "Thank you, Chris. Let me take your questions first, and James should add, of course. Look, like we said in the prepared remarks with regard to the full year revenue picture and our goal and our confidence in the €32 billion, obviously, first quarter helps a lot. We outperformed not only the consensus, we, to be honest, also are ahead of our own plan in the first quarter, which gives us all the confidence that we can keep the momentum and that we will see the €32 billion also at year-end. So first quarter helps a lot. Secondly, Chris, I'm really happy with the diversification in our business. And if you really tear it apart, then you can see that many of our businesses will actually be unaffected by that what we have seen in early April or are even benefiting from that over time. We can see a very stable and continuous development in the Private Bank, very positive, stable delivery path, supported by an ongoing growth in assets under management. So I would say also with having the monthly performance review meetings with Claudio, that this is a continuous path, which we enjoy, both in Personal Banking, also with additional deposit campaigns, but in particular, in the Wealth Management business with our Investment business. Similar good momentum in Asset Management, very happy with the first quarter results. We always forgot to mention also that I really have to congratulate Stefan also for reemerging into the Amdocs [ph] with DWS. It really shows that there is momentum behind the business is very positive on the outlook. Also here, I would say, with that what we have seen in April, also with the way they have managed the performance for our clients, it's actually a very good and convincing picture. And therefore, we stay the course on Asset Management, and there is, in our view, no concern that we will miss our full year results. In the Corporate Bank, we had a little bit of a weaker start in Q1. Fortunately, we offset that with the over delivery in all the other businesses. And therefore, I'm saying we are even stronger in Q1 than our own internal plan. But the nice thing is actually that the Corporate Bank will accelerate from here. So the sequential performance, we believe that we will see slight increases in revenues quarter-over-quarter from where we are right now. We can already see also a little bit more of demand in the Credit business, in the Financing business, in the Corporate Bank. We saw it already at the end of the first quarter. Now obviously, this did not or was not fully reflected then in the P&L for the first quarter, but you could see an increase in demand at the end of the first quarter, which also gives us the confidence going forward. And linked to your second question, I will get back to that. Look, in particular, what is happening also in Germany is a huge opportunity for our Corporate Bank, and I will talk about that positioning in a bit. On the Investment Bank, to be honest, I'm super happy with our FIC business. I think, again, we have shown that not only we performed very well in Q1, but also that we took market share. If I compare that with the numbers which we have seen from our peers, Q1 was another example that Deutsche Bank took market share in the FIC business. If we go deeper into FIC, to be honest, yes, we have seen some weaker days in the first half of April. But to be honest, we are back to normal, so to say, in the second half. And the outperformance in Q1 will carry us through the year and will also carry us through the somewhat weaker days in the first half of April. So I'm honestly very happy with that business. And don't forget that in that business, in the FIC business, we have a very stable financing business, where I would even say that the opportunities, which the market now presents in the financing business, also in areas like distressed and credit trading, are actually really good. And from our capital position, the power we have to invest there, I'm actually optimistic. So in this regard, there are pockets also in FIC, where we can benefit from the situation. And again, in the second half of April, we are absolutely back to normal flow business. And that then actually remains with the question, O&A. I'm actually satisfied with Q1 in O&A. You know that we had the one markdown, which we already mentioned also to the market mid of March. Outside that, O&A actually behaved very, very strong. If I now look forward with a very robust pipeline, stronger pipeline than before, and there is no deal canceled. Yes, we see some delayed deals, but no deal is canceled. And I do believe actually that with where the markets are right now, where I do believe we move, that I can see that actually Q2, Q3 with that robust pipeline is actually enjoying quite healthy numbers in the O&A business. So all in all, looking at the outperformance in Q1, looking at the chances and opportunities we see in the Private Bank, and part of the FIC businesses, the continuous inflow on Asset Management and now the acceleration in the Corporate Bank makes me absolutely comfortable with our €32 billion revenue goal. With regard to your second question, look, I really do see for the time being 3 trends. And this is where James and I try to focus the bank on in terms of delivery and client delivery. Number one, and let me start with that, in my view, is the global volatility, uncertainty clearly also with our clients. But here, the concept of the Global Hausbank is working. And we said it in the previous quarters and again in Q1, but also in particular in April, we can see that the demand for advice, the demand of a global bank with a global network is higher than ever before. And I also see actually that a lot of clients, and we even have tangible examples in the O&A business, in the Corporate Bank business where clients want to actually see the European alternative to the U.S. banks, in particular, in a world which is more fragmented than before. So the setup as the Global Hausbank, with strong roots here in our home market, clearly helps us. Secondly, I have been on the record with supporting statements of that, what we will see from the new coalition. I do think that Germany can digest actually the additional debt, which you intend to take on in order to do investments. There are huge opportunities to leverage that with private debt, to leverage that with financings. And that's actually what we started to see at the end of March. And therefore, we're saying we see in the Corporate Bank that there is a trend with regard to financing, which goes into the right direction. And I do believe if the government is taking the right decisions over the next 3 months, and you have heard actually Friedrich Merz that he is intending to take some accelerated decisions before the summer break. That will be actually very good for the atmosphere, for the psychology in the country, for the consumption in the country, and obviously, we will benefit from that in the various business lines. Thirdly, we should not forget all the acceleration also when it comes to Capital Markets Union or better said, Savings & Investment Union in Europe. Again, the focus is on banks with the capital markets business. We have seen the reallocation of funds already to Europe over the last weeks. We have clearly seen that also in our flows. And to be honest with that, what is happening in Brussels, together with that, what is happening in Germany, I think we are rightly placed to benefit from that. All that with the outperformance in Q1 makes me really confident that we can achieve our goals and that we will achieve our goals on the revenue side but also on the profitability side.",

    "text": "Sure. Thanks, Kian. I'll start on the fixed guidance that we've given or commentary about the market. Look, I think one important thing is to say is that the second half of April, and it isn't precisely in halves, but I think the easiest way to think about it is second half of April, resumed a pattern that looked very much like what you see in the disclosure on daily trading results in the FIC business for much of the first quarter. So to your question about ongoing, it isn't a concern for us at the moment at all. In fact, I think we're well positioned to recapture the foregone revenues from the first half of April, as in the balance of the quarter. In fairness, we're actually up year-on-year still in April. So we look at this with sort of a relaxed view. Naturally in markets that are as turbulent as the ones we experienced in the first couple of weeks of April, you're going to see some correlations break down some impact on the books. But we were reasonably happy. So there was, of course, a slowdown in a few weekdays, but we were happy with how the desks performed in that environment, the way we were able to stand in to provide liquidity for clients, pricing, what have you. In terms of the products, it was a little sort of varied around the world. But to your point, credit struggled more, and there were elements of -- in the rates and FX complexes where again, correlations moving created some disturbance. What's interesting is how quickly and almost fully the markets have recovered over the course of April. Again, going to your question about is it an ongoing concern? As we sit here today, really, it's not. And actually, I've been positively impressed by the way in which investors have continued to be engaged in the environment that we have, which is reasonably fast moving. In terms of the outlook, lots of our assumptions are driven by macroeconomic variables, and I'll focus on revenues and expenses. And naturally, we look at downside scenarios. And that was the principal driver, of course, of the overlay that we took in provisions in Q1. We think that overlay was prudent and appropriate and actually reflects how the macroeconomic consensus has moved since the end of March. So we feel quite comfortable with how, if you like, first quarter reporting reflects our outlook as well as the consensus environment today. The other thing, just more broadly to the question you asked and really Christian's response to Chris's question, we see a lot of, what I'll call, sort of portfolio effects in our businesses. So businesses that are maybe negatively affected by certain elements of the macro environment will be offset by others that are benefited. And so it isn't at all linear. And we feel like the balance of risks and opportunities that we see in the market really underscores our outlook, as Christian just mentioned. And hence, we're feeling pretty good about the overall macro environment even as it's changed since the beginning of the year when we last spoke.",

Look, on the distribution, I stay to that what I said and what we said end of January because that was a clear outlook statement that, a, obviously, we have the approval for the €750 million, which started -- where we started the program early April. And then we clearly said that we want to deliver 2 quarters where we show that we are on track for our 10% RoTE. Now we are very happy with that what we have seen in Q1. You have heard from our kind of outlook statements, which we just reiterated that we remain comfortable on the 10%. And then we will reassess during the second quarter, obviously, the possibility of a second buyback, and we'll then start the discussions. But I would find it not fair actually if, on the one hand, I'm doing a clear statement in January and saying, I measure myself and we measure ourselves against the first 2 quarters and then I change track. Obviously, the outlook in the overall economy changed, we have shown that we can deal with that. We have shown that we have laid a very solid foundation, we are at 13.8%. And therefore, I feel overall pretty good about all this. But now we are focusing on delivery of a strong Q2. And then I'm sure we will reassess and have the discussion with our regulators.",

    "text": "And Nicolas, on the CLP side, it's very nuanced, but the easiest way to think about it is that the overlay represents about €70 million broken into 2 parts. One is as I just -- part of the answer to Kian's question is, we put it -- we assumed a set of macroeconomic variables that were more pessimistic than what were present in the market in March, and that represented about €50 million of the €70 million. And essentially, the consensus is caught up with that level. So we feel good that, that was appropriately calibrated. So €50 million on macroeconomic variables reflected in a forward-looking indicator overlay. And about €20 million reflecting what I'd call collective staging. So we've been looking not just recently, but for the past couple of quarters, either at sectors or individual obligors particularly exposed to tariffs. And that can be based on their own export activity, their supply chain, what we think the competitive environment for their business might be and how it will be affected by tariffs and so on. And so we took some actions around collective staging, and that represents really the other €20 million. To be fair, there's probably some amount in what I would think of as the baseline. So the rest of it is about €400 million. There's some of that €400 million actually would also reflect tariff-related impacts that have been sort of bleeding in as individual credit decisions for obligors are reflected, but the easiest way to think about it is €400 million run rate, which is in line with our guidance, and we always expected the first quarter to be a little higher than the rest of the year and €70 million of overlay broken out, as I described. As to the guidance, look, the wide end would have been about €1.6 billion. We note that consensus is a little higher than that already. And we think based on how Stage 3 is -- has developed, and we now see the evidence of that normalization that we called for. We think that's entirely reasonable -- would kind of imply about €375 million per quarter from here, which, absent a deterioration of macroeconomic variables, would be entirely achievable and to be expected, hence, sticking with the guidance.",

Would you expect a material impact in the second quarter that could possibly affect your second buyback decision? That's the first question. Second question is on the U.S. commercial real estate outlook. Christain, I think you gave some fairly constructive comments at the conference in the middle of March, a lower -- sorry, a higher rate trajectory didn't affect your expectations there. I was just wondering if you could give us an update whether there's been a significant change since then, whether you've reassessed your €0.5 billion stress loss for the commercial real estate portfolio. And then final question is just on when we can expect some more concrete targets for future years rather than simply a continuous improvement?

So the VaR outliers, we haven't triggered at this point over the threshold at which sVaR outliers would produce an increase in market risk RWA. And you've -- the sVaR did tick up at the beginning of the month, and we've managed that down through hedging and portfolio actions. So those risks are there in a -- if the market were to become disrupted later in the quarter, but we think the impact of what was present in the market in the first half of April has been managed. And at the moment, we don't see that presenting itself. On the CRE side, it's interesting. The market indicators are a little bit mixed. So office in the index is slightly down, I'll call it, flat. Leasing activity has actually ticked up, which is good. And of course, rates and sponsor behavior have, while they've moved around, largely unchanged. So our outlook for CRE continues to be where it was beginning of the year. We would see a steady improvement from the levels that we show you in Q1. In fact, there was only one new default in CRE in office in the U.S. this quarter. So what you have is essentially 100% of the provision associated with valuation adjustments on existing defaulted positions. And hence, I think we get closer to the point where you see a more dramatic decline in the provision levels. As you say, we're tracking a little bit closer sort of every quarter to the severe stress, but we don't see anything that would suggest another leg down in CRE, we're still in line with our earlier expectations.",

And the second question is about the increase in compensation expenses that you flagged that is coming partly from the rise in your share price.

    "text": "Thanks, Stefan. So the answer is both on FIC revenue. So we are obviously up big year-on-year in the first quarter. We're up slightly in April, in the month of April, and therefore, we remain up significantly year-on-year, year-to-date in FIC. And that's encouraging to see how the franchise strength, the investments that we've talked about, client engagement, all of those things sort of playing out as we hoped and have been -- and Ram and his team have been working to for such a long time. So it's encouraging development. And to the earlier question, if the market tone stays as it has been now in the second half of April and in the first quarter, we'd certainly recapture the weakness in the early days of April. On the compensation expenses, at the end of the day, it falls through to the expense line on a consolidated basis. Essentially, the group offers DWS some benefit of hedging that risk. It transfers and creates a revenue item for DWS that's then eliminated on consolidation at the group level, but the compensation cost impact shows up at the group on a consolidated basis. And actually, it represents year-on-year, a decent size of the increase. If I break the compensation numbers up, it's basically 4 parts, all about equal between €30 million and €40 million. Foreign exchange translation, the stock impact, variable compensation and then the net impact of fixed pay coming through, which we think is a good outcome, especially as a lot of that was then offset in non-comp expenses. On the NSFR, we wanted to tip our hat to the question that was raised in the EBA report. So on Page 28, we show you a number of more than 90% of our U.S. dollar asset side being funded by native U.S. dollar liabilities. Now NSFR by its definition doesn't include cross-currency funding, which is just a quirk or a feature of it. Including cross-currency funding, we'd be above -- safely above 100% on -- and we think our dollar liquidity position is extremely strong because essentially, the liabilities fund, a balance sheet that is, I'll call it, 80% loan-to-deposit and a significant amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets in dollars. If anything, our dollar funding is more robust than other currencies. So we saw that, and I think, hopefully, have provided with that one data point, a good response. I will say, and we maybe come up to this tomorrow on the fixed income call, there's a lot of I'll say, technology, limits, controls, maturity ladders and what have you that we apply to managing currency risks and the funding implications of currency risk on the balance sheet. So we think we've got a very, very strong, robust set of capabilities there.",

And you have, I think, 18% of your cost base in U.S. dollar, assuming the euro dollar remains where it currently is around 1.14, this should have I think, around 1% positive impact on your cost base year-on-year. So I'm just asking, is there -- would you say there is positive risk to your cost guidance for this year? Or not really because despite the good Q1, despite the FX tailwinds here, you think this could be offset somewhere else by the end of this year? The second question is on O&A revenues. I see you've dropped the guidance of the plus €600 million you expected for this year. I think it's clear what you've explained already on this call. Maybe just to ask, do you still think nevertheless, that you could expect an increase year-on-year or it could be flat or down?

You've seen that year-on-year in the first quarter, kind of the average was a €52 million upward movement in reported expenses that would flip around next quarter to some degree, depending on the path of the exchange rate. Remember, though, that because we have U.S. dollar revenues, it neutralizes more or less in pretax profit and in the ratios. There's a little bit of, I'll call it, tracking error, but by and large, the U.S. dollar nets out when you get to cost/income ratio, pretax profit and RoTE.",

Yes, we do believe that here, if we compare 2025 with 2024 that we will see an increase in O&A despite of that what we see in the markets right now. Therefore, again, I think it's really important to look at the probability weighted pipeline, which is still very robust. Also at the comment I made before that we haven't seen any canceled deals that we actually have seen a very nice development on the mandates, which we received. And therefore, if I take now Q1, if I look at the pipeline and the work we are doing on Q2. To be honest, I'm very confident that we will see O&A revenue numbers, which are ahead of last year. And again, given the diversification we have in the business is also the compensating business areas, even if we have a weakness in O&A versus our initial plan. We believe that this will be offset by other businesses and we have the really good cushion, which we have already established in Q1.",

And given kind of our strategic view as well as the decision to close the DSL channel, I think you'd expect to see some of that also persist in the year. Now again, our outlook statements about Private Bank are, I would say, bullish that we still see continued growth in the coming quarters. And so that would incorporate additional runoff of what we think of as capital-intensive portfolios. On the cost side, there was nothing special necessarily in the non-comp in Private Bank in the first quarter. We did have restructuring and severance, as you saw, most of the restructuring and severance charge that we took at the group level in the first quarter was in PB. We would expect that to lessen as the year goes by, maybe some more in Q2, but less in the second half of the year. There can be some seasonality in things like marketing expense and what have you. But by and large, what we'd expect to see is the continued impact over the coming quarters and into the subsequent years of the benefits of the sort of cumulative restructuring steps that we've taken around particularly branches, personnel, but also the impact now of more fully the benefits of the technology investments we've made in the past.",

And also with the pain we, in particular, took in the year 2023, it's paying off now. It's really paying off on the cost side. It's paying off in the way the clients are reacting. And I have to say that also one of the reasons why we are so confident to achieve the €32 billion and 10% RoTE is now that all the hard work is flowing through -- is going through the P&L of the Private Bank. So I would say there is a continuous improvement. Also the decision, by the way, because you talk about loans and mortgages, clear decision of one item which we subsummarized under Deutsche Bank 3.0 and this is SVA. It was a clear decision by the Finance department and Claudio's department to reduce mortgage lending under one brand, the DSL brand. That is SVA positive.

Can you share perhaps other clear opportunities for the SVA Bank to increase resource allocation in certain areas and also conversely where you expect to see perhaps clear restrictions? Also how this aligns the demand side, i.e., where are there growth opportunities, where you can allocate more capital from an SVA perspective. That's the first one. The second one is a question on NII, perhaps for James. Are you still expecting about the €300 million pickup in the banking book NII in 2025? Or has this also improved slightly, as you alluded to '26 and '27 have improved due the hedge [indiscernible]. And the last question would be on RWAs.

    "text": "Yes. Let me start, Mate, on your SVA question. So first of all, I'm delighted that this topic of SVA focus and day-to-day SVA management is now fully incorporated in the bank. And you can see that in our monthly performance review meetings that we are really driving the businesses and as such, the whole bank based on SVA. Now I'll just give you one example in the Private Bank. And to be honest, this is one example where we executed. And rest assured that, obviously, we are going through portfolio by portfolio, and in particular, on those portfolios where, so to say, we are SVA negative, we are looking what can we do? Now one item is where we're starting, and you have seen that also in the Private Bank is repricing and repricing will play a role in the Private Bank. Repricing will partially play a role in the Corporate Bank. If you think about our trade finance book and our lending book, there is a chance actually to reprice. And based on all the data we have, the methodologies we have in hand, we will do this. Secondly, if you think about SVA, it's not only about actually whether we allocated capital in the wrong way, it's actually about the underlying cost and process cost of running the business. And hence, we are very much in the detailed work to think about more efficient front-to-end processes, in particular in credit-related processes. Again, for instance, the German lending book, the trade finance book, David Lynne and the credit department are looking into a more efficient credit process end-to-end. That will lower the running cost of that business. And actually, I think it will or we think it will make the trick to bring it into a clear SVA-positive business. Thirdly, we are looking SVA also from a regional point of view, whether there are regional portfolios where we potentially do not have the significant market share where we can restructure or from a brand name point of view, like we did it for DSL mortgaging in Germany. So SVA actually is a combination of repricing client-by-client review, which Fabrizio is doing in the Investment Bank and in the Corporate Bank, looking at the 5- to 10-year history of clients, whether we have, so to say, continuous SVA-negative clients where we want to go and will go now into the debate with the discussion with the client, what else we can do in order to make that relationship a more profitable one, but it also goes over processes. And at the end of the day, we wouldn't mind to take decisions to also exit certain sub-portfolio, if we are not convinced that we can turn it into positive. And therefore, I think it will be one of the most significant levers we have to really raise our return on equity beyond the 10% return to a higher number. And the progress which we have seen over the last 3 months since we introduced it to you, end of January, is quite significant.",

    "text": "It actually feeds nicely into your third question, which is RWA. And so one of the levers beyond what Christian just talked about is looking at more capital relief transactions through securitization to help various businesses. And obviously, the market is broader and deeper than a few years ago. And so we're sort of going, if you like, more deeply into the portfolio to look for securitization opportunities. Now that takes some time. So I don't want to sort of over -- go out over our skis in terms of how much more is achievable this year. But I'd certainly see us achieving the €30 billion target, maybe slightly more than that in '25. But at that point, sort of we move into the future, and we will continue looking at capital optimization in the years to come. The opening up of securitization markets with the Savings & Investment Union initiatives will obviously help in that regard. And the measurement of businesses by SVA makes them less inclined to hold on to revenues if they're being measured at, if you like, the very bottom line. In banking book NII, our guidance is basically consistent with where we were at the beginning of the year. There are obviously moving parts in that ocean. Rates have moved, but as you see, our hedging has protected us and we don't see an impact from the rate environment. We do see a benefit, as we mentioned, in the years beyond 2025 as the long-term rate curve has steepened and obviously, our hedging, the rollover hedging benefits us. And there's been a little bit of movement in FX and in volumes. But basically, we're still where we were before, about $13.6 billion. A lot of that, the year-on-year benefit is in Private Bank and in Financing. You will have seen there have been some movements in Corporate Bank. Some of that's just reallocation or reclassification of revenues sort of group neutral or even within the CB neutral as it reclassified some revenues into remaining income. But again, with all of that said, our guidance is in line with where we started the year on banking book NII, which is encouraging.",

As you know, there's also a revolver piece of it. There's the underwriting pipeline that then gets distributed. But we're actually at a relatively lower point in the cycle given the slowdown of activity so far this year. The individual position that we were talking about is actually our last remaining sort of position from the pre-war period, so prior to March or February of 2022. It's one that actually we've had a reasonably sort of positive view on. We participated in a recapitalization last year. And the mark reflects really sales activity away from us and partially, we participated in the sales activity in order to free up capital, but there's certainly a possibility that the on-balance sheet position recovers over time.

Number one, we will see with the Savings & Investment Union, a lot of more investments actually into Europe also in certain asset classes like defense, like infrastructure. And in this regard, there are not a lot of banks actually who can handle that and who can bring investors together who have the access and the network to the investors around the world. And that's what we are already seeing right now. You cannot imagine actually the kind of the interest which was created not only by the Savings & Investment Union, but also by the German decision to invest more into Defense and Infrastructure and how many investors are now so to say, contacting us in order to be, so to say, part of this initiative. And hence, I would say that in this regard, the capital markets initiatives, the leverage which we can provide from a banking point of view in order to support these programs is actually quite significant. And again, we saw it in particular after the announcement of Friedrich Merz early March. The second part, where I do believe we have a huge opportunity is actually based on the Savings & Investment Union, but also based on the coalition agreement in Germany because if you read it in detail, there is a clear intention to look at the pension schemes in Germany and the way the people will actually provide for their retirement plan. And in this regard, I am convinced that we will see changes in this regard also in Germany. And I do believe that this is a huge opportunity, in particular for a bank like Deutsche Bank, not only because we have the 19 million end-clients in Germany, the retail clients, but also as we have, so to say, the product factories, be it in DWS or in the Investment Bank, which can provide for that. And the level of discussions we have with Berlin, but also with Brussels on how we can facilitate that, how we can make sure that we have a change in the pension scheme is on a very, very good level. And hence, I do believe on both sides, i.e., the Investment Bank, Corporate Bank supporting actually the corporates in the investments, but also on the Private Banking side, there is a lot of upside. And hence, I'm very positive, in particular for the outer years.",

And then secondly, just coming back to the overlay for tariffs. I was looking at IFRS 9 disclosures on Page 41 and 42. And you obviously presented a bit differently to others. You talk about 1 percentage point of GDP being a €77 million adjustment on ECLs. The other banks have kind of provided you a downside scenario adjusted the weighting and given all the assumptions to the downside scenario.

Obviously, you'll see it in our results with the variances. But what I'd tell you is maybe to help is our plan, as I think we said at the end of January was done kind of with a rate of about 1.10 on the I to the U.S. dollars. You remember that December, it had gone all the way to kind of 103.5. And if we do it on March, it will be back to 1.08 and currently 1.14. So it's been moving around a lot. I think it's just -- it's fair to say that it's a downward -- so today, it would be a downward pressure on the ex FX numbers we showed you in January, both for revenues and expenses, netting out in pretax profit. On the tariffs item and the IFRS 9 sort of view, you're right. And one of the -- I don't want to say a challenge, but the positive and the negative of the way we show the disclosure is that you're seeing the sensitivity of each of the variables. And what we sort of implemented was an overlay that played with a number of variances -- variables. So U.S. GDP, U.S. unemployment rate, the level of the S&P, the level of the credit metrics. So I couldn't give you one metric to really sort of quantify what it is. We sometimes look at it in terms of standard deviations of all of the metrics.

So look, I think you'll see improvement from here, as I mentioned, there was some internal sort of reclassifications that we made in the Corporate Bank, but I think a steady but modest improvement from Q1 in Corporate Bank. In Private Bank, it's more pronounced and more related to the hedge rollover than any other factor. And in Financing, it's call it €100 million of the full year benefit more volume driven. Now I will say with all 3 businesses, volumes will play a part. Christian noted that in the Corporate Bank, loan growth was a little bit more sluggish in the quarter than we might have expected. But then spiked up at the end of the quarter. So if we do see loan growth sort of on average in the quarters that lie ahead, that exceed our current estimation or deposit growth, then we could have some volume-related lift on all of those numbers. But as I say, so most of the hedge rollover benefit you'll see in the Private Bank. I think your second question was movements in capital. With the first quarter behind us, it becomes a little bit more simple because we don't have really remaining model-related changes or sort of acceleration of the impact of equity comp is really concentrated in the first quarter. So it is -- at this point, it's really earnings net of accruals for future distributions or profit recognition for future distributions, net of balance sheet growth or business growth. Last question about DWS and M&A. I think Stefan's comment was more that we are better positioned today to think about and potentially pursue transactions for DWS than in the recent past in part because DWS was also working through some internal issues. But I don't want the implication to be that we haven't considered it at all over the now 7 years since the IPO. And I want to just emphasize, I mean, we recognize the strategic environment in which DWS is operating, and we haven't been sitting on our hands, but also appropriately, we haven't pursue transactions that aren't beneficial to DWS' shareholders or the group. So there's been some discipline attached to it. But Stefan's right to say that the company is better positioned. And of course, the market environment around DWS has changed. You've seen a number of transactions in the industry in recent days. I do want to emphasize DWS is well positioned with its existing business, and you can see it executing and performing well on its strategic intent with both inflows and the distribution of its assets under management as well as the performance. All are good indicators about DWS' trajectory from here.",

So I guess the question is how much RWA growth you anticipate the business to require over the next sort of 12 months and linking to the -- to your loan growth outlook, I was just wondering if you could give us some color on RWA growth expectations there. And that hopefully gives us a good idea of how much buybacks we can expect.  The second one, again, related to how much capital you might be able to generate in the remaining part of the year. your guidance on asset quality still implies quite a significant tick up in provisions given your very strong performance in Q1.

    "text": "Sure, Noel. Thank you, Raul. So on your first question, Raul, I think it is prudent to adjust for the French part reversal of the impairment. And so far that capital is concerned. As indicated, if we do reach a transaction, there is a likelihood of a commensurate kind of capital reduction taking place. Now just to remind you, our capital target operating range is 14% to 14.5%, and we expect this to be reviewed slightly lower in the medium to long term. And as we do our capital return projections or our share buyback projections, we look at our medium-term capital outlook and compare it to that range. And this is -- obviously cautiously compared to that range. And this is what's giving us now the flexibility to announce the share buyback and to consider additional buybacks going forward.  As regards RWA growth in line with loan growth, it has been subdued in the first quarter. It may remain subdued for another quarter. We may see some pickup, particularly with the Hong Kong and China bounce back. But again, for this year, we have not given guidance on loan growth, recognizing some of the economic conditions. We do remain committed for medium term or mid-single-digit growth in loans for the medium term, which is what you can factor in for RWA growth commensurately and equally for our share buyback.  If I move on to your next question with regards to asset quality. I would lean towards your latter comment, Joe sorry, Raul, that we are baking in some conservatism or we think at this stage, the full year guidance, which we have retained unchanged from February is now leaning towards conservative. Just want to highlight some tailwinds, the -- certainly, the situation in the U.K., the possibility that we make recession is a tailwind. Equally, the recovery in Hong Kong and Mainland China following the opening up of the borders and resumption of activities and trade is a tailwind. But at the same time -- and obviously, the China real estate has shown some positive signs, both from the economic standpoint as well as from the policy measures, but at the same time, we wanted to remain cautious. There are a number of refinancing taking place in Q3 and the China real estate -- commercial real estate portfolio, which we would like to stay cautious on and we continue to watch some of the U.K. SME space, in particular, those heavily reliant on discretionary consumer spend before we revisit the guidance.

It's been a busy quarter. Everything we've seen reinforces the view that we had on that weekend when we did due diligence. The book was a good quality book. We've seen no nasty surprises. We did do a bit of mark-to-market on acquisition [indiscernible] but that was -- we were -- that was evident to us when we did due diligence that weekend. Georges can give you a little bit more detail on that. But fundamentally, the asset quality of the SVB book is as we expected it. The team have done a good job in building that business over the past 14 years. They've got good client relations, good quality book and good business development potential.  And on the back of that, we decided to invest in putting more people on the ground in some of the key markets around the world that have strong technology and life science centers to take that business model not just to the U.K., but take it globally. So we're investing in that as well. So [indiscernible] surprises on that and then in terms of other acquisitions that we may consider or M&A activity, I mean, I think the insurance business is a key component of the wealth proposition that we have. We have a very profitable insurance business in Hong Kong. It's a combination of manufacturing and distribution. The team has done a good job in building out the product lineup in Hong Kong over the past few years to put us back into a market-leading position in Hong Kong, and we get access to the full value chain.  One of the challenges we've often faced in the past is getting full recognition of that value as a bank shareholder in an asset -- in an insurance manufacturing business. But you can rest assured the economics of that business are very strong and we've got a market-leading position. So we obviously, like all businesses, keep the strategy under review. And if we think there's a better position to take, we'll take it. But at the moment, we're pleased with the way the insurance business is performing.

If you look into Q1, we have not published a revised rate sensitivity but we continued the trajectory of our structural hedges.

Average revenue was up 13% in Q1 relative to Q1 last year. So I think what Georges is saying is, I think we've seen a recovery taking place in that wealth revenue. We're not expecting that to just be a Q1 phenomenon. That is something that will continue in Q2 and Q3 and Q4, but it's still early days to predict whether the 13% is an annual number or it's higher than that or lower than that. So -- but we don't expect it to disappear in Q2, Q3 or Q4. So there should be a level of annualization on that as well in the WPB-non-NII line.  With respect to the AGM comment, look, I think we've said for a while that we believe the safest and fastest way to achieve higher returns, better performance, better dividends and capital generation was the existing strategy. I think the Q1 results provides a lot of evidence that, that is the fact that, that is the best way. We guided the market over the last 12 months to a 12%-plus ROTE. I did emphasize at the year-end that we should focus on the plus, not the 12. And I think you see even excluding the notable items, we've done a ROTE of 19.3%. I would just draw attention to the fact that in that ROTE of $19.3 million, there is a tax credit, and Georges can probably cover that as well. That tax credit is not something that will repeat every quarter. But even if you adjust for that, it's still a very healthy return on tangible equity.  So I think it's in the -- what we're focused on is driving performance on behalf of all our shareholders, and we believe doing what we've done is the best way to get improved returns, improve performance rather than some more radical corporate restructuring action.

We -- on the -- that reconciliation between the headline reporting number and the cost target, what we're trying to do is be very straightforward and not try and bake in what as a CTA last year to this year. So we're adjusting down the prior year reported number for the notable CTA last year. So that the cost target of 3% is on an apples-and-apples basis with the cost base of this year. So we're not looking to take an easy option on that. We think it's the right thing to do, but as we say, we're 2% against the 3% target in Q1.  And then on SVB, I just want to clarify as well, the SVB business we bought, we acquired a cost base with that, and we acquired a revenue stream and that revenue stream was in excess of the cost base. So we've acquired a positive P&L that was contributing, if I remember correctly, around about $80 million to $90 million of , so although we've acquired 300 -- sorry, we acquired the majority of the $300 million is the acquired cost base of SVB. It is a profitable cost base.",

As we look ahead, perhaps that tailwind , at least in quantum. So is that going to make it tricky from here to deliver NIM sustainability? Or is the drop in HBAP and the headwind from deposit mix, in particular, likely to fade in your view to allow for some sort of stable NIM backdrop?  And then the second question on SVB. In addition to the acquired cost base, you flagged incremental investment spend and plans to build the business outside the U.K. So could you talk about sort of associated revenue ambitions and what sort of time frame you expect to see notable uplift there.

So indeed, you did call out the headwinds -- the possibility of headwinds in the U.K. Obviously, there may be still 1 or 2 rate hikes for which we will be passing most of that to customers through [indiscernible] rate. And we do see continued headwinds in Hong Kong with around 1% per month migration into term deposit with the mix now at 25% term deposits across both our entities in Hong Kong. This being said, we also have tailwinds. The first one is we still have a strong momentum from Q1, which we're carrying over. The second tailwind is HIBOR normalization. I mean, just for reference, in Hong Kong, HIBOR and exchange fund bill rates in Q1 were 65 and 35 basis points lower on average than where they were in Q4, and that was a major headwind for us in Q1.  We are seeing now over the last few weeks, we have been seeing normalization in those rates. If we continue to see normalization and just for a reminder, we have about 200 basis points of their equivalent rates in dollars. If we continue to see normalization, this will provide us material tailwinds in the Hong Kong base. And the other tailwind is our resilient deposit and loan base, we continue having stable deposits and loans despite the -- some of the competitive pressures, and we continue to aim for mid-single-digit growth in both in the medium term, which should give us some supportive tailwinds.",

And we said we were not uncomfortable with where consensus was. We still have that view. The only adjustment you need to make to NII is for the IFRS 17 adjustment. Everything else remains as we said in February, the guidance that existed at that point in time, we were not uncomfortable with it. The same is true today, just adjust for IFRS 17, which is around about a $2 billion adjustment from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17. That's the only change that needs to be made based on what we've given you as an update today.  And then on SVB, we acquired -- sorry, we recruited 40 people -- over 40 people in the U.S. to build out our SVB capability in the U.S. It will -- we did not bring a book with them, purchaser book. So they will be in build-out mode, so there will be a payback period on that investment. We think it's a relatively short payback period based on the quality of people we've hired. We're looking at other geographies around the world. We think it's a sensible and modest investment to do that organically. And we're pretty confident on the payback. We'll be relatively sure. We'll provide more details once we complete that buildout. Hopefully, by the half year, we'll be able to give you more information.  So there will be a profit drag to a degree, probably in the first year or 18 months, but then I think it will be back into profit territory even on those organic build-out strategies.

Your net interest income is annualizing north of $36 billion on the Q1 number. Your guide is obviously greater than $34 billion. I appreciate there's lots of moving parts here, but I guess, to be more specific, in terms of your commentary around consensus at full year and now, there's a kind of $1.7 billion gap between where the Street is and what you're guiding for, the Street is $35.7 billion. It doesn't actually sound like you see much downside to that consensus number at $35.7 billion unless there's something here around term deposit mix or -- it feels like there's a lot of conservatism in the NII guidance or there's something I'm missing. So can you help us with that?  And then secondly, on the noninterest income, I totally appreciate your markets business might have overrun in Q1, but you are also pointing towards a wealth management business that's trending higher and underlying momentum in our your fee businesses, you talked about strategic initiatives at full year sit behind that.

    "text": "Two good questions. And let me just clarify what I said about what we said in February. I think you're right on your math. I think if you go back to what we said in February, there was -- we talked about $36 billion plus. And when people were talking about our NII, there was sort of annualizing it to about $38 billion and the consensus was around $37 billion to $37.5 billion. And I think we said we were comfortable with that. So I think if you go back to then, we sort of said, yes, we're sort of comfortable that consensus had a calculation on the plus bid of the $36 billion. They'll put it sort of north of $37 billion. That was around about consensus back then. And all I'm saying to you now is the only thing you need to adjust for is IFRS 17, which takes about $2 billion off of that. So we're talking about $34 billion plus and that, therefore, would put you north of $35 billion. So I think what we're saying is there should -- we're sort of saying the Street has probably got NII around about the right place back in February of last year. And we're saying there's no need to change what the Street is. You only got to do the mechanical adjustment for IFRS 17. Hopefully, that helps.  And then, Georges, I think do you want to just come back on the non-NII, because I think -- you're right, there's elements of our non-NII performance in Q1. So Georges is saying annualized. There are just some elements that are saying it may be unwise to annualize them fully for some of the trading income. Georges, do you just want to reclarify what you said.",

So Aman if I kind of unpack the non-NII, some of the outperformance that we've seen with regards to funding of the trading book, where we've seen $1.4 billion this quarter against $0.1 billion quarter 1 last year because rates were at 0, but against $1.3 billion quarter 4, so somewhat flat to just slightly up from quarter 4. That number is -- it is fair to annualize it given current rate forecast consensus.  Equally, as Noel mentioned earlier, the discussion on wealth, the growth in in wealth, the resumption of activity in Hong Kong, in particular, bodes well for the future. And I think it is fair to assume that we will see continued performance in wealth.  On the other hand, some of the outperformance in some of the market activities such as foreign exchange trading, which had a record quarter, it may not be repeated. And obviously, we will have to look at it quarter-by-quarter in terms of what the business opportunities are there. And while you can bake in and factor in the results, the Q1 outperformance, I would caution you not to annualize that outperformance, but in general, if I take a step back, it is a good set of results and we are confident about the future. And in light of the strong Q1 performance, we will have to review and we will review the guidance in H1.",

And I was just wondering if we look into the medium term or starting '24. Do you see the goal for the group to lean more into growth so that mid-single-digit loan growth could potentially be higher? Or should we just think that any increasing profitability could be essentially a return to shareholders just in terms of the trade-off between opportunity for growing more versus shareholder return.  And secondly, with regards to the deposit trends. I was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of [indiscernible] deposit franchise during the quarter. Have you seen, in particular, inflows in certain parts of your footprint helping delivering that stable deposit [indiscernible] in the quarter.

Listen, I think, clearly, we want to pursue growth, but I think we have the capacity in our dividend payout ratio of 50% to pursue growth and with the option of doing buybacks as well. Now at the moment, I think we've seen a relatively subdued lending market in corporate banking. I think the demand for term loans around the world is not particularly high at the moment and probably isn't going to be particularly high in the very near term.  As Georges said earlier, I mean, once we get to 2024, one would expect there to be an increase in demand starting to emerge. But for the near term, for the next few months in '23, given the economic uncertainty, we're seeing subdued loan demand. So I think the message I'd give you, in a 50% payout ratio world, we believe the second 50% after we pay the dividend, there is potential to fund both growth and buybacks. And that's our plans going forward. Georges, do you want to just cover the deposit trend, the inflows, the outflows and deposit migration.",

So some of the outflows we're seeing particularly in the U.K., so obviously, U.K. retail, Q1 is a tax payment period. So there is seasonality here. We are still seeing high cost of living resilient inflation in the U.K., which is obviously draining some of the U.K. consumers savings, to a lesser extent, competitive pressure as well in the U.K. Likewise, for corporates in the U.K., Q4 was at year-end where people showed up their liquidity, whereas Q1, most of the companies pay dividend. And then you can see some of the draining liquidity, we're also seeing deleveraging of loans using some of the deposits to deleverage on the loan side, especially for those with a strong rate differential between what they're paying on their loans.  This being said, we continue to see growth and strength in the deposit proposition. So if I take Hong Kong and all of Asia, actually, we've seen definite deposit growth in the retail and the personnel banking space. We have seen 5% growth of our deposit base in Commercial Banking in the U.S. So we were one of the beneficiary banks of the deposit migration from medium-sized banks into large banks.

I think probably it will start to emerge more in the working capital side of the balance sheet, trade finance, before people start investing in fixed capital. But I think there is a level of nervousness out there in the corporate world about taking long-term investment decisions in fixed capital, that is aside from sustainability. I think there's a lot of infrastructure spend taking place, and I could see some loan growth coming in and around that sustainable infrastructure investment. So maybe I am being a bit cautious on loan growth at the moment. I think I'd rather be that way in the near term. But I don't think -- I do believe there's going to be medium-term loan growth.

Even in the U.K., we are seeing green shoots in the mortgage sector. I mean, our market share in the mortgage sector in the U.K. for the first 2 months of the year is that 15%, that's for new business. That's against the book market share of about 7.5% and the Q4 new business market share of 9%. So we're certainly there in the retail space where we're seeing growth.  On the wholesale side, I just want to add 1 comment to description, which is also bear in mind the rate differential between China and Hong Kong. So all those Chinese companies who used to use Hong Kong as a base for raising funding internationally will be less doing so as long as the rate differential between dollar rates and China rate are that wide. It is cheaper for these corporates to raise funding in Mainland China as opposed to Hong Kong, and that will remain the case up until the time we see a reversal in that rate trend.  If I move to your second question, Tom, we have not shared targets for 2024 as yet, but the few guiding principles I can share with you, the first guiding principle, paramount guiding principal is that you should expect our focus on cost discipline to continue. The second guiding principle is that we will continue doing transformation and restructuring as part of our BAU cost base and expect some of those sales to flow through also into 2024 and beyond. And case in point is the spend on severance, which we're planning now to do in Q2 this year for which the benefit will flow through mostly in 2024.  And thirdly, at this stage, we're still looking to guide towards a dollar cost number as opposed to and the way we will be looking at 2024 as we come to be able to give you additional guidance later in the year.",

So on NIM NII, NIM in Asia was flat because most of the uplift from rates has translated into an uplift in the non-NII component of the trading book funding, about $0.3 billion uplift in that space. We've introduced banking NII. In due course, we will enhance our disclosure in the space to introduce banking NII sensitivity and banking NIM, which would be reflecting such an uplift.  The -- with regard to your second question, Manus, the hedging activity, so if you look at our NII sensitivity, downwards 100 basis points have reduced from $4 billion to $2.6 billion. About 1/3 of that reduction is due to our hedging structural hedging activity and another 1/3 of that reduction would be effect of the change of the composition of our balance sheet. And then the last 1/3 is numerous other factors, including modeling enhancements. If you now look at our structural hedging activity, which we've conducted over the last 12 months, the overall impact on the reduction of banking NII sensitivity is to the tune of $1 billion.",

So again, on net interest income, at face value you are greater than $35 billion, NII guide does imply a step-up in the run rate of net interest income in Q3 and Q4. I suspect you would point us to the greater than $35 billion, suggesting that there's some conservatism . But can you talk to what the pressures are or indeed actually even the sources of support on the net interest income run rate from here through to year-end?  I think one thing the market would love is some sense of whether this level of net interest income is sustainable beyond this year? So anything you can give us there, I guess, related to -- I know that the U.K. has been very strong as well. So any kind of color you could give us on the moving parts there and the sustainability of net interest income in the U.K. would be great.  The second question was around distributions. Specifically around your dividend, you're reiterating your 50% payout ratio guidance this year. This year, and potentially next year, it does look like it's going to be quite strong earnings. I guess if you take consensus looking for an underlying EPS of around $1.20, which involves an ordinary dividend of $0.60. I mean that number feels big versus $0.51 you used to state versus what you did last year. And I guess the question is how comfortable are you with paying a big ordinary dividend now, which might then become quite difficult to sustain in the future if rates come off and earnings kind of taper, are you bothered that you do $0.60 this year and you do some number that's lower than that next year or thereafter?",

    "text": "Sure. Thank you, Amandeep. So kind of in turn, addressing your points. First, as you did say, we're emphasizing that this is a floor. We're emphasizing this is a guidance of greater than $35 billion. We're revising this floor because we're gaining more comfort first half way into the year and with the outcomes of H1. We want to remain cautious, and you may find our guidance to be cautious given the difficulty to forecast some of the challenges I'll talk about in a second. And then in terms of outlook for the rest of the year, look, we are not looking to change the consensus for H2 NII. We're comfortable with H2 NII consensus stands at this stage.  Now in terms of the pressure and the support we're seeing, well, we're seeing certainly tailwinds that we've seen already in Q2, one in terms of additional rate hikes to be expected very much in the major currencies, such as dollar, pound and euro. We've seen also tailwinds in the HIBOR normalization. We've seen about 1% quarter-on-quarter normalization of HIBOR. And if you look at July, we continue seeing further normalization. HIBOR is now around 5%. So probably at the end of July, we'll have fully normalized. And those will provide us some -- certainly some tailwinds as we look into H2.  This being said, we continue to see the same headwinds we've been calling out from the year-end, and they will continue manifesting in H2. The first headwind, which we forecast to remain is the subdued balance sheet growth, certainly subdued loan growth due to the activity. We have indicated we may see some resumption in '24, but for the -- for this half -- for the next half year, would probably remain as a headwind.  And naturally, the other headwind that is very difficult to forecast is the deposit costs, the behavior, what pass-through rates we will be feeding in, what is the impact of lagged migration to time deposits. Hong Kong, we're still assuming a 1% migration per month and whether this manifests as it is, it is very difficult to forecast, hence, our cautiousness.  Now if I look forward, look, we're not guiding for NII in '24. But there are a few things I can just give you to kind of bake in your analysis. The first one is you have to exclude Canada and France upon completion of these France retail upon completion of these transactions, which now we expect for Canada in Q1 '24. And in France, as we initially ambitioned we're aiming 1st of June '24.  The second one, you have to expect that the balance sheet growth will resume at some stage in '24, and that will give us support for NII. The third one is obviously the structured hedging, which I mentioned a bit earlier, and the impact they will have on more stabilization of outlook for NII. And obviously, the fourth one is what interest rate assumptions you are going to use and what pass-through rates you're going to use. And then last but not least, we are investing a lot in our non-NII or fee income earning businesses and do expect fee income earning businesses to continue driving some of that growth. That's it for the NII component.",

I think in your math, based on consensus, you have taken out notable items. I'm not going to comment on the size of the dividend. But what I'm going to say is in order for us to sustain dividend, there are a few things we're working on and you can as well do the math, Amandeep. The first one is share buybacks. As you know, share buybacks is reducing our share count. And to the extent we ambition to continue on the journey of share buybacks as long as we remain capital generative, which is what we forecast, you have to adjust your denominator by the share count.  The second thing is the NII stabilization actions we're taking, which should give us some protection from a reversal of the rate cycle. And the third and fourth -- third one is obviously our cost discipline will be maintained. Even though we haven't yet we're not ready to share numbers, we will maintain the discipline. And lastly, as I again indicated, fee income growth and the investments we're putting in fee-generating areas such as investment and wealth are also initiatives to support, mitigate a turn in our earnings and therefore a turn in possibly our dividends beyond '24.",

So just wondering if you can scope for us Georges on what is [Technical Difficulty] from here?  And then the second one, just for Noel on the management [indiscernible]. If I look at the [indiscernible] management revenue this quarter, [indiscernible] just sort of stable on Q1.

    "text": "So in terms of the buyback, obviously, the fact that today we announced a $2 billion buyback will today have an impact on our Q3 CET1 ratio of 25 basis points. But you do expect us to continue generating profitability, which will build capital, 50% of which will be provisioned for dividend based on the 50% dividend payout ratio anticipation. And therefore, that buyback will take into the additional capital generation. So I wouldn't look at Q3 25 basis points as a -- due to the buyback we just announced as a challenge. This is obviously -- this is just upfronting if you want the profit generation that we would be doing in the quarter.  Beyond that, again, at this stage, what I can say is we believe we remain capital generative for the foreseeable future. And as long as we're capital generative, we remain -- we continue to ambition a rolling series of share buybacks. But obviously, we would review this on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on a number of factors, including our capital adequacy ratio. I just want to also highlight and probably answering your question, Raul, and complementing the question of Amandeep earlier, that the Canada sale expected in Q1 '24 will provide us additional capital. The priority use of the first part of it is for a $0.21 dividend, which we will be in a position to distribute expected in H1 '24. And then the residual part of it, we will utilize to supplement or complement or top up any capital buyback and we're planning to do.",

    "text": "Thank you. And I think it's a fair comment on your second question that what we're talking about here is very much growth in lead indicators. The $27 billion of net new invested assets here in Asia in the first half, up 21%. Globally, net new invested assets growth of $75 billion over the past 12 months. A growth in our aggregate invested assets of 7% globally. They're strong lead indicators, an additional 0.5 million international customers in the past 12 months. For me, they are the lead indicators. I think you're absolutely right, there will be a lag effect as you turn the customer acquisition and asset acquisition into revenue. But that's why we're talking about building businesses and new growth opportunities that can supplement our revenue going forward and give us some cushion on offset to any downside rate effect that may emerge post '23 and post '24. So we think it's the right thing to do.  And you're right, the revenue will be a lag indicator on those early success criteria that we're sharing with you. If you remember, our growth in our Wealth business in Mainland China, we started with 0 wealth managers just over 2 years ago. We've now about 1,400. Our ambition is to get to 3,000 over the relatively near term over the next couple of years or so. Again, that will be revenue generative as an offset because most of that is fee-based as an offset to any downside pressure that may be on interest rates.

Most of these charges are on stage 3. These are more technical adjustments of the names that have defaulted. So where we stand now in terms of charges is we are comfortable with the charges we have against this portfolio in China CRE. Now with regards to the plausible downside scenario, we indicated $1 billion at the year-end as a plausible downside. We have indeed crystallized $0.3 billion of it.

Listen, we believe in both the mortgage book and the savings of the deposit book, we've tried to make sure that we are offering a good range of products to our clients, whereby they have choices, so on savings. We've got a good competitive range of fixed rate deposit accounts in the market. We also believe we've got good pricing in place for more instant access type savings accounts or deposit accounts. We will participate with the FCA and on any review they do.  We believe if you take our 2-year fixed rate savings account in the U.K. based on the yield curve in the U.K., we're offering savers the opportunity to get 5.1% on that fixed term -- 2-year fixed-term savings account. If you compare that to our 2-year fixed mortgage product that we're offering to our customers with a 60% loan-to-value ratio, we're in the market at around about 5.53% and for new-to-bank customers, we'd be in the market at about 6.1%. So we believe we have the structure of the deposit book and the structure of the mortgage book in the right level. And as ever, there is a price difference between term products and instant access products because of the maturity and the liquidity risk.  So we have tried to price our products fairly and appropriately. We're very cognizant of the pressures that U.K. customers face at this point in time. We certainly try to remain competitive and to help them navigate what is going to be a challenging year or so with high interest rates in the yield curve and higher rates of inflation, but we will fully participate with any review that the FCA take. We're also trying to encourage through marketing prompts customers to take advantage of those products if they want them and they meet their circumstances. We can't and should not force them into term savings, but we need to make sure they're aware of our term savings products should they want to take advantage of it.

But this is more in the long term, I understand that, I just want to get some color? Any color, particularly after the U.S. regulatory release that Basel III End Game, like how would that change our present forecast on that, so this is for the long-term question.  And then on the near term, just now, I think management gave us a number. Potential additional ECL charges on China's CRE is $0.7 billion. And then I also noticed that for our guidance for full year credit cost is 40 basis points. But if I look at the first half, it's a bit less than 30 basis points on an annualized basis, right?

There's economic uncertainty around China's commercial real estate. There's economic uncertainty generally in the world.  We've had a good first half performance on ECL, I should say, $1.3 billion is below the run rate of 40 basis points. So we think we do have some capacity to absorb some of that risk that's inherent in the commercial real estate book in China. But I think I'd be misleading you if everything could be so scientifically proven because you've got to -- it all depends on what happens elsewhere in the world.  So yes, I could easily say, yes, we've got capacity to absorb that, but it depends what happens elsewhere in the world. So -- but we do believe we have -- it's right to maintain a conservative guidance at the moment on ECL is at 40 basis points.

But as the output floor starts kicking in 5 years into the journey, so from 25 plus 5 years, there is a likelihood that the output floor will catch us and net-net, the impact may be in a material up or down, but immaterial up as we look at it at this way.  This being said, I just want to caution one thing. The U.S. obviously issued their draft rules last week. They came out more severe than we initially expected. They will have an impact on our U.S. operations. It remains a marginal impact. We're likely talking single-digit RWA uplift against a possible downward move before that. But those rules will impact our local reporting for our U.S. entity will not change the way we report at the group level. So we will need to navigate both if you want, in parallel.",

    "text": "Listen, you're absolutely right. We -- we're keeping a strong and tight cost discipline in the bank. But what we're doing is we're reallocating cost from . And what we're typically reallocating is from what I call bad cost, costs that are associated with low return in portfolios, low return in business activities in certain markets or costs that are associated with manual processes that should be digitized.  So if you look at our cost performance, I think we increased our investment in IT costs by 12% so far this year, first half to first half. We increased some of our investment costs in our global businesses, and we reduced costs elsewhere, and that's what's getting us back to the 3%. So we're investing and saving at the same time.  And that is a phenomenon that probably historically HSBC has not been . It's typically been cost management or cost investment. And it's been a cycle, you manage costs tight and then you invest. We're definitely trying to do both at the same time, and there's a lot of self-funding going on to try and mitigate the overall cost base. And that's how we're building out the 1,400 people in Mainland China because we're saving costs through other country exits or the market exits, reducing our support costs in some of the manual processes in our global processing centers, that's allowing that investment to take place. And that's been the journey for the past 3 years.  On the SVB, the integration is going well. The business, we've had no nasty surprises since the day we bought the business. It was profitable the day we bought it. It is still profitable. We're going through systems migration at the moment. One statistic, which is probably an important guide for the future; in the 3 months post acquisition, we talk to bank customers at a higher rate than the 3 months prior to acquisition.  So in the transition of ownership from the previous owners to us, we've seen an uptick in the momentum of customers wanting to bank with SVB in that first 3 months period. That acquisition has also given us the knowledge, the platform, the connections and frankly, the positive brand and reputation globally that has allowed us to go and recruit a team in the U.S. We've recruited a team here in Hong Kong, and we've recruited a team in Israel.  So my view is that there is strong growth prospects in that business, not just for the next 2 or 3 years. I'm doing this because I think this will be an important business for us in the 5- to 10- to 15-year time frame. This is an important sector of the economy, and we're willing to invest in it. So I'm very pleased with how it's going.  We probably do owe you, as an investment community, more detail on so how material, what are the numbers. And I think we'll come back to you at the end of the year with if you add this all together, the investment and the current bought business, what could that potentially look like going forward and how material is that. But that is something, if it's okay, we'll give you more towards the end of this year with the full year results.",

    "text": "Yes. So Guy, maybe I'll start by talking the dynamic, and I'll dive into NIM specifically. But first, in terms of pass-through rates on the deposits, for the last 50 basis points of rate hikes from the Bank of England, we've passed through to our savings rate, retail savings rate, around 70%. So we believe from a consumer point of view, we are competitive, having passed through. And obviously, this is a higher than 50% pass-through. The overall book pass-through within the around 40 -- between 40% and 50%. But clearly, the marginal pass-throughs are higher at this high level of rates.  Equally, on the mortgages, we continue aiming for market share. So we've grown the stock market share from 7.7% to 7.8%. And our new business market share is now just shy of 10%, so we maintain a leading proposition in mortgages. Now if I go specifically on the NIM. Look, without talking to our peers' NIM some parameters that you can use when you're doing your assessment and your analysis. The first one is we have a very strong liquidity position with a very strong deposit franchise and a low loan-to-deposit ratio.  The second one to take into account is we are relatively small in consumer finance. So that component of our portfolio is single-digit percentage of our retail finance. The third one to take into account is that our structural hedging is relatively young, i.e., we started the structural hedging essentially when rates started to be at higher levels. So we have little \"baggage\" from structural hedging positions from prior, i.e., when rates were very low, and this is obviously helping us in adjusting our NIM upwards and we're not bogged by, if you want, low interest-earning assets from older structural hedges. And in terms of expectations, I think it's fair to expect that the increase we've seen in Q1 is unlikely to be repeated as we look into the rest of the year.",

As we look to year-end, we do anticipate that we would reinstate this impairment sometime in H2 for a possible obviously, closure of the transaction on the 1st of Jan. So that notable item, if you want, washes itself out from our full year expectations.  As regards to 2024, I think the Canada impact is a couple of percentage points on our ROTE.

So on the non-NII wealth in Asia, you will observe actually the biggest pickup is in insurance -- sorry, first, taking the impact of funding the trading book, which is showing under non-NII and this material is $1.2 billion. If you take this one out, the growth is essentially from insurance and insurance in Hong Kong, it does appear on the non-NII but not fee income. That growth is kind of a reflection of the growth we've seen in Q1. It's in the 40% to 50% growth year-on-year. It is reflective of the opening of the border between China and Hong Kong and the additional inflow of Mainland Chinese policy, new policies. Now Hong Kong business, about 30% of new policies are from Mainland Chinese.  As you would expect, insurance is a core component of our wealth in particular here in Hong Kong, and that's the main driver of the growth. We still see some softness in Wealth with regards equities trading, and that's more reflective of the equity markets in general. And I want to say the -- while the Hong Kong GDP is a main driver of our loan portfolios in terms of growth in our balance sheet, Wealth activity is not necessarily directly linked to the GDP. It is linked to investor behaviors and it is linked to sentiment in the market.  With regard to your second question on migration. So in HSBC, we continue to see a migration of around 1% per month, although it did slow a little bit in April, but that kind of continued a trend that we have been forecasting whereas in Hang Seng where the term deposit share is in the mid-30s percent, our colleagues in Hang Seng have taken a proactive approach to manage some of the highly rate-sensitive deposits and allow them if you want to accept some attrition against these highly rate-sensitive or rate-chasing deposit and this is what allowed them to maintain or slightly reduce their term deposit mix. They are benefiting from a very strong liquidity position and a strong deposit franchise and they do not need necessarily highly rate-sensitive deposits at that margin.",

We continue increasing our book. The pricing, as you know, the mortgages are capped and the pricing is highly correlated to the savings rate.

It's -- if you take all of the international banks share of the corporate debt market in Mainland China, I think all of us together are about 2% market share. So actually, growing your Corporate Banking business as an international bank, particularly if your strategy is connecting Mainland China to the rest of the world in both directions, GDP is not the prime driver of growth in the sense of what you can do because you're still relatively niche in the market and what is a huge market, so you can get growth despite the fact that GDP and by the way, GDP is still 5% plus. So it's not bad, but you can still get growth.  Similarly, in our Wealth business that we're pursuing in Mainland China, we're pursuing an area which is around about helping internationally orientated personal customers and particularly the domestic customers in the Greater Bay; Area get access to wealth products, insurance products to help them with their protection needs and their savings needs. And that is primarily targeted at the affluence or the emerging affluent sector rather than particularly at the high net worth or ultra-high net worth. Now that is the core business we have here in Hong Kong.  Now the way I look at it, is that proposition here in Hong Kong has been a very strong driver of growth and profitability for HSBC in Hong Kong, while we see that same opportunity in the Greater Bay Area, the engagement between Greater Bay Area or the Guangdong Province and Hong Kong represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for us. And what we're trying to do, which was different to 3, 4 years ago, we're targeting international wealth and insurance as our primary proposition as opposed to just becoming another mortgage provider or another card provider in Guangdong province. So I think we see opportunity for growth. Yes, you can't ignore the macro environment, but we do see conditions for good growth for our business in Mainland China.",

    "text": "So on the Hong Kong NIM, so the first, the NII increased by $0.1 billion, but the banking NIM increased by $0.4 billion because the non-NII component of the trading funding increased by $0.3 billion. Now the way the NIM -- the bank -- sorry, the way the statute in this [indiscernible] computed is only looking at the NII component and therefore, it's showing flat. But as I mentioned, we will be upgrading our disclosures and enhancing our disclosure with regards banking NIM, and that will give you more visibility on the overall margin when you take into account the funding of the trading book.  Now in terms of sensitivity to the USD, you're actually also driving towards the same kind of dynamic in the funding of the trading book. So dollars has been a currency that we fund a number of our activities with. So when you look at the NII sensitivity, dollars comes opposite to all the other currencies, because that's a funding currency. But essentially, dollars is funding -- our funding of the trading book. And therefore, when you look at the funding book sensitivity, we've put in a few kind of a few explanations on the slides where we estimated this to be -- to the tune of $1.3 billion, it is fair to assume most of it is dollars and therefore, reverses it and kind of renormalizes our dollar sensitivity overall on the balance sheet to be that of kind of a negative sensitivity for minus 100 basis points.",

We've had a good first 6 months. I'm pleased with how the business is performing. We delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 22.4% or 18.5%, excluding those notable items. And we've increased dividends and buybacks. I'm also confident about the future. We still have opportunities to drive growth and to diversify revenue while retaining tight cost control, and we have upgraded our returns guidance for 2023 and 2024.

Because I think as recently as mid September, HSBC were reiterating their expectations for cost very much in line with the existing guide and the commitment to the cost base. So particularly the point around compensating the staff -- potentially compensating staff for performance, I understand that it's been a strong year for profit, but it doesn't look like the view of profitability changed materially since you last spoke to us. So that component there would be interesting. And the related point then is to what extent should we expect that element of cost growth to roll over into next year? I guess, at its heart, I'm trying to get a sense of what the underlying cost growth is that you're currently seeing through the business. And then the second question was around margins. I was wondering if you could just help us with a bit on your experience on deposit beta and term deposit mix, particularly in Hong Kong, but also a comment on the UK would be helpful.

    "text": "Sure. Thank you, Aman. So first on costs, I think with regards this 1% cost we contemplate for Q4, we have to put this in the perspective of the financial performance. Obviously, at the start of the year, we weren't necessarily realizing the performance of the group. We obviously need to wait for Q4 both to assess the financial performance but equally to assess how we continue to deliver on our strategy. It ultimately will be a matter for the Board and the remuneration committee to decide but we felt it appropriate and fair to recognize that our colleagues have contributed, participated for the last many years through the whole strategic reshaping of the firm through ensuring we have a great deposit franchise and a strong balance sheet and obviously delivering the growth we've seen in wealth and transaction banking that we can channel 1% or the equivalent $300 million towards performance related pay. Again, all this is at the stage of contemplation, the matter we will reaffirm at the year end and again subject to our remuneration committee's opinion. In terms of next year, now we're not giving guidance for next year. But I think we are reflecting in this performance related pay a year-on-year material change in our performance, as you've seen from our returns and our PBT which obviously with that quantum we will probably not expect for next year, right? In terms of margins, Aman, so as we indicated at these levels of rates mostly in the UK and certainly in a number of Western markets and for our wholesale businesses, at these levels of rates, we were expecting to have a materially higher betas than 50%. We've expected that additional rate hikes from here would be mostly for the benefit of our customers. If you look at the overall betas in the UK, overall betas around 50, just north of 50%. So while the margin of betas have exceeded 80%, the overall is in the range of 50%. Term deposit mix Hong Kong kind of same trend as we've seen through the nine month coming to this quarter, about 1% migration per month. So we have seen 4% over the quarter after 2% previous quarter and 3% in the quarter one. That took the total term deposit mix to 31% in Hong Kong. We have not seen a deterioration of the trend. We expect the trend to remain the same as we look into potential headwinds in the future. But equally, we continue to see some of the tailwinds we were calling out before to continue. Just to put in perspective, the UK term deposit mix is just single digit percentage point. So we know it's a modest increase in Q3, but it's not a main contributor to the dynamic of our NII.",

    "text": "Georges, if I could just add a couple of comments on the VP [ph]. There are two factors that really come into play on Q3. The half year when we talked about our cost position, we had a lighter VP and we had a very strong first six months of the year. There was a lot of economic uncertainty around that time; inflation, interest rates, ACLs, China commercial real estate. So we didn't want to anticipate exactly what the financial performance would be in the final six months of the year. We were confident of mid teen returns, but we needed to make sure that the final six months traded well. I think as we've gone through Q3, we've continued to trade well. So I think our expectations now on a full year rate are probably higher than they would have been when we started this year and started to build a financial plan for this year. So in the context of things, we've given an indication that given the strong profit performance and if it continues into Q4, it will be right and proper to share some of that upside in profit compared to original expectations with our colleagues the way that we've intend to share the upside in expectations with our shareholders on both dividends and buybacks and a 1%, 300 million top up to VP for the level of performance that could well outturn this year is a reasonable amount of additional VP to put in. I will remind you that VP is not a continuum and a baseline. It is assessed each year on the profit of the bank against targets, and can go up and can go down, but that’s a final determination we'll make at the end of the year. And we're just trying to be fair to our colleagues on what they've done. But it's a factor of uncertainty in the half year over trading performance has become less uncertain as we've gone into Q3, and you've seen the numbers, and we hope we will continue in Q4 in a strong manner. And if that's the case, we feel we should reward our colleagues for a very strong performance this year. But that's the background to it. We remain -- both myself and Georges remain absolutely committed to strong cost discipline.",

    "text": "So purely for the funding cost of the trading books, you should expect that the trading balances will remain broadly stable at around $130 billion for the quarter, then kind of the math are simple. It's just that times the short rate levels, essentially in USD. As you look at the overall banking NII, I think the indication is that we've grown $0.1 billion Q2 to Q3. We haven't given indication for Q4. Again, feel comfortable with where the consensus is for Q4. And just reiterate that banking NII is probably a better measure because it kind of gets you immunized for some of these choices we make in how much we fund the trading book with. With regards to your first question about tech and ops, so it's a mix of necessary and discretionary. We made the decision on the basis that well, first, when we put our cost base at the start of the year, we had materially higher inflation in some areas and some geographies and some pockets than we anticipated for the year. And we felt that it would be adverse for certain customer outcomes if we needed to take more restrictive action on it. And this is putting it in the context that our nine-month year-to-date reported cost is down 2% year-on-year -- is down 2% year-on-year. So this is why we were willing to tolerate the continued investment in tech and ops. I just want to reaffirm what Noel said.

    "text": "Sure. Thank you, Jason. So first on the treasury losses, so a few things to share here. First is, we see this as one of the multiple tools we have to manage our structural hedge and obviously to manage the risk in our balance sheet. Second, importantly, the losses themselves have been taken already into CET1 mostly last year. So these are already factored in our CET1 and this is why effectively they have a mild CET1 ratio benefit where we sit today. And then third, as you indicated, Jason, we are looking to retrieve these losses in the NII line essentially over the next five years. So this is a reinvestment into either longer dated or higher yielding instruments by disposing -- faster disposing of lower yielding instruments to allow us to kind of move faster than our structural hedging of the balance sheet. If you wanted some sense of kind of math, you could argue if we've taken 600 million losses, it's about 100 million loss additional NII every year for the next six years or so, which kind of gives you a sense of how we're looking at it. And it's indeed as part of our restructure hedging, which means part of how we're protecting the balance sheet, mitigating risks of a rate downfall in the future. On your second question, Jason, about the mainland China. So first, I can comment on BoCom Q2 performance, because as you know in our numbers, we have one quarter delay. So the exercise relates to Q2. Our value in use as of Q3 has room of about $0.4 billion compared to our carrying value. So as you -- look, impairment is not a management discretionary decision, right? There's a rigorous accounting process and we just follow the process. And based on their Q3 results, we will evaluate those as we go into Q4and that will be part of our end of year assessment. I think the important thing I want to share about BoCom is because it sits in significant investments and because we hold capital deductions -- regulatory capital deductions against it, as you can see from this slide on $16 billion capital deduction, it effectively means that any impairment on our holding of BoCom should it happen will have virtually nil CET1 ratio impact and that's because any impairment will be compensated like-for-like by a release of the deductions of a similar amount. So therefore no implication on CET1. We will also -- it will have an implication reported profits, accounting reported profits, but we'll treat it as a material notable item and it will have no implications either on the way we calculate our dividend or our dividend payout ratio. So this is why at this stage, this is not a concern. We'll just follow the accounting rules as we do [indiscernible] assessment.",

We said 11 billion year-to-date, essentially in Hong Kong and the UK, that continued even this quarter despite softness in the housing market, but we remain competitive and we continue to support this business for our customers. So that is definitely there. We're also seeing some loan growth in the unsecured space in our retail business. It will be smaller proportions. In terms of commercial, the reality is the main softness in loan growth in commercial is in Hong Kong and this is what's driving the commercial overall number. The softness is Hong Kong has two parameters; one, the rate differential with mainland China and as long as we have saturated differential, it is expected to have mainland Chinese borrowers continue borrowing onshore mainland China rather than borrowing offshore because of the rate differential, and that probably will not reverse in the next couple of years. But also two is some of the softness we've seen in the economic conditions in Hong Kong, which we start to see reversing. And we've been encouraged by the policy measures that have been taken by way of supporting the economy. And if those materialize, we will start seeing some pickup in the segment. Now outside this softness area, we do still have strong loan growth potential in growing areas in our geographies such as Southeast Asia, such as India, such as the Middle East. We even had growth in some of the Western economies. So that is happening. Quite importantly also, I want to call out growth in trade. I called it out in the earlier kind of speech if you want, but trade is bucking the trend for the first quarter where we see 3% growth in our loan book after several quarters of decline. And that's encouraging. We'll obviously need to see how it evolves. But that's definitely encouraging. And if you look at it, most of that growth is in Asia, which means it's bucking the trend in Asia, and that's probably on the -- certainly on the backdrop. Now the trade between China and ASEAN has exceeded trade between China and Europe or China and U.S. and that obviously will benefit given our footprint in China and ASEAN. On the special dividend, Gurpreet, at this stage we're aiming for completion of Canada sometime in Q1. We will then have to go through due governance and do approvals before we do it. I think H1 '24 is reasonable to expect, but it's obviously at this stage just a matter of a process we need to go through. I think that's what I can say at this stage.

We're planning to give you additional disclosures from the one we already give today, which is the usual NII table with multiple rate shifts over the five years that includes duration, that includes yields on the structural hedge, et cetera, which hopefully can allow you to model all of this. We're not ready to do it at Q3. It will be more appropriate to do it at the full year. I think what you should take into account is some of the information we shared at the half year, which is the hedge itself has allowed us to reduce our NII sensitivity at the back end of last year from $6 billion for 100 basis points down to now $2.6 billion, over which you should add the funding of the trading book sensitivity of 1.3. So that's giving you an idea of how much the overall hedge among other contributors have supported the reduction of NII volatility and our NII sensitivity to the downward pressure on weights [ph]. And I think you should definitely assume that it remains our intention at this phase of the cycle in rates to continue doing hedges as appropriate across all our balance sheets where we can find them.

So the first one is, I would kind of as always will encourage you to look at banking NII, because that will -- first, it's a better reflection of our rate sensitive earnings. And second, it will immunize you from some of the kind of business choices we make by putting more money into the trading to support -- more funding to support the trading activities whatnot and that can create noise in NII versus funding of the trading book which is emulated when you look at it from a banking NII perspective. Now talking a little bit on Q3 before I talk about the outlook. On the Q3 numbers, if you look at banking NII in Hong Kong, it was up 10%. Now this is not reflected in NIM. NIM is up 2 basis points, essentially because a lot of that upside went into the funding of the trading book. But the full rate sensitive earnings in Asia or Asian entity has grown 10% by about $0.3 billion. So that's the first thing to observe. If you look at HIBOR rates, Q2 to Q3 obviously were up 75 basis points. When we look at Q4 to date, there’s another something like 50 basis points baked in the average. So there is additional tailwind into Q4 from HIBOR which we will obviously need to see how the next two months fare before we evaluate. If you look at the UK, so the UK NIM was up 16 basis points Q1 to Q2, down 8 basis points Q2 to Q3. The first thing I want to say is this is definitely not the trend here to be read. I think NIM is broadly stable from here for the next few quarters. Some of these moves are kind of idiosyncrasies in our market treasury management not necessarily drivers of trends. So we are looking at it in the role as broadly stable. Obviously, it continued facing pressure on deposit cost. But as I just said earlier, at these rates, any additional rate hikes are expected to be passed through to customers and this is what's been happening. So we've benefited from 75 basis point rate hike in pounds between Q2 and Q3, most of which has gone either to customers in the form of pass throughs, some time deposits, migration in the UK minimal, but some and then obviously asset margin compression in the UK. So as you look forward, how can I kind of invite you to evaluate? First, I'm not giving guidance for 2024. The only guidance within '24 is the mid teens ROTE. We will be giving more details at the year end. But if you want some indicators of how to think about it, first think about it as we will continue facing the usual headwinds of margin compression, but that probably is easing now, having seen most of that compression in Q2 and Q3. We will continue to see pressure on deposits, migration may continue. We've seen the pace of 1% per month in Hong Kong, kind of steady for the last nine months that is likely to continue. And then as you -- so these would be the main headwinds. So the tailwinds would be one, the additional rate upside in Hong Kong from HIBOR, probably no further rate upside in the major other currencies. The tailwinds will be reinvestments of maturing structural hedges that have been put at lower rates and as they mature, we invest in higher rates and that will give us additional tailwinds. And then the main tailwind, which we anticipate at some stage in '24 but not yet, at least not for the next couple of quarters but at some stage in '24 is volume growth. When we start seeing volume growth, we will see the support for the NII in the medium term as we've always indicated mid single digit percentage point growth for balance sheet is our midterm aspiration. And as and when this starts after the next couple of quarters of transition, this will give us the additional tailwinds. I suppose that's probably as much as we can say at this stage, Raul. Thank you for your question.",

    "text": "Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess just a couple of follow ups. The first one is on your hedge strategy, because I guess you have basically in the disposal losses, you've essentially I guess brought forward some of the rolling of the hedge, which I guess we haven't really seen so much especially in UK banks. They tend to sort of use it as a sort of pure smoothing mechanism as it were to just let the lower rates run off and then reinvest in, but you seem to have brought forward that. So I guess the question is, does that suggest that you're not just using the hedge as smoothing mechanism, but is to sort of more actively sort of trade it as it were. Is that fair? I guess it's the first question. And the second question I guess it's for Noel. I just saw on Bloomberg that you made a comment that we feel like the China CRE situation has bottomed out. Acknowledging that the Chinese government has taken steps to support the sector, but the news flow still seems to be pretty negative. And to the extent that there have been actions taken, they're probably not as large as maybe some of the market would have expected or hopeful a few months ago. So it's probably around tailoring and the positive [ph] requirement in some of the Tier 1 cities. So I guess just what gives you the confidence that we have bottomed out?",

    "text": "Perfect. Thank you, Perlie. I'll take the first question and I'll invite Noel, obviously, to comment on your second one. So the hedge strategy, first, we have a number of tools at our disposal. We will use them as effectively and as opportunistically [ph] as we can to achieve what we want to achieve, which is, number one, reducing the downside sensitivity of our balance sheet to a reduction in rates. And number two, extending that reduction of downside as far out in time as possible. This strategy that we've used, which is disposing of existing low earning positions is one of these measures. So number one, to remind you, it does not have a CET1 impact, at least the loss does not have a CET1 impact because the loss has been taken capital mostly in 2022 already. So that gives us this flexibility on our capital. The second one is, yes, a part of the hedge considerations is indeed allowing us to extend higher yields for longer rather than kind of retain some of the lower yielding assets for longer than we wish for and give us additional protection. And the third is also risk management considerations. We will also look at how we use our RWAs and treasury portfolio and how we can optimize the utilization there often, how we use combination of bonds and swap hedges and in fair value accounting relationships, et cetera. So there are all sorts of number of other considerations which we'll look at. But the outcome of which for the purposes of our bottom line is indeed giving us this runway. Now I need to point out. We’ve done an exercise in Q3. We indicate that we intend to do another exercise to the tune of about $0.4 billion in Q4. But we do not look at this as a recurring activity, right? This is kind of by exception occasional when risk management and performance justify it, we will do it. This is not meant to be a recurrent “activity.” I just want to be clear about that. We've done it last quarter. We'll do it next quarter. Anything beyond that, we will give you an indication, but it will be on a case by case and occasional basis. Noel, for the second question.",

    "text": "Yes, on China CRE, my comments this morning were really about the massive policy correction that has taken place over the last 18 months in commercial real estate in China. It has really impacted very heavily the real estate market. Do I think that big negative correction in the market has been delivered and do I expect further negative correction? No. I think what we're now into is the workout phase of that policy correction. Equally, I think I said this morning, I don't see a big swing back into positive policy territory for commercial real estate. I see it as fine tuning from this low base. So what I'm talking about is the market as a whole, the commercial real estate market in China, a massive correction down. I think we're at the bottom of that correction phase. And we know in a gradual replying back out with possible policy tweaks taking place. But as you quite rightly say, they're not going to be big swings back up in policy correction. They're going to be smaller policy correction taking place as we've seen in recent weeks. Now what does that mean for ECLs, for banks both domestically and internationally? Well, those ECLs have and could still emerge over time. But I think the market itself has bottomed and now we're in a period of sort of readjustment for the new norm. And I don't see a big readjustment back up. From our point of view on ECLs, I think we feel as Georges has said, we've got good coverage ratios on the unsecured book. 50% of our offshore book that is SOE related or POE related. We do not see that same policy correction effect in the SOEs the way it's affected the POEs. So we don't see necessarily a downside on that at this stage. And then those POEs in 50% I talked about, those POEs are largely either secured or they’re not in the residential sector. They're in CRE and other forms of the sector. So I think from our point of view, we feel well provisioned at this stage. It's not to say that there aren't potential problems on the horizon from an ECL point of view for the industry. But we feel as though we're well positioned. I suppose my bottoming comment was on the market as a whole in that there's been such a massive correction. I think we're now in a gradual rebuild, but that gradual rebuild will take time and there will be the potential for the industry to bear some further losses. And we are keeping a close eye on that and what it means for us. But we think we're well provisioned at the Q3 level. We're probably going to take some more of our plausible downside scenario in Q4. But as Georges said earlier, we think that we've got the capacity within our overall guidance on ECL of 40 basis points to absorb any further charges we may or may not take in Q4.",

    "text": "Thank you, Rob. On your first point, look, this is a matter of phasing it in time so that we're doing it thoughtfully, carefully. We're evaluating the impact every time we do an activity. So I don't think there's a -- we didn't put a cut off per se for Q3 and Q4. As you can see, the numbers aren't mathematically or aren't kind of -- they don't follow a given symmetry. It's just a matter of where we are on the journey when we kind of cut off the books on the 30th September, but we carry this activity throughout and we look for the right market opportunities to do it. I think this is this way we look at it. With regards to your second point, a couple of things I can share here, Rob. The first one is the rate sensitivity of China. So just to give you an indication, the impact of the China NIM on our hedge or our Asia NIM is about 3 basis points. So the fact that we have some rate compression in China simply because of the policy rates compression, this has affected our overall Asia NIM by a couple of basis points. So that's the quantum or the magnitude given, obviously, the size and scale we have in Hong Kong versus the size and scale we have in mainland China and other geographies. The second one to call out is that the rate differential. We expect it to remain for a matter of many quarters, probably a couple of years, which does mean that offshore -- that mainland Chinese customers borrowing offshore in Hong Kong will probably remain subdued for the next couple of years, because it's much cheaper for them to borrow at lower rates in RMB. And this headwind is likely to continue for the next couple of years. Now on the flipside, again, because of the rate differential, the growth in wealth that we observe in Hong Kong is obviously a positive and a beneficiary of a differential. So the fact that we're seeing more wealth build up in Hong Kong, the fact that we're seeing more demand for our insurance products and capabilities in Hong Kong also reflects the fact that for mainland Chinese, for some of them and subject to their quotas, they're allowed to do, et cetera, it is interesting. It's an attractive proposition to invest offshore because they're getting the right pickup. So we're seeing the benefits of that when we talk about our insurance business in Hong Kong and our new business CSM, while we're seeing the challenge on the other side. Look, all this at the end to say is we remain very optimistic in the medium to long term on both Hong Kong and mainland China. And we just need to see some of the short-term difficulties play out specifically in mainland China specifically in the real estate sector until we recover and are able to see some of the momentum back on positive growth there. Thank you, Rob. I suggest we move to the next question.",

You reiterated the great consensus 5 billion NII guidance in the past, you've talked about being comfortable with consensus, which is obviously above that 36.5. So if I could just push you as to whether you are still comfortable with consensus. And then second question, buybacks and how you're thinking about those. Obviously, a step change today going from two to three for the next quarter, a full month [ph] for the buybacks and the France retail, you're looking at a 14.2 call it one ratio, still within your target range. You've said 2024 ROTE similar to 2023, payout ratio for the dividend similar to 2023. So the only delta seems to be loan growth where you're still talking cautious short term there aiming for mid single digits in medium term. So when we're thinking about the buying back going forward, is it a trade off with that loan growth? So is it the case if the loan growth goes to mid single digits, you go back to 2 billion, whereas if it stays low single digit, you stay at 3 billion? Conceptually, how are you thinking about the buyback? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Andrew. Okay, on your first question, NII guidance, I can reaffirm. We're still comfortable with the 2023 consensus. As you look into 2024, we haven't given guidance yet apart from the mid teens ROTE. But I'd like to kind of just point out two things just to keep in mind. The first one is, again, banking NII would be a better guide of how our earnings will behave with rates. So look at NII in combination with the funding cost of the trading book and immunized therefore your analysis from how much we end up channeling or not in terms of funding to the trading book activities. And then the second one just to keep in mind is the disposal of Canada and France, which will both contribute to an annualized $1.5 billion of NII, which obviously not be there as and when they go away, as and when the sale is complete. And then finally, balance sheet growth at some stage in '24 where we kind of start resuming the expectation of our balance sheet to grow. That's I think in the broad sense how we should look at for 2024. Again, we're not guiding but we're giving you some tools that you can do your analysis. In terms of buyback, so a couple of things. First, the reason we announced a 3 billion buyback, certainly because we have the capital to support it, but equally because we have an extended period to do it. We mentioned that this is an intent to do it up to February results. That gives us four months. So I'll definitely encourage you not to look at 3 billion as the new 2 billion. It is not. It is a reflection of the fact that we're aiming for a -- we have a longer period ahead of us, four months instead of three. And we're aiming to see if we can get up to 3 billion during that period. It's there for kind of a specific consequence of this length of the period that is ahead of us for that buyback. We -- look, I continue saying it remains our intention to perform a rolling series of share buybacks as long as the capital support it. We look at our forecast and our capital does -- capital buildup does seem to be reasonably realistic in our forecast. And therefore, it remains our intention to do the series of buybacks. About the question of trade off between buybacks and loan growth, a couple of things. First, as you know, the proceeds of the sale of Canada will give us a buyback runway regardless of loan growth, because the gain -- the proceeds less the priority use for special dividend will still allow for a few billion dollars of additional buyback and irrespective of our loans, so that'll give us runway for loan growth. Second, I just need to also highlight when we talk about mid single digit loan growth, we're not saying mid single digit RWA growth. Some of our loans specifically in the mortgage space, which is the component for our loan growth, have lower RWA density and therefore benefit from lower RWAs and therefore our RWA growth is expected to trail loan growth absent credit reviews. And therefore we don't see that there is a competition between loan growth and buybacks. I think this is a fine balance between the two and the appropriate trade-off between the two. This is, Andrew, probably how much I can say at this stage to your question. Thank you very much. I'll move straight to the closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your questions. I want to end by reiterating that we've had a good nine months. All of our businesses have been performing well. We have delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 17.1% when you exclude strategic transactions, and we remain committed to tight cost discipline. We're investing in growth while we're also supporting dividends and buybacks. And I will be looking forward to speaking with you all again soon. So have a good morning, afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much. ",

    "text": "Thank you, Noel. Warm welcome to everyone here in Hong Kong. For those of you watching in London, good morning, and thank you for joining our full year 2023 results call. We delivered a good underlying business performance in the fourth quarter, but let me first start by clarifying that our reported profit before tax was impacted by $5.8 billion of notable items and the further $0.5 billion from Argentina hyperinflation including the more than 50% devaluation of the peso in December. Let me unpack three of those notable items. First, we reinstated the impairment on the sale of our France retail business as signaled at the third quarter. Second, we booked a $0.4 billion of Treasury disposal losses in the quarter again in line with the guidance at the third quarter to extend the duration of hedges in anticipation of rate decreases. And finally, as you know each quarter we conduct a value and use test on the carrying value of our investment in BoCom, described in detail in our annual report and accounts. Following the outcomes of that test in Q4, we took a charge of $3 billion in the quarter against our carrying value. The charge had an insignificant impact on CT1 capital and our CT1 ratio, and no impact on our dividends or share buyback. And just to be clear, this has no impact on our strategy in mainland China, has no impact on our strategic relationship with BoCom, and it has no impact on HSBC's or BoCom's operation, strategy, or outlook. So on a reported basis, our profit before tax was $1 billion in the fourth quarter, down $4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the $6.3 billion impact of notable items in Argentina hyperinflation, our profit before tax was $7.3 billion, up $0.7 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to growth in banking NII. On the next slide, so on a reported basis, fourth quarter revenue was down $1.6 billion compared to the same period last year, due to the impact of notable items in Argentina hyperinflation. Excluding these, our revenue was up $1.5 billion, primarily banking NII. The strength of our deposit franchise, our access to 2D pools of liquidity in the U.K. and Hong Kong, and our enviable balance sheet made it possible for us to benefit from the more favorable rate environment. On the next slide, fourth quarter NII and banking NII were again impacted by Argentina hyperinflation and a reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue between NII and non-NII. Excluding these, both NII and banking NII were broadly stable on the third quarter, and NIM was down three basis points, primarily due to higher time deposit costs and deposit migration in Hong Kong. Turning to the outlook, taking our fourth quarter banking NII and adjusting for Argentina hyperinflation and the reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue, and the disposal of our France retail and Canada businesses, gives you an annualized run rate of just above $43 billion. That should be your starting point for modelling our 2024 banking NII. We expect four key variables to drive our banking NII from that starting point in 2024. Changes in interest rates, the reinvestment of maturing structural hedge assets at higher yield, deposit migration, particularly here in Hong Kong, and balance sheet movements. There is a degree of uncertainty inherent in all of these. We're guiding towards a banking NII of at least $41 billion in 2024. This is our current estimate of the bottom end of the range of reasonable outcomes, and is intended to help you with your modelling. We will continue updating further as the year unfolds. And before turning to non-NII, I'd like to direct your attention to the chart on the bottom right of this slide. Over the last 18 months, our banking NII sensitivity has reduced by around $3.5 billion. More than one third of this reduction is due to increased structural interest rate hedging. Subject to market conditions, we expect to increase both the notional and the duration of our structural hedge in the coming quarters, in order to reduce our banking NII sensitivity still further. Non-NII was down $0.9 billion compared to the same quarter last year, due to notable items in Argentina hyperinflation. And again, excluding these, non-NII was up $1.7 billion versus the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to the revenue offset into non-NII from the central cost of funding global banking and markets trading activity, which is included in banking NII, and from the cash flow hedge income reclassification between NII and non-NII, I referred to previously. Other non-NII was up modestly versus the same quarter last year, including an increase of $0.1 billion in net fee income, primarily in commercial banking and wealth and personal banking. Looking at non-NII from our two strategic activities of wholesale transaction banking and wealth. In wholesale transaction banking, non-NII was up 2% on the fourth quarter of 2022. There was good growth in global payment solution, in trade and in foreign exchange, reflecting the strength of our international network and transaction banking capabilities, as well as increased client activity and repricing initiatives. This was partly offset by a relatively small decrease in security services. In wealth, non-NII in both asset management and private banking grow by double digits versus the fourth quarter of last year, due to an increase in assets under management, partly driven by net new invested assets. However, total wealth non-NII was down $0.1 billion as a result of a $0.2 billion correction to historical valuation estimates in our insurance business. For the full year, non-NII in wholesale transaction banking was $10.6 billion, up 5% on 2022, and $6 billion in wealth, up 7%. Turning now to credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1 billion, primarily in wholesale. This brought our full year ECL charge to $3.4 billion, which was 33 basis points of average customer loans, including those held for sale, or 36 basis points excluding those, and within our full year 2023 guidance. Due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we're guiding towards ECLs of around 40 basis points for 2024. We took an ECL charge of $0.2 billion for mainland China commercial real estate in the fourth quarter, as part of the $1 billion charge for the quarter referenced in the last slide. This brought the full year charge on this portfolio to $1 billion, crystallizing the plausible downside scenario that we set out last February. Our main area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. That exposure is now $6.3 billion, down $1.2 billion in the quarter, and down $3.1 billion compared to full year 2022. We continue to monitor the sector closely, and we are comfortable with our current level of provisions. Turning to costs, full year 2023 costs on a constant currency basis were down 1%. On a target basis, full year 2023 costs came in 1% higher than our Q3 guidance, driven by three items that unexpectedly landed in the fourth quarter. First, the FDIC special assessment, which we expected to be incurred over 2024 and 2025. Second, the U.K. bank levy was higher than forecast, primarily due to adjustments relating to prior years. And third, there was an offsetting benefit from Argentina hyperinflation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we are aiming to limit cost growth to around 5% in 2024, on a target basis, which excludes the reduction in 2024 costs from the France, retail, and Canada disposals. This will be driven by the flow through impact of 2023 inflation to 2024 costs, investment and volume growth, and partly offset by cost-saving initiatives. On the next slide, customer lending and deposits were broadly stable versus the third quarter, once you exclude the sale of our France retail business. Without that, there was $35 billion of deposit growth, of which $27 billion was in Asia, with around half of this in Hong Kong. Deposit growth in Asia benefited from seasonality, and we would expect at least some of that growth to reverse in the course of Q1. Turning now to capital, our CT1 ratio at the end of 2023 was 14.8%, which was down 0.1 percentage points on the third quarter. There are three things I'd like to draw your attention to. First, as I said earlier, the BoCom charge had an insignificant impact on CT1 capital and our CT1 ratio due to the compensating reduction in regulatory capital threshold deductions, and it had no impact on dividends or share buybacks. Second, we expect the share buyback announced today to have an impact of around 25 basis points on our CT1 ratio in the first quarter of 2024. And finally, we expect the Canada sale to generate around 1.2 percentage points of CT1 in the first quarter of 2024. We remain committed to consider a $0.21 per share special dividend in the first half of 2024 as a priority use of the sale proceeds, which equates to around 0.5 percentage points of CT1. Before I hand back to Noel, I am pleased to share some enhancements that we have made with regard to our international disclosures. There are two sets of data, and Noel will also comment further on them. Starting with our wholesale business, let me walk you through the data on this slide. In 2023, we generated $33.5 billion of client revenue across commercial banking and global banking markets. Of this, $20.4 billion was generated from multi-jurisdictional clients. By this, we mean clients that bank with us in more than one market. The charts on the right show that two thirds of the client revenue we generate from those clients comes from providing them with services and markets outside their home market where they also bank with us. It is also worth pointing out that two thirds of multi-jurisdictional client revenue, or $13.4 billion, was generated from clients whose home market is in the West, with the remaining $7 billion from clients whose home market is in the East. Turning now to WPB international revenue, more than $10 billion, or 40% of our WPB revenue, comes from international customers, around two thirds of which is generated in Asia. So to summarize, both the wholesale and WPB client revenue data clearly demonstrates the strength of our international network and our unique capability to serve international clients. Our network and further investments into our international proposition position us to capture an even greater share of this vital, fast-growing sector. Let me now hand back to Noel.",

    "text": "Thanks, Georges. Thank you, Georges. You've just heard about good underlying performance in the fourth quarter, and Georges has introduced more detailed information about our international revenue. Our wholesale international business model is a mature and differentiated business model with substantial scale. And in recent years, we have started to develop and invest in our WPB international business model. What Georges slide showed is that already 40% of WPB revenue comes from international customers, and we believe we can take it much further. So let me now turn to how we will drive revenue growth, not just this year and next, but over the next three to four years. As always, I'll begin with our purpose, ambition, strategy and values. These have helped to drive the good underlying business growth, which alongside supportive interest rates, have given us strong momentum. In the short term, we're conscious of the potential downside risk to NII. The structural hedging we have put in place will help to protect that income. But we do have some clear focus areas under our four strategic pillars, which I will cover on the following slides. Starting with focus, and our international wholesale business, which remains our biggest competitive advantage, and because of its scale, our biggest growth opportunity. In the past, our businesses in the West were primarily focused on domestic clients. Over the last four years, we have repositioned those businesses to align them with our international strategy, exiting low return and low growth domestic RWAs. The result is the differentiated model you see today. In commercial banking, we are unique in our ability to serve clients across multiple geographies, which is what HSBC was founded to do. The result was the $13.3 billion of profit before tax that commercial banking generated last year. In global banking and markets, I believe we are uniquely positioned to connect clients between West and East, which was evident in our market-leading performances in markets like the Middle East and businesses like Global Foreign Exchange. We have clearly got a strong international franchise. As you can see, we facilitated more than $850 billion of trade last year, with the diversification of supply chains leading to revenue growth opportunities for HSBC. We are ranked second globally by revenue in our payments business, and processed around $500 trillion of electronic payments. And we have been number three globally by revenue in FX since 2021. But I believe there is significant amount of untapped opportunity still to go for, which can drive revenue growth in the face of declining interest rates. Importantly, this potential revenue growth is not necessarily dependent on GDP, as that growth opportunity already exists within our client base, and it is often fee-based and strongly influenced by opportunities that are inherent to our international nature of our client base. To provide some evidence of this growth potential, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 29% in 2023, and the revenue multiplier for multi-jurisdictional corporate clients in commercial banking was five times that of an average domestic-only customer. I am pleased that international isn't just a wholesale story. We are doing more with our WPB customers as well. Building our wealth business to meet the rising demand for wealth management services, especially here in Asia, has been a strategic priority in recent years. So I am pleased that we attracted net new invested assets of $84 billion last year, compared to $80 billion in 2022 and $64 billion in 2021. This is a good indicator of future revenue opportunities, which again is often fee-income and should benefit in a lower interest rate environment as investors shift from cash reserves into invested asset classes. Another trend is the growing demand for seamless cross-border banking services. Innovation is key here, and we hadn't innovated enough in this space in the past, which meant we weren't offering our customers what they wanted. But we are now. Global Money has more than 1.3 million customers, up from 550,000 a year ago. We also launched a new, strengthened international banking proposition. Overall, we grew revenue from WPB international customers by 41% last year, from $7.2 billion to $10.2 billion. And while you might assume this was driven solely by higher rates, I am pleased to say there was a 43% jump in new-to-bank international WPB customers last year. Again, these are higher revenue generating customers, bringing in three times as much revenue as an average domestic-only customer. Next is the continued growth in our two home markets. Our leading propositions in Hong Kong and the U.K. provide us with deep liquidity and a differentiated proposition. These two pools of liquidity underpin our exceptionally strong balance sheet, which gives us the safety and security that our clients trust us to provide. Hong Kong and the U.K. are both highly connected global financial centers. We have increased our market leading share of trade finance in Hong Kong by 6.6 percentage points over the last three years. This included a 2.4 percentage point increase last year alone. We are also ideally positioned to capitalize as the mass affluent population in Hong Kong and mainland China continues to grow. Driven by rapid urbanization across mainland China and the increased use of the connect schemes between mainland China and Hong Kong. We grew new to bank retail customers in Hong Kong by 36% over the last three years, including by capitalizing on the significant increase of visitors from mainland China post reopening. In the U.K., we also have good traction in commercial banking. In 2023, we were the number one bank for U.K. large corporates, as well as the best bank in the U.K. for SMEs, according to Euro Money. And we are continuing to grow in wealth and personal banking. We attracted over 1 million new to bank customers in the U.K. last year. And we've had steady mortgage growth, increasing our market share of U.K. stock to 8%. As economic conditions improve and we continue to invest, we're confident in our ability to grow our business further in these critical areas. Next, I showed a slide like this last year to demonstrate how we've gone from a business that depended on our home markets for the vast majority of our profits, while the rest of the franchise underperformed, to one with broad based profitability across markets. This slide shows the increasing profitability of these diversified growth opportunities. The number one rankings speak for themselves. And I especially want to call out the great work that the global banking and markets team are doing in the Middle East. They now topped these rankings three years in a row in a region that presents significant growth opportunities going forward. India, mainland China, excluding associates and Singapore all contributed more than $1 billion of profits in 2023. With Singapore doing so for the first time. This underlines why HSBC was named best bank in Asia by Euromoney. But there was strong growth across all these markets. The next slide underlines that we have reshaped our portfolio to reinforce strengths while exiting areas of underperformance and/or lower strategic priority. Over the last 12 months, we've announced exits in a number of our smaller markets. This is one way that we expect to take out further costs alongside our continued focus on improving the internal efficiency of the bank. And by making savings, we can invest in the areas on the left that help us to drive growth. Before I move on, I want to mention SVB UK. Everyone knows that HSBC is an international bank. But we also have a long history of supporting innovative entrepreneurs. And the acquisition of SVB UK enabled us to build a bigger proposition that can help us to become known as the go to bank for innovation companies. It's encouraging that innovation banking had its best ever quarter for customer onboarding in the fourth quarter of 2023. I'm also encouraged by how many of those innovative companies want to take their capabilities cross border. The next slide sets out how we're investing in technology to make customer experiences better, sell process is more efficient and our cost of execution lower. I'm pleased to see more of our personal and corporate customers are mobile and digitally active. HSBC has traditionally grown by cross-selling products to our existing banking clients, but innovation also enables us to open up growth avenues that are beyond our traditional customer footprint. Zing is one such growth avenue because it offers cross-border payment capabilities, but critically it is targeted at non-HSBC customers. Our embedded finance joint venture announced with Tradeshift last year is another such growth avenue. It's still early days for both, but they will allow us to break outside of the existing business model. I will also briefly cover our final two pillars. There isn't a conversation I have with a client where the net zero transition doesn't come up. Our first net zero transition plan shows how we intend to finance and support the transition to net zero and collaborate globally to help enable change at scale. It will be a complex journey, but we have exactly the right geographic footprint where the need and opportunity are greatest. Finally, energize. Over the last four years, we've increased the pace of execution across the organization. The management team is confident about the business, but it's even more important that our colleagues are confident, because when they are, we stand a much greater chance of succeeding. So I'm pleased that our 2023 staff survey showed the number of colleagues seeing the positive impact of our strategy was up 11 percentage points from 2020 to 73%. And I'm also very excited by the number of quality new hires we've been able to bring into the organization over the last 12 months. It's also a vote of confidence in our strategy and the momentum we have built over the last four years. In summary, I will go back to what I said at the start. I'm really pleased with how we performed in 2023 and the contribution that our people made. We reported $30 billion of PBT for the first time and a mid-teens RoTE. There was good underlying growth in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation. Our profit before tax was $7.3 billion. We distributed $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of 2023. This included the best full-year dividend since 2008 and three share buybacks. And we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. We remain committed to cost discipline and we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue even in a lower rates environment. We're confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver mid-teens returns in 2024. With that, let me hand over to Noel for Q&A.",

In particular, if the banking NII sensitivity for the next 100 basis points of trade cuts can be guided to us. The second one is around the gain, the implied improvement in the capital from the gain in Canadian operations. And that remains at around $10 billion of which $4 billion can be special dividend.

    "text": "Thank you Noel. Thanks Gurpreet. So we have not at this stage given guidance for full year 2025. I point you to the guidance we've given for full year 2024 of at least $41 billion in banking NII and mid-teens return on tangible equity. In terms of banking NII sensitivity, we do have a slide at the back end of the deck, which I can point you to, which shows for the further 100 basis point and for future years what's the impact. What I can point you to is number one, we continue to intend to increase subject to market conditions, but as of today to increase the structural hedge. Second the volume of the structural hedge. Second, we continue to intend to increase the weighted average life of the structural hedge, having now reached 2.8 years and with the intent to take it to about three years, both of which should give you a sense of how we're mitigating rate impacts into 2024 and 2025 from the structural hedging activity. With regards again on Canada, so $10 billion proceeds, $4 billion will be considered, well we committed to consider as a priority use for a special dividend. The residual $6 billion will constitute about 0.8%, 0.9% additional CET1, which may, which very likely will be at the Q1 outcome. We will continue looking at opportunities, but it remains our intent, subject to market conditions, our capital position, regulatory position, it remains our intent to continue a rolling series of share buybacks beyond this one.",

    "text": "Hi. Good morning from London, good afternoon to yourselves. Two questions please. Firstly, I just want to clarify the messaging on the banking NII outlook. If I rewind 12 months ago, I think you gave guidance for greater than $36 billion of reported NII, but then this time a year ago you said you weren't seeking to move consensus, which at the time was actually higher, it was at $37. If I fast forward to today, you're guiding to greater than $41. If I look at consensus NII, I adjust the trading book funding costs, it looks like consensus banking NII is around $44. So are you seeking to rebase consensus banking NII or should we put greater emphasis on your greater than within that $41 target? So that's my first question. I just want to clarify that messaging. My second question is around the hedge. Thank you for the extra disclosure on the $478 billion nominal and the 2.8 years average life. Can you give us an idea of both the average yield on that book and also where it's currently rolling off that and what you're aiming to roll it back on at if you are extending the duration now?

    "text": "Thank you, Andrew. So obviously today we cannot see consensus banking NII and basically I'll use this opportunity to ask you collectively if you can start giving us your banking NII. So we can see the NII forecasts and then the funding costs of the Trading Book gets lumped together with the non-NII and it's to be fair difficult for us to unpack it. Although $44 billion does sound high if we try to do the math ourselves. But let me take a step back and just walk you through how we're thinking about NII and just bear with me for two minutes. But I think that explanation will probably help guide you. So we start from a Q4 10.7 billion banking NII. We would adjust then Q4 for the parts related to Argentina hyperinflation as well as the reclassification of the cash flow hedges between NII and non-NII. We'll adjust for the part that does not pertain to Q4. So that's a full year correction. And that's about an additional $0.5 billion you could use on the Q4 10.7 number. So that takes you to 11.2 adjusted quarterly run rates. Annualized taking into account day counts you get to 44.4. From that 44.4 remember you have to deduct the full year French NII, France retail NII, as well as three quarters from the Canada NII, which together combined come to about $1.3 billion. So $44.4 minus $1.3 takes you to just above $43 billion. That would be our starting position if you want, in terms of an annualization of a run rate, factoring in structural hedges, etcetera. Now from that $43 billion, there are various tailwinds and headwinds. We have the tailwind of reinvestment of all the structural hedges from lower rates into the current rate environment. We do have some tailwinds, probably cautious on H1, but tailwinds beyond H1 in terms of volume growth and loan growth. And we do have headwinds, including the rate cycle, if indeed we start seeing the decreases in the second half of the year. And we obviously have the headwinds, which we've observed specifically in Hong Kong around deposit migration to term deposits. Kind of baking all of that into account, we're getting to the guidance of at least $41 billion that we're comfortable sharing today. With regards to the structural hedge, we have shared with you volume. We have shared with you the weighted average life. And we have shared with you now banking NII sensitivity. We have not yet shared and we have not yet found the level of standard we would need to be able to share the yield. But what I can tell you about the yield is that both the yield of the maturing hedges being replaced at current rates, as well as the additional hedges we're doing with inverted curves are all baked into our at least $41 billion banking NII guidance.",

    "text": "So if I could just add a couple of comments. One reason we're not giving a statement regarding consensus is, as Georges says, we think consensus is a mixture of updated thinking that has adjusted for some of these annualization effects of disposals and other things. And some consensus hasn't adjusted for that at the moment. So I think there's a little bit of apples and pears in today's consensus position. So what Georges is clearly trying to articulate for you is, take the Q4, adjust it for the known items, get to a new starting position of $43 billion, and he's underpinned that starting position of $43 billion with at least $41. Therefore, the range of modeling is going to be somewhere between $41 and $43, depending on the assumptions you might make on the headwinds and the tailwinds. And we think that given that lack of consistency on consensus, the uncertainty in the market, that's probably the best way to guide you on banking NII. There's a very clear repositioning of the starting position to get us back on an apples and apples basis. And then the other thing, no, that was it. That's what I wanted to say. Those two comments.

    "text": "Katherine Lee from JPMorgan. So I have two questions here. The first question I want to clarify, the mid-teen RoTE guidance is on normalized lot. That means that the RoTE, excluding Canada disposal game. So I want to clarify that because if that is the case in mid-teen RoTE, then if you look at the company compiler consensus, I think the RoTE is 17.4%. Then I just calculated on a very like top-down basis, excluding the disposal gain and consensus RoTE is roughly about mid-teens as well. But the thing is that I think that means that the HSBC guidance and consensus is quite in line in terms of normalized RoTE. But I think on NII, on cost, I think in the previous questions, I think there may be a bit of reset in expectation. And then I think cost, the 5% cost is a bit higher than where consensus was indicating. Then that means -- does it mean that you are quite optimistic on non-NII growth, i.e., fee growth or maybe you have a different view on asset quality and, hence, the ECL charges. I think this is the first part of the big question. The second part is on BoCom. May I know like what trigger the $3 billion impairment charges? And as China's yield is declining like they just announced a 25 basis point on 5-year LPL cuts in all those. Should we be expecting more impairments on the BoCom investment? So basically, I want to see if there is any onetime of events that trigger this impairment or if it is going to be a normalized part of the business. So I think in the statement, you clearly stated that they will have no impact on dividends and shareholders' return. I believe this is related to the $14 billion capital deduction, which you have already made on associate. I think that is primarily BoCom. But can you explain a bit of that mechanism? Because I think today's share price reaction is partly factoring in the kind of concern that if there is an ongoing impairment on BoCom, that will affect the company's ability to deliver shareholders' return. Yes.",

    "text": "Thank you, Katherine. So Katherine, taking them in the order you said the first mid-teens RoTE is excluding notable items. Therefore, it is excluding the gain on Canada. So your calculation is correct. In terms of NII and cost, there's a couple of things to share. We recognize the cost assessment. In terms of banking NII, we have given the guidance here. Just point to -- I mentioned it in my earlier speech, but I just point you that our banking NII sensitivity has reduced more than -- by more than half from the full year 2022 due to, among other parameters, our structured lending activity. So therefore, the rate impact on our banking NII is reduced commensurately. Equally, we do have some anticipation of volume growth if and when rates start increasing, which is now planned for H2, and this is why we have some positive outlook for H2. If rate decrease volume could pick up, subject to economic conditions, etcetera. But that's the assessment we have made today. And then thirdly, on the non-rate sensitive earnings. I've called out transaction banking and went earlier. Between them, they constitute about 80% of our non-rate sensitive earnings. One has grown 5%, 23 to 22, and the other one has grown 7%. And therefore, we do feel there is momentum in both these areas for continued growth. And I didn't talk about the residual 20%, but in the residue 20% capital market activities, for instance, is included. And again, in a different rate environment, we have grounds to believe this can also pick up. So yes, we are comfortable with the momentum we have in the revenue. Can I point you on one thing about cost? We called it out 5% for the 2024 has a flow-through impact from inflation in 2023. 2023 experienced high inflation. There is some flow-through, some adjustments, including wage inflation, which we anticipate to do in 2024. Based on current outlook of inflation, that parameter is easing as we look forward beyond 2024 without giving you any guidance for 2025. The inflationary component flow through into 2025 does look like easing from where we stand today, looking at 2024 outlook for inflation. If I move on to your second question about BoCom. So this is a -- we do talk about the value-in-use model. It's following the Hong Kong accounting standards, international accounting standards. Without boring you with the accounting details, the ARNA has many pages, which we can point you to that explain it. It feeds into parameters all in the -- essentially, in the public domain including macro data, other factors, including analyst comments, feeds into the model. But the model is not highly intuitive, but the outcome is the outcome, and we've been consistently applying it for umpteenth quarters now and therefore, we'll apply for Q4. It is very difficult to predict what the model will give us in Q1. We will take into account the information we receive over the course of Q1, and we will run the model as we do every quarter and consistently apply the outcome. Finally, captive deduction. I think this is a very important point. Your math, Katherine is correct. There is about $14 billion sitting today in our regulatory capital deductions because they sit above our threshold. Therefore, you could legitimately assume that there is that much of buffer against any impairments we face in our financial holdings, BoCom being one of them. The other one is insurance. That's the two essentially. And therefore, you can legitimately assume that the compensation we would get from any hypothetical future impairment will be commensurate given the size of our threshold deductions at this stage. Yes.",

I think you can probably get a sense that there's some reasonable confusion about what the message is for the 2024 baseline. If we work back from your kind of clean mid-teens ROE, you've given us some guidance on cost. You've given us some guidance on credit. It's kind of getting into a baseline revenue number of about $64 billion in consensus is $63.5 billion or thereabouts. Are you comfortable with that consensus number? Are you seeking to change that with this guide? So that is question number one. And question number 2 is, why the focus on banking NII versus total NII because it's going to be as rates come down a lot of moving parts on the trading book funding cost dynamic because, indeed, if I look at your annual report, you've actually got a benefit coming through in the USD bucket from rates falling in terms of the aggregate NII.

Otherwise, I'll be giving you guidance on our full profitability. But we recognize your arithmetics. A couple of things just to highlight if you want to for your consideration. The first one is our guidance for banking NII is not $41 billion. It's at least $41 billion, factoring in elements of uncertainty that I called out earlier, that's for full year 2024. You do have the building blocks for cost and for ECL. And then the residual part, if you want, of our earnings story is the non-NII component, excluding the gains from Canada. And as I said earlier, about 80% of it is generated from transaction banking and wealth, both of which do have momentum, both of which are areas where we continue investing both in terms of digital capabilities and client servicing and in terms of net new invested assets. And we are excited about the potential of these two businesses, and we believe our meetings RoTE is not based on unreasonable growth in these areas. It's based on momentum growth in these areas. Maybe I can point you to our net new invested assets, $84 billion for the year, up from $80 billion last year, up from $64 billion the year before. So clearly, we're acquiring new assets. But equally, as you've seen, Asset Management, Private Banking grew double-digit percentage points. That's also partly due to the valuation because our AUM is also increasing because the underlying valuation is improving, which is, therefore, a generator of fees commensurately, subject to market conditions as we go forward.",

Do you expect growth to pick up in Half 2, but 2024 as a whole, can you just confirm that you expect net growth in the balance sheet?

We have not communicated a further plausible downside on the China commercial real estate portfolio booked in Hong Kong because we believe at this stage that, number one, we're well provisioned for this portfolio afterwards -- after the provisioning that's taken place last year. And number two, we also have less concerns going forwards on our residual exposure in that portfolio. I can point you to our exposure is now at $6.2 billion, that's down $3.1 billion from full year 2022. So therefore, we do not -- we have reduced level of concern. I can walk you through, if needed, the -- how well ECL positioning is in this portfolio but we're comfortable. No additional concerns than we caught out last year. On the loan growth, yes, our expectations is that as economic conditions continue improving and the interest rate environment becomes more supportive, we would expect to see loan growth. We continue to guide on a medium-term basis to mid-single-digit percentage points loan growth and balance sheet growth. It's very difficult to forecast what H2 will look like, but that is part of our projections.",

    "text": "Thanks, Noel. So Robert, we've added about 80 -- or north of $80 billion to our hedge this year in terms of bond notional a little bit more in terms of other derivative notional. And that's on top of $80 billion we've added over Q4 and starting in Q3 in 2022. So that should give you an idea of also what is the quantum we could reasonably do in 2024 if the market conditions remain supportive for the hedge. In terms of duration, I mean, the kind of -- the obvious one to call out is we can certainly hedge on our weighted average life for slightly longer currencies such as the pound, the U.S. dollar and some extent, the euro. We have an inability to hedge in any reasonable size or shape and this is due to structural market, our Hong Kong dollar exposure. So our Hong Kong dollar exposure hedge would remain much lower. And therefore, our exposure in Hong Kong dollar would remain more sensitive to the rate outlook compared to the other currencies. In terms of Canada sale, you could expect in Q1, subject to completion, which is now I believe -- which is now planned to be -- on track to be by the end of Q1. We would expect to see a jump of 1.2%, 1.3% in our CET1 ratio. The special dividend, which we're committed to consider would happen afterwards. Our best estimate is H1, but frankly, afterwards as soon as we can subject to all necessary approvals. And that will drop the CET1 by about 0.5, with a result in net of around 0.8 in our CET1 after the dividend. We will update you at the Q1 results about the special dividend considerations.",

    "text": "Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple. I guess the first one is as -- just what can you do with cost in the falling rate environment because you've talked about management actions. I guess the reason I'm asking is because this year, I believe all in is about 7% year-on-year. And of course, it includes a lot of one-offs like levies in this quarter and SVB earlier in the year. But on the basis that it crept up from plus 2% year-on-year, which is, I think, the first we talked about the 2023 guidance to the end result being something like 6%, 7%. And just wondering what levers do you have in your sort of cost management action pocket to combat costs if revenue were to disappoint. So that's number one. And the second question is, I think we will talk a lot about what might happen to revenues in various rate environments. But -- and also just thank you for the disclosures on the structural hedge. But I guess stepping back a little bit from that. Just a couple of clarifications. So in a falling rate environment, how would you expect things like customer behavior to respond? So things like deposit mix shift like in Hong Kong. So I guess the mix shift towards term happened quite a lot faster in Hong Kong versus the U.K. on the way up and it's still ongoing from the disclosures today. So if rates were to turn, would you expect that flip back to be pretty quick? Or on a pretty high rate environment? Or do you still expect to make sure to continue? So I think you talked about things like capital markets might outperform in a falling rate environment. So I guess, on an underlying basis, just how do you see that because capital markets and loan growth, etcetera, I guess a lot of it is also to do with the underlying GDP as well. And there's still a lot of uncertainty sort of on the horizon. So even if rates were to come down, just how quickly do you think these benefits can come through?",

    "text": "Good. Yes. Thanks. So on a reported basis, 2023 to 2022, we were down 1%. And so the growth against our target of 6% also is reflective of the fact that a lot of the restructuring costs we've taken in 2022 did not repeat. We've guided how the costs have increased from our initial 3% where we included severance into the 6%. Obviously, the last percent this quarter was unexpected. The rules for the FDIC special assessment came in November. The earlier draft rules we've seen in September indicated we would be incurring that cost in 2024 and 2025, but the rules that came in November had us to have to -- have a different accounting treatment and accelerate all that as did all other banks who were subject to the FDIC special assessment. So I just want to call it out that this one a particular event we called out. We -- as we look at going forward for 2024, we're looking at a 5% on a target basis growth. This is excluding the cost reduction we would get from exiting the French retail business and the Canada business. Between the two of them, we will be exiting on an annual basis and equivalent to $1 billion, just shy of that, which is around 3%. That would be a reduction in cost of 3%, but that is excluded from the way we're managing our target basis. Just explaining how we're coming up with this cost, and then Noel can talk you through the levers to manage our cost. So first, there is this flow-through inflation from 2023. There is some wage adjustments we need to take into account for 2024 based on the flow-through inflation from 2023. That component, we feel is easing and hopefully, and the outlook of inflation will ease as we go out of 2024 into the future. There is continued spend in technology and continued investment in some of the growth areas -- organic growth areas. That's particularly true in wealth. And those spending are partly offset by a number of cost management actions, some of which we have taken already such as the severance program, which will have a flow-through benefit into 2024, and other actions we're planning to take. Just before Noel talks to levers, we're looking at cost as in growth on a target basis in dollar numbers. We're not looking at our cost efficiency ratio basis. There may be fluctuation to our revenue, but frankly, in a year like 2023, our CER has dropped from 65% in 2022 to 48%. So we will tolerate some volatility on the CER as long as we're managing our cost in spend dollar basis. But...",

    "text": "Thank you. Thanks Georges. And I know this is an important topic, and let me reiterate upfront, we remain committed to cost discipline. The question is how are we achieving cost discipline? We obviously look for efficiencies in the existing organization. We invest in tech to drive efficiencies in our processing costs, and we're continuing to do that. We invest in simplification of the portfolio, closing down businesses organically, exiting costs organically. But we're also exiting costs through M&A. And in our target basis, we adjust for that. But I don't want you to lose sight. We have exited -- we'll be exiting $1 billion of cost in 2024 as a function of M&A decisions. Portfolio choices made for good strategic reasons. $300 million of that was the exit of our French retail business. It's a business that was losing money. So we've exited $300 million of costs by selling and it's going to be profit accretive because that business was a loss-making business. We've exited $800 million of costs in Canada through selling. We hope to by the end of Q1, not tempting fate. Why are we doing it? Because that business in our hands was probably valued at around 1 times book, and we were able to generate 2.5 times book as over 2.5 times book. We sold it because it was worth more to somebody else than to us. And we're redistributing the proceeds of that to our shareholders because we thought it was the right answer for our shareholders. So we do internally generated cost efficiency and externally generated cost efficiency for good strategic reasons, and we'll continue to pull those levers. Now the other thing is we are -- we do believe an organization like us with the growth opportunities we have, we should invest. And we made a decision last year on our original cost target of 3% to actually move it up to 4% because we were continuing to invest in tech. And in tech today as part of our overall cost base is now around 22%. When I took over four years ago, tech as a percent of our cost base was 16%. So we're trying to remain disciplined on cost and change the nature of the costs to be a much more strategic cost component in driving future enhancements for customer propositions and efficiencies. So that's sort of the thinking we have. You have our absolute commitment, both myself and Georges and the management teams. We will keep cost discipline. We'll invest and save at the same time. We have to acknowledge the flow-through of inflation. But the other component we made a decision on in 2023, given the very, very strong performance the business had, we thought it was right to go from 4% to 5% by topping up the variable pay pool by an extra percent. We thought that was the right decision for our people. So we think it's the right cost decision, but it has inflated our cost compared to our original target of 3%. But I think we had to do the right thing by our people on that. And then the final 1% taking us to the 6% number you talked about was unexpected. When we talked to you in Q3, we didn't expect that final 1% to come through for FDIC and bank levies. The FDIC is probably a timing issue. It was going to come through in 2024 or 2025, but it actually surprisingly came through in the final quarter of the year. So you've got our commitment will remain tight with high cost. There is now turn to revenues. And let me maybe again, decompose how we think about revenue growth outside of NII or interest income. Clearly, the great work that Georges and the team have done on hedging and further structural hedges we put in place and the extra duration is a mitigant to the downside. I look at the opportunity on the upside in two components. One, is our core USP of International Banking. We have within our franchise, clients who operate in more countries than we currently bank them, be they personal clients or corporate clients. We still have huge amounts of untapped opportunity to further penetrate our client base. And every time you saw in the revenue multipliers, we take a client to multiple jurisdictions, a revenue multiplier of 5 times domestic revenue in Wholesale Banking, 3 times domestic revenue in retail banking. That's an internal generated revenue opportunity, not dependent on GDP. That's in our hands. The second revenue opportunity you talked about in your analysis is countercyclical. And I do believe -- I've been around 37 years, so I've seen some cycles. And I do believe lower inflation, leads to lower interest rates, lower interest rates lead to a pickup in economic activity normally for the lag effect. And I do believe that pickup will have a positive impact on capital market activity in our Global Banking and Markets business. I think it will have a big and positive impact on demand for corporate lending and personal lending in our wholesale and retail business, lag effect, as I've talked about. And thirdly, I think consumers will start to shift out of cash into invested assets, and that's a huge opportunity for our wealth business. And you've seen our track record on our ability to attract net new invested assets over the last three years, $84 billion, $80 billion, $64 billion. That's where we're very focused and a lot of our investment is going. Now it's for us, the management team to deliver on that. So we know we got to deliver on tight costs and cost discipline, and we've got to deliver on revenue diversification. My final comment on this is I'm grateful that we've had four years of transformation because we now are through the majority of that transformation focus, majority, and we're now focused on that growth opportunity. And we're in a fortunate position that all of the hard work over the last four years has given us that platform for growth. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you very much. Hi, Noel, hi Georges. I have two broad questions. The first one is kind of split into two. I've got a second question around GB&M, sorry, capital return. First broad question, it's around fee income. The first part of it is, I'm a bit confused by your banking NII sensitivity. You can see on Slide 34, $3.4 billion on 100 basis points rate cap. But the majority of that comes from nonbanking -- sorry, non-NII. So can you help me there because I just don't understand that? I thought banking NII kind of stripped out the trading funding cost. So whatever color you can give us there? And the related question is that your outlook for fee income, more broadly, I get your messaging around wealth. Transaction banking is kind of demonstrating positive momentum. But can I ask you about the other big chunk of fee income, which is GB&M. And there's various moving parts there. I suspect that you think cyclically, it's not earning its full amount. But I also do note that Global FX has kind of been decent for a while. So can you give us your view on to what extent that business is operating at, below or ahead of kind of capacity? That was a kind of broad two-pronged question on fee income, believe it or not. The second question was around your distribution, your approach to distribution that you're potentially phasing down the barrel of slower volume growth in 2024. And I'm interested in you're arguably then going to be more capital generative this year on still decent profits, and not a lot of balance sheet growth. How do you approach that? Do you kind of give us additional buybacks through the course of this year? Or do you kind of hold that powder dry for a bigger rebound in 2025, say? Thank you very much.",

    "text": "Sure. Aman, so what historically we've been giving you is NII sensitivity. But there is a big component that is rate sensitive in our earnings, which doesn't sit in NII. It sits in non-NII under funding cost of the trading book. And what we've been doing, and hopefully, that slide was meant to clarify it, but I'm assuming now we have to take probably more offline with you to go through it. What we've been doing is showing the sensitivity of both the NII to rates as well as the sensitivity of the funding cost of trading book to rate. And then giving you the full sensitivity of banking NII to rate because that would be a better representation of how sensitive our earnings are to rate, and it will take away the noise that is created by ongoing commercial decisions on how much we've -- how much funds we provide the trading activity or take away from the trading activity in year. It kind of cleanses that information out because it's just giving you the total that is relevant for our overall earnings. That sensitivity has reduced by more than half over the year in part at least for 30%, 40% of it due to our structural hedging activity. With regards the fee income, you mentioned FX having a good and decent income. A couple of things about GB&M to call out. First, the PBT of GB&M was more than 20% or 25% higher year-on-year. So clearly, a business that increases PBT. Its return on tangible equity has exceeded our cost of capital. It's something that has been not achieved for many years. It's above 12%. And to be also fair to GB&M, it's return tangible equity only increased by about 10% because there are some corporate center related adjustments, which is affected them. Otherwise, the return on tangible equity could have followed the trend of PBT growth because their RWAs were down, and they could have seen close to 20%. And therefore, well above their cost of equity. So we're comfortable with how the business is continue to transform itself, focusing on their strength and adjusting their footprint, and that momentum continues. In terms of distribution, well, first, it remains our ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks as long as our capital supports it and the outlook for capital does support it, but this remains subject to ongoing macroeconomic developments and regulatory approvals, etcetera. And one thing to call out with regards our bolt-on acquisitions is when we look at an acquisition, obviously, the first parameter is making sure it's a strategic and accelerating growth area that we strategically want to grow. But the second parameter that we also use equally is that it is accretive compared to a share buyback. So we're making sure that when we go for a bolt-on acquisition, the investments is more accretive than the investment in buying our own shares. And this is -- this would be a disciplined measure to make sure we're doing M&A that is both strategic and accretive. And finally, in terms of other parts of the distribution, 50% dividend payout ratio for 2024, which we reaffirmed. And then if you want to give a -- if you want to have a benchmark on where we would operate on a target basis, our CET1 ratio, it will be in the 14 to 14.5 range, which we reiterate, but we recognize we may not meet that target because we may be well above it for a few quarters in particular, thanks to Canada, but also to our own capital generation.",

The Board and I would like to pay tribute to Noel's exceptional [indiscernible] As Group Chief Executive, he drags both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler, more focused business through the disposal of assets in the U.S., France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver an improved performance, achieving record profits last year and create a platform for future growth and development. Now, you'll hear from him in a second, has decided it's the right time to step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments. As you would expect, the Board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already have started a robust and rigorous process to find our next group Chief Executive. This process will look at both internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased that now has agreed to remain in his role while this process takes place, ensuring a smooth and orderly transition.

    "text": "Thank you, Mark. I'm very grateful for your support, guidance, friendship and partnership. I'm proud of what my HSBC colleagues and I have achieved together over the past 5 years. Over that period, we have hit some significant milestones, record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade and the highest dividend since 2008. As Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we have built a strong platform for the bank's next phase of development and growth. That's why I feel this is the right time to step back to find a better balance between my personal and business commitments with the intention going forward after a break of pursuing a portfolio career. When I reflect back on the last 37 years, I have held intensive leadership roles, particularly since I took over the U.K. Commercial Bank in October of 2008. After 16 years of intensive leadership, I'm ready for a change. But it's also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It's an ideal time to bring in new leadership. The Board has now started a process to find my successor, and I'm very happy to continue in my role as that process takes place. Rest assured, I will be working hard to ensure a smooth and orderly transition for my successor and to keep the momentum going in this business, as you have seen in Q1. Until then, it's business as usual. So, let's now turn to our Q1 results, which have showed continued progress. We had a good first quarter. Reported profit before tax was $12.7 billion. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion. Our return on tangible equity was 16.4%, excluding notable items. I'm also pleased with the further capital distributions of $8.8 billion, which brings the total amount of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last 15 months to almost $28 billion. And we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance for 2024. I will now hand over to George to take you through the numbers.",

    "text": "Thank you, Noel. I'd like to open by paying tribute to the enormous contribution Noel has made to the bank. I've greatly enjoyed working alongside him. And I know everyone at the bank has appreciated this strong and effective leadership. I'm also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since my appointment as CFO, 15 months ago. The Board has announced the process to find a successor, and I know Non and I will continue to remain very focused on the job at hand until that process has been completed. Turning now to the numbers. Reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion was down $0.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, down $0.4 billion on last year's first quarter. On an annualized basis, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 26.1% or 16.4%, excluding notable items. We completed the $2 billion share buyback announced in February in 2 months. This means that since the end of 2022, we have bought back 6% of our outstanding shares. And the trend of strong shareholder distributions continues this quarter. We have announced, as Noel said, a further $8.8 billion of distributions consisting of first interim dividend for '24 of $0.10 per share. The special dividend of $0.21 per share from the Canada sale proceeds and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we plan to begin right after the AGM and complete within 3 months. Finally, we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items and our commitment to limit cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. So, on the next slide, reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion included $4.8 billion gain on the sale of Canada, partly offset by the $1.1 billion impairment on the classification of Argentina as held for sale. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion with revenue growth offset primarily by higher costs and ECLs. Revenue of $20.8 billion was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue was $17 billion, which was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year, with growth in banking NII, partly offset by lower fee and other income. Within that, we saw high single-digit growth in multi-jurisdictional revenue in the first quarter, which underlines the value of our global network. Banking NII of $11.3 billion was up $0.6 billion on the fourth quarter on the reported FX basis, mainly driven by Argentina banking NII as well as the nonrecurrence of the cash flow hedge reclassification in the last quarter. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, a few things to keep in mind. First, our Q1 banking NII included $0.3 billion from Canada, which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion of the sale in March this year. Second, first quarter banking NII also included $0.5 billion from Argentina. This contribution will continue to be highly volatile until the sale is completed, which we expect to be within the next 12 months. Please, therefore, do not extrapolate the $0.5 billion run rate for the remainder of the year. Our banking NII guidance assumes a contribution of around $1 billion in full year '24 for Argentina, which is in line with full year 2023. Third, the banking NII outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our full year results in February. The Hong Kong time deposit mix remained stable as a percentage of customer deposits in the quarter and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates. However, it is still early in the year, and these things can change. So, we are maintaining our 2024 banking NII guidance of at least $41 billion. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was down by 9%, primarily due to the normalization of FX revenues compared to a very strong foreign exchange performance in the first quarter of last year, which benefited from higher market volatility. Fees from Global Payment Solutions had another good quarter, up by 6%. Wealth is another growth area that had a very good quarter, up by 14% on the same period last year as our investment continued to drive improved results. Private Banking was a standout performer, mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia, but growth in wealth has been broad-based. To illustrate this, we acquired around 135,000 new-to-bank retail wealth customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. Approximately 60% of these were nonresidents attracted by our service and product capabilities in Hong Kong. Building on previous quarters, we attracted $27 billion of net new invested assets, of which $19 billion were in Asia. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.8 billion, up from $0.4 billion in the first quarter of last year. On credit, expected credit losses were $0.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 30 basis points of average loans. These were primarily Stage 3 charges across retail and wholesale. There was a $54 million charge related to our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. While challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more benign ECL contribution from it than last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue monitoring developments closely. And we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around 40 basis points of average loans, recognizing the overall uncertainty from the flow-through effect of higher rates on the economy. Next, we are on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. This quarter's year-on-year cost growth was impacted by 3 items. First, we chose to face the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. This accounted for 2 percentage points of cost growth this quarter. We do not currently expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly different to 2023. So, the accrual will be lower over the next 3 quarters than it was in the same period last year. Second, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to 1 percentage point of cost growth this quarter as we only acquired SBB U.K. in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide you with a fuller update on that business at the half year, but I'm pleased that it has good momentum. In the U.K., we onboarded 183 new-to-bank innovation banking client groups in the quarter, the best quarter since acquisition. Finally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank Finland levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost discipline, and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis, inclusive of all the above items. On lending and deposits. There was good loan growth in the U.K., the Middle East, Mexico and Asia, excluding Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remains subdued, largely due to the high interest rate differential with Mainland China. Overall, we continue to expect mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium to long term, but we expect demand to remain subdued in the near term. Deposits were down 2%. This was due to a range of factors, including seasonality, the switch from time deposits to wealth products in Hong Kong and our deliberate choice to forsake some highly price-sensitive deposits. Next, our CET 1 ratio was 15.2%, up 40 basis points on the fourth quarter. Organic capital generation and the gain from the sale of the Canadian business enabled us to announce $8.8 billion of capital distributions this quarter. This includes a share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have an impact of around 40 basis points on our CET1 ratio in the second quarter. For modeling purposes, please note that the $5.8 billion of dividends announced today as well as the $5.9 billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full year results in February will both be reflected in TNAV in the second quarter. At closing of the sale of HSBC Argentina, which is expected within 12 months, we will also recognize $4.9 billion of foreign exchange reserve recycling losses subject to any movement in this reserve up until completion. These losses have already been accumulated in capital over the previous years. Therefore, recognition in the P&L will have no impact on CET1 nor on TNAV. Finally, looking forward to the rest of the year, our good first quarter puts us on track and we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance. A mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items, a banking NII of at least $41 billion, ECLs of around 40 basis points cost growth limited to around 5% on a target basis and a 50% dividend payout ratio. And with that, Louis, can we please go to Q&A.",

I guess, just in terms of my question, the PD migration in Hong Kong, if you go back to the way you were computing it previously actually looks like it improved quarter-on-quarter and certainly under the new definition, has stabilized. I think it's Slide 17, if I'm not mistaken, in the presentation. Is that a little bit better than where your expectations were a few months ago? I know when I was in Hong Kong recently, it sounded like things were starting to stabilize, but is that better than where you were thinking a few months ago? And then secondly, on the buybacks, is the $3 billion number due more to the calendar effect? Or are you looking to kind of boost the run rate there from the $2 billion in the quarter?",

    "text": "Thank you, Joseph. So, first, on the time deposit reclassification, we have actually reclassified some private bank term deposits to time deposits. This is due to the observation of their behavior and the recognition that they better classify this time deposits. This rebases the number. But as you could see from the 2 choices we have, it does not affect the trend. So, therefore, the trend that we've seen under both classifications is the same, and we've seen the first quarter stable quarter-on-quarter. It's too early to call it a peak, but we've always expected migration this year to be slower than what we've seen last year. And this just confirms the trend change from what we've seen in full year 2023. As regards to your buyback question, so the short answer is, yes, this is indeed due to calendar effects. We just completed a €2 billion buyback in 2 months. That's about $1 billion a month. That is the fastest run rate we've done in terms of share buybacks ever. We are now announcing a €3 billion buyback, which we intend to to do over the next 3 months, starting after AGM. We will see how the run rate goes, it will remain at the $1 billion run rate. We will see how it will go. As regards any future amount of buyback or whether we're doing a buyback, one, it remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share buyback. And, second, we will decide on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on our capital outlook, the loan growth outlook and other parameters as and when every quarter.",

Just doing, George, on this point on distribution and looking at the sort of moving parts for capital, one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the growth in RWAs. The €7 billion of increase driven by asset quality trends. I think you're calling out is predominantly in Asia. What should we think about the sort of outlook for RWA growth from here even if loan build is muted, just to get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in content terms for distributions? And I guess the second question to Noel, just maybe a question for your broader thoughts, no. The 5 years proceeding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC, but I guess, for a lot of people given in your markets given the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you exited Canada, you announced Argentina. You're in the process of exiting quite a few smaller markets. Return on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens.

    "text": "Thank you, Raul. I'll start with your first question first. So, on RWA outlook. So the RWA growth, we called on a quarter-on-quarter basis, $24 billion. First, about 40% of it related to lending and other asset growth. And as you can see from our lending book, we've grown our lending book by €5 billion. There's a number of areas of growth that contributed to around 40% of it, $9 billion. Then we've had a $5 billion market tristRWA growth. This is due to a pickup in NSS activity against a subdued 4Q, and it's more in line with their activity levels in the first 3 quarters of the year, if you want. And this is the normalization of the market's activity. And then there is $7 billion, which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, first, it is a continuous exercise. We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis. We have recognized across a number of geographies and a number of sectors, certain names, which we've decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe. You will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ECL. And that's mainly because for many of these customers, their balance sheet remains strong. So, we're comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore, there is no ECL implication from this downgrade. But just closing the loop, this RWA downgrade, you will see some of it materialize in our Stage 3 loans, where we increased our Stage 3 loans by about $2 billion, and that's exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality. With regards to how we look forward, we are very comfortable where we are today. Our credit metrics remain solid. As I say, the balance sheet of our customers remains strong for a number of them for at least the exposure that is collateralized. We're very comfortable with the level of collateralization and the LTV. And therefore, we do not foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking. We will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always do. Noel?",

    "text": "Thank you. It has certainly been an extraordinary 5 years, I should say, not just for HSBC, but for the world. And I'm really pleased and grateful I want to pay tribute to the team for the way they've collectively navigated that. And during that whole process, the external environment executed on a complex but absolutely critical transformation plan over the past 5 years. And the outcome of that hard work is evident in the financial performance last year and the financial performance in Q1. I also want to say thanks to Mark, with such volatility in an external environment. Any CEO needs the support of their chair, their advice, their guidance, and I've had that all the way through and have had the support from the Board all the way through in navigating what has been a very complex external environment. But the team, the Board, Mark, collectively, we've done a good job of navigating it. Now, if I look forward, I'm not going to give to do list to my successor because that is not the fair thing to do to anyone. But I will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very much focused on. And I'm focused on for as long as I'm still CEO, and that is continuing the momentum. You don't work as hard as we worked for the past 5 years and then take the eye off the ball at this moment in time. So, I'm very focused on a smooth, orderly transition. I'm very focused on continued execution of the strategy. I want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy. We have exited a lot of businesses, a lot of RWAs over the past 5 years. The one thing we've protected whilst doing that is the international core of HSBC. The countries we remain in, the businesses we remain in are fundamentally now focused on the international nature and essence of HSBC, and we will continue to do that. Our key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are sustainable and repeatable whilst also taking advantage of the growth opportunities as they emerge in a world that becomes more stable and there are inherent in our customer franchise. Therefore, we're very focused on continuing the development of wealth, our transaction banking capabilities, our global wholesale banking capabilities and then being ready for when corporate loan demand picks up, we can take advantage of that to couple good returns with sustainable growth. And I think you've seen evidence of that in these results. Hong Kong is subdued at the moment, but we understand why with the rate differential in China. But if you look at the rest of the world, as George said, there's balance sheet growth in Wholesale Banking, in the rest of Asia, in the Middle East, in U.K., in Europe. We're seeing good growth elsewhere. So, it's about focus, momentum, continuing to couple good returns with good growth.",

    "text": "Thank you, Jeremy. So, on your first question about deposits in Hong Kong. So, if you remember at Q4, our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. What we've seen in Q1 this year is a decrease of about $16 billion. Therefore, you can see seasonality playing across the 2 quarters, and therefore, is broadly stable across the 2 quarters. What happened though is, some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some deposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. And when you look at Q1, while you see the deposit outflows, you also can see that $19 billion of our net new invested assets were in Asia. Therefore, a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated into wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4 and explains if you want the seasonality of this deposit. Second, look, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and viable franchise. We continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail and wholesale customers. We cherish this. We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. And throughout the last 6 quarters, you've seen how our deposit base has been very stable with our deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers. Therefore, I won't comment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers. If I move on to your second question about the structural hedge. So, first, you would have noticed that we increased this quarter, the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 million, with the average weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of 3 years. Second, we commit at this stage to continue our structural hedging activity. Obviously, this will remain subject to market conditions, but we will continue the trend that we put in Q1 based on current market outlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind toward banking NII. And this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted as you know, and you can do the math. But equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates. And this reinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into banking NII. Between the 2 of those effects, the structural hedge activity for the full year 2024 would remain a net tailwind to our banking NII. We have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind. We're looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space. But that tailwind has been factored into our guidance of at least $41 billion bank NII and obviously, factored into our return on tangible equity mid-teens guidance.",

George, I just wondered whether you talk a little bit within the context of higher for longer, you've referenced subdued loan demand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates. And I just wonder whether one of your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue. So, I wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether that's a material part of the plan? And sort of what do you think that means for revenue sort of evolution in the next few quarters? I think I certainly was somewhat surprised that we didn't see an upgrade to banking NII guidance this quarter. I know you don't rebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that Higher for longer has on asset mix and then on credit demand. And then secondly, wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there's a part of the business that's quite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now 20% in in a short space of time. But I just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. Is that the strategy delivering the sort of net new money flows? Or is there an element of sort of market volume there that we should be a little bit careful about?",

    "text": "Thank you, Jason. So, first on Banking NII, we recognize there are kind of a couple of encouraging developments. The first one is the higher for longer on the rate side that would look like more favorable than when we discussed last in February. And, the second one we just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix, specifically in Hong Kong, where we've seen term deposits remain stable for this quarter. So, we recognize these tailwinds to our banking NII, but we also recognize quite early in the year, and these factors can still change. So this is why we didn't change our guidance. And as you said, Jason, I don't think you should expect us to update our guidance every quarter. We would reconsider this every quarter. But for this quarter, we're just sticking with our at least $41 billion. In terms of the wealth performance, so recognize mid-teens percentage growth in wealth, 34% for our private bank. I would say a couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that we've already said it's a focused strategic area. We are investing in this area. Big part of our investments goes towards this area, and we're very pleased to see the results of our investments generate revenue fairly quickly. You can see that through net new invested assets growth. You can see that through our CSM, new business CSM growth in insurance as well as in the actual revenue performance. This being said, I would just caution you not to annualize the numbers you're seeing because Q1 2023 had somewhat subdued January in it when China and Hong Kong were still closed. So, therefore, you've seen more pickup in activity in the Q1 '23 at the back end of it, whereas we had a full proper Q1 '24. So, there is an element of not annualizing the performance, but expecting that performance to continue growing. I just realized I didn't touch on your asset mix question of the first question. Look, we do not foresee a material change in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year, the main growth take place in mortgages and recognizing mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in the U.K. and Hong Kong, and the margins have been quite tight. As we start seeing pickup in wholesale demand, as we start peeing pickup in unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that those will drive higher margins than if you want what we see in mortgages. And our numbers in Q1 did show that this pickup definitely is there in areas of Asia, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, the U.K., et cetera. And the next in line for that pickup will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some stage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease.",

But I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, which is how are you thinking about the trajectory going from here because it sounds to me that deposit migration is probably, well, stabilized a lot. And I would have thought any longer pricing that hasn't already come through will come through in the next few months. And I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, you can probably build more hedges at better rates as well, et cetera. And there's obviously a tailwind as you mentioned in this year already. So, how does that inform your thinking on your medium-term RoTE? So I guess that's the first question. And the second question, again, on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit. So, again, I guess just noting your point that Hong Kong might be a mix in line to pick up. But I guess, overall, the emerging market is probably not benefiting in terms of activity level and in terms of capital inflows from the higher U.S. rates.

And as I said, there has been a number of manifestation of tailwinds now compared to when we last spoke in February. But equally, it is early in the year. And as you've seen, these things do change. And, therefore, want to beccon in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing parameters. We will update some longer than what we're updating but not at this quarter, barely. So, do expect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future. I would say the one parameter, just to keep in mind, as you start planning for '25 is take Argentina out because, obviously, subject to the sale completing, which we expect to complete in the next 12 months, that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from our banking NII. That's the most kind of predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025. In terms of the broader activity level, first, if you look at the wealth performance, it just demonstrates how wealth remains very resilient. And that's particularly true in Hong Kong, but very much so across Asia. Second, when you look at our transaction banking activities, apart from foreign exchange, which has an idiosyncrasy related to Q1 '23 with a very high volatility has performed across the various areas of its fee earning activities. And then our activity is very much benefiting from cross-border trends. If you look at some of the investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra region in Asia between China and ASEAN between India and ASEAN, between India and the west, et cetera, all of those trends are growing. I mean the numbers are staggering in some cases. And these are the activities that our business is operating on. So, therefore, while recognizing that there will be some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels, there is still a very strong underlying network activity, which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in wholesale transaction banking, anyway.",

So, our outbound activity from Mainland China to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase in activity over the past 12 months. We've seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this year. So, a lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down. But what I would say is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up at quite a pace a very significant pace. We're very well placed to capture that outflow, and we are capturing that outflow. And our business in Mainland China performed well last year. It's performing well again in the first quarter of this year and its outbound activity is performing extremely well. So, we'll give more updates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that.

With Hong Kong relaxing LTV ratios, I think basically, not only they would be they relax the the purchase requirements and the stability requirements on residential properties.

So, will that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth, particularly related to Hong Kong? Second one. And then the last one, I think, is on cost.

    "text": "Thank you, Katherine. I'll take question 1 and 3, and I'll hand over to Noel to address your second question about the outlook for Hong Kong. So, first on non-NII. Wealth has performed well. Transaction banking weakness is specifically due to foreign exchange. That's driving the whole weakness. And the reason, as I called it out earlier, the reason is that foreign exchange had a record strong quarter 1 '23 on the back of heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis. So, therefore, we're doing a comparison to a record quarter, and it will show that drop. But if you look at the number itself, and the revenue itself for foreign exchange, it is back to normalized levels. So, there is nothing to worry about here. It's on the contrary back to normalized levels, and we continue to expect some cyclicality in that space, while we continue expecting growth in the other areas of transaction banking. So, I wouldn't read more than that into it, and we remain very confident that the investment we're putting both in wealth and transaction banking and in the technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain strategic focus and bearing results as we look into future quarters and years. On your third question about cost. So, first, I just want to reiterate, it is a clear priority for us to maintain cost discipline, okay? And we are very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5%. We will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis. We're confident about it. And we're actually on track to do so. And the reason why we're kind of on track to do so yet, we showed a 7% quarter 1 growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic items related to the quarter, which are not repeated in future quarters or some of them will reverse in future quarters. I'll just call the 3 of them out that matter. First, there was a 2% accrual of the performance-related pay where we decided to phase that accrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher performance-related pay accrual in Q1, hence, the 2% contribution towards the 7%, but it will contribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a full year basis, we are not accruing to a significantly different number than the full year '23 performance-related pay. Second, there was 1% contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter because last year's first quarter, we only acquired SBB in the middle of March, which means we practically didn't have it in the first quarter last year, and that's a base effect. And then third, we had the one-offs or the expected nonrecurrence of the FDIC special assessment additional charge this quarter as well as the bank of in levy. Bank of Finland levy is a new charge, which used to be an interest expense as an NII and now it's moved to operations expense as in cost. And between the 2 of them, they contributed to 1%. So, if you adjust for those and you bake them in, we're still and remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year or circa 5% on a full year basis. On your second question, I'll hand over to Noel.",

It was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month. That will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions of many of those developers. We have to wait and see how that stabilizes because undoubtedly, there was an element of catch up in that first month because people were anticipating some change. Therefore, there was low activity in the preceding months. And then we got to see how that stabilizes. But I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance liquidity within the market.

    "text": "Thank you, Andrew. So the UK NIM was up 6 basis points, indeed, essentially benefited from some idiosyncrasies of structural hedges and timing of structural hedge maturities and reinvestments. So, if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of plus or minus 10 basis points. I would say U.K. NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple of quarters. And we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. And you will, therefore, add to that broadly flat, some structural hedge due increases, which will drive you within this plus or minus 10 basis point range. As regards our loans and deposits have been stable. Again, the U.K. economy has been resilient, we're very optimistic about the outlook for the U.K., specifically around inflation and employment. It remains a very important customer franchise for us. It remains a very important market for us, and we continue gaining market share. I mean, we continue gaining market share in mortgages with a 10% new business market share when our back book now market share has moved or our kind of overall portfolio market shares moved from 7% to 8%. We are a 25% market share in SME lending. And obviously, we continue investing in this business. You can look at the ring-fenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment growth for their infants bank within our overall circa 5% cost growth. So, all this demonstrates the confidence we have in our business in the U.K., our client activity in the U.K. and the outlook for the U.K. If I move to Argentina, I wish I could give you a trend for Argentina, then the way it works is the numbers balloon with hyperinflation, and then they kind of they shrink with devaluation, and it depends how they manifest themselves over month-over-month. Q4 last year has seen hyperinflation to some level, but they have seen a massive devaluation. If you recall, in December, we've seen more than 50% currency devaluation. That's contributed to a disinflation of the amount that Banking Argentina brought to Q4. And then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We've seen 6% devaluation only, but we've seen 54% inflation, and that will just inflate the numbers. So, it will be volatile quarter-on-quarter. And our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it averaged out over the last year, which is around €1 billion. Now just looking at the overall Argentina, if you take in the nonbanking NII, you take in the cost base, et cetera, last year's Argentina contribution to our PBT was $0.2 billion. Just to put it in perspective, this is about $0.01 earnings per share or 0.5% dividend per share. Therefore, I think as you look at the full year '24, that's the quantum that Argentina volatility will create. So, it should not distract you from the way you're forecasting the bank's outcomes.",

    "text": "Good morning to everyone in London, and good afternoon to those joining from Hong Kong. Today is my last results announcement before Georges takes over in September. I'm delighted to be handing the stewardship of the bank over to him. Georges is an exceptional leader who understand what makes HSBC special. I'd like to thank my colleagues around the world for everything they've done over the last five years. And I wish Georges every success for the future. I have always been immensely proud of the heritage of this bank and the strategic role it plays in the world. But when I took this job on five years ago, we didn't have the financial performance to match our standing. My aim was to change that. I believe we've done so and created a strong platform for future growth. This was evidenced by the record profit performance last year and by the strong first half performance this year, revenue of $37.3 billion was up 1%. Profit before tax of $21.6 billion was stable on the same period last year. This performance enabled continued strong capital generation. Our return on tangible equity was 17%, excluding notable items. We've announced $4.8 billion of further capital distributions today. This takes the total capital we have distributed by way of dividends and buybacks in respect of the last 18 months to $34.4 billion. Finally, we've updated our guidance to reflect our increased confidence about the future. We're providing new guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025. In addition to the 2024 guidance we already had. We're upgrading our 2024 banking NII guidance from at least $41 billion to around $43 billion. We're revising our 2024 ECL guidance to be back within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. And we're reconfirming our 2024 cost guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. That's despite growth of 7% in the first half, which as Georges will explain, is mainly due to timing differences compared to last year. The benefits of our strategy execution over the last five years are evidence in our performance. Before getting into detail on the further progress made over the last six months, please allow me to share some reflections on our five year journey. When we set out, there were two key strategies to delivering higher returns. The first thing we had to do was to reshape our portfolio. Building on the work of my predecessors who initiated important structural changes, we've continued to exit businesses and client portfolios that were non-strategic, subscale and unprofitable. First, via organic portfolio reductions, which delivered RWA savings of around $128 billion. And then via inorganic means through disposals. The second and very important strategy, which we commenced at the same time was to build alternative sources of revenue growth. Within this, we've invested to grow fee income, particularly in areas where we have significant strengths such as wholesale transaction banking and wealth. We've also continued to invest in our differentiated international propositions. And we've significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates from approximately $7 billion of banking NII for a 100 basis points down shock in interest rates at 30th of June 2022 to around $3.4 billion at the end of 2023 and now down to around $2.7 billion today. All of this had to be underpinned by a culture of cost discipline, which we have instilled across the group. These savings enabled us to invest in the areas I've spoken about. And this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance. As you know, we delivered a record profit in 2023 and a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2023 and in the first half of 2024. It has been over 15 years since the group was generating returns at current levels. And we now expect to sustain it this year and in 2025. The other tangible measure of success is capital distributions to our shareholders. I'm really pleased that we delivered around $54 billion by way of dividends and buybacks to our shareholders over the last five years, including the distributions announced today. And I'm especially pleased to have paid the special dividend of $0.21 per share earlier this year following the sale of HSBC Canada. I see this payment not just as a financial return, but as a return for the loyalty that our shareholders have shown us over the recent years. Let me now summarize the further progress evidenced in the first half. First, wealth has been a key component of revenue diversification strategy. It delivered two very good quarters, growing revenue by 12% in total. In Transaction Banking, fee and other income in Global Payment Solutions grew by 4% and in Global Trade Solutions by 1% in a very difficult environment for trade. Revenue for HSBC Innovation Banking was up 4% quarter-on-quarter as our new global proposition continues to gain traction. Second, our scale markets in Hong Kong and the U.K. enabled us to grow profits each year as we captured new opportunities in both the corporate and retail businesses. As you can see, we also have positive growth in other markets, including India, which was up 4% in the first half and Singapore, which was up 2%. Third, we continue to grow multi-jurisdictional client revenue in both wholesale and retail. Fourth, we saw good growth in both customer lending and deposits in the second quarter despite what is still a relatively sluggish environment. Finally, we've continued to grow the size and duration of the structural hedge to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate movements. Georges has new disclosures on the expected benefits in his section. All of this progress underlines why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity this year and in 2025 as well. Let me get into some more detail. The steps we've taken to change our retail business model and our continued investment in people and digitization have made wealth a key driver of revenue growth. Wealth revenue was up 12% in the first half to $4.3 billion. And that growth is broad-based. As you can see in the boxes on the right side of the slide, wealth fee and other income was up 14%. Private Banking revenue was up 16%. We attracted $32 billion of net new invested assets. Our new business insurance CSM was up 77%. Moving to the next topic. Transaction Banking revenue was stable in the first half. There was good growth in payments, which was up 3%. This included growth in fee and other income of 4%. This is a result of the investment we made to grow and digitize that business, which helped to improve our ranking from a top four bank in 2022 to number two today. Foreign exchange was down 8% compared to a strong performance last year when there was very high volatility. And while trade was slightly down in the half, the pace of decline slowed to the point that it was broadly flat in the second quarter. But we still grew our trade volumes despite global trade volumes remaining subdued. And we also increased our market share in trade in Hong Kong to more than 26%. On the next topic, our businesses in Hong Kong and the U.K. both continue to perform well in the first half. Profit before tax in Hong Kong was up 1% on a constant currency basis, while the Hong Kong corporate loan market remains subdued, it was resilience in the second quarter. It's too early to call it a trend, but deposits and investment activity increased, which underlines that the right differential works in both directions. We attracted 345,000 new to bank customers in the half as we continue to capitalize on significant inflows into Hong Kong from customers seeking opportunities for investment. Profit before tax in the U.K. business grew by 11%, excluding the gain on SVB U.K. last year. Customer lending was also up 2%, but our U.K. business is differentiated by its connectivity with the rest of the group. In the first half, we grew the number of U.K. international customers by 8% to 2.7 million customers. We have a strong international franchise. We evidenced this through our multi-jurisdictional revenue disclosures in February. And in the first half, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 4% to $9.7 billion. And as I said earlier, this isn't just a wholesale story. We're doing more with our international retail and wealth customers as well. We now have 7 million international wealth and personal banking customers with revenue from these customers up 6% to $5.4 billion. So these are the levers that have put us on track to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity this year and why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025. With that, I'll hand over to Georges. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Noel, and hello, everyone. Before I get to the Q2 numbers, I'd like to comment briefly on the recent announcement. I'm deeply honored by the trust placed in me to lead this great institution into the future. Many of you may have questions about the future strategy and direction of the group. Although I don't take over as Group Chief Executive until the 2nd of September from Noel, I'm ready to share a few high level thoughts. Under Noel's leadership, we have delivered financial performance and built a strong platform for growth. The strategy of the group is working, and I'm committed to building on this. The shape of the group is broadly where we wanted to be with the bulk of our capital and other resources deployed in our four scale activities that's Hong Kong, the U.K. Our international wholesale bank underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities and our wealth proposition, particularly in Asia. This puts us in a very strong position. In each of these activities, we have scale and sustainable competitive advantages, and our strength are aligned to the needs of our customers. They account for the vast majority of the economic profit we generate today and present some of our most exciting opportunities to grow over the next five to 10 years. And together, they are capable of delivering above cost of capital returns sustainably through the cycle. We've made good progress and we are now in a position to accelerate the pace of execution of the strategy with focus and intensity to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, to improve operating leverage, while maintaining strong cost discipline and prudent risk management and to continue to improve client service and experience. You'll also have seen that we have announced this morning that Jon Bingham has been appointed Interim Group CFO from the 2nd of September. Jon is currently our Financial Controller, and has outstanding technical accounting and regulatory knowledge and expertise. A process to identify the next permanent group CFO is underway, and I will update you further in due course. Now though, turning to Q2. In summary, profit before tax of $8.9 billion was up $0.4 billion on the second quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis. In terms of the drivers, the banking NII run rate was stable on the first quarter. There was another strong wealth performance, while wholesale transaction banking was stable in last year's second quarter. Despite cost growth of 7% in the first half on a target basis, we remain on track to meet our 2024 guidance of around 5% cost growth, and there was growth in both loans and deposits in the quarter. On the next slide, so HSBC Canada contributed around $0.5 billion of revenue and around $0.2 billion of profit before tax in the quarter before the sale completed in March. To make like-for-like comparisons easier, these contributions and some other impacts have been excluded from some of the commentary. So excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions, profit before tax was up 7% to $9.1 billion. Revenue of $16.5 billion was up $0.3 billion on the second quarter of last year. Excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions, revenue was up $0.8 billion or 5% on the second quarter of last year. Banking NII of $10.9 billion was down $0.4 billion on the first quarter on a reported FX basis, primarily because of a $0.3 billion reduction from the Canada sale. Excluding this, the banking NII run rate was stable. We're now in a position to upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance to around $43 billion. This assumes a $1 billion contribution from Argentina, which was its reported NII in 2023, although we note that it remains volatile and difficult to predict. We're also providing new details to help you understand the expected benefits from the structural hedge. Around $55 billion of assets are due to mature in the second half of 2024 with an average yield of 2.8%, and around $105 billion of assets will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8% as well. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was stable on the second quarter of last year or up 2% excluding the impact of strategic transactions. Within this, Global Payment Solutions had another good quarter, up 2% as the security services, which was up 3%. Foreign exchange delivered broadly stable revenue compared to a strong quarter last year. And wealth had another very good quarter, underlying that our investment is continuing to drive improved results. Wealth fee and other income was up by 13% compared to last year's second quarter. Private Banking was a standout performer mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia. But growth in wealth remained broad-based. Customer growth and improved wealth penetration primarily in Asia, helped drive growth in investment distribution. Invested assets were up 2% to $1.3 trillion, including $6 billion of net new invested assets in the quarter. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.6 billion, up $0.2 billion on the second quarter of last year. On credit, expected credit losses were $0.3 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 15 basis points of average loans. This included $0.4 billion of recoveries and other items mentioned on the slide. Excluding these, ECLs were broadly in line with our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. Stage 3 balances were 2.4% of customer loans, up $1.4 billion compared to the first quarter. This was driven by Hong Kong commercial real estate book, but there was a limited impact on ECL charge because of the high level of collateralization. We are revising our 2024 ECL guidance to our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points of average loans. Next, costs grew by 7% in the first half on a target basis, but we remain on track to meet our guidance of 2024 cost growth of around 5%. 2 percentage points of cost growth in the first half came from higher performance-related pay accrual and levies. As we explained at the first quarter, we have phased the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than last year. We do not expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be materially different to 2023. So the accrual in the second half is expected to be lower year-on-year. In addition, the second half of last year included $0.3 billion of levies that we do not expect to repeat this year. We are, therefore, reconfirming our guidance of around 5% cost growth for 2024 on a target basis and we remain committed to cost discipline. On lending and deposits, there was positive loan growth in the quarter in both the U.K. and Asia, whilst Hong Kong was broadly stable. Overall, we are promising signs in the first half. Deposits were up 2% with the majority of this in Hong Kong. There was also growth in the U.K., Europe and U.S. and the rest of Asia, but it also included the benefits of seasonality in commercial banking and a large one-off in Global Banking and Markets. So I would encourage you not to annualize the 2% figure. Next, our CET1 ratio was 15%, down 20 basis points on the first quarter as strong organic capital generation was offset by distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We have announced a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we expect to complete within three months and to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points on our CET1 ratio in the third quarter. Finally, to recap, our strong first half performance and our confidence about the bank's position enable us to provide new guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items for 2025, in addition to our existing mid-teens guidance for 2024. Upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance from at least $41 billion to around $43 billion, revise our 2024 ECL guidance to within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points and we confirm our guidance for '24 cost growth of around 5% on a target basis and mid-single digit loan growth over the medium term. With that, Louis, can we please go to Q&A. Thank you.",

And then linked to that as well, George, I think you're on the tape this morning talking about accelerating the existing execution.

I think you talked about $55 billion maturing in second half at a 2.8% yield. Is it fair to assume the new positions that you're putting on are probably about 1% higher than that, given where the forward curve is?

There's always investment you can do to grow more revenue, to improve customer experience, improve systems and processes. So there's never a notion of finishing. There's always -- should always be a notion of continuous improvement and continuous ambition.

    "text": "Thanks, Noel. Yes, Andrew, it was just echoing Noel and building on that. We've called out some of the key areas of our strategy. I've called out Hong Kong, the U.K., the international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by a leading transaction banking capabilities as well as wealth, all of which have demonstrated very strong momentum, certainly over the last few years, but definitely over the first half of this year, we're confident about the momentum. We're confident in our ability to continue investing in them. And we're confident also we have ample capital to support additional growth. So it's just about getting pace -- continued pace in the execution of this strategy that has proved its results. On your question about the structural hedge, Andrew. So $55 billion are expected to mature over the course of the second half at an average yield of 2.8%. If I try to reverse engineer your math and if you assume the reinvestment happens at around 3.8%, with a 1% uplift, then you get $500 billion. But remember, this is maturities that are happening over the course of the half. Therefore, I think you have to average the number and therefore you have to assume half the number as in-year 2024 benefit from that structure and hedging investment. So say, the half of your $0.5 billion you quoted. Also bear in mind that we are increasing the structural hedge, subject to market conditions. We've done about $25 billion in the first half. It's a good estimate of the run rate for the second half. And that is a mild headwind, because we're increasing the hedge from higher short-term rates into lower longer-term rates due to the inversion of the curve. So you have to take all of this into consideration when factoring in the impact for 2024 banking NII.",

    "text": "Very good. Thank you, Amit. So consensus -- if you adjust consensus for 2025 for the impact of the loss from the sale of Argentina, which -- by the way, as we communicated now, we expect by the end of the year. Therefore, it's more reasonable to assume that that loss the recycling of the foreign exchange loss of $5 billion, which has no impact on capital or on distribution it's fair to assume that impact will happen in '24. But if you adjust the consensus in '25, you get to around 14% indeed. Our definition of mid-teens is broadly around 14% to 16%. So without commenting on the consensus, our mid-teens definition is broadly that 14%, 16% range. On the growing revenue on a sustainable basis, let me point you to three major indicators, which are going to be important in the way we look at the future. The first one related to banking NII. Banking NII, number one, has been stabilized partly with the reduction of banking NII sensitivity. If you recall, two years ago, we called down $7 billion to be the impact on banking NII on our revenue for a 100 basis point drop in interest rates. That number at the year-end was $3.4 billion. And that number, as we reported it now is $2.7 billion. So therefore, we have through activities of structural hedging, but also through other methodology improvements and balance sheet composition, we have reduced the dependency of our earnings and of our banking NII to the impact of low rates. The second component, again, relating to banking NII is that while for a few quarters, we've seen subdued loan growth in particular in the U.K. and Hong Kong wholesale market. We have now seen stabilization. It's early to call it a trend, but we are encouraged by the stabilization we've observed. And importantly, we will be more encouraged to when we see rates coming off in the support they can have for loan growth, in particular in these two areas that historically have been a little bit more sluggish. Other parts of our activity remained resilient loan growth and in South and Southeast Asia remained very strong loan growth in the mortgage businesses and the U.K. and Hong Kong remain very strong. So there is a volume component to banking NII, which we supported. And as you can see from our capital, we have ample capacity to support loan growth. And the third component I would call out is the non-banking NII part of our earnings. Fees and other income in particular wholesale transaction banking and wealth. You've seen the momentum in these businesses. You've seen the continued investment we've put in these businesses. We believe these momentums are sustainable. There's an underlying sustain sustainable trend supporting wealth in particular, in Asia. And there is an additional support through our own investments, both technology and people relationship management related to support growth in this area, and we believe the momentum is sustainable. So those are the big -- broadly three components that we believe will sustain our earnings as we look into the future.",

    "text": "And Amit, just to come a little bit more elaboration on the sluggish subdued. Listen, I'm not surprised that the corporate loan market is a bit subdued at the moment. But I think it's right for that to be the case because in the higher interest rate environment, there's not many corporates out there want to borrow at today's interest rates. And actually, they've still got a lot of cash sitting on their balance sheet. They don't need to borrow, which is a good position to be in. But as you see interest rates come down, I would expect there to be a pickup in activity. And I suppose, what Georges just said is, we're starting to see the very early signs of that starting to emerge. It's very early. It's too early to call it a trend. But I was pleased in Hong Kong, the rate of decline in the lending book -- corporate lending book in Hong Kong in Q1 reduced dramatically. So we've been declining through 2023. And it actually plateaued in the Q2 and there was us in Hong Kong. And then in the rest of Asia, we saw a growth in Q1 and Q2. And in the rest of the world, we saw growth in Q1 and Q2. So Q1 was the first time we saw net growth in corporate lending. Q2, we saw net growth as well. So I think it's encouraging early signs as interest rates come off, I see that happening. And the other thing is, we've also got to remember, there's another site of the Hong Kong market. The deposit market and the investment market is very strong, as you saw in our wealth businesses. Now the net new invested assets going in to the business. I think in the first half of this year was about $34 billion, if I remember correctly. And I think as rates come off, cash moves into invested assets. And I think we're seeing -- we're a beneficiary of that, particularly in Hong Kong, where rate differentials are playing strongly into the investment market, whereas they're subduing, the rate differentials are subduing the demand for loans in the Hong Kong market, but the rate differential is working in the opposite direction on investments.

I mean I guess if you think about things like cash moving into invested assets, which should be higher ROE. Your wealth and personal banking ROEs around 31% at the moment. You're doing about a 22% U.K. ROE. I guess, what would hold you back from maintaining that level in '25 and '26, notwithstanding some rate cuts?

The first one is just trying to understand how the notional size of the hedge is changing in the U.K. versus the rest of the world? My understanding was that the structural hedging in the U.K. is quite a mature book. So I wouldn't have expected that to increase in size going forward. And I would think that most of the low-yielding refinancings are coming from the U.K. But as when we think about the rest of the world, it looks like your structural hedging was more recent. So there's probably scope to increase that, but maybe the refinancing yield is a bit higher. Is that kind of right understanding, is the first question? The second question is just coming to the Hong Kong CRE book and some of the disclosures we've pulled out there. I think $36 billion of total exposure, 40% of that is unsecured. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more additional color around the unsecured part of Hong Kong CRE. I think you say it's very good quality, but how you look to manage the risks given the unsecured nature of this CRE book? Thank you.",

    "text": "Sure, Noel. So Raul, on the hedge size, we haven't given the specific currency split to a balance sheet split. But yes, you should assume the Sterling component is one of the largest component in terms of the hedge size. And the U.K., therefore, the Sterling component is one of the most mature by way of size of hedge, but there is obviously still or previous hedges maturing, previous hedges stuck at lower yields maturing, and we're able to benefit from the reinvestment of maturing hedges at higher yield. That was still a component in the U.K. bank's NIM which has been broadly stable, and we expect to remain broadly stable and the structural hedge reinvestment is playing a role in that. With regards to the rest of the world, it's a story of two tales, indeed, there is a reinvestment of all structural hedges at higher yields, and that is a tailwind in our banking NII. There is also additional hedges we're doing where we can, and these additional hedges are suffering from a partial -- a partial set off or a partial offset as a headwind because they're suffering from the fact that are inverted, but it's still the right thing to do for the management of our banking NII sensitivity. And then, obviously, always keep in mind that the Hong Kong dollar exposure we have remains largely under hedged, and that's due to the fact that the structure of the market does not give us enough instruments to be able to invest in the long-term to support hedging. So the Hong Kong dollar would remain structurally underhedged in that sense. With regards to the Hong Kong CRE question. So 40% of the book is -- of the $36 billion you mentioned is unsecured, it is typically exposure to large conglomerates with a diversified revenue stream, including revenue streams from activities not related to real estate, 90% of that book today is rated strong and good and literally 0% is in the impaired category. We're very comfortable over the exposure we've had in that book and we continue obviously supporting our customers through the cycle in this phase.",

    "text": "Very good. Thanks, Noel. Jeremy, so without giving specific comments on the quarter-by-quarter specifics in the development of our fees and other income component, the growth that you've observed during the year in Q2 were mainly driven from two areas. The first one is wealth, which is obviously a very strategic area where we continue to invest and exhibited growth. The other one was from markets, in particular, from some of the equity business in markets. This is coming on the basis of two components: one, a subdued Q2 last year. So there was a base effect which benefited the outlook for Q2 this year. And then the second one is the fact that we've seen more activity and more vigorousness than if you want the Asian stock markets, in particular, the Hong Kong stock market. And we're encouraged by this. And if the trend continues, this will bode well for additional activity in this space. Let me jump to the third question, and I'll hand over to Noel to conclude on the second one. Capital distribution hierarchy. First, we've committed to 50% dividend payout ratio for this year, which means half our earnings will be earmarked for foreseeable dividend. Part of it will be distributed through our interim dividends. The rest will be netted out at the end of the year. After that, we obviously will use capital to support the organic growth of our business. Loan growth, as we said earlier, started to pick up in certain areas. We are encouraged but we have ample capital to support the loan growth, the appetite we have. We look at bolt-on acquisitions or areas that are dead on strategy, both supportive of acceleration of the strategy that will be part of utilization of excess capital and any excess beyond that we will distribute back to shareholders to a rolling series of share buybacks. If you look at our CET1 ratio today at 15% and you look at our capital accretion that we remain capital generative in the business based on the guidance we've given for this year and next year. We're confident we will have capacity to deliver on the three, and I will say the buybacks will continue looking at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis with the ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks.",

    "text": "Thanks, Jeremy. And on your second question, is it an Asia strategy? Is there an international strategy? I think they're interchange. Well, I don't think they're mutually exclusive because if you look at what we do at the core of what we've done for 158 years or more is we've connected entrepreneurs and businesses who want to trade with the world. That's what we've done from day one of HSBC being founded. So we're essentially about helping businesses and individuals trade internationally, invest internationally. Now why are they one and the same? Well, a huge amount of the entrepreneurs that we have as clients are based in Asia, they're based in the Middle East, they're based in the East and they trade with the West and the West trades with the East. And Asia and the Middle East, the high-growth markets. So I don't think it's an either or. I think for us, it's very simple that is we're internationally driven. And Asia is a hugely connected international part of the world and will remain so going forward. The nature of trade will change as it has done for 158 years. So I think we use the words Asia and international is and probably interchangeably, and sometimes it gets people confused. We're investing where there is growth and where we have differentiation. There is growth, there is international connectivity. There is differentiation in Asia. There is in the Middle East.

I just wanted to wish you the very best going forward or whatever it is you decide to do. And yes, Georges, on a similar thing, just to extend my congratulations around your appointment as CEO. I had two questions, please, both on net interest income. So a point of clarification. I guess your banking NII guide this year of circa $43 billion, that face value does imply a material step off in net interest income in H2. I just wanted to check, I mean you're guiding for Argentina being $1 billion this year, and I think it was the best part of $900 million in H1. So is it literally just Argentina dropping out of net interest income in H2 is driving that? And what would really, really help is the kind of momentum of NII in H2 and the extent to which that carries over into '25. I'm not necessarily looking for an updated guide here. But if I just take again your banking NII disclosure at face value, it's implying a kind of $42 billion annualized run rate in H2 ex-Argentina. What do you think the puts and takes are on that if we were to kind of look a bit further afield beyond this year? And then the second question was, if I could just get you to update your thoughts around deposit pass-throughs, you're obviously noting you've hedged more of your balance sheet now. And what is actually pass-throughs where to be, say, 10% lower than what you're modeling in your updated banking NII sensitivity, that would be really helpful. Thank you very much.",

    "text": "Yes, thanks Noel. Aman, thank you. So on your first question, look, 40 -- around $43 billion of banking NII for this year is a reasonable expectation. And we're more confident about it because we're already seven month into the year. And somewhat the forward rate outlook has become a bit less volatile than we've experienced over the last few months. Argentina, we have worked with a planning assumption of $1 billion. So within around $43 billion, we've factored in around $1 billion contribution from Argentina. It is a very difficult to predict number. It is a very volatile number, and therefore, the best of estimate you can use around $42 billion and add whatever other expectations you may have for Argentina, but we're sticking with this $1 billion estimate on the uncertainty, just for reference, $1 billion was the banking NII contribution of Argentina in 2023, and this is how we're building the assumption for our -- for planning for this year. Now if you look forward for H2, headwinds and tailwinds facing the banking NII. The first one to call out is the rate outlook. We're using the mid-July curves, which comprise broadly between one and two rate cuts across all the major currencies in the second half. This is the working assumption. The second one is on the structural hedge since we called out earlier, you should expect to benefit from the $55 billion maturing assets in 2H at 2.8% yields, which would be reinvested at higher yields than the prevailing yields in H2, which will be higher, take a five-year rate as a good benchmark for what rates will be reinvested at. But this is partly offset by the additional structural hedging we are likely to do on an inverted curve. Again, here, your best guide is what we've done in H1, $25 billion of additional structural hedging is a reasonable run rate to expect for H2, but will depend on market conditions in H2. The other components that are playing is headwinds and tailwinds are the balance sheet growth, where we continue to see strong growth in South and Southeast Asia. We continue to see resilience in the mortgage books in the U.K. and Hong Kong. But we are now encouraged to see stability in the Hong Kong wholesale book, which has been on a decline for a few quarters. It's early to call it a trend, but it is now -- it is definitely green shoots when we look forward, and it will be supported with rate reductions as in the balance sheet growth in this space. And then the last one to call out is deposit migration. That's particularly true in Hong Kong. Again, Q1, Q2, we've seen migration at 0% and 1%, respectively, which is a 1% overall on the half. Just to put it in perspective, this is after full-year '23, where we've seen 12%. So again, the trend here is much more encouraging. We're very unlikely to see anywhere near the trend of last year, but it remains a difficult one to predict. Now as you look forward into the full-year 2025, we're not guiding on banking NII, but a few points for you to bear in mind. The first one is, please remove Argentina's contribution. Again, working assumption, $1 billion, this is following the planned sale of Argentina to take place before the end of the year. Second, remove the one quarter contribution from Canada, $0.3 billion in your NII, then we've shared that there will be $105 billion of existing structural hedge assets which will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8%. So those will provide some tailwind as we reinvest them at higher yield. So beyond that, you can apply your own interest rate assumptions on the banking NII sensitivity we provided, $2.7 billion is the sensitivity we provided across all currencies for a 100 basis point drop. And you can apply your balance sheet growth assumption. And again, we believe lower rates will be more supportive of growth in balance sheet when you look into 2025. But basically, all of that is factored into our guidance for return on tangible equity for 2025 at mid-teens.",

And this is based on an assumption of around $600 billion of IPCAs. So we can work out the math, if you want offline. That number is broadly stable. We're still working on an assumption of a 50% pass-through in our banking NII sensitivity. Second, if you look at the cumulative pass-throughs, we're broadly around 50% from the start of the rate hikes in late 2022, all the way to now broadly around 50%. The earlier part was much lower than 50%. The latter part was much higher than 50%. It is difficult to predict how pass-throughs will work out on the rate cut scenario, and this is why I think 50% remains a good estimate of what it could look like, noting that we don't have recent history of that. I would point you to one thing to be mindful of is in the U.K. and a number of other geographies, we will have to provide customer notice of at least 60 days before we pass through rate cuts. So there will be a delay in pass-throughs on the way down, and that's a 60 to 90 day on average, for instance, in the U.K. Thank you, Aman.",

Yes, and just echo Aman's comments and thank you, particularly do you know because it's been a pretty turbulent period for HSBC, I think there are a number of times when if somebody said you'd be making mid-teens returns, I think I would have thought that was delusional. So thank you very much for that. It benefits us all. My two questions were -- the first one was, could you tell me -- you probably disclosed it somewhere and I missed it, but performance-related pay, I see it is going to be flat this year. Is it possible to tell us what the total quantum of that is because I guess there must be some potential that, that may have to go up, particularly given the revenue performance. So that would be my first question. And then the second one is, to me, if I look at these results, I guess the standout to me was the performance in Q2 of the Wealth and Private Banking business. If I look in the past, it's generally been quite seasonal in Q2, but it seems that actually it's held up pretty flat. So should we expect that -- is that like a sort of new base level of run rate? Is that something we should continue into the second half now and then sort of grow on from there. Was there something about Q2, which held it up better than we might have expected. Thank you.",

    "text": "Well, well, firstly, thank you for your comments. And on your second point on Wealth, listen, I'll give a very personal comment. You normally expect Q1 to be the seasonal high and then a bit lower in Q2 and a bit lower. So actually, Q2 did exceed expectations in terms of seasonality. It was a strong quarter. At the moment, I can't -- we tend to be a bit on the conservative side and say don't base a trend on a quarter or two. But I think your assessment there actually, Q2 was a strong performance is exactly where we are, it was stronger than probably one would have expected through normal seasonality. I think it is, if I talk to the team, they were confident of a good performance. They're seeing good lead indicators. I mean we've taken in, in excess of $250 billion of net new invested assets just over the last two and a bit years, two and half years. And I think we've all got to probably -- we haven't seen this period where how will cash move from cash to invested assets as interest rates come off. And therefore, I think it is difficult to predict a trend. I think we just got to see it go quarter-by-quarter, but the lead indicators are good. We've invested in the business over the last few years to put us in this position. It was all about getting ready for lower interest rates and being in a position to take advantage of it. We invested heavily in the product lineup for our clients to make sure that if they were going to move into invested assets, they could do so with us rather than another bank. And we invested in distribution. We had good distribution in Hong Kong, but we didn't have as good a distribution in other markets. So we built out distribution in Mainland China, in Singapore, in India and in the rest of the world. So I think it's put us in a good position to take advantage of it, but it's too early to call it a trend. But your observation is a fair observation for Q2. It was good. And it's nice to be able to report that. On performance-related pay and costs, I mean I'll let Georges cover that, but we're absolutely committed to the 5%, so.",

    "text": "So we paid $3.8 billion through full-year 2023 on performance-related pay. This is disclosed in our annual reports and accounts. But if you look at how we accrued for that number through the year in 2023, we actually under accrued in the first quarter 2023. And then we topped it up at the fourth quarter to get to that total number. When you look at full-year 2024, we are accruing towards a broadly similar number for the full-year than for the full-year '23. And any decision on the performance rate pay will take place in January with the Remuneration Committee after the full-year's performance has been delivered. But we are accruing broadly to the same number. The difference is that we're accruing more evenly. So this is why you'll see a higher accrual on a year-on-year basis in the first half, and you will be seeing a lower accrual in the second half on that trajectory. It is -- all of this is factored in our cost guidance of limiting cost growth to around 5%. We're absolutely committed to our 5% or circa 5% cost growth guidance.

Can you explain to us what is the impact on capital because we understand that there is a limited impact on ECL charges but mainly reflected on capital. So what is the drag on capital? And then also like going forward, whether it's your view on Hong Kong CRE, in particular, for the loans which are already Stage 2E categories.

    "text": "Sure. Sure, Noel, thanks. Katherine, so on the capital, so we've indicated the $6.4 billion increase in RWAs due to modeling adjustment. To be specific, we've adjusted the probability of default models for banks globally. And the reason we adjusted this probability for default model for banks is because we wanted to factor in some of the observations and learnings from the March 2023 crisis in the way governments have supported the bank resolution, that's specifically true for the U.S. and Switzerland. We've taken those learnings. We've baked them in our modeling, and this resulted in this additional RWA, insofar that bank model is probability of default, et cetera are concerned, we consider this to be done. And if you ask me, well, we continuously look at our models in a general fashion, Look, the next big model update is going to be Basel 3.1 as and when Basel 3.1 becomes live in the various geographies or jurisdictions where we operate. We have not indicated the impact, which we do not expect to be material, but we're waiting to see some of the final rules that are still missing in a number of jurisdictions before we can call out the exact impact to the market, but we don't expect it to be material. In terms of Hong Kong CRE, we've spoken earlier about the 40% that is unsecured with which we remain very comfortable. And so your question probably relates to the other 60%, which is the secured portfolio of our $36 billion exposure. So of this about $3.2 billion are credit impaired. What's happening basically is a number of -- a few of our customers basically are facing some short-term cash flow pressure challenges, and this is partly due to high rates. But the balance sheet remains strong and our level of collateralization remains strong. Typically, for this impaired $3.2 billion portfolio, the level of collateralization on average is 55% loan to value. So that -- this is why there is a material of any ECL impact from the designation to Stage 3. In terms of the capital impact, some of -- depending on which models we're using and what form of lending it is, some of the impact may manifest in RWAs and we've seen a little bit of that in last quarter. Some of it will manifest in EEL, excess expected loss, which will go straight into our CET1, we publish these numbers, but by and large, these are immaterial numbers. And again, it's all supported by the fact that we have a very strong level of collateralization against the exposure. As we look forward, first, these customers, the specifically credit impaired customers are current, remain current. We expect some of the pressure they're facing to ease as rates reduce and as economic activity in Hong Kong picks up. In terms of medium- to long-term outlook for the sector, we are actually positive. We are confident first in the Hong Kong economy in general to rebound. But in particular, for the sector, we expect that the sector's pressure will ease in the medium to long-term, and we remain confident and positive about the sector.",

    "text": "Thank you for the helpful disclosures on the hedge, et cetera. I have a question regarding -- two questions, which are pretty much linked regarding falling rates and how does the management see it. First of all, the wealth income. It's an odd cycle with wealth income and AUM growth rates being elevated as interest rates are high. So when they do fall, do we have any precedent as to whether they will be an impact on the wealth income from falling rates or we don't get that much benefit from income. We see right now that a lot of Mainland Chinese money is also coming out and parking in Hong Kong. So that's the first part of the question. The second is lending growth, we have targets for mid-single-digit. But when we think about modeling banking NII, we have to look at average interest earning assets. So I'm wondering, we have lots of liquidity on the balance sheet. If rates do fall, and then some of these depositors don't feel incentivized. Do we get overall deposit growth not so strong, which internal leads to average interest-earning assets not growing and hence, we should not be modeling in average interest earning assets growth at mid-single digits, so help us shrink out that. Thank you so much.",

    "text": "Very good. Thanks, Noel. Gurpreet, so first, one thing on the way we report it essentially is fees and other income. So the slide I have there for wealth, that's particularly the fees part, which is fees earned on assets under management or on -- for insurance, in particular, related to new business CSM. So the impact, if you want, on rates is more about transition of customers from deposits into AUMs. So this has been happening. We are seeing some of our deposits move into net new invested assets and transferring if you want to AUMs and our wealth proposition. It is likely on a trend basis that when rates come down and deposit -- the earnings you can make on deposits reduce that customer may shift some of it into AUMs through, we'll be visible now the net new invested assets proposition, and then we will be able to service them in the fee space. So yes, there is a component where we do expect more wealth activity to take place as we see deposits being less remunerative, but this is more on a broad trend basis, not a direct linkage. We are also benefiting from the structural growth of wealth, in particular, in Asia, where we believe the underlying market is growing at very high-single-digit, if not double-digit percent over the next five years. And on top of that underlying growth, which we're benefiting from, we are taking market share because of our additional investment in this space. So this is definitely a platform that can benefit from a number of trends that will support the momentum. On your second point, it's a very good point because we talk about balance sheet growth and loan growth, but we have also strong dependence for our banking NII to deposit growth, which constitute the underlying for our average interest earning assets. So we've seen this quarter deposit growing 2%. I caution you not to annualize the 2% because some of it is seasonal, some of it is one-off. But we have a fantastic deposit franchise. I mean you know us everywhere we operate, we have a very strong balance sheet that's very appealing, and we have a very strong proposition in deposits and transaction banking for both wholesale and retail, which means that we will continuously look to capture deposits. We continue winning global payment solutions mandates in the wholesale space. We continue being attractive for retail customers, and we just shared, Noel shared 345,000 new customers joining our Hong Kong business alone. This is in the U.K. in 2023, we added 1 million new customers. So therefore, we do continue seeing a good momentum, underlying momentum to grow our deposits with this very attractive deposit franchise of ours.",

    "text": "I think I'd reinforce that and add another comment. The trick for us in the past, we were very good as a retail bank. We were very good as a corporate bank. But when customers, whether they were retail customers or corporate customers wanting to invest in alternative asset classes other than cash, they tended to go to other banks because our product range and our distribution wasn't strong enough. We deliberately set out to invest in our products and distribution capability for wealth. So that, that cash, if it did move, it moved within the bank, not outside the bank. One of the byproduct benefits is if you've got a good wealth proposition, you also attract the cash. You keep the cash in the bank as well. They go hand-in-hand. And so I think look, I think we're in a very different position today in offering wealth propositions to clients. And what we've done is deliberately try to diversify the revenue stream. So it's less dependent on purely corporate banking and retail banking. And there is a continuum from retail and corporate banking into banking the individuals and the entrepreneurs in their personal capacity and doing their wealth management in their personal capacity. And that's, I think, the exciting trend for the future. And I think that's why we believe that we're well positioned to deliver mid-teens ROTE next year because we have that diversity and that continuum of offering. So I just want to say that's not a by chance strategy. That was a very deliberate strategy to keep both the cash in the bank and the invested assets in the bank.",

Just trying to scope the degree of ambition that you might have around restructuring. It looks like efforts to restructure the business are focused on delivering net cost saves. You're clearly doing very well on revenues at the moment, particularly fee businesses are presumably a source of near-term upside to market expectations. But I think the outlook is volatile. A lot of these things are outside of your area of control. So what is the scale of the ambition around what you'd be looking to achieve on things like costs and indeed, RWAs as you try and kind of future-proof the medium term return on tangible equity outlook? And then I had a second question on net interest income. So I think the -- I'm taking the kind of banking NII guide at face value and trying to mix out Argentina, I think it's implying a kind of annualized run rate of around $41.5 billion at the fourth quarter as a jumping off point into '25? Maybe a bit of a low-value question, but interested if you were able to at this stage, just to comment on banking net interest income as per consensus in '25.

So Aman, the primary reason for the reorganization is to create a simpler more dynamic, more agile, leaner bank. It's really to allow us to empower our frontline staff and make it faster to make decisions and ultimately serve our customers better. That's the primary reason. Now, as a result of simpler, leaner, more efficient bank, there will be cost saves. The cost takeout will be essentially in the form of severance or related costs. It will be affecting senior roles that will be deduplicated or the reduction of the number of senior roles will drive this. We will be giving you those details about the – figures about the upfront costs as well as the benefits realization in the full year -- in the full year results in February. What I can say is, number one, the benefits will exceed the upfront costs and the payback is going to happen in the short time frame thereafter. And then the second point to share with you is that we remain fully committed to cost discipline. I've been sharing this in my days, as group CFO. I carry on this mission of being fully committed to cost discipline, and this is now embedded in the firm, as you have seen from our Q3 results. For 2024, we remain on track to deliver on our cost target. We are committed to it, and we're confident we will be able to achieve it. Jon?",

    "text": "So on banking, thanks for the question, Aman, if I might be giving you a slightly longer answer to this. So if we start on 2024, we've reintegrated our guidance on 2024 of banking NII of around 43 billion. But I encourage you to think about that as 42 billion ex Argentina. In total, we've printed 31.6 billion for the nine months to date. And we think the Q3 run rate of 10.6 billion is a pretty clean run rate for you to think about modeling 2025. We don't provide guidance at this stage on 2025 banking NII guidance. But if you take that clean run rate of the 10.6 billion, which I agree it's about 42 billion, we'll have disposed of Argentina. So therefore, we then think of the building blocks for you to model this along four factors. Firstly, rates, the reduction in rates implied in markets will be clearly a headwind. The cuts during the third quarter, given the timing of the – they had a relatively modest impact on the third quarter's results, but we'd encourage you to use our banking NII sensitivity against market implied rates to generate that component. We then have the structural hedge that will provide a tailwind. We've got the reinvestment of maturing positions that will enable us to reinvestment at higher rates. We've signaled that for 2025, we've got 115 billion maturing at an average yield of about 2.9%. So think about those maturing and being replaced at something along the lines of five-year bond rates. We've then got volume growth, whilst volume growth has been relatively subdued in 2024, we do hope that with interest rates coming off and economic activity picking up, that we will see more loan growth. We continue to guide to mid-single digits in the medium to long-term. The timing of getting there will be unpredictable. And then lastly, we keep an eye on time deposit migration. That has been relatively stable, particularly in Hong Kong, at 39% over the last couple of quarters. But the impact on that as rates come off, will be variable. It depends on competitive pressures and customer behavior. So all of those factors is how we have thought about it to modeled it and included that within our mid-teens royalty guidance for 2025.

I was just wondering if you could kind of explain the slight disconnect with the net new invested asset number in Asia, which certainly was positive but probably not quite as positive as I might have expected given how good the revenue line was? And then second, could you just share your thoughts about the outlook for corporate loan growth across Asia. So in fact, loan growth were generally across Asia. So I think in the second quarter, we saw both Hong Kong and ex Hong Kong, all slightly. But I think three months ago, [indiscernible] more positively at least on Honk Kong also we had the announcements in China about a month ago, so just where do we go from here on the Asia loan volumes.",

First, our Wealth business, as you've seen in this quarter, has exhibited double-digit returns. This is the third quarter in a row with similar type returns. Wealth business, as you know, is generated from four segments one of which has performed quite well, which is the trading activities of our customers. And that manifests both in the private bank as well as in our invested assets. They have been very even stronger following the measures we've seen in China. On the outlook for corporate loan growth in Asia, we are -- as I shared earlier, we are -- we are very encouraged by the policy measures that have been taking place that have taken place, both in Mainland China as well as in Hong Kong. We see these measures combined with the outlook on rates coming down as supportive of future growth, specifically in our Hong Kong book. Outside Hong Kong, the rest of Asia remains a resilient Southeast Asia and South Asia remained quite strong in terms of loan growth, although, of course, a different size in our books than Hong Kong.

    "text": "Thank you, Amit. Let me address your first question, and Jon can address the ECL charges question. So the primary reason of this reorganization is to simplify the bank, as we share. But we've been on a multiyear journey to simplify the activities we do in the bank. We've been exiting activities that were non-strategic. We've been reshaping our portfolio, we exited markets or activities currently, we're on track to complete the sale of our Argentina business and our Armenia business and announced two additional exits in September, including South Africa as well as the Private Bank in Germany. Now that equity was addressing the what in terms of what we do as a strategy. The reorganization we have announced last week is basically addressing the how we execute our strategy is not changing the what is changing the hole. And the reason we could effectively execute how we change our strategy as in be simpler, more agile is because of the work we have done over the past few years in simplifying what we do. So, it is the right time now to address how we execute our strategy, because we've simplified what we're doing. We've clarified what our core strategic areas for us, where we have competitive strength and where we have leadership and opportunities to grow. So the timing, therefore, is a natural kind of conclusion of the various activities that we have been taking through the transformation over the last five years. I want to say that outside the UK and Hong Kong, where we're merging all our commercial banking activities with Global Banking and Market activities to form the corporate and institutional bank. It will comprise our core products, including our balance sheet-related products, credit and lending and deposits, our transaction banking products, as well as our other products such as Investment Banking or Markets. And this should give our customers a more seamless way to deal with HSBC across all this product spectrum that we offer them. Jon?",

That's actually a more normal charge, because Q2 benefited from releases and recoveries. If you then dissect the third quarter charge, there's three things within there. So firstly, the UK, which is $0.2 billion charge, again, that benefited from the releases in the second quarter. It's a more normal charge. There's nothing more going on in there. Hong Kong, in total, we incurred a $0.5 billion charge. As you said, that was mainly $0.4 billion charge in wholesale, which included $0.1 billion of Mainland China CRE and $0.1 billion of Hong Kong CRE. The rest of it was across the number of sectors, again, nothing of particular note. And then relative to third quarter, last year, we did have an increase in our Mexico retail charge. So that went up to $0.2 billion charge. That's actually been relatively normal through the quarters of 2024 but relative to third quarter 2023 is a little higher. So, we're confident, as we see this that we will be in our 30 basis points to 40 basis points planning range over the medium-term and certainly that for 2024.",

There is the underlying trend, which is a continued growth in our wealth business, which has been there quarter-after-quarter. It's a result of both our increased investment in the space, it's a result of us winning market share given our brand and franchise. It's also a result of the underlying market growing. As you've seen, Hong Kong is now expected to become the largest private wealth hub in the world by the end of the decade. So that is definitely trend and we’re privileged with our position in Hong Kong to be able to benefit from it and benefit our customers from it. That is the first component, which is an underlying continued investment and growth trend. You add to that, obviously, the additional activity we've seen following the measures that have been taken in China. This has created additional activity, which has been, as you said, for the week or so in the third quarter. We do see this activity continuing and obviously normalizing. But we do see these measures that have been taken to be supportive measures certainly of the economy at large, but in particular, supportive measures of the financial markets and the revival of some of the financial market sluggishness that we've seen in both in Mainland China and Hong Kong over the last few quarters.

So a few customers continue to face cash flow pressures, some of that is rates resultant, and as rates come off, we would hope that begins to abate some of those cash flow pressures. If you look at the Asia wholesale Stage 3, they were up $1.1 billion in the quarter. Some of that relates to Hong Kong CRE. That also drove a modest amount of additional RWAs. The ECLs on that, we've referred to the fact that there was $100 million charge on ECL. That was both across Stage 1 and Stage 2. The Sage 3 ratio is slightly up quarter-on-quarter. But we continue to see good collateral across that portfolio, and so we don't see this as a material ECL driver going forward.

You should expect this to be ingrained in the way we think is spending wisely and in the right places. In terms of strategy, we've basically -- in the reorganization we announced last week, we are basically organizing ourselves alongside our strategic pillars. So this creates clarity and this also creates simplicity in the way we can execute our strategy. We have two home markets where we have scale, a leading market position and great growth opportunities and certainly very strong competitive edge. In our Corporate and Institutional Banking business, we have a global connectivity capability and a transaction banking capability that is second to none, that is a very leading and providing excellent services to our customers. Our positioning is very cherished and very valued by our customers. And then we have Wealth and Premier Banking, which is really the proposition aimed at the affluent segment for investment needs in particular, across our network and in particular, so in Asia and the Middle East. Any opportunity we have to accelerate this strategy will be it organic or inorganic is an opportunity we will go after. We are looking -- these areas all exhibit fantastic growth opportunities. We have a real competitive edge, and we will continuously invest in them both organically and inorganically if the opportunities arise. What I should say there is -- we do have the capital to support our needs.

I think the confusing thing here is that I think on the headline NII actually slightly missed expectation. But if we work out the banking NII, there's a moderate peaks and also we try to calculate whether it's the banking net interest margin, it seems it's by and large stable despite in 3Q, have actually went down kind of on average 50 basis. So, may I ask like what is driving that stable net interest margin? Would it be from the liabilities management side? Just now John gave us some color in terms of, like, say, deposit migration. But is it possible to give me some -- give us some like numbers to work around, like what is the ratio in Hong Kong and how the trend has changed? So, this will be my first question. My second question is that when I look at RWA migration, I saw on the -- on numerate -- I saw that in the migration side, and there is $2 billion addition to CET1 capital due to movement in research. Can we get a bit of -- I would say, color on that one? Will we be seeing some kind of movement -- like similar type of movement in the coming quarters? Actually, I have one slight additional question is on the loss that we were talking about the legacy securities. Can you give us a bit of color on this one? And I understand that management put this into notable items, so supposedly to be one-off, but is it really one-off in nature? Will we have other securities, perpetual bonds that we would like to redeem in the future? Like, say, for example, do we have another 10% type of perpetual on currency in our books that we may be looking to redeem it when opportunities arise? Thank you.",

We have said that we will look at our legacy securities continuously, but we will take action that are accretive or neutral. We will not take action on legacy securities that are detrimental to our investors and our shareholders. In this case, we've taken an action on legacy security that has more than 10% coupon, that could be naturally and easily replaced with much lower rates.

But effectively, the net interest margin has moved from 162 to 146. There's three things driving that. One, the loss on the early redemption of legacy securities, as you've mentioned; two, some Argentina volatility; and then, the remaining is on we've allocated more funding to the trading book. And as you know, that will be a drag on net interest income, but also an equal and opposite benefit on non-net interest income. So, our preferred measure and the way that we think about it is through the banking NII lens, there you'll see that our clean run rate ex-Argentina and ex-notables has been relatively stable period-on-period, reflecting the fact that the Q3 rate cuts had given their timing had a modest impact on Q3. If I -- you'd also asked about deposit migration, we've again got some detail in that on slide 17, but that has remained relatively stable at 39% for the Hong Kong deposits. If I move on to your CET1 question, and then particularly the change in other adjustments for CET1 capital. That is around the fair value movements of our securities that are classified as fair value through OCI. So we've generated a gain on those, which has given us also a capital benefit on that. I think on legacy security, George has covered most of the questions on that, but we're not signaling anything at this stage around further legacy securities redemptions. Thank you, Katherine.",

Just to be clear, the $1.1 billion increase in Stage 3 loans in Hong Kong. Is that all CRE, that's just to be clear on that? That was the first question. The second one is we've obviously got a US election coming up in the next couple of weeks. And I just wondered if you could give us some thoughts from your perspective in terms of the possible sort of risks and opportunities that you see that could come out of that, I guess, with the two realistic options. And I guess just related to that, there was a lot of press comment that your organization was driven by splitting up Asian, and I guess the UK or developed markets businesses. Is that actually right? Or is that just sort of idle speculation from journalist? Great. Thanks so much.",

    "text": "Okay. Thank you, Ed. Let me take your second and third questions, and Jon can address the Stage 3 question. So look, we -- this is a matter for the US Electorate to choose their President. I'm not going to speculate or comment we will see the outcomes on the 5th of November. But what is important for us is that we serve our customers. We have been serving our customers through various -- through an evolving set of rules and regulations on the -- on the global scale. We serve them for their needs, especially the cross-broader needs where we're unique at being able to do so. We obviously comply with all rules and regulations, we will make sure that our customers are able to comply with all rules and regulations and so far that their financial needs are concerned. And any new rules and regulations, which may come with any new administration are things that we will obviously comply with and support our customers to comply with. What I can say, though, is it remains a distinctive skill that we have in supporting our customers' cross-border needs. This is one of our unique areas of competitive edge. And this remains unchanged, and our customer needs remain broad-based and global, and we will continue supporting them on that mission. And with regard to the reorganization, this is categorically not either an intent or a preparation as has been speculated by some splitting of the Asia business or, et cetera, absolutely not. This is a simplification of the bank where we today govern ourselves through five regions, and we're bringing this regional setup down two, that is part of the simplification. It is also meant to help us speed up the build-out of what is a very promising corridor between the Middle East and Asia. We're seeing material growth in this corridor over the last few years. Our customers across both Middle East and Asia are looking for the opportunities of trade and investment in them. And we've been -- we have a leading -- we have a unique position to be able to help our customers across this corridor. That simplification should also help speed up to build up that corridor. And I remind you in our western geographies now, we’re essentially a wholesale bank. We have sold our retail banking activities in France. We sold the mass retail activities in the US. We've sold the bank in Canada. We sold the bank in Greece. We are in the process of selling the bank in Argentina. And with that, we'll be left with what is essentially a corporate institutional banking business that also bring some simplification aspects to the way we govern ourselves in this region. These are the reasons why we did the simplification of reorganization we announced last week. Jon?",

The picture is very similar to how we described it at the second quarter. We could see more migrations into Stage 3 until interest rates begin to ease the cash flow pressures in those businesses. But given the collateral levels that we have against that portfolio, we don't see that as a major driver of ECL risk going forward.

    "text": "Welcome, all, to today’s call. I’m joined by Pam, our new Group CFO. We’re delighted to be here in Hong Kong, the city where HSBC was founded 160 years ago. Our history and heritage stand us in good stead in so many ways. Adapting to new economic realities and technologies is what we have always done. It brings out the best in our people and culture, especially when acting as a trusted advisor to our customers as they navigate the world’s economic uncertainties and look towards new opportunities. Before Pam takes you through the fourth quarter numbers, I will cover four items. First, I will go through our full-year 2024 results. Second, I will set out the changes implemented over the past few months to create a simple, more agile, focused bank addressing the ways we operate in a fundamental way. Third, I will describe in some detail the solid foundations we are building on. And finally, I will share with you what we plan to do next in order to deliver sustainable strategic growth and meet our return targets. Starting with the full-year numbers, 2024 performance was strong. We delivered record profit before tax of $32.3 billion, or $34.1 billion excluding notable items. We generated a 14.6% return on tangible equity, or 16% excluding notable items, in line with our mid-teens target. We announced a total of $26.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders in respect of 2024, including $0.87 per share of dividends and $11 billion of share buybacks. When I took the role in September, my priority was to inject energy and intent in the way we deliver our strategy, while maintaining continued focused cost discipline. At our third-quarter results, I committed to provide you with more detail on the expected benefits from our organizational simplification. We have simplified HSBC in two important ways. We have elevated and empowered our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK and our Wealth proposition, and we have combined our two wholesale businesses. In doing so, we have eliminated large parts of our complex matrix governance structure. This significantly improved operating model is now led by a tighter Group Operating Committee. It has clarity of accountability, fewer management lines and layers, reducing the need for the number of committees we previously ran across the bank. This has increased our agility. As an illustration, previously, every dollar of revenue we generated had at least two accountable executives at the Group Executive Committee. Today, around 60% of our revenue has a single accountable executive at the Group Operating Committee. This will empower our people to make faster decisions, collaborate better and innovate for the benefit of our customers. In short, we’ve simplified our structure and we’ve aligned it to our strategy. This will enable us to deliver around $1.5 billion of annualized savings by the end of full-year 2025, primarily through deduplication of roles. This represents circa 8% reduction of our global staffing costs. This will cost around $1.8 billion in severance and other up-front costs. Those $1.5 billion savings will have no meaningful impact on revenue and they will be taken straight to the bottom line. Separately, we will redeploy circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities as incremental investments to our priority growth areas, where we have clear competitive advantages and generate accretive returns. We have started to do this by announcing that we will begin to wind down our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, Europe and the U.S. I will cover our priority growth areas shortly. These actions give us the confidence to target a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Each of our four businesses are firmly rooted in our core strengths. In our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK, we have two strong businesses. In both businesses, we serve Personal Banking customers as well as Commercial Banking and Small and Medium Enterprises. We are a leading bank and are growing market share in key products. Importantly, in both, we are profitable and delivering very good returns. As for the large corporations with global banking needs in both home markets, alongside individuals with multi-country personal financial needs, they will be served by our two international businesses, as I am about to set out. Corporate and Institutional Banking, CIB, is a global wholesale bank with significant competitive advantages. It has a powerful deposit franchise with strong financing capabilities, and it also has a market-leading transaction bank, leveraging our global network. As the world’s number one trade bank for the last seven consecutive years, we are exceptionally well placed to help our customers and capture global and intra-regional trade flows as supply chains reconfigure, new trade routes emerge, economies grow, and our customer expectations evolve. CIB is also well positioned to help entrepreneurs secure the capital they need to build the businesses of the future and help our customers decarbonize. International Wealth and Premier Banking, IWPB, is ideally placed to capture the increasing number of affluent and high-net-worth customers, especially those with international banking needs who seek new investment opportunities to help them protect and grow their wealth. Our recognized brand, financial strength and complementary footprints across Asia and the Middle East reinforce our position in the world’s fastest growing wealth markets. Let me now highlight our distinctive strengths, starting with our high-quality revenue streams. Our franchise generates resilient recurring revenue from three key sources. As you can see, in 2024, two-thirds of revenue was from Banking NII. This is the result of the strong deposit and lending positions in each of our four core businesses. As you know, we have built up the structural hedge to protect this revenue stream from falling interest rates. Pam will speak more about this. The remaining third was from fee and other income. Around a half of this was from our market-leading Wholesale Transaction Banking business, which is built on our global network, covering 85% of global trade and capital flows, including high-growth markets such as India, ASEAN, of course mainland China, the Middle East and Mexico. Around a third was from Wealth, which I will talk about shortly. Taken together, this means that more than 90% of our revenue comes from three high-quality streams. Moving to our strong deposit franchise, our customers trust the strength of our balance sheet and have chosen us to look after their deposits. This gives us a highly liquid and profitable balance sheet, which provides greater flexibility through the cycle. Within our $1.7 trillion deposit base, we have large deposit surpluses in each of our four businesses, giving us the funding capacity to support our clients. Turning now to our high-quality loan portfolio, we have always maintained a conservative approach to risk management, as evidenced by the quality of our loan portfolio. In the period since 2018, we have experienced a global pandemic, an energy crisis and the real-estate cycle in the U.S., in Hong Kong and in mainland China. Our average annual ECL charge over that period was 32 basis points of average gross loans, which is well within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. On our disciplined capital management, over the last two years, our capital generation has enabled us to return $47.7 billion to our shareholders. This comprises of $27.7 billion of dividends and $20 billion of share buybacks, including those announced today. Through the rolling series of share buybacks we have undertaken since the start of 2023, we have now repurchased 11% of our year-end 2022 issued share count. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. The external environment presents us with opportunities but also challenges. The interest rate outlook is benign but it remains volatile. We can adapt to changing patterns of trade and economic growth, but there is a risk of disruption, and we have a major opportunity in wealth in Asia and the Middle East, but it is a highly competitive space. Despite these challenges, we have levers we can pull on to support us to deliver on our target. We’re confident we can take decisive action to do so. These levers are, first, driving operating leverage as an ongoing process through cost efficiency and optimization, as well as continuous improvements in productivity, second, dynamic balance sheet management and capital allocation, which I’ll cover shortly, and third, investing for strategic long-term growth. Let me turn to this next. We're creating the capacity to invest for growth in the business and to drive efficiencies. We’re focusing our growing investment pot, as shown on this and the next slide. First, in our home markets, we intend to expand the number of wealth centers and enhance our wealth capabilities in Hong Kong, which is set to become the world’s leading cross-border wealth center. We attracted around 800,000 new-to-bank personal banking customers in Hong Kong last year, and we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities as international customers choose Hong Kong as their cross-border wealth hub. In the UK, we plan to also grow the Wealth business, and we plan to improve our SME coverage and proposition. This is an extremely attractive and profitable segment, where we will intensify our focus. Second, in CIB, we intend to leverage our network and further enhance our transaction banking capabilities, including in high-growth markets such as Mainland China, ASEAN, India, Middle East and Mexico. We are also looking to scale up our broad loan origination capabilities by underwriting more and distributing more to our institutional and wealth clients. This ability to leverage our loan origination for the purpose of distribution will give us larger opportunities to generate fee income, improve capital efficiencies and, in turn, improve CIB returns. Third, in IWPB, we intend to accelerate the wealth build-up in our home markets, and particularly also in key growth markets such as Singapore, the UAE, India and Mainland China. In each of these, we aim to accelerate the hiring of relationship managers, establish new wealth centers, and expand our product offering. While we are benefiting from an underlying growth in this segment, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, we also aim to grow our market share by, first, better driving wealth penetration with our own wholesale or Premier customers, second, better capturing cross-border flows of our own customers in their outbound location, and third, increasing the proportion of mandates within our invested assets. Finally, underpinning all of this and across the Group, we aim to seize the opportunity of AI and generative AI. Our flagship initiatives will focus on improving customer service through both our mobile apps and our contact centers. We also intend to increase tech productivity with tools such as coding assistants, and improve process efficiency in areas such as onboarding, KYC, credit applications and many others. Mid-teens returns will give us a range of attractive options for capital deployment and will drive EPS and DPS growth over time. As the illustration on the right-hand side of the slide demonstrates, a mid-teens return on tangible equity will enable us to deliver the 50% dividend payout ratio in 2025, and still have sufficient capital to grow the balance sheet, buy back shares, or both. Supporting our customers will always be our first priority, and we expect our loan book to grow in the mid-single digits over the medium- to long-term. However, fluctuations in customer demand for credit mean our loan book may grow at an uneven pace. Share buybacks remain our preferred method of returning excess capital to our shareholders, because they drive growth in EPS and DPS. For instance, in 2024, while our earnings grew by circa 2%, our earnings per share grew by circa 9%, reflecting the benefit from the circa 6% reduction of share count through share buybacks in this year. So in summary, we’ve simplified the Group and, along with our continued focus on costs, are committed to delivering circa $1.5 billion savings to the bottom line. We’re focused on delivering for our customers by capturing growth opportunities where we have a clear competitive advantage and accretive returns. And we’re eliminating, over the medium term, an additional circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities, and redeploying them into these priority growth areas. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027. With that, let me hand over to Pam.",

    "text": "Thanks, Georges. Thank you, everyone, for joining. I would like to begin by sharing my approach as Group CFO. In short, I’m fully focused on discipline, performance and delivery. Discipline means prioritizing with precision, maintaining strong cost control, and ensuring investment rigor for growth. Performance means gearing our financial strategy towards achieving our mid-teens returns target. Delivery means ensuring we remain agile and resilient, enhance operating leverage, and are always well positioned to support our customers. Let me now turn to the Q4 numbers. Starting with the highlights, profit before tax was $2.3 billion, or $7.3 billion excluding notable items. This strong performance enabled us to announce a further $8.4 billion of distributions in respect of the fourth quarter. This consists of a fourth interim dividend of 36 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we intend to complete before our first-quarter results in April. On this slide, you can see the impact of notable items on year-on-year revenue and profit growth. This was principally the $5.2 billion related to historical foreign exchange translation losses from the Argentina disposal. Excluding these, profit before tax was up 10% on the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue of $16.5 billion was up $1.2 billion on the fourth quarter of last year, driven by Banking NII and a strong performance in Wealth. On Banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina and other notable items, the Banking NII run rate remained broadly stable. Deposit growth and benefits from the structural hedge were partially offset by lower interest rates. Looking ahead, we expect Banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. To be clear, this is a change to the way we have given you guidance before. ‘Around $42 billion’ is not an underpin. It is our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections. We also want to give you some additional detail on the structural hedge. As you know, we have been building up the structural hedge to help manage our interest rate sensitivity. During 2024, we increased the notional balance by around $50 billion. We also extended the duration from 2.8 years to 3.1 years. This contributed to a further reduction in the interest rate sensitivity of our Banking NII last year. We have reduced our sensitivity to a 100-basis-point rate shock from around $7 billion in June 2022 to around $2.9 billion at the end of 2024. We’re also providing additional disclosures on the expected reinvestment profile of the structural hedge. We expect to reinvest around $95 billion of assets in each of 2025 and 2026, from a current average yield of around 2.8%. We also expect to reinvest around $90 billion of assets in 2027, from a current average yield of around 3.4%. Moving to fee and other income, Wholesale Transaction Banking was stable on last year’s fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of strategic transactions, primarily the sale of Canada, it was up by 3%, as we continue to leverage our global network and capitalize on our position as the world’s number one trade bank. The standout performance was again in Wealth, which was up 27% on the same quarter last year. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth. I’m pleased we added 234,000 new-to-bank Personal Banking customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. This brings the total number added in 2024 to 799,000, as Hong Kong continues to grow in importance as a cross-border wealth hub. I’m also pleased with the strong momentum in the business in January, which is in line with previous years. All of this gives us confidence that we can continue to grow this business further. Our medium-term target is to continue to grow fee and other income by double-digit CAGR. There are three trends that underpin this ambition. First, the multi-year growth in new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong underlines that the city is on track to becoming the number one cross-border wealth hub before the end of this decade. Our past experience suggests that new customers grow their total balances and wealth products over time, so this is expected to provide a tailwind. Second, the strength of our business in key international wealth hubs, particularly Hong Kong, has enabled us to grow invested assets in Asia at 17% CAGR. This was also the key driver of our 13% CAGR growth in invested assets at the Group level. There have also been strong multi-year inflows of net new invested assets, with Asia accounting for the majority. Finally, our CSM balance is a third bigger than it was two years ago, despite the reclassification of our French life insurance business in the fourth quarter. This reflects continued year-on-year growth in new business CSM from higher volumes, particularly in Hong Kong. As you know, the CSM balance is a store of future earnings, which released into the P&L at between 9% and 10% in the last two years. All things being equal, this means that future earnings growth has been built in. Also, last year the value of new business CSM was substantially greater than the CSM released to the P&L. On credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1.4 billion. $1 billion of this was in wholesale, including around $300 million from two clients, one in the UK and one in Mainland China commercial real estate sector. Overall, our portfolios in our home markets remained strong. This brought our 2024 charge to 36 basis points of average loans, which is within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. We expect our 2025 charge to be within our medium-term planning range. On costs, we are committed to deliver $1.5 billion of simplification savings from our reorganization to the bottom line, of which around $0.3 billion will be recognized in our 2025 P&L. We expect to incur around $1.8 billion of severance and other up-front costs by the end of 2026. The bulk of these costs will be incurred this year. Separately, we are also aiming to reallocate a further around $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic activities to priority growth areas. You will have seen that we have announced that we will begin to wind down our ECM and M&A activities in the UK, Europe and the US while refocusing on Asia. Those businesses were not materially profitable and exiting them will make around $300 million of costs available for reinvestment in our priority growth areas. The slide also shows some businesses that we have recently agreed to dispose of, German Private Banking and French life insurance, to which I’ll add the sale of our retail banking operations in Bahrain, which was announced today. These were not aligned with our four businesses where we will focus our investment dollars and our time. Through these actions, we are creating investment space in our priority areas within our strict cost discipline. As Georges said, these include Wealth in Asia and the Middle East, UK SME coverage and wholesale transaction banking. Entry to the extra investment list is a high hurdle requiring strategic alignment and financial returns. As we continue to work through exits of low return and non-strategic activities, we are confident the investment dollars they provide will deliver a higher return to the bank. The actions taken last year mean that 2024 costs were in line with our guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. We remain fully committed to cost discipline. We expect 2025 costs to grow by around 3% compared with 2024 on a target basis, which excludes notable items and the direct costs of the Canada and Argentina disposals. Our guidance of around 3% growth includes up to 4% underlying growth from inflation and investment, partly offset by around $0.3 billion of efficiency cost savings that we expect to realize this year. On loans and deposits, loan balances were stable. Deposits were up 3% in the fourth quarter. This included an increase in Hong Kong supported by customer growth as well as seasonality. As we have said before, I would caution you against annualising that number. Our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, above our target range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect the buyback of up to $2 billion announced today to have an impact of around 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter. We have reclassified our $7 billion legacy French home loan portfolio as hold to collect and sell in the first quarter. This will lead to recognition of an estimated $1 billion pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. In summary, we have set out our current expectations in respect of 2025 and the medium term, but our key target is mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. We will run the bank to deliver this. Neil, can we go to Q&A please?",

    "text": "Thank you very much, Gurpreet. I will handle the two questions. On CIB, we haven’t given specific returns medium-term returns for CIB. As Pam said, we’ve given the bank-wide target of mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We haven’t given a business-specific, but let me give you some indications of how we’re looking at the business. First, this business will benefit from the largest of the reorganization-related cost saves because this business is the result of the merger of two wholesale businesses and, as per any merger, you would expect a lot of cost synergies in areas where we had duplicative activities, be it mostly back-office activities that are duplicative where we will achieve the savings. This business also will benefit from additional we call it also the investment space from additional capital allocation efficiencies. We will be looking for more originate and distribute model. We will be looking to churn the balance sheet more, sweat the balance sheet more, drive higher earnings and fee income from this balance sheet and create better efficiency in the capital, and therefore we have a number of activities that will support this business’s return on tangible equity performance. And remember also this business is a leading business in wholesale transaction banking. We’re the largest trade bank in the world for seven consecutive years. We’re a top-two bank in payments and a top-two bank in foreign exchange. We’re the largest bank in securities services across Asia and the Middle East, so we’re benefiting from an amazing transaction banking capability. We’re also benefiting from an amazing deposit franchise. As you’ve seen, this business is in the 50s percent loan-to-deposit ratio, and that is a highly stable and highly profitable proposition. So a lot of investment in this business is to support this direction of travel. I didn’t mention the activities such as debt capital markets, et cetera, which also remain core in the wider capital solutions we provide to our customers. On your second question about IWPB, I think you have to look at this business as one of the largest growth engines of this firm. I mean, starting with Hong Kong, Hong Kong is on track to become the world’s largest cross-border wealth hub, ahead of Switzerland, by the end of this decade. We’re talking a few years. 800,000 new-to-bank customers, and we see this trend continuing. Then you look at various other parts of our network. Singapore is a major financial hub. The UAE has become a major wealth hub. We are the leading international wealth provider in mainland China and in India. So we continue to invest in these areas, and that investment will come in all forms, like more relationship managers, more wealth centers, more products on the shelf, more technology capabilities, and therefore, you have to expect that a lot of investment will go to this business, but this business is exhibiting already double-digit growth. I mean this business, Wealth in particular, has grown more than 20% year-on-year, and if you look at Asia alone our Wealth business in 2024 has grown more than 30% year-on-year, and therefore it deserves a lot of investment, even if that means we will eat a little bit on our return growth because we want to really secure our future as a leading provider, and our brand in parts of the world, such as Asia and the Middle East, is frankly second to none in our capability to attract this. Cross-border is a very important area for us. Frankly, we have to punch at our weight. We’re punching below our weight in cross-border. Our customers are with us in a given location, and then we lose them as their wealth or part of their wealth moves to another location. By just setting the right referral mechanisms, the product capabilities cross-border, the internal incentives, there is so much we can capture. It’s our own customers. So the reach is fairly easy. It’s a self-help mechanism that we’re trying to just recover on. As for Zing, so Zing was a fantastic technology platform which we built and were rolling out to non-clients that we were building from scratch and built a few tens of thousands. What we did is we flipped it over its head, and we’re bringing in the technology platform right in the core proposition. As we roll this technology platform within our core proposition in the UK, 15 million clients will be able to benefit from it practically straight away, and we shouldn’t be preventing that. That, on the contrary, accelerates our acquisition of international customers. And then, as we start thinking, rolling these new technologies widely in our Wealth business, there’s a lot of potential we can get there. And that is a much faster gain than trying to build it from scratch in an area where we have non-customers working with a different brand than our very strong brand, HSBC. Thank you, Gurpreet.",

I just wanted to understand a bit if you could talk around the revenues associated, the capital and the risk-weighted assets, so we get a bit of an idea of the optimization of this capital? And secondly, also what the return on investment on this that you expect? You mentioned a high hurdle rate. And then the second question is more general to you, Georges. I mean, you are a CIB guy; you think about curveball issues all the time, spillover effects. So I’m quite interested about how you are planning for tariffs within the Group, and in particular how you’re thinking about the curveballs, not the direct impacts, but the indirect impacts that are impacting you from CRE to Wealth growth, et cetera, FX, and how you’re basically putting that in your planning on your outlook and sensitivities around that?

    "text": "Thank you, Kian. Okay. I’ll take the two questions, but if there are more details, additional granularity on CRE, I’m sure Pam can handle that, but I’ll just give you a general sense. So on your first question, $1.5 billion reallocation of costs, so what we did say is we would reallocate it from non-strategic or low-returning activities into activities where we have a competitive edge, where we have better returns, and where we have opportunities to grow. So you have to look at this as returns incremental. Just as an illustration, the wind-down of our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, U.S. and Europe will give us $300 million of saves as we achieve them, that we can redeploy elsewhere. This cost was generating broadly break-even profits, so we’re marginally profitable in these activities. We do expect these to give us a much higher return as they’re reinvested, and we haven’t quantified that, but the expectation is that there’s an accretion of return. Second, if you look at the areas we’re looking to invest in, wealth, transaction banking, as big callouts, they are actually none or low balance sheet-consuming businesses. They’re materially fee and other income-driving businesses, with low, if any, impact on RWA growth. And if you look at the SME business, this business is essentially liability-driven and transaction banking- driven. The loans portion of this business is relatively small. The loan to deposit ratio is in the low-teens percentage points, which means, again, it’s a low RWA impact, high in Banking NII from deposits or transaction banking, but low RWA impact. In terms of your CIB curveball question, look, tariffs are not a new feature of global trade. There has always been various forms of tariffs on various products along various corridors, and we’ve always navigated those with our clients and supported them along the route. I think what’s changed now is maybe the speed at which the landscape will be evolving, the speed at which we may see new tariffs or changes in tariffs. But with the bank present on 85% of the trade corridors, with our global network, with our deep knowledge in all the markets where we operate, deep understanding of local rules and regulations, deep understanding of global rules and regulations, we’re actually very well placed to support our customers adjust and position their businesses to navigate these tariffs. Now, I add to that also, remember, most of the jurisdictions we operate in have pro-growth government policies. The UK is a good example, pro-growth government policy; the US is a very good example;. mainland China, pro-growth initiatives, consumer support initiatives. You look at Hong Kong, the removal of the cooling off measures on the commercial real estate or real estate in general. These measures have been effective, and we’re seeing the benefits in the economy and economic growth. So, there are a number of positive factors that also we can benefit from. We’ve seen that in January, by the way. The start of this year has been very encouraging. And look, the idea of all the simplification work we’ve done is that so we are simple, so we are agile, and agile means we can dynamically react and support our customers. And we will adapt quickly. We will react. We will make sure that we’re supporting our customers along these journeys. Thank you, Kian.",

The comment on looking at it again was removed some time ago, so no change for now in that respect. I want to just unbundle a little bit more on the cost point. So on the cost point, if you look at the guidance that we have, and this is the $1.5 billion of cost savings that are going straight to the bottom line. So the way we’ve looked at it is that it’s about 4%, if you look at inflation, as well as BAU investment. The benefit of that $1.5 billion this year that we are taking straight to the bottom line is $300 million. So if you compare to on a target basis, and you’re starting excluding disposals and hyperinflation, you start from 2024, it’s going to be a 3% year-on-year growth. So that’s what we are looking at. Now, severance and other one-off costs, they will be treated as notable items. Now, the timing of the $1.5 billion, yes, is $300 million this year. There’ll be more to come, clearly, in 2026. We see the full benefit of the $1.5 billion savings coming through for the full-year 2027, and the severance costs, et cetera, will be more upfront.",

    "text": "Thank you, Kun. I’ll take your first question, and I’ll ask Pam to address your second question. So, look, trade and wealth. First, it’s very difficult to predict what will happen to global trade in an uncertain environment, but what we can say is, for the last eight years, that trade has started to become more disrupted. Global trade has continued growing, low-single-digit percentage points. The trade routes have reconfigured. ASEAN has become the largest trading partner of China, ahead of the U.S. and Europe. We’ve seen more intra-regional trade pick up. We’ve seen more fragmentation of trade routes. So rather than the goods moving from point A to point B from, say, manufacturing to consumption, they’re usually going through multiple legs on the journey, across various other jurisdictions. Now, it so happens that we still have expectations that global trade will grow at low-single-digit percentage points. And it so happens that this reconfiguration segmentation is playing to our strength, because many of these new jurisdictions that have become major participants in global trade are jurisdictions where we have deep presence and, in some cases, leading presence as an international bank, and we are able to capture these flows and we will be supporting our customers along these routes. In wealth, again, if you look at various analysts and consultants’ consideration, Asia and Middle East wealth is expected to grow at high single digit into 10% CAGR for the next five years. So the underlying trend of the growth of the middle class in many of these Asian economies is there. And simply being a leading bank in this space, we benefit from this underlying trend, but what we are doing is we also want to increase our market share because, in some areas, apart from Hong Kong, where we’ve really been a leading player, in other places, we’ve been punching below our weight. And the idea is to be able to step up our product capabilities, our customer reach, the various metrics, which I shared in the slide without repeating. And the additional investment is not only to capture the underlying trend, but also to grow to our more natural share. This will be focused essentially on Asia and the Middle East. We recognize there are other pockets of wealth that will be important for us, but we’re not going to be a wealth player in the U.S. because we don’t have the right to win. Pam.",

So just in terms of our focus on both NII and fee income, clearly, as we sit today, our NII, given our strong balance sheet, deposit base, loans and advances, is a much bigger proportion of earnings compared to fee income. But given the guidance we’ve just shared with you, that we are looking at double-digit growth in Wealth over the medium term, even though it’s on a smaller base, whereas on loans and advances, we are looking at a mid-single-digit growth in the medium-term. So that balance will tilt, but I won’t go over my skates just as yet because the baseline starting point is so much bigger for balance sheet-driven business as opposed to fee income, but in direction of travel, absolutely. And also, the two things are a bit correlated. Hopefully, with your customers, when you do more, it’s not just balance sheet-related products. You do more fee income-driven. And we think that really gets us more into the space of hearts and minds of our customers, which is what we are here for.",

Thank you for elaborating on the capital distribution hierarchy, but I recognise that you are guiding to a mid-teens RoTE for the next three years, but only a 50% dividend payout for 2025. So what are the implications behind it? And we can see the bank’s share price is above one-times price to book, so will that affect your future consideration between buybacks and maybe raise the dividend payout? And the second question is on the loan growth. HSBC has been consistently guiding to a mid- single-digit loan growth for the medium to long term, but it’s still very challenging in the near term. So what circumstances do you think might be necessary for the bank to finally hit the target, and to what extent is that loan growth assumption baked into our Banking NII guidance? Thank you.",

Look, with a mid-teens return guidance, there’s plenty of space to do the 50% dividend payout ratio and to support the businesses to grow, which has always been the priority use of additional capital. But as you said, loan growth hasn’t been there for the last many quarters, and the opportunity for us was to return the excess capital through share buybacks. It remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through share buybacks, because we see this also as a means to create an accretion in our dividend per share – earnings per share and dividends per share, by reducing the share count.

Firstly, in terms of our views on the 50% earnings per share, we are very comfortable with that number, and as you can see, we look at obviously distribution but also opportunities for growth that we can deploy our surplus capital. I’m very pleased that we are trading above tangible book value, and we absolutely don’t consider the tangible book value to be a ceiling for our buybacks. Share buybacks will continue to be our preferred mode of distribution going forward. The other thing on dividends is that you obviously have to look at where your CET1 is at a point of time. You have to look at regulatory changes. For now 50%, we’re very comfortable with. Now, in terms of your next question on loan growth, we need to unbundle it a little bit. Yes, loan growth is flat. It was down $3 billion in Hong Kong, up $3 billion for the rest of Asia, up $1 billion for the UK, down $1 billion for the rest of the world. We are optimistic that as the interest rate trajectory stabilizes there will be customer demand, and when there’s customer demand we’ll be there obviously to support our customers. But what’s also really important is as we’re seeing that from a Hong Kong perspective there is some momentum coming back, we expect at least the loan trajectory in Hong Kong to stabilise and not reduce.

On the buybacks, if you could just clarify, the $2 billion is obviously a step down from $3 billion.

That’s the first question. The second question, I want to have another stab at the costs. Ben asked about this. I think the walk to 2025 is very clear, but if we then think about the walk to 2026, should we assume a similar level of inflation and investment? Is 4% a fair assumption for future years in your view as well? Then when we eyeball slide 29, which has that cost phasing, and it looks like there’s a $600 million, $700 million step up in the cost saves in 2026, before the full run rate is recognized in 2027. So are we looking at a 4% increase in 2026 from that 2025 guide, less another incremental $700 million of cost saves, so a sub-$34 billion cost number?

The big moving parts always when we look at our cost is what’s the underlying inflation, staff costs and we also track very closely what’s the increase in fixed pay from a staff cost perspective. So it was expected 3.6% in 2025. It was 4.4% in 2024, so you can see the trajectory shifting as obviously inflation is coming down. We also include in that 4%, and we have for 2025, additional investments, so you can do the math in terms of where we go to for 2026. But also let’s be mindful, so far we’re saying for 2025 we are only taking $300 million of the $1.5 billion down to the savings line, so there is an absolute tailwind for the rest of it coming through for 2026, so that’s how the math works. And as we go into 2027, I would expect two things to happen. You’ll see some normalization on the inflation and the underlying built number. We will have the BAU investment, so that continues the same building block, but what’s important is even though the $1.5 billion has been taken down to the bottom line we expect through our simplification some of the additional efficiency costs beyond just FTE-related costs, i.e. the ways of working, so that will give us some tailwind, but obviously not to the same extent as you’ve had in 2026.",

It’s a target and obviously, if the world’s in a better place, there is an upside, but you also have to look at the downside and that’s how we look at all scenarios in our assumptions. Coming back to your second question on the $1.5 billion. Firstly I want to clarify, the first $1.5 billion, which is simplification savings, has no revenue impact because it’s literally more senior roles, deduplication, simplifying the matrix. On that, there is no revenue impact and the whole savings is a tailwind which goes straight to the bottom line. On the second $1.5 billion, which is different, it is clearly a reallocation, which will happen from the individual business level, but we will take it all to the Group level. Now, when you take it all to the Group level, there is going to be some time lag between the cost coming up and re-investing, but we do think that the payback period is pretty quick because we know it’s in existing areas we want to reinvest. So that time lag on the revenue should not be that long and that will get compensated. But as we have said before, we are taking this reallocation of cost, particularly from two areas: ones where we are sub-scale, and so materially it doesn’t really make an impact in terms of your profit – they’re small-scale divestments – but there are others where in terms of profitability they are not materially profitable, like we said on the investment bank. Therefore, as we take them through into new areas with higher returns and being very focused on those which are our competitive strengths, we do think that positivity will come back pretty quickly.",

Have we factored that in the mid-teens RoTE guidance? Because when we are exiting some business, we need some regulatory approval and it’s hard to gauge the timeline. What assumptions do we have regarding these parts in our mid-teens RoTE guidance? The underlying question is will we see some upside, because if we do it faster or slower like that. The second one, I still want to ask about CRE question. I think it’s an old question, but I think we still have a lot of people, a lot of investors care about it. Both in Hong Kong and China in last quarter we heard some events which led to some concerns on these areas. If I look at our Q4 numbers, I know that some are edging up on the ECL charges. Is any parts of that related to CRE and what is our outlook on CRE in both regions? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Katherine. I’m going to ask Pam to address both your questions but let me share with you just briefly my outlook on the CRE situation. So firstly, in mainland China we believe that we’ve hit a trough, really, in the challenges that the sector has faced. We believe the measures that have been taken to stabilise and start a normalisation process are working their way effectively through the economy. But more importantly, our exposure has materially reduced and therefore it is not going to be any more any major driver for our ECL. Second, about Hong Kong. We’re actually positive about the outlook of Hong Kong. Hong Kong, first the economy and certainly rate trajectory is going to support that, we’re seeing growth manifest in 2024, in growth outlook in 2025 and a number of sectors really have revived. But also in the CRE space, the underlying CRE market in Hong Kong is strong and resilient. The supply/demand equation is very supportive for the medium to long term and as we said, the rate outlook will also support that. But then if you look at our exposure to many of the borrowers in the space, the borrowers are much stronger and much less leveraged than what we’ve seen in the China CRE space. They are in a better balance sheet position, albeit they may have cash flow challenges due to high rates, et cetera, but the loan to valuation we have on our exposure is also very strong. We are in the 50s percent. Therefore, we do not think the Hong Kong CRE exposure in our books will be any material driver of our future ECLs. Pam can address your questions on cost and take you more specifically in the CRE elements.",

    "text": "Thank you for your question. So firstly, yes, we have factored the reallocation into our mid-teens RoTE guidance, and we’ll work as quickly as we can to reallocate costs to higher- return areas. Obviously, if it is faster than our assumptions – we tend to be a bit conservative, which is a good space to be, then there will be some upside. But given regulatory approvals, et cetera, things can be slower. But all in all, we are still very comfortable to have a mid-teens RoTE for each of the next three years. I’ll take the China CRE question first, and then I’ll do Hong Kong CRE. Now China CRE, we’ve always been very comfortable with our onshore exposure, which has been secured. The issue really has been with the offshore exposure, which was unsecured, but that number is way down from where we started. We are now down to $2.2 billion net of ECLs, and, out of that, there is very little of the exposures where we feel that there is more headwind. And as you can see, the chart for ECL last year was much lower than the prior years. So that, I think, gives me a sense of optimism with regard to the trajectory of the China CRE outlook. And of course, you can have one-off cases, and things move on, but, overall, it’s based upon our exposure. Now, on Hong Kong CRE, just as a starting point, as long as the interest rate trajectory is high, of course you can see some customers facing headwinds, because it’s a cash flow issue, fundamentally, and that makes you bring more names into the stage 3s. But what’s very important to note is that, despite them coming into stage 3s, our ECLs haven’t increased, and the answer is quite simple. Most of the names coming through the stage 3s last year have been from a secured portfolio, which is 54% of our total portfolio. And as Georges said, there’s a very high level of collateralization. I mean, average LTV on sub-standard is 46% and, on the impaired, is at 58%, so there’s enough room in that space and there is strong collateral. So even when they go to stage 3, there is not an ECL increase, and the ECL increase this year has been minimal and we see nothing changing there. On the unsecured, 90% of it is investment grade, so 46% of portfolio is unsecured; 90% is investment grade. And it’s primarily with the conglomerates and strong developers and, because they have diversified cash flows, the inflow into stage 3 from this portion of the book is very small. So all in all, even though, with the increase in stage 3s, you see a minimal uplift in RWAs and the capital impact, but a very small capital impact, from an ECL perspective, there is really no material change in the ECL trajectory at this point of time, and we are very comfortable that it’s all well within our mid-term guidance of 30 to 40 basis points.",

    "text": "Hi, guys. Good morning, Pam. Good morning, Georges. I had two questions. I think you’re pointing to much better pre-provision profit outlook than consensus. I guess we’ve laboured the discussion around costs, but my takeaway is that it is broadly flattish beyond 2025, and maybe a bit of growth, but well lower than where the street is. I think Banking NII guidance also speaks for itself, so there are two related questions to that. One is around non-interest income. There’s a lot of moving parts on non-interest income, but I think you’re coming in with significant momentum on non-interest income, in excess of consensus, but we do have a lot of moving parts there. Is there anything you can do to help us? I know you don’t like to talk too much about non-interest income, because there’s volatile line items in it, but you’ve got double-digit growth momentum in wealth management, trade that’s probably growing low to mid-single digits. Who knows what markets do, but they’re probably not going backwards. Then you’ve got a retail piece as well. But it just does feel like that is something that is trending well in excess. So if you were able to comment in respect of 2025 consensus, that would be really helpful. The second is about Banking NII. So the $42 billion guidance this year is great. And I know there’s a lot of focus on lending, but really it’s deposits that matter, right? You alluded to the strength of your franchise. And loans are going to be subdued for a while, but deposits are already growing and, indeed, they’re going to continue growing from here. Can you try and help us with that? Are you able to quantify the deposit growth and average interest-earning asset growth that we might look to expect? Because I think you can comfortably grow your balance sheet despite a subdued demand dynamic in your key markets. I think that really helps underpin the kind of Banking NII beyond 2025. My kind of slight follow-up question, then, I’m going to sneak it in, but it’s just around FX. And if you were to mark to market any of the cost guide, for example, for the spot FX rate, if that would affect any of your kind of guide or commentary today, that would be really helpful.

I’ll take your first question by saying, ‘Nice try’. Unfortunately, I cannot give you more than what we shared. What we’ve shared is a confidence that we’re running the bank towards a mid-teens target on return on tangible equity excluding notable items for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We’re also guiding to a medium-term outlook on Wealth at double-digit growth, which we’re comfortable with, given this is an area where we’re investing in and we see the underlying trends supportive, but this is more a medium-term guidance. It’s difficult to evaluate what it means on a year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter basis. And we’re also comfortable that our wholesale transaction banking – given our strong leadership position in many of these areas, we will be able to ride the wave, and we think the wave – the macro is in a low-single-digit percentage growth. It’s subject to possible disruptions, but the underlying trend, if you look at global trade with all forms of corridors – not just some of the disrupted corridors – other corridors are likely to continue growing. I think this is how you should look at it. And remember the rate trajectory as well. It’s still uncertain, but that will be a way if we see faster rate cuts than we’ve implied. Let me just pause here on that part of the question and ask Pam to take you through Banking NII and FX.",

    "text": "Thank you, Aman. So firstly, our cost guidance is on a constant currency basis, so clearly, from an FX perspective, there could be an impact. In terms of the $42 billion guidance, you’re right. On loans, we say it’s mid-single-digit growth in the medium term, and lower rates will help to get some momentum back, but it’s also driven by overall market confidence, so I can’t really call out the timing of the return to loan growth exactly. Now, deposits, clearly, was a key one in the fourth quarter, but we know that, in the fourth quarter, there’s a bit of a seasonality effect, so I would very much caution you against annualizing that number. But I think, in terms of deposits, if I look at just the drivers for the $42 billion guidance, there’s interest rates, which is a headwind at this point of time, given the market-implied rate curves, and then there is the structural hedge, which will be a tailwind. The loans, we have talked about. On deposits, we feel very lucky to have a strong deposit base, as you’ve said, and the trust of our customers to give us those deposits is a cornerstone for our strong balance sheet. The deposit benefit for next year is driven by what’s going to be the time deposit mix, because that held through in the fourth quarter. As the interest rates come down, we expect the time deposit mix to also come down. So in that context, you can factor that in as part of your overall calculation in terms of the headwinds and the tailwinds.",

We separately announced $1.5 billion from strategic reallocation of costs from activities that are non-strategic or low returning into our core strategy where areas of our competitive strength.

So the specific scenario, which we homed into was based on significant increase in tariffs as well as retaliatory tariffs. We also took a holistic approach. We considered different businesses, different geographies as well as customer segments. And this scenario resulted in significant decline in trade and significant slowdown in global GDP growth. The impact of this, we looked at both in terms of revenue through lower balances, but also on flow-based income.

So if we compare those two tests, are there assumptions for the trade test, better or worse, than the -- I mean, the downside scenario better or worse than those set of assumptions used in the ECL test?

And we are comfortable based on the work we have done to reaffirm our guidance on RoTE. I just want to be clear that the scenario does not include the secondary impact of any change in policy rates in terms of the revenue-related scenario. Secondly, none of these two scenarios have what you call an extreme downside to scenario with like a double-digit contraction of GDP like we saw in the COVID period. So just to give you some guardrails. So in terms of Hong Kong CRE, this was a relatively quiet quarter. We did have one specific name, which in the performing book, there was a credit downgrade. Otherwise, there's really nothing more significant. We continue to look at our book in detail, and there may be a few names up or down on the credit curve with very modest impact on RWAs, but no significant impact on ECLs.",

So I just wondered if you had observed any material shift in the way that your customers are transacting with you, you've seen any forward indicators around sentiment, any signs of derisking or deleveraging? Any shift in particularly your kind of corporate customers that might be on the receiving end of trade tariffs? Any insights there would be really helpful. And then the second is definitely get the message around continuing to execute on the existing strategy? I guess just two kind of related points to that, one around capital returns. I mean it's obviously great that you've announced a $3 billion buyback. You're talking about a more subdued outlook for lending by extension RWA. So presumably, you might be quite capital generative this year. So it seems like you're committed to distributions despite the uncertainty, right? It's an uncertain backdrop, but the pace of distributions that you're kind of executing on it, it feels like you're committed to that. Is that the right read? Should we be confident around things like the buyback sustainability from here. And just the related part of that question then is just around you talk about divestiture on track, the $1.5 billion, but in terms of the redeploy, because I think you talked about some potential revenue opportunities from the redeploy or cost savings if it doesn't come through, are you minded to delay any of this redeploy basically given the volatile backdrop?

I'm going to take your first question about customer behavior, and I'll ask them to address both our capital return strategy as well as the cost redeployment from the reallocations. So in terms of customer behavior, I think nothing that would really surprise you. Corporate customers essentially are in a wait-and-see mode. So some of the CapEx or large investments are on hold. Certainly, some of the shipments from China specifically to the U.S. have slowed down, but we've seen no PMIC. So there's been no significant drawdowns. There is -- deposit behavior has remained normal. So nothing really to call out beyond the wait and see. In terms of personal banking and wealth customers activity. Actually, this has been quite strong. And remember, we have a diversified product offering. So we've seen customers rebalance their investments between various offerings and be it various geographic equity exposure or other assets such as mutual funds or structured products. And when customers want to take a risk of approach, we see the money flow into our deposit base, so we kind of capture the customer assets either in invested assets or in deposits. But when we look at our NNIA for the first three months of the year, it remained positive, strong. So we remain positive on the outlook of the growth in this business. Remember also, we're investing in this business. So we're capturing the underlying growth in the market, but we're also capturing market share in the way we're embedding in this business. Pam?",

    "text": "Thanks, Aman. So just one point to add on the wealth customer behaviors. Our strength relies in our very broad product proposition. So as we see the mix shift between U.S. equities or Asian equities, or indeed into short-term fixed income products. We are there to support our customers as well as in terms of insurance on more protection and savings related products. So given that gives us confidence that this double-digit growth continues. And we've seen the same trend even through April and the same trend also no panic, no drawdowns and deposit behavior normal through April. So that's just to say that. So coming down to distribution. So just as a starting point, we have a policy on ordinary dividends. I'm assuming your question is much more on share buybacks. But let me see overall the process we follow. Every quarter, we look at where we are in terms of a CET1. And you know our CET1 operating range is between 14% to 14.5%. We also look at our capital generation, less the capital needs or capital deployment that we want to do. And what's very important is routinely, we look at a range of scenarios in terms of the macroeconomic environment. And then based on that, we look at the quantum on share buybacks. And clearly, if we have excess capital, share buybacks continues to be our preferred method to return capital. We have not changed our view on capital redeployment. But as I've said, we look at opportunities. We look at the generator capability quarter-on-quarter, and that's how we make the decision on the quantum of share buybacks.",

The first, Georges, HSBC is a signatory to a letter suggesting to the U.K. regulators that ring fencing is something that should go, I think that's the right view. But we've got a lot of investor demand for sense from the U.S. to the motivation for that? What is it that you'd say in terms of OpEx, funding costs and what restructuring charges may go with that? So when you made that motivation, what was the next behind it? And then secondly, very strong performance in costs in Q1, but guidance held constant for the year ahead. I guess that implies potentially some slippage in efficiency ratios in the quarters to come, notwithstanding the cost saving actions that are underway. Could you talk a little bit about sort of the moving parts? Is it just quarter-to-quarter volatility? Is there anything we should be thinking about in the upcoming quarters as far as cost inflation that is concerned? Thanks very much.",

    "text": "Thank you, Jason. Let me address your first question on ring-fencing, and Pam will take your second question on the cost. So our view on ring-fencing is that we've taken major -- I mean there's been major enhancement to the prudential regulations for banks in the U.K. in particular, the broader regimes of capital, of loss absorbency through MREL, liquidity, recovery and resolution, et cetera. All these measures have basically put the bank in a much better safer prudential space that have made ring-fencing effectively redundant. The second thing to say is that the U.K. is the only major economy that is applied ring-fencing. So it's quite unique to the U.K. So as an outcome, is increase the cost to operate as a bank. It created capital inefficiencies at trapped liquidity, it effectively exposed our customers, including businesses and SMEs to higher costs. It did somewhat also stifle competition. The bar to be able to compete in the U.K. for banks has become stiffer and more difficult. So therefore, we believe that removing ring fencing or at least scaling back on some of the ring-fencing considerations will improve the outcome for customers and ultimately, therefore will support growth in the U.K. Now just to reiterate, we are very supportive of the government's growth agenda and we will play our role in the U.K. for that. And as regard to the financial impact of the removal or the scaling down of ring fencing, look, we haven't done full analysis, but we believe this will be positive for both capital cost and ability to compete and support the growth of the U.K. economy and our customers.

    "text": "Thank you, Kian. Kian, I'm going to make some broad comments on the view of corridors and overall our business. And I'll ask Pam to give you additional information on the tariff scenarios as well as in the cost implications, okay? So a couple of things to note. The first one is as we did say, the Lion's share of our banking NII is driven by our deposit franchise. This deposit franchise is a hallmark of our balance sheet. We run 50s loan-to-deposit ratio in three of our four businesses. And in the U.K., we're on 80s, which is the lowest, Therefore, we have deposit surpluses in every currency, every geography, every business line, and this franchise is very robust and is a driver of a very important lion's share of our banking NII, very important revenue stream. The second, when you look at our fee income, when -- so far has continued to grow at double-digit returns, and we do expect it to continue to grow at double-digit returns in the medium term, given the underlying market opportunities and market growth as well as our own investment to continue gaining market share. So transaction banking is the one we really are diving into. Remember, first, Transaction Bank is a wide set of products that cover various areas outside trade. And remember, a lot of our businesses, let's say with multinational customers operating in Asia or in China, a lot of their business is in China for China or in Asia for Asia, where they produce and manufacture locally and distribute locally with limited impact on tariffs, albeit some may be impacted by tariffs. But even within trade, we have seen growth of trade corridors intra-Asia or within Asia, Middle East at a very fast pace, and a number of these corridors have become structurally resilient and on a growth trajectory. Now some of the China plus one trade patterns that are still meant to ultimately distribute or export to the U.S. will be affected for insofar that there's intra-Asia trade flows for that ultimate purpose, but there is a much bigger intra-Asia, and Middle East trade flows that are two-way and that are related to domestic manufacturing for the purposes of domestic consumption, which we continue to see as structurally growing. Our scenarios have really looked at differentiation between the areas of structural growth and the areas that will be widely impacted by tariffs, which Pam can talk to.",

    "text": "So thank you, Kian. So firstly, just to reiterate, the $40 billion banking NII continues to be our best estimate for full year 2025. Now we've looked at a range of reasonable upside, downside assumptions, including rates, but we are not immune to all scenarios despite the stress work that we have done. Our Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion puts us in a good trajectory given that range of scenarios you've looked at all plausible upsides and downsides. Now as always, there are four key drivers. The rates that we have included are based on the mid-April curves. The structural hedge will be a tailwind to this headwind of rates. We have $75 billion maturities in the remainder of the year, and they are on 2.8% yield at the moment. So there will be an upside to that. The other two elements are harder to forecast, particularly in terms of balance sheet growth, as we've said before and the loans stay muted. Having said that, loans and advances were slightly up in the first quarter of this year, primarily because Hong Kong loans and advances were stable compared to Q4 last year where they had contracted. Now the deposit migration trend from Hong Kong has stayed stable over last year into this year at 39%, and that is continuing even through April. So if I look at it in the round in terms of deposit behaviors of our customers, both from a corporate side and as well as from a retail side, we stay quite comfortable. So on tariffs, just in terms of the broad piece, what we have looked at from a tariff perspective is, and it's all in terms of seeing the various scenarios in terms of delivering the mid-teens RoTE. I mean firstly, we looked at our income stream beyond banking which is wholesale transaction banking. And it has many more products beyond trade finance. It also is in diverse products within trade finance and their diverse global and intra-regional corridors. Now when we have looked to the downside scenario, we've looked at higher tariffs. We have looked at impact on GDP. And we have looked more broadly on policy rates, inflation, the big picture. But again, to say we have not looked at GDP to the stress level of a downside scenario that we have called out in our release, which is like a double-digit contraction of GDP as we saw in the COVID period. So if you look at all that, we come to a low single-digit percentage impact on revenues. And within that and within the incremental $500 million ECLs, we stay very confident for our mid-teens ROTE for the next three years. Now the broader impacts are going to be hard to quantify. These are your second, third order impacts, but we'll continue to monitor them through our various scenarios and review them quarter-on-quarter. On costs, our cost trajectory is on track. And given this, there's no shift on that. And we will still continue through our envelope to be able to invest in the areas which we have been, as Georges has said, because we can see the direct benefit coming very quickly in those areas even in the current environment and continuing through April, and that's primarily on the well side.",

Again, just coming back in terms of the broader profitability mid-teens kind of target. So essentially, you're saying that if we were to see that plausible downside scenario, you still believe you can achieve that mid-teens profitability level and that's before factoring in any further kind of cost actions? Or would that be with any kind of rejigging or additional cost action taken by the group to mitigate some of that impact? And then secondly, I just wanted to check, when I look at the downside 1 ECL scenario now versus a full year, it seems like the China and Hong Kong drawdown is not quite as severe. I see the U.S. is maybe a little bit 30 bps more severe, so I was also kind of curious why that downside scenario is not quite as negative perhaps as what you assessed at the full year stage?

    "text": "Thanks. So just in terms of the scenarios just to confirm, they are not identical scenarios, but in terms of severity and plausibility, you're right in the ballpark because the ECL scenario stresses a lot of things on interest rates, inflation, et cetera, from a range of factors, and this one on tariffs is quite specific on the revenue line. And to clarify on ECLs, we had to build our reserve for this quarter, change the weightings of the downside 1 from 15% to 30%. And when we look at the $500 million potential impact, that is if you change that downside 1 scenario weighting to 100%. So just to say that's a $500 million additional to the $150 million. Now in terms of Hong Kong and China CRE, absolutely, in terms of both from an individual customer level as well on the forward economic guidance, given the starting point, there is a lesser impact, and overall there has been very little noise from a Hong Kong CRE and China CRE other than isolated names in this quarter. There can be credit downgrades over a period of time. We saw a few now, but the impact from an RWA perspective is very modest. If you look from a U.S. perspective, also there was a specific name. And when we look at the credit downgrades, so that's also in the quarter. I wouldn't really build any trend from this quarter into a full year.

    "text": "Thank you, Gurpreet. So firstly, banking NII was flat on a quarter-on-quarter on a constant currency basis, excluding notable items in Argentina. Now we don't split out the dollar impact of every moving part, but let me just unbundle. So the headwinds were to fewer days in the quarter as well as lower interest rates. But the tailwinds was reinvestment of maturing hedge assets at high yields, a bit of change in the mix of our market treasury assets as well as the benefit of deposit pass-throughs, particularly in the U.K., which come through with a delay of 90 days so the interest rate cuts, which we saw in August came in through for a full quarter in this quarter. And then we saw a bit of a tail of the November cuts as well. So that's how is the impact there. In terms of your other question, of course, we look at various upside and downsides in that $42 billion. And I just want to reiterate, that $42 billion is not an underpin, it is just around $42 billion. Our current best estimate based upon what we see in terms of deposit betas, based upon what we see in terms of actual deposit flows coming through updated not just for the quarter, but also considering the trend we've seen through April.",

    "text": "Good morning. If I could have a couple on the organizational simplification, and then also just one clarification on well. On the organizational simplification, you previously guided to $1.8 billion of restructuring costs. And you said the majority of that is expected to be booked in 2025. I think you only took $141 million in Q1. So presumably, we should expect a big step-up in the restructuring charges from Q2 onwards to the rest of this year? And then the second question kind of attached to this is, you said that the actions taken to date will already translate into $300 million of annualized savings. I appreciate in Q1, you've had very little of that. But nonetheless, you're still guiding to $300 million for the full-year '25 when you've already achieved $300 million annualized and there's presumably more to come over the remainder of the year with the additional restructuring. So can you just clarify it now on why more of the savings are not flowing into full-year '25 compared to '26? And then on wealth clarification, given the new segmental split, is it possible to get the split of the Asian invested assets and $16 billion Asian net new invested assets this quarter that's attributable to Hong Kong? Thank you.",

    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Andy. So firstly, in terms of the actions taken and the P&L being coming through for the year. The actions taken typically is when you have colleagues put through at risk and decisions made, communicated. There is always a time lag typically between that and colleagues leaving the platform. Typically, it tends to be about a quarter 90 days. So when you say an action has been taken, you know it saving is going to come through, but there is going to be a time lag between that decision and the savings feeding into the P&L. So when we said the majority of the actions have already been taken, the annualized savings that we calculated, it's for the full-year. So it's not as though these actions are already banked in and there's going to be further. So that's sort of the main piece. Now on restructuring costs, you're absolutely right that there is going to be the majority of the restructuring costs taken in 2025 rather than 2026. And I would expect most of that to come through Q2, Q3 and then some Q4 and then tapering down as we go into 2026.",

    "text": "Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I just had a couple. The first one, I noticed that your cost guidance is based on an average exchange rate in Q1. But the U.S. dollar, I think, is what off about 6% since then. So I assume that if we were actually to do that at today's exchange rate, your cost number will be somewhat higher than that. And I'm just trying to check, is your revenue guidance also based on those exchange rates. So should -- is it effectively like both where we should both gear up both revenue and costs for the weaker dollar in terms of our expectations. That's the first point. And then I guess partly related to that, are we actually in the plausible downside scenario now? I mean if I'm looking at trade flows from China to the U.S. are down, what, 45% bookings, something like that. I mean that feels to me like a pretty downside scenario. So should we assume that as we go through Q2 and Q3, we are actually in that scenario now. Is that effectively where we are, assuming nothing changes. And I guess nobody has any idea what will happen in terms of the changes, but assuming we stay where we are today. And then I guess my second question was just about BoCom. I just can't really understand the accounting, because you're still running with a valuation that's what, $10 billion above the market value, but you didn't subscribe for new shares with the capital raise, which I sort of assume you would have done if you had thought it really was worth that much more. So should we be expecting you to actually track that now down to what would be like a market price rather than just the 1.6 million, should we be revisiting how you do the sort of -- I think you call it value and news don't use something like that? Thanks so much.",

So look, the adverse plausible downside scenario is a scenario that is further adverse from where we are today with significantly higher global tariffs on major trading blocks on an aggregate basis. And we've looked at their impact across, obviously, our trade business, but more importantly, across overall our volumes and the economic outlook of our businesses on the whole. We do recognize that there is uncertainty, and it's very difficult to understand how much downside or upside there is in the future outlook for this.

So I agree the downside scenario is not something where we are now because the downside scenario clearly has a broader impact in terms of GDP and other areas, which then gives the significant impacts that we talked about, so just to make that clear. And you're absolutely right, the target cost base of $31.9 billion, equivalent to full-year '24 costs was rebased on first quarter's average exchange rates, all things being equal, U.S. depreciation would put an upward pressure on an absolute cost, but in the same way, it will put an upward pressure. I have some benefit on the revenues, and we will do that on the same principle quarter-on-quarter as we progress. And our FX rates have been volatile. We'll continue to update you quarter-on-quarter. So in terms of BoCom, just in sort of simple terms, at this point of time, we continue to say that BoCom is an associate. We have done the assessment as we do every year in terms of further impairment. And there has been no impact for this quarter. The dilution impact into P&L, we will have an accounting impact on the completion of the share issuance, and that's where that will be taken. But I just want to reiterate all said and done. There is an insignificant impact from this dilution on our CET1. And because it's a material notable item, there is no impact on dividend or distribution.",

The first one I still want to ask about the tariff scenario, because I think for analysts, at least our investors in this part of the world, I think it's partly -- it's widely expected that the Chinese government will have more stimulus policy, because of the tariffs. So in your downside scenario analysis, have you incorporated some of the positive impact from the stimulus policies, which could potentially be benefiting the Hong Kong China market? So I think this is number one. Number two, I still want to ask about the loan growth because now the guidance is that there will be muted loan demands in 2025. So what sort of tariff scenarios that we are -- like when we're giving this type of guidance, what sort of tariff environments are we incorporating?

Katherine, I'm going to make some comments on your first question, and I'll ask Pam then to take it forward as well as the loan growth question, which gives you an overlook. So firstly, we recognize indeed, there is a lot of potential for China to take policy measures and other measures to stimulate the economy, and we would be very encouraged by that. We're confident about the outlook for China. We're optimistic that these measures as they are taken and they will be taken will have a positive impact on the economy. We believe in the foundational strength of the Chinese economy, and we're very encouraged to see the pickup in retail sales, and therefore, the pickup in domestic consumption also. so on the whole, our main scenario is that we are confident in the medium- to long-term outlook in China.

    "text": "Yes. Thanks, Katherine. So absolutely being a stress downside scenario plausible, but severe, we typically take the downside. We don't take the upside of the mitigating actions or any other policy measures. It's purely tariffs and retaliatory tariffs in a plausible range. So all said and done, I just want to reaffirm, it was all calculated as part of the target RoTE guidance that we are giving. On loan growth, the situation is in some ways similar to where we were at the end of Q4 because macroeconomic uncertainty delays decision-making. So we are not seeing any of those CapEx decisions being brought forward or delayed. They were delayed. They will continue to be delayed hopefully at some stage when some certainty remains, there will be loan growth. We are also monitoring very closely to see if there is any increase in drawdowns just like we observed in Q2 of 2020. At this point of time, there's no increase in drawdowns. So overall, from a loan growth perspective, I would say, still muted in terms of what we are seeing. The only thing I would say is that if there is sort of continued tariff uncertainty, you will see maybe a little bit pickup from a OpEx perspective on working capital because when you have to pay import duties upfront and there's some delays in some of the monies coming and so on. So that kind of will have an impact. But from a materiality perspective, the real driver for our banking NII guidance of $42 billion is really deposits for which we have a very strong franchise. We are in a privileged position to be a trusted partner for our customers, and we expect that to grow. Of course, there will be a bit of seasonal fluctuation quarter-on-quarter.

    "text": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let’s talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and the recent televised interview. So, I will go straight to the specific impacts on the Firm. As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firm-wide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end. It’s important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook, which I will address at the end, still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter’s inflows. Now back to the quarter touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share. Consumer spending remained solid with combined debit and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year. And credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the Company. On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex markets was down $1.1 billion or 10% driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume. And markets revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs, reflecting the annualization of last year’s headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter, which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted average economic outlook. Onto balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion and net repurchases back to shareholders. Now, let’s go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid, and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. Moving to financial results. CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher-yielding products, as you would expect, but were encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our Wealth Management offerings. Client investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year, reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. Next, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number 1 with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and currencies in emerging markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity and cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates. And gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition and non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In middle market banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in CapEx spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially with higher rates creating headwinds for both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in the urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million, predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion, pretax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our asset management joint venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisory teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run rate impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by fixed income and equities. And then liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6%, driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. Next, the outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year as well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook, given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year. I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags. We think a more sustainable NII ex-markets run rate in the medium term is well below this quarter’s $84 billion as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance. And while we don’t know exactly when this lower run rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. And of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds as well as the broader macroeconomic environment, including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it’s worth noting that markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. Moving to expenses. Our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.",

So I think down the road, there may be some limitations on held to maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type size banks and more scrutiny and history exposure, stuff like that. But it doesn’t have to be a revamp of the whole system. It’s just recalibrating things the right way. I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taking, which are drastic, it could actually make them weaker. So, that’s all it is.

So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple of factors. So the change in the rate environment with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we’re getting a lot of positive feedback from field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It’s been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So, that’s kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher card revolve, which is helping. And I’ll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction. And that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all the uncertainty kind of went through the same way. But as Jamie has pointed out, like those uncertainties are all still there. We highlight them on the page. And as we look forward to this year and into next year in the medium-term, we remain very focused on those.",

So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of ‘24 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased G-SIB stab and operating with a 50 basis point buffer. So the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, who knows how we’ll tweak that going forward. But that’s still our base case assumption. Specifically, on the stress test, I’ll -- contrary to what I’ve heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you’ll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of 2 in terms of how big it wound up being and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now, we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets in harsher credit shocks in the numbers. So for planning purposes right now, we’re assuming flat for SCB and we’ll know soon enough what that actual number is.",

You had the guilt problem in London. You had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates or those who are too exposed to refi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. So now that -- I say to all of our clients, now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That’s answer number one.

You also obviously know that our current EIR actually shows a slight negative number, so it tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won’t get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short term. But the point is that the level of rates now is, of course, very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It’s quite tricky and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I’ve alluded to a couple of times on this call, the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve.

And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a stable environment from that perspective. And similarly in wholesale, we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would continue to expect -- we would continue to -- we would expect that to continue to take place, probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable and we talked previously about the medium-term run-rate in the mid-70s that was before First Republic and you know you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher, but whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number.

So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1 and we hear you loud and clear that your more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III end game, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero, because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different role from a rate scenario and everybody is talking about, even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero.

I guess I would start by saying that when we talk about 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment where we brought the lowest eurobond, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment. And at some level, that remains true today. Furthermore -- you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III end-game, one relevant question might be, if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target. So, I think -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the Company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that. Some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math, simply diluting down the ROTCE by expand the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, you know repricing on products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So, I'm not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power, we will adjust to the higher capital. So lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios, we feel good about our ability to deliver the results and we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out, especially after we see the Basel III proposal and it goes through the common period.",

We've been over in credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite cautious about it. We know that it's going to kick-off just as a normalized it will be, considering more than that is now.

On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal, ultimately sometime this month or something. So sooner or not, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about including Chair, Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr's 2% of RWA which runs up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception, obviously, of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff, we can get way into the weeds there within the markets business and we do have a good track-record of adjusting and optimizing.

So we'll see -- I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations. Generally, we do still expect reasonably robust card loan growth. But away from that, for a variety of different reasons at different products, whether it'd be mortgage or C&I, after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there. So we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms, we went through-the-cycle.

So we'll see what happens on that. On an FRTB, it's really very nuanced, it's probably like to much detail for this call to be honest, but just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one-product under FRTB has yield curve spread options and if the FRTB proposal goes through, as currently written, that product becomes not viable. So obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares, but it's just one example of the way, sometimes when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly, all the way down to new products and responding accordingly. You can wind-up having to change our business mix there. Obviously, more significant products that matter much more of a real economy like mortgage where, the layering on of the operational risk in the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again, making the product even harder to offer the homeowners, so we'll see, we'll see what happens.",

I just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second-half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as treasury issuance really begins to ramp-in earnest. Yes, good question, Steve if. So, let me say a couple things about this. So obviously our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks, as well as obviously the public transaction, but now if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and project forward. Our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to reassert itself from this higher starting point broadly as a function of QTS with the system. But, noting that we do have some hope for offset by taking share, just to get a couple of examples like in consumer. We've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning. And so their share over increase their and in wholesale, we've obviously invested a lot in products and services. And so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates. And so there are potentially some share offsets there. but broadly we are core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you know, the same thing, we have noted that as we got through the desk fueling and the CGA build it has come into effect a lot of bill issuance. The big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves have come out of RFP. And so-far, with most of the GTA, they're on I guess the targeting 600, and they're at 550 or something almost done.",

And we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe with tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And of course, that hasn't happened yet this year. So that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting -- continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion. And so we're seeing -- the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration, but that's sort of working as we would have hoped. And so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher for longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing, both from internal migration and possibly from other effects. And at the end, as we always say, we're going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.",

    "text": "Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes, some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks. But some of them are very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes on the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is -- you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum. And it's therefore, in some sense, non-optimizable. So we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. There's what I -- sometimes I use the term costless optimization, where it's just technical fixes that don't affect revenue and don't require you to exit businesses. I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that's shareholder value disruptive, but it won't be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now that's one that we hope will be changed but is tricky because those are very long-duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So sorry, a bit of a long answer. But then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we've got to wait for that one because given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.",

No, but in all seriousness, I think our US economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with, I think, two quarters of negative 0.5% of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year. And that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth, I think, around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we’ve sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was, where am I seeing softness in credit. And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly or certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected. And then, of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank.

Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like $1 billion of the Fed and their preamble, they forgot about $1 billion of operational risk RWA.

    "text": "Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we were seeing very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization of revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it will probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period. In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better. So that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in wholesale, the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no lending, we have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth, but in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain.",

So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the consumer franchise for all the reasons that we've talked about. But I would also point out, sometimes we don't like the word overearning because right now, customers are happy, and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to compete effectively really comes back to a decade, two-decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches and the app and all the online services and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise, which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there, the fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment means that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.",

And then as a follow-up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments, you and Jamie, about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your noninterest-bearing deposits, I think, are around 28% of total deposits, which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the noninterest-bearing deposits going to interest-bearing or is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?",

It's a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing split is the best one to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between wholesale and retail, we've got some amount of noninterest-bearing in wholesale that's sort of the ECR product, and so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low rate paid across checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then, of course, even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings, to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and wholesale. And then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product-level reprice that may or may not happen at the moment in the future.",

As we think about the dynamics in higher for longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice.

So that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume is a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother. So when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product-level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it will be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now. And we think we can manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise. And we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships, and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle.

And I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward-looking. I guess what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that, I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, has this changed your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for your -- for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, this Basel III endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns.",

    "text": "Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple of pieces in there. So let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III endgame proposal? So short answer is we're not going to change that number today. But when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, it's not -- you have to start by acknowledging that, that is a major headwind to returns. In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right? We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator, denominator here. Okay. So say the numerator doesn't change, if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that, that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III endgame for a couple of reasons. One is we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that will be different in consumer and in wholesale. Some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level. But that hopefully can mitigate some of it. But of course, the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy, and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we surprised ourselves on those points in the past. So we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things, and we may exit things. But I wouldn't necessarily assume that, that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder disruptive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what I mean. So that's that. And then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation, and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine. And we're building a lot of capital, and we were managing capital conservatively. And we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do. But that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impact on the real economy.",

Between Q2, if you've never had, and how much the fiscal stimulus is going to continue at this rate before you have kind of [indiscernible] kind of factors. So I just -- I think you have to be very cautious. And of course, the dealer policies, I think, is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week. And we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems or interest rate problems. But usually, geopolitics presents itself as usually as a deep recession or a mild recession, a recession part of the world or markets going down a lot. And because markets do well is not a reason ever to say they're going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. I just -- but my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious [what you’re] (ph) facing.

And market make -- but the really important thing is market making is a critical function. And if you look at the world, only so many large market makers who can make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone and all those various things to buy and sell for their clients in size, and market makers have a different function than hedge funds. And I don't know what the real intent was with this, this is another one, I think, needs to be really thought through. What are you trying to accomplish? We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market [shock] (ph) or something like that. But the other thing about market making, I do agree it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions, which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints for the LCR, SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations on what you can do.",

In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you see these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while, of course, there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term, directly sensitive to the revenue environment, and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes. But other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle, but they're long-term plays. And you really shouldn't expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower cost in response to a lower revenue environment, where we didn't balloon the cost when the revenue became, as we've argued, unsustainably high.",

Some of the same dynamics that we just talked about, in particular, overearning on deposits or sort of above-normal deposit margins also apply to First Republic franchise to some degree.

I think empirically the number is maybe a little higher than that, just because even though we do model lags in the EAR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger, but just crudely, I think, as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive.

So I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into CDs. But maybe a little non-intuitive, if you're kind of trying to do beta-type math with change in rates and change in rate pay, it gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then in terms of balances. Yes, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider that QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues, and that long growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So I kind of agree with you that this environment is, at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",

So whether you believe it or not is a separate issue. But I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling, obviously we always worry about the tail scenarios is a very strong labor market.

I know we've been through this before, two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So if you could just upfront give us visibility. How much of that is due to incentive pay? How much is that due to tech? How much is that due to AI? And what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pickup? Thanks.",

    "text": "Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And - yes, and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our card products and so that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy and CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts, we had an 8% growth in active card accounts, and over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem, as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our long-standing and pre-existing innovation economy strategy. So we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes for the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor, as well as, again, to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt, that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect. Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses. And that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features, and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So that's happening throughout the company, both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say, actually, in closing, talking about technology, which I think is interesting, that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.",

But I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So I think that - I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves, in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way. It's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.",

    "text": "Yes, good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus, and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT all else equal is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset helpfully by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's - the market's expectation is that the QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So - and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down with the shrinkage in system-wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.",

    "text": "Yes, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps higher, and the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there have been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change. So sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates and therefore waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So that can go both ways. And then M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple of nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year, and so that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024 all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pickup in deal flow and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.",

I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C suites, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So there's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.",

So I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is, this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So it is a meaningful shift in the environment. It's something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head to head with the private credit providers and these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution. And we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So that's been a priority. And we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB, with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.",

I'm assuming because you'll have a full year in '24 First Republic, that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or - I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.",

So one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period on period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so we really focused on having our guidance be firm-wide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of things that you said. So again, I don't want to get into like micro validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math, but we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EAR for my response to the prior question, because that EAR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of their various dynamics. And so I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.",

If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of - that pulled to par happens quite quickly and therefore probably juice the 2023 number a little bit.

Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so is this suggesting we could be towards the higher end of that range or even expanding above that?    And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%.

For those who don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode. And to remind all of us how lucky we are to be here, but Betsy in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20-plus years have been exceptional. So on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back. I'm thrilled to have you here.    And so you're asking a pertinent question. So we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we increased the dividend. And if you ask me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like 1/3 of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera.   I think the far more important question is the 15%. So look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it. That basically will prepare us for the total Basel endgame today roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.    Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short run or the long run. But -- and it looks like Basel III endgame may not be the worst case, it will be something less than that. So obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say on the order of $20 billion or something like that.    And yes, we're -- we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first. And we pay the dividend, the steady dividend. Build the business. And if we think it's appropriate, to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a year. I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices.    I think you've all heard me talk about the world and things like that. So waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully, we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all.    But in the meantime, there's also -- it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce our CET1, too.

    "text": "Yes, a good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is not really. So as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend that is driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise. That continues. We continue to capture that money in motion at a very high rate. So we're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and the level of engagement that we're seeing.   I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash-sorting? We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume they're in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively 0 and the policy rate is above 5%, that you're not going to see ongoing migration.   And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where -- even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So it's quite conceivable.   And this is actually on the yield curve that we had in the fourth quarter that had 6 cuts in it, we were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So I would say no meaningful change in the trends, and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there. ",

So I mean, I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now, but the snap from quarter end had roughly 3 cuts in it.   So it's the current yield curve. It's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from card revolve growth, which, while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin.   And then there's obviously the wildcard of potential product-level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace.   And you know this, obviously. But in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively 0, relatively small changes in the product-level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So the error bands here are pretty wide. And we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing. ",

The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low. But the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out -- not running out, but normalizing. And you see credit normalizing a little bit.   And of course, higher-income folks still have more money. They're still spending it. So whatever happens, the customer's in pretty good shape. And they're -- if you go into a recession, they'd be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books drop, their profits are up.   But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year, look at 2 years or 3 years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera.

And the other thing I want to point out because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, one thing you projected today based on what -- not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed. But these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen? Like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera, then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens.   And I just think the chance of that happen is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome.

Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want.   But if you think of real estate, there's 2 pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve, the whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%. All assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. But it's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect.   The second thing is the why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and filling things out. And other financial assets.   If that happens because we have stagflation, well, that's the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies. You are going to have more companies cutting back. You are going to have less leases. It will affect -- including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that people haven't really experienced since 2010.   So I'd just put in the back of your mind, the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone -- the real estate will muddle through.   Obviously, it'd be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all that, but people will muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tougher on a lot of folks, and not just real estate, if in fact that happens. ",

    "text": "Right. So interesting framing of the question, Erika. So I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're overearning, right? So obviously, one major area is that we're overearning in deposit margins, especially in consumer. And that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid.   So I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also heard Jamie say that we're overearning in credit. I mean, wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have built for that. So in the current run rate, a bit less clear, the extent of what we're earning.   And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized, essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the overearning narrative.   Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital and so on. And you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III endgame.   At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day. So we might not have that much more to say, except to reiterate what I've said in the past, which is that whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize. We will seek to reprice. We will adjust in various ways as to the best of our ability.   But given the structure of the rule, as proposed at least, there -- a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so in the base case, you have to think of it as a headwind. ",

And I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, equity markets have been under a little bit of pressure the last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there, and that always helps.   Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there.   But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic, and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so we caution a little bit there about pull-forward, which is even more acute, I think, on the DCM side, given that quite a high percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year has gotten done in the first quarter. So that's a factor.   And then the question of M&A, I think, is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A but also because of its knock-on impact on DCM through acquisition financing and so on. And there's the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there, and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect.   I don't know. I've heard some narratives that maybe there's like some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this. So I don't know. We're fundamentally, as I said I think on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter, happy to see momentum in announced M&A.

    "text": "Yes, a really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period.   And while that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here? For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower 0 bound and a sort of more normal dynamic in global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the foreign exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting.   And so all of that creates risk management needs, and active managers need to grapple with it and so on and so forth. So I think that those are some of the themes on the Markets side at the margin. And yes, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say. ",

So I think he left the call in my hands for better or for worse. So -- but let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here.   I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that, right? If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that's not only a problem outside the U.S. That affects the global economy and therefore the U.S. and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera.   So -- and in that context, keeping in mind what we always say, that we invest through the cycle, that we sort of go -- we don't go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges. We manage risks. We do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment.   But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had, which is its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated.   And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. It's -- we're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yes, I'm sure we'll give you more color and other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see. ",

So it's like 4 years ago at this point. So there's been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to grow with that.   So I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think, particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So you could see some mean reversion there.   And yes, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share. ",

    "text": "Sure. So I think the first thing to say, which is somewhat obvious, but I'm going to say it anyway, is that there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So that's point one.   Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. And it's a little bit hard to see it. And in our world, where we're guiding to, I guess now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that are being generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA in the company. That does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency.   And I think, to get to the heart of your question, which is, okay, in what type of environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So if you talk about like a normal recession with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans, which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective, assuming resilience through the cycle? No, we wouldn't.   Could there be some environments that, for whatever reason, change the business case for certain investments or even certain businesses that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short term. ",

    "text": "Yes, sure. So let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of a concept that's kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital, for lack of a better term.   And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability, at least in theory, to deploy portions of that with kind of like -- into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason in what might be thought of as a tactical sense.   So he's just pointing out that, that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue. There's just too many moving parts there.   But for sure, one thing that's true is that higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago is linked also to a higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, G-SIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business.   And we don't just chase revenue. We go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it, and we will. So we still are operating under multiple binding constraints, and obviously, the environment is complex. So the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always.   But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position, which is in no small part in anticipation of all of the uncertainty. But it does also mean that, if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. ",

You can look at it a lot of different ways, inflation cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture.   There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect where in the -- while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest-income cohorts, within that, there's obviously a probability of distribution, and there's some -- or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some such people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit, unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared, which is sort of aggressive levering up.   So I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the read-across is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets.

    "text": "Right. So I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads, including secondary markets, and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they're exceptionally tight.   So I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would have had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening that -- in secondary markets.   That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leveraged lending space in the normal way that it does in that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool. And you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms, which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So you are seeing a little bit of that.   I think that away from the leveraged lending space, in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think in no small part as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, we were seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived the last few weeks, and it's always a little bit hard to observe in any case.   But I would say broadly the dynamics or the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive, and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot.

I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, now you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that, that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas. And that's part of the franchise, and it's all good at some level.   But narrowly on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say for us, the strategy there is very much to be product-agnostic, actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? What does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silos. So you have -- you need underwriting skills, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do, and we're really good at it.   And increasingly, what you see actually is that as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk.   And so in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. At the same time, the syndicated lending space, being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution, other aspects of how that business works.   So we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none. And so we're looking forward to the future here. ",

But I do think that kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So let me go through the pieces.   So yes, the current quarter's results annualize to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion, which was very front-loaded as a result of short-dated assets. So that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective, you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect.   There was maybe an embedded question then there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet, and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectation for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal for a couple of reasons.   One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumed that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers.   It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal, including the FDIC and so on and so forth.   So yes, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie. ",

Like you obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question.   Like as we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store. And right now, we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise, despite the uncertainty about the Basel III endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it.   I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders. And obviously, there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth.   And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal, for the system to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess that's probably as much as I have on that. ",

    "text": "So, I wanted to start off with a question on capital. Just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus a 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?",

    "text": "Right, okay. Thanks Steve. And actually before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that you know before the Basel III endgame proposal, we had a 17% through cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and you know, it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here, but in reality, we don't know anything -- you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made subsequent week at an industry conference. So maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirements. So after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the Capital one way or another is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. You know, growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the Board's announced intention to increase it to a $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year, so that's a testament for our performance and that is a return of capital. And then finally buyback, but that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we said here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it is kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patients. So given all that, putting it all together I'm sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store, as much as anything else.",

You've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII over earning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition, as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures. Deposit balances were also more resilient in what's a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating. Do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher?

    "text": "Yes. Interesting question, Steve. So let's talk about deposit balances. So yes I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, Q2 is still a bit of a headwind. Loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And RRP seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance, net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe, with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what. But I think it is definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the over earning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest completion data and so on, you could usually get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So we'll see how it goes. And in the end, we are kind of focused on just running the place, recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of over earning, whatever it is.",

And so -- and then if you talk about like the timing here, right? So you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released 3.3%, is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31, it may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation, we haven't used that word. What we know -- what we believe, rather, is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed’s disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma SCB, whatever it might conceivably be, you actually see once again, quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and -- another example of what we've said a lot over the years, that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So I'll leave it at that.",

We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So I think the larger point is just that -- a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit, and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then the dividend, I think, we are always going to want to keep it in that like sustainable, and also sustainable in a stress environment. So that continues to be the way we think about that. And then at the end of it, it is buybacks. And Jamie has been on the record for over a decade, I think over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation, and price is a factor.

    "text": "Yes. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean we are happy to see the progress. People have been talking about [depressed] (ph) banking fee wallet for some time, and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop on the low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialogue and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So as the dialogue on ECM is elevated and the dialogue on M&A is quite robust as well. So all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So on the DCM side, yes, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull forward, and therefore we are reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to for example, acquisition finance. So the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refi, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at [remove] (ph), you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs, for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect. And that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that as has been widely discussed, that extent to which the performance of the large industries is driven by like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases, people still have concerns about that. So those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that, over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And yes, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out.",

And when you look in there, specifically, for example on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments, where you see a little bit of rotation of the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. But the effects are really quite subtle, and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we are seeing, which, while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth.

I think -- I guess one way the environment is evolving a little bit is that as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing kind of like not that many deals. So the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated lender finance market making their way into the private market as well, is sort of people realize that even in the private market, you probably need some of those protections in some cases. Which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So it is maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether we are doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before. And at the time, my answer was that I haven't heard much about that trend, and that continues to be the case.

So clearly, it is true that empirically, we've behaved like very asset sensitively in this rate hiking cycle, and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near-term. But when we look at the fund's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both like the [EAR type lens] (ph), the short-term NIR sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital from higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple of times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're walking in 5.5% rate. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on.

    "text": "Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess the way I think about it is a couple of things. Like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So if you kind of build yourself out a full year forecast and make reasonable space on your own, or analyst consensus or whatever, and you think about the fourth quarter, better look at this on a full year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers, and you obviously have to strip out kind of the onetime items. And so if you do that, like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number that's higher than 17%. So yes, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of the expected higher deposit costs. That's -- we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very supplemental model of the company, you would have like expenses grow -- revenue is growing at some organic GDP like rate, maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background -- you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So as much as our discipline on expense management is, as tight as it always has been, the inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There is still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of in part, the normalization of NII. And then the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.",

I guess I sort of -- I guess I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forwards is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like I mean people have different views about the so-called term premium. And obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw, when rates were at Zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of -- many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM and extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies -- is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offside from the capital and other perspectives. So there are some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of -- earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII, but that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.",

    "text": "Yes. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So let me try to unpack it to the best of my abilities. So -- in no particular order. One thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually, is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of -- and we prefer the right to sort of change that at any time. So I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief. And so I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the [Q] (ph) also, but I'm just going to say that again. So that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we are always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks, is a reasonable thing to do when you are generating your kind of capital. And so we were talking before about this $2 billion pace, we're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 million, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made, that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and liquid large cap financial stock, i.e. Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So we talked about, Jamie talked about as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM, and that's what we did this quarter. So that is why the 4.9% is a little higher. And it's consistent with my comments at our Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks. And beyond that what you are left with is answer to Steve's question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we are generating these types of earnings and there is this much organic capital being generated, in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend, if we don't return the capital, we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio, the levels of which -- if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They're just artificially high and unnecessary. So one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It's just that we don't feel now is the right time.",

But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? I mean how are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment, and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits. And the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So if you think about it in the wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So we do continue to expect that migration to happen, and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business. And some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we are encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So big picture. I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing, and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now.

I think the C&I charge-off rate we are seeing 10 years was something like literally zero. So that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number, I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across bankers and the risk team, that's not -- we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic.

And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So who knows what it will actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.",

That is basically client activity primarily secured financing related sort of matchbook repo type stuff and similar things that are -- grows up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore quite low RWA intensity. So while our ability the supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA, and therefore capital intensive, and therefore it doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yes, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand. Meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts, and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth that's going to make sense. And so we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we are going to do is have the excess capital mean that we lean in to lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So there is always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally. And frankly, that is in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient.

    "text": "Yes, sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together, the best of my ability. So as we sit here today, the biggest single driver is of the sequential declines is in fact, that we're expecting, is in fact the yield curve. So that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the starting the cutting cycle. It feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield seeking behavior, that has come down quite a bit. So that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix, where with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as you move to wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there. And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So maybe I'll, well I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter. And as you may recall at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happened. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes, obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines at NII ex-markets. But the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, card revolve growth, and other factors can return us to sequential growth. Obviously, we're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you, you know, a bit of a framework to work with.",

I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items, and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion, and for next year it was $90 billion. So that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. And it was because we thought that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So I'm happy to expand more on that. But anyway, to expenses, yes, so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, you know, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against, so that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers, because of the seasonality of incentive comp, but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so there's some manualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed. Like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously we're in the third quarter now and not the fourth quarter. In the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until investor day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on the NII.",

So obviously a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EAR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from 2.8 to about 2.1 if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to expand as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio.

As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone's trying to figure out the over-under for net interest income next year? So maybe a two-part first question. The second being inspired by what Jamie just said number one, you know, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in ‘25, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, like we have no idea what the curve is going to look like, right? I mean, it's gyrated so much. And so, as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end, but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?",

But let me answer the beginning of your question and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex-markets to be currently at 87%, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now, that consists of, I already mentioned previously, that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year. So you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate. You've got some sequential declines. You've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full-year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves, resumed in the back half of the year, both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve over that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought I mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year, but still a tailwind. You know obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Now…",

A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EAR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EAR, which is what we disclosed. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EAR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question, which is a little bit about the front end versus the back end. So what you see is that actually the front end EAR has gotten smaller and most of the EAR is now in the back end. So it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin from the context of next year's numbers, a headwind -- would be a headwind for us. We remain asset-sensitive to Fed cuts.",

Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital. And it's a deployment in a different way because you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road, you need capital supports, the deposits and same for the innovation economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view and you -- in life, you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well-served by just waiting. And same thing with deploying capital, we can buy -- we can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple of billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also know what the real excess capital is yet. So we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it will be fine. And so that's where we are and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know, right? And we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point.

    "text": "Yes. So let me take time to cover this one because obviously, it is very -- become very important. People are talking about how they're growing and partnering, and things like that. And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical. I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best products and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unit tranche. It is more expensive and you're seeing little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending, but we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the things. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital, some of this already been paid-off, some are done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going at $10 billion, could be $20 million or $30 billion, not limited today. I will say today we're extending -- we will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more billion, we'll do it sole-handed or do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have -- and I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down, have to get permission for everybody because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. So you could -- and we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that. Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing. And we're going to different strategy. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients. Probably we could be more price-competitive. We can do some of the very specific thing and not the solution that fits the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it. And we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where the bank has to hold for things, with the insurance guys, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other business for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often. So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that. So I hope if any of the press is on, they heard this too.",

So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in Investment Banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as, to some degree, driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline.

But I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pickup in mortgage applications, tiny bit of pickup in refi and our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced, right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So I'm not -- it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.",

One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling, and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into non-discretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of new landing scenario economically.

And that applies to -- and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to Fintech’s. And in the market-making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, it's worked well in its current contract for a long time where some activities were inside the regulatory perimeter. And there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability, given the constraints of the current rule set.",

But we're not -- we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about dealer inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's hampered a little bit. But again, we do it -- remember for clients, so we are a large market makers in both sides of the markets for clients, both credit and treasuries. And a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they're both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're going to deploy more capital we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do it to service clients. So we're very conscious of it with the competition on both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10-years ago, talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that.

    "text": "Yes, it's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question in other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about and recognizing that, that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms' liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point is just another reason why it's important to look at the whole frame more holistically when we think about the regulatory response in the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of hikes, and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down. And that seems to be increasingly the consensus that, that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So final point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for a system-wide deposit growth, which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level.",

And also look at the volatility, it's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have -- I've already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy to the repo markets. And is it a good policy to think that every time that happens because you can do it very safely, fully collateralize all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace that, that happens, the Fed has to step in every time. I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there comes some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Feds got to stump in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you have to be very thoughtful about this. That's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1 and all these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again.

You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve and you've got balances, and balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential tailwind -- one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there is a reason that we emphasized the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation, which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech. The changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the [Technical Difficulty] I'm trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that, that number has historically and in the recent past been quite liability sensitive. So you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation.

And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firm-wide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside duration management and all those other factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits. But it -- we have not needed to reprice in order to retain bank relationships, which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits. As I mentioned, we're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the build-out and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number. So we believe there's a big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of like average annual share growth of the order of 30 or 40 basis points that we've seen historically, that's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer.",

And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and had all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough, we have enough excess. And given that we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near-term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal in order to arrest the growth of the excess, and that is our current plan, although I'll give you the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",

    "text": "Sure. I mean, the truth is, and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So we are seeing the results of our kind of high-certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities, in the Commercial & Investment Bank, we continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significant -- significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating and we throw resources against that stuff, as we do that. But broadly, the themes were very consistent. I think in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we've generated at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen, it happens every day in all the teams everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development and there's been a lot of focus on the development environment for them in order to enable them to be more productive, and so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of efficient -- a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization and so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. Now as Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So the fact that we've gotten to a peak and that it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency. Finally, though, what I would say is that, if you look at the headcount trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it's been for very good reasons and it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and our ability to run the company efficiently, but anytime you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we asked people at the margin to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So, we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat headcount and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams and reconsider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high-certainty investment and growth. So obviously branches and bankers and so on, and also critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.",

So backing off a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job supporting the economy that isn't reflexively anti-bank. It doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity. It uses data and it balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth. And the hope is that we got some of that and that also while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little bit less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III endgame, it's also G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors and that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis.

And the third is, I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the business team volcanized system we built, which has negatives and even the regulars will tell you that.

And so many of the larger corporates are accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets in some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near term.

So if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So obviously, from what we understand, if you print that somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by -- to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift.

    "text": "Right, Erica. Okay you are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. So let's try to address this not at too much great length. First of all, G-SIB; so yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter or fourth quarter. So while our current view of the G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures in various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal pattern. So not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other, but anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules and normal seasonality took us back under five. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute limitations deadlines that were coming up. So let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is what is our core view about -- and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator actually. What is our core view about -- if you just for the sake of argument assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analyses of like a flat numerator, up 5 numerator, up 10 numerator, up 20 numerator, I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator is a little less. And then guessing about our several case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7 and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",

So on the one hand, you're right, if you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which as we know is the one thing that we know won't happen, but if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And, you could draw the conclusion that means that the over-earning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated. For a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that for the time being, anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle, unclear, but I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year.",

Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are, where they are?

    "text": "Sure. Yes, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance would be acquisition finance, because that's been relatively muted as a function of the M&A environment. And if that picks up, you could see more there. Now those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long. So, whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever is a separate issue, but as we -- as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be -- it's decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite, still growing above-trend obviously, which is great and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates, rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So yes, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking, could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more on the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the greens, I think you know them, right, and they're aligned with our big longstanding investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So that's why we're pushing so hard on that front because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the markets business, inside investment banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level, we look great in any given region and any given sub-sector, we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.",

I don't actually recognize those numbers, but I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring a lot of new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So, the combination of the tail end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build-out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.",

So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there is what would appear to be a certain amount of front-loading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So, ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions. In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So, as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients is a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve, and also across the size of the clients, I think, smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So, that's a little bit of our read of the situation right now, but certainly a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now.

If the economy gets worse, credit loss will go up, volumes can change, yield curve can change, and we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him with -- how they're looking at their forecast today. They think it's about 50-50 for recession, so I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit loss will go up, and other factors will change, too. And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is, and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am, and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, you guys -- not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So, it's now up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that'll be 0% and negative 5% probably the next month. And then, you're going to hear a thousand companies report and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is, a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company, but I assume you see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So, people have to adjust this new environment. And I think you will see what it is. I just also want to point out just so you can round it up, this is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period $15 billion. And then, to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month -- three-quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stock will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",

It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience? And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you're going -- obviously, deterioration in outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?",

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the accident forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog-standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was some -- there were some big pending announcements and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information. And so, it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build. We use this weighted average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve, but obviously, the actual mechanisms are quite complex, the depth of any potential recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors it hits, idiosyncratic stuff and wholesale, there's a lot. I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So, if the labor market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does.",

I mean, we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them specifically in airline travel and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be -- have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So, you see people behaving rationally and I have noted even you hear anecdotes and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising. We have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So, it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of interested in the space is like what's happening by income then, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower-income segment. And I think when we look at our card data and also our cash buffers and people's checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower-income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower-income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin cash buffers are lower and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments, but actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower-income segment. So, no evidence of distress, I would say.",

The treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing US treasuries if those reforms are implemented?

We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which has deep flaws in them, to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks. It's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks -- the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't -- if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea, but every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So, they should make these changes. The reason why is when you have very -- lot of volatile markets and very widespread and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it, not as a favor to the banks themselves. And anyway -- and we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. It's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate the markets, help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no -- basically take not much more interest rate exposure.

I think our point is a little bit, as Jamie said in his Chairman's letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed and there are interactions among all these things, and we as a bank are not particularly bound by it.

We actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that.

Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws -- meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now. Yeah, so on wholesale loans, beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story. Now, we're seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional C&I loans in the current moment, but that's another hurdle there.

When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad.

But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you're seeing in DCM today, when you don't have bond deals, when you have less trading, when you have -- so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job, and we're here to help our clients.

So, the way I think about it is, there are some elements of the expense base, which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So, we talk about those as volume and revenue related expense. And so, you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyzed them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so, if, for whatever reason, the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust. Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling through our traditional long-term investment lens simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company. This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is, how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook. But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy. So that's a factor as well.

    "text": "Yes. So if I may complement the NII. In Europe, we have not seen the full repricing of our portfolio, obviously because, as you know, mortgages reprice every 12 months. So we still have a long way to go in the repricing of mortgages in Spain. Again, they are 12-month, Euribor based. And in Portugal is 6-month Euribor based. So we still have, again, way to go to reflect the full impact of the repricing or the rebasing of our portfolio in Europe. In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, as I said during my presentation, we expect cost of risk to remain fairly flat in 2023 relative to 2022, excluding the one-offs. The cost of risk in the first quarter was 4.4%. The €474 million provision that we took in Brazil in the first quarter to strengthen the balance sheet was used more or less one-fourth for one-off cases for specific cases and the rest it was just to strengthen our balance sheet. So in that sense, the 4.4% of the quarter is clean. It excludes one-off cases and it reflects the true asset quality evolution of the quarter. So for the rest of the year, as the interest rates are expected to remain high, we expect a better performance of our individuals portfolios because these are very short term. And obviously, they -- most of them have matured already, and we have been adding high-quality new vintages, but we might expect some more challenging evolution in the corporate sector. So again, all in all, excluding one-offs, more or less flat year-on-year.",

We have seen all the levels in deposits basically maintain themselves. Individuals probably is the most important part in which 80% to 85% of our deposits are basically individuals, families, et cetera, which are basically very solid and very stable, okay? In that regard, also, I mean, with all these times, you always be prudent about how you manage things. But I can tell you that our units are performing really well in that sense, okay? In terms of the deposits, it's always cyclical. The decrease in deposits was mainly in CIB as we described. It was actually not very meaningful to the total size of the portfolio, and we expect basically to get them back and is the normal flow of the business, okay?

    "text": "So back when -- in the first quarter, we had a drop of around €21 billion in CIB deposits in Europe. But that was seasonal. If you look at the fourth quarter, we had quite a strong increase, but again, this happens every quarter. This quarter was a bit more -- a bit higher than in previous quarters because we also grew a lot in deposits with our customers in Europe in the fourth quarter. So associated basically with year-end balance sheet performance. So this is not recurring and this is seasonal and -- but again, it doesn't really affect the structure of our deposits. We always try to take advantage of the opportunities. We had an opportunity in the fourth quarter, took advantage of that, is normalizing a bit in the first quarter of the year, but I would expect the seasonal behavior to happen every year. Betas. Where are we? So let me tell you where we are. In Spain, we have a -- in retail banking, beta today is 6%. Yield, average yield is 22 basis points. In CIB, in Spain, European branches and global CIB, betas are between 80% to 100%. So in Spain, if you look at the whole of Spanish balance sheet, the cost is 80 basis points with EBITDA of 25%. And this is -- we guided for the year to between 25% to 30%, still this will hold because, again, most of the CIB business has already repriced and we expect a slow increase in the repricing of retail banking, so still within the 25% to 30% for the year. U.S. beta is 35% at a cost of 1.67. Betas were a bit higher in the first quarter, not significantly higher and very much in line with the average of the system. In the U.K., beta is 25%. And in the first quarter, betas were 30% to 35%, we guided to around 50% for the year. So if we look at our interest rate sensitivity relative to the figures we gave at Investor Day, very much in line with Europe, and the U.S. and probably a better outlook in the U.K. Finally, ALCO. Yes, we expected more or less 16% -- sorry, €16 billion average in Spain. We are already there. We might be above -- a little bit above that, but it basically depends on the opportunities we see to gradually increase the size of the portfolio. Remember that we are very, very far from a neutral ALCO portfolio. We have a negative balance sheet, which is what we want to have. We gradually want to close that negative sensitivity. So actually buying an ALCO portfolio or rebuilding an ALCO portfolio in Spain is not just a matter of 2023, it's probably also a matter of '24 and even 2025. So again, we will react to what we see are the market opportunities.",

I mean, mostly, the majority of the portfolio will reprice in probably April and May, okay? So the portfolio is still repricing and we're going to see those impacts mainly in Spain exactly at that time probably to the mid through the cycle of the year and towards the end. It also is going to depend on what's happening with the deposit impact and how the market is basically going to react towards that. So in that sense, we'll see that. In the U.K., we're basically seeing things stable, okay? We basically see that we're still basically building up the way the portfolio has been going and also Portugal, we expect also to continue better towards the end of the year, okay? Also, the terms of what you were talking about growth in deposits in Mexico, you're right, is still lagging behind, okay? The growth in customers in Mexico is starting to peak. What is important to do in Mexico was actually to change the onboarding that we had with clients, okay? And that was part of the things that we needed in order to compete head-to-head against our competitors. So in that regard, you're going to see an increase on the deposit base in Mexico in the following quarters, given also the new payrolls that we have contracted that are coming into the portfolio. Also, you're going to see a very good increase in time deposits as basically the market has turned very competitive, and we will also be focused on profitability. What we've been doing in Mexico is mainly maintain our deposit base of individuals, while the costly deposits from corporates were basically leaving them aside also to have much better margins, okay?

In terms of cost of risk, we expect the cost of risk actually to be better than we expected at the beginning. What we saw a little bit some of the vintages on '22 started to being a little bit more complicated than we expected. But it's quite interesting to see that normally, when you see customers in those vintages started to get delinquent for more than 90 days, usually will repossess between 90% and 95% of the autos, okay? What's been happening and it has been quite surprising is that whenever we see the clients going delinquent beyond 90 days, we see that they basically are calling us restructuring and start paying us back. So we have seen a decrease of repos from around 90% to 95% to around 59% to 60%, okay? That's basically 30 points. That's why you see the cost of risk is getting much better in the U.S., okay? To your question basically of going back to pre-COVID levels, what's going on there is that we have changed the mix of the portfolio. Pre-COVID, we have a lot more in subprime and deep subprime. Today, we have a much larger part in the portfolio of prime and near prime in the business. So that's why the portfolio is never going to go back to the levels it had. Also in '19, we have Bluestone, okay? If you remember, we actually eliminated that JV back in 2021. And that was basically very complicated in terms of cost of risk. So that's another part of the portfolio is actually much better because of that, okay? So in that sense, we believe that the cost of risk in the U.S. even though is normalizing because it's going back to pre-COVID levels, it's not going to be as that as it used to be, but it's much better than we expected at the beginning, okay, to conclude.

What basically the EBA has ruled that minority interest in local currency does not need to be adjusted with the exchange rate because obviously, if capital is eventually used, let's say, Brazil, if capital is eventually used in Brazil, it will be used in reals, not in euros. So before this, the interpretation was that the capital needed to be adjusted through the exchange rate and now obviously, because the capital will be used in local currency doesn't need to be adjusted. That's a net between positives in some countries like Brazil and slightly negative in some countries like Mexico, where the currency has appreciated net-net, 13 basis points. U.K., okay. So in the U.K., yes, we still have around €100 billion structural position, which will help NII going forward. We would expect mortgages to go down this year more or less around 5%. So volumes a bit down in the year, but very positive NII sensitivity to rates, and we still think rates might go up a little bit. So we would expect NII to go up mid-single digits, probably a bit more than mid-single digits. So that's the expectation for this year in the U.K.",

Remember, we said €1.7 billion using the forward rates -- forward curve rates as of December. In the first quarter, the curves have remained after having moved up and down, they are basically where they were at the end of December. So we would still expect for the next 12 months, a sensitivity similar to the one that we have experienced in the first quarter and in line with that guidance we gave because as Hector explained, we would see the repreciation of our mortgage books in Spain and in Portugal to gradually gain speed throughout the year.",

The first is essentially, if we take your Q1 numbers and the clean underlying number you provided, and we just basically add up till the end of the year, we would reach €11 billion profit in 2023, where consensus is well below that. Where do you see consensus being too conservative on your -- on the estimates for 2023?And two clarifications. The first is on Brazilian cost of risk. You indicated a flattish evolution excluding one-offs. I just want to make sure I understood correctly that the €474 million charged on provisions this quarter is not a one-off. And so the guidance you're giving is at 4.4% to 4.5% cost of risk in 2023. The second is again on the guidance you have given before. I didn't understand it was related to NII growth or volumes when you said Mexico up double-digit, U.S. down mid-single digit and Brazil up low-single digit. Thank you.",

    "text": "Okay. So let me take consensus and the cost of risk in Brazil, and I will try to clarify that. What is consensus below where we think we might be, I think we are a bit more constructive on fees, and I think the first quarter shows a very good performance of fees, basically on the back of the contribution of our global businesses. You've seen in the presentation that our global businesses, CIB, Wealth Management, PagoNxt, they're doing very, very well. Also, cost of risk, we guided for lower than 1.2% cost of risk. We are at 1.05% in the first quarter, probably the market is a bit skeptical about our capacity to keep cost of risk under control. So those, I think, are the two -- this is a bit on NII, but it's not significant and a bit on cost. So generally, I think its provisions and fees. Cost of risk in Brazil. So the €474 million is not in the P&L and that has been used to reinforce our balance sheet in Brazil, around one-fourth of that for one-off cases and the rest is just a generic strengthening of our balance sheet in Brazil. So the 4.4% cost of risk in the first quarter is clean in the sense that it doesn't have any one-offs for specific cases. From now on, as I said, I would expect if interest rates remain at 13.75% until after the summer, probably we are going to see cost of risk drifting upwards because of the gradual deterioration of the corporate sector, but by no means in excess of the cost of risk we had last year. So that's why we are saying more or less cost of risk in line with 2022, excluding the one-off, which is already excluded in the provisioning number in the first quarter. I think that clarifies my comments. And then on Mexico.",

On Brazil, could you just clarify that last year's cost of risk, excluding one-off was around 460, 470 basis points, I think. Another question on the Polish FX saga. Do you expect there to be more provisions to come for the Polish Swiss franc mortgages and lastly, one question on the regulatory outlook.

The other -- the previous vintages are basically performing quite well, okay? The thing is there are a couple of things. First of all, if you remember with the stimulus, we actually dropped quite a lot the amount of provisions that we had. What we're having right now is we're having to make some of the provisions that the portfolio needs to have in order to basically be in the same level that we need to be with IFRS, okay? IFRS, as you understand, the new definition of the folder was put in place two years ago didn't hit us as much in the U.S. because the portfolio was performing completely different, okay? So when you turn that portfolio to IFRS, the NOD, the new definition of default basically requires you to create a lot more provisions even though you may not need them because the portfolio is performing well beyond 90 days, okay? I don't know if I'm explaining it correctly because it's quite complicated. So what I'm trying to tell you that IFRS does not see that the portfolio could be so irregular in the way it performs, okay? So normally, a portfolio in Europe beyond 90 days, et cetera, will be -- I mean, go for repossession. A portfolio in the U.S. is not performing exactly like that. It's actually beyond 90 days is performing much better, and the client might pay you one installment, two installments, and then would pay you, not to pay you one installment and they will pay again, et cetera, okay? So that's why you see those differences and the movements in the provisions on the car prices. Even though you're right, car prices are better than -- much better than we expected, and the Manheim is actually at better levels.

Brazil we will give you a comment on capital and then Jose will tell you a little bit about what's going on with increasing RWA, okay? In terms of the Brazil margin quarter-on-quarter, as we say, basically is explained by the following: our launch since 2021, we have become much more conservative and growth – grown volumes very selectively changing the loan mix to lower risk. Okay? So we mainly get out - we're out of credit cards. Went on to Consignado, auto loans and mortgages.  On deposits also the fast increase in rates has meant a rapid rise in the cost of deposits, okay, as well as a change of the mix on the deposits. Rates are staying higher for longer has prevented the cost of deposit from coming down impacting NII. Remember that in Brazil, we have negative sensitivity to rates, okay? So Brazilian NIIs in the second quarter of ‘23 is already flat. Okay?  As we set and Jose was very precise on that the worst since behind us and we are already seeing a reduction on the average cost of deposits and we also see an improved customer spread. Okay? So we expect NII in the second half of ‘23 to be higher than the first half of the year leading to a flat NII in the year with a substantial improvement in ‘24, okay?  In terms of the cost of risk, not only the macro outlook is improving, but since ‘21, I just – I explained, we've been very selective in the approach of the new lending extension and focusing to more secure and higher rate customers as I explained, okay? This is showing good results and we believe the worst, as I said, it repeatedly is worst - sorry the worst is behind now.  Cost of risk in the second quarter is already improving, versus the first quarter and the vintages are showing really good performance as we have seen. So we don't expect cost of risk that will deteriorate in Brazil in ‘23 versus ‘22, excluding the one-off that which implies staying close to around 4.6%, okay? And then, to be on capital to be very precise, we expect to generate at least 10 basis points of organical capital on average per quarter with the current shareholder remuneration policy that we put in place.  As a result, we will be on track to meet our target to be above 12% even when the final implementation of BASEL III comes into effect on January 1st on ‘25, okay?

Half of that growth is due to FX as we consolidate the Latin America, basically, the peso and the Brazilian based assets in to the Group. Of the other half, half of the other half, so a substantial amount corresponds to a stock finance.  And this is due to the recovery of the new auto business in Europe. This will eventually translate into auto loans. So, this is obviously short term that will eventually lead a higher profitability going forward. When we look at the outlook, as Hector said, we don't expect any significant regulatory or supervisory capital impacts in the second half of the year.  We see no inorganic charges in the second half of the year. Obviously, it looks like the available for sale portfolio valuation also will stay relatively stable. We see improving profitability, as we have mentioned, particularly driven by higher NII in the second half. An increased weighted assets should be probably under control.  So net-net, we see a stronger capital - organic capital generation in the next couple of quarters again, leading to a capital that will remain well above 12% every quarter and building up sufficient capital to be above 12%, post BASEL III.",

And this is basically on the back, use prices continue to be strong, okay, as I explained and declining at slower pace that we previously anticipated. The changing out to loan portfolio mixed of our subprime, do you remember that I told you that before 2018, we had a lot more subprime than Prime and the change on the mix has helped.  Also, we have robust and better than expected labor market in the US, okay, which is sustaining that, okay? And out of customers that are delinquent exactly as I was explaining in the first quarter for more than 90 days are rolling into charge of status at historical low levels, okay? Normally, they were above 90%, 95%. Last quarter they were around 59%, this quarter around 67% percent, okay?  So it's still much better than we expect and much better than it was actually happening pre-COVID, okay? And in 2023, we expect cost or risk to continue on the normalization at around 2%. And after two years of artificially low figures given COVID et cetera, as I was saying, normalized levels should be below pre-pandemic, cost, or risk at around - you remember, pre-pandemic was around, 285, it’s never going to get there, okay? Because of the change of mix and what I was explaining, okay? In terms of the Spain, okay?  In Spain, the deposits, I mean continued to be stable, okay, I at around, we have around €299 billion, okay? We have excess liquidity in Santander Spain, LTVs around 78% as is the case for the whole Spanish system that is around 80%. Quarterly the claim is most linked to CIB deposits, flat in retail in the quarter despite the early repayments of mortgages, okay. 60% compared to the same period of 2022 and increased volume of deposits moving off-balance sheet products.  Also, what we see between the first half of ’23 versus the first half of ‘22 is plus 0.9% okay? So we have a different change of the mix with time deposits going up at around 61% up year-on-year, while demand deposits are going down around 5% on the back of the higher rates, driven by the growth of CIB, which allows us to maintain also - and maintain a stable net liquidity position, okay?

And then we have 60 – sorry, €30 billion with reprices with a six months €40 billion with a three months and €65 billion with one month. So, we would still expect significant repricing upwards in the first half of next year, as interest rates in Europe may go up once or twice, but as they stabilize, we will still have significant repricing of a big chunk of the portfolio in the first half of next year.  So obviously, the asset yields are expected still to expand well into 2024. Obviously, margins will depend on the cost of deposits but as Hector said, we are not seeing any pressures today to increase their remuneration of retail deposits. We are already paying almost ULIBOR for CIB deposits, institutional deposits, but we don't see any pressures on the retail side of deposits, which means that probably the peak in net interest margins will not happen until well into 2024 in the Eurozone.

It was driven mainly by higher rates on the strong focus on managing the spreads and profitability. Although the UK tends to be more competitive than other Europeans markets as you know, okay?  So we're putting profitability ahead of market share, okay? And we have a lower risk appetite, but we're expecting good performance to continue leading to and NIM expansion, okay? So, we expect it to stabilize towards the second half. Okay, 2023 with a high-single-digit growth on higher rates. And despite the lower volumes that we have because of what I just explained about profitability, okay?  In the second quarter, NII was flattish. Okay? Higher yields on loans did not offset the higher cost of retail funding and the slowdown in new originations, okay? In terms of the betas, Jose will tell you afterwards that I tell you about what's going on in the U.S.  In terms of the U.S., overall, as you have seen has one better than expected given the change of mix towards prime, okay as I explained in detail, lower yield, but also better risk profile and the lower grade provisioning is helping us, okay? NII is flattish in the quarter and year-on-year on funding pressures on the wholesale and retail as you know, a lot of this is funded by wholesale, as well and a common trend across the sector which has been partially offset by higher yields that we have.  Santander, U.S. betas are above the what we expected but lower than the average of our peers. Just to give you exactly what's going on. And we expect NII to be down mid-single-digit on lower originations and also the higher funding pressure again in line with the peers.  However, given the strong behavior that we have on the labor market and seeing the performance on the first half, the US NII could do better than we expect, okay? U.S. NII is not the only one that has a cost of risk and profitability, are also better than expected in the country, okay? So Jose, I don't know, if you can comment on the betas please. ",

We still think that that will continue. So the UK is a market with less excess liquidity than Spain for instance. So we would expect as Hector said, margins probably - they were stable in the second quarter relative to the first and we would expect them to remain more or less flattish in the third and probably slightly going down from there.  In the US, as Hector said, we kept our deposits flat, paying less than our regional bank competitors. The beta in the U.S. is 36.8%, up two percentage points quarter-on-quarter. So after the spike that we saw in February, March, the betas in the US have remained very stable. And we are actually increasing deposit market share at a lower cost than our competitors. ",

In the Spanish loan book, the dynamic that we have seen is quite clear, okay? We have seen low demand of credit, okay, which is impacting us a little bit, mainly also we have seen an increase on the prepayment mainly on the mortgages, okay?  Because of the increased rates, remember that a lot of a big percentage of our portfolio is some variable rates and floating rate. So in that sense, that’s the dynamic that we have seen. And also we have seen due to the increased rates, the corporates and the SMEs being more cautious in new credit demand, okay? And the dynamics, we lived throughout the year continuing that way, let's see what happens at the beginning of the year. And also, if we can see more confidence a little bit on investment, okay?

As I said, we don't expect any headwinds significant headwinds from any of the three big components that could affect capital regulatory or supervisory charges, inorganic charges or other charges basically market-related pensions, intangibles, we don't see significant headwinds in the second half of the year.  In terms of BASEL III, we have seen the proposal. It’s still a proposal. So we need to wait to see exactly how is - how the regulation is approved. We still think we will have an impact of between 40 to 60 basis points, probably and again depending on how this is finally written, probably towards the lower end of that range, if things are confirmed when the final proposal is approved.  In terms of the accounting, well, I think Investor Relations will give you more details about - this is pretty detailed. But in the first half, there is no impact or no adjustments between net interest income statutory and underlying zero. What happened in the first quarter is, we had an positive adjustment of €211 million and we have reversed exactly the same amount in the second quarter, which by the way in terms of the €20 billion, it's a very small amount.  So, no adjustments to NII in the first half. What we added to underlying in the first quarter was reversed in the second quarter. There are other adjustments in the P&L, but basically netting out in most cases will happen in the first quarter in the second quarter.

So to start, I mean, Brazil NII, okay, performance in the recent quarter has explained first of all on loans in 2021 I have been very specific on that. We have become very much conservative and we have changed the mix, okay?  And we have grown volume selectively, okay, changing the loan mix the low mix – the loan mix to lower risk on deposits, okay. The fast increasing rates, means a rapid rise in the cost of deposits, okay. We expect NII in the second half of ‘23 to be higher than in the first half of the year leading to a flat NII in the year with a substantial improvement in ’24, okay? If we see that the rates basically start to come down because it's very important to understand that Brazil has negative sensitivity to the, we should gain traction. And we maintain, we're going to maintain our cautious stance, but we believe that we can go back to the market, okay? And we believe that the functional rates could fall in the second half, bringing the cost down in retail funding, okay?  And then in the drivers of NII in Spain and Jose will give you more details. Spain is one of the countries that has benefited most from the higher rates, okay? We will continue to see strong growth in clients. Just in the first half of the year we have 300,000 more active clients, okay? NII in Spain is up around 57% in the first half of the year and 60% just alone this second quarter is mostly supported by the pricing of the loan portfolio.  The height yields and remain contained on the cost of deposits. So, we have been managing very well in that sense. We expect double-digit growth for NII in 2023 and regarding the peak of NII in Spain, there are several things to consider that Jose will explain you as this will continue to reprice at least during the first half of ’24, clients which we expect will continue to grow and betas, which will be key. We're still seeing a rational competition with low betas for individuals in a system which remains highly liquid, okay?

The ALCO in Spain we have €27 billion ALCO, €21 billion is a structural long-term held to collect with an average maturity of - duration of 7.7 years on a yield of 3.3%, 3.4%. And then we have €6 billion which is more associated with short-term liquidity management average duration of 1.2 years and yields slightly below at 3%.  We expect to continue increasing the amount of the ALCO portfolio in Spain to gradually reposition the balance sheet towards a lower positive sensitivity because as interest rates start reaching a peak, we don't want to run a balance sheet with such huge positive sensitivity to rates. So one way of doing that is not the only we are also taking other measures, but one way is obviously increasing the ALCO portfolio.  In terms of betas, the beta for deposits in Spain is 17.8%. If we exclude CIB, by the way this is three percentage points higher than in the first quarter. If we exclude CIB, the beta is 9.5%. The beta in CIB is around 60%.

Okay, we're talking about that in the blended provisions that we have we are provisioned up to 58%, okay, of the outstanding that we have, okay and we believe that's enough to sustain exactly what needs to be done over there given the dynamics that we have seen in the market, and if you basically changing towards lot these when the these mortgages just started be about there, okay?

This basically, we have had prepayments up to €6.5 billion so far this year. And you're right. SMEs and mortgages basically have been not demanding credit as much. I believe people are being cautious in the way and trying to see how the economy evolves, even though employment has continued to be strong and demand continues to be strong. This is a fact, and we have seen the clients basically being cautious.  Nevertheless, if you see our portfolio in the rest of the countries, mainly Latin America has continued to grow. There, we have been maintaining and being very, very cautious in credit appetite, but also very focused on profitability. So we're growing the portfolio in Latin America in a very good way, but in a profitable way.  And also, you have seen that DCB has increased and has a substantial good development during the year, and we will continue to see that over the next few months. So all in all, we are 2% below in loans this year, but we foresee that once clients basically see that rates are starting to stabilize and the market basically has a more clear view of what's going on, I believe that credit will come back, little by little.

And how do you see profitability in 2024? It would be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing into next year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the U.S.  My second question is with respect to asset quality in the U.S. There was a big uptick this quarter, and you've been talking about normalization in cost of risk. And now we've seen lower used car prices and higher delinquencies, but neither of them were material changes. So the question is what's driving this?

    "text": "Yes. Thank you, Antonio. Okay. On profitability, as I said during the presentation, I reiterate the 15% RoTE. So that basically gives you the numbers that you're looking for, okay? So in that sense, we're pretty comfortable on that. On '24, as I basically said, we see also the portfolio repricing. So we see a strong first half of the year in Europe. And then we see a strong second half of the year in Latin America when we see basically the dynamics changing. And you have seen that and you've seen that in the numbers of this quarter when basically you have seen Latin America basically performing better, okay? So in that sense, that can give you a very good idea and Jose will give you more details on that.  In terms of asset quality in the U.S., and I've been saying all along that in the past few quarters, it's very important to understand that it's always seasonal. If you take a look at what happened last year, in the third quarter, it was actually the same and we expected that, and we told you so. And -- but it's important to tell you that it's actually better than we expected. And also it's not going to go beyond the 200 basis points, as you correctly pointed.  In that sense also, we see that the portfolio is performing better in the sense that we see that people with 90-day delinquencies or above when it used to happen is we used to repossess about more than 90% of those cars is basically performing much better, and we are repossessing between 60% and 65% of those. If the threat continues like that and used car prices in the U.S. continue like that, we expect a better performance than we normally expect.  It's important that you understand that we have a completely different mix today in the portfolio. The portfolio that we had pre-COVID didn't have as much prime and near prime as we do today. Prime and near prime is at around 41% of the mix of the portfolio, though that basically tells you that we expect the asset quality to maintain at good levels. And also, the U.S. has been performing with a strong employment as well and the dynamic as well. So in that sense, I'm comfortable with the numbers we're giving you.

And we would expect cost of risk in 2024 to be fairly flat, maybe slightly up compared to 2023 in the U.S.  In terms of profitability, well, we have -- we still have negative sensitivity to rates in Latin America. So as rates start going down, we will see accelerated momentum in NII in Brazil, in particular, coupled with higher loan growth and flat or slightly improving asset quality.

We don't expect any significant change in the behavior in the market in the coming quarters. So we would expect the beta in Spain to gradually drift upwards, but very gradually, similar performance to what we have seen this year.  In the U.K., beta is 35%. If we look at the beta in the quarter is higher than that. It's around 50%. So here, we would expect higher -- gradually higher betas, but we are pricing assets also higher. The new mortgage pricing in the U.K. today is around 5.7%. So this is going to help withstand the slightly higher betas that we expect next year. For the rest of the countries, Portugal at 9%, Poland, 30%, and in the U.S., it's 32%. Ex-Corporate Investment Banking is 31%, very much in line with expectation, not much to comment on that.

So we're changing a little bit that the cost of risk is helping us out first of all, because our -- some of them -- the positions that we took, actually the credit loans that we gave are basically performing much better than we expected. And the mix also is helping us out because remember that the mix that we changed, went a little bit into payrolls and to secure loans, and the mix has also changed and it's getting better.  We're also seeing that the market is performing much better in terms of LLPs. So in that sense, we're opening it a little bit. I mean we're open to a little bit more or giving out loans in terms of going back a little bit to the credit card markets. We are performing very well, but our credit appetite is cautious, nevertheless, and we expect Brazil basically to perform really well in that sense. So you're going to see really growth in momentum also given that the rate is coming down, and we expect the rates basically to continue coming down over the next few months. So this is a double combination in terms of how we're managing the portfolio and second, because of the way the rates are moving in Brazil. So in that sense, I believe it's going to be much better.  In terms of the growth in cost in Spain, as you know, we have been implementing One Transformation. So with the implementation of One Transformation, we're spending a little bit to transform a little bit on processes, some things that we're doing and the way we're managing the bank in that sense. But -- and you're going to see a much better outcome in the next few months due to that fact because we are -- as you know, we are simplification -- we're doing simplification, dropping the number of products that we have, we are doing also automation of many different things, and we are pushing our branches basically to move more towards businesses than look at the incidents or problems.  So all that transformation that we're making in -- all that transformation that we're making is the one that is pushing us a little bit to spend a little bit more, but it's going to be in control, and we expect that to continue to drop in the next few months. So in that sense, I feel confident that we're going to be able to do that.  So in terms of in Brazil, going back to the -- to just to that -- just to tell you the second half is going to be much better than the first half of '24. As we continue to go on and we build up the portfolio, it's going to be performing much better. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement. ",

The other way around, actually, we are moving towards lowering the cost as much as possible in the organization. This is exactly what we're doing. It's very important to understand exactly what One Transformation means, which means exactly simplifying, first of all, and simplifying the amount of products that we have significantly. Second, basically automation of a lot of the processes, and this is mainly -- I'm talking about on the retail side, which is quite important, which means, for example, transformation in countries like Portugal, where we have already gone through a really good transformation, basically, now 10% of the things we do in a branch is basically operations and incidents and problems. 90% is taking care of the client.  In other countries, such as Mexico or Spain is 50% of that. So basically, this is what One Transformation means, and this is what we're doing. So simplification, automation, then we're going to come in with the platforms. You have seen a little bit what we've been doing with the different platforms that we're deploying, for example, merchant acquiring that has been deployed already mostly in Latin America. You see the cost coming down. And you see also that we are getting revenue on quota from our customers. So in that sense, it's very important that you understand what One Transformation is and why are we doing this.  Second, in terms of -- your second question was on operating expenses in the U.S. Okay, very important question. What we're doing in the U.S. is just a complement of the rest of our CIB business. What do I mean by a complement? We have become a very large player in CIB, I mean, large for the standards of Latin America and a very important player also in CIB in Europe. It's important to point out that 94% of our -- of the business that we do there basically is client-oriented. It's very important to understand that it's just 6% is trading. So it's client flow, your selling FX, your selling plain vanilla derivatives, is doing a lot of trade finance to our normal clients at midsize and SME clients.  And this is basically -- the only piece that we needed is basically was to complement the U.S. This is not in any means to really beef up our presence in CIB in the U.S. This basically will complement the rest of our business and also will give us capabilities in 4 or 5 particular sectors that complement the rest of the business that we do in Latin America and Europe, in the U.S., which, by the way, we were not making because we didn't have the capabilities. So it's not a huge thing vis-a-vis the size of the group, but it's important that it's going to be an important revenue generator. And you're going to see that revenue going to start to pick up in CIB pretty fast given that because it's already a complement, as I was saying, of the rest of the business. ",

However, going back to the Capital Markets Day, I remember that there was a way stronger emphasis on fee income and non-NII revenues, which seems to be underperforming a little bit or initial expectations. So could you elaborate on that? Is that the market momentum has weakened, but you see that being recovered in the future or simply that there's some -- you are running behind your initial plan?  And second, when you talk about the cost of risk seasonality in the U.S., could you explain a little bit better why is that? I mean why there is such a concentration in provisions in the third quarter? It will be helpful to understand.  And lastly, on reporting changes. I don't know if you can share that already, but when you're talking about the retail and commercial new global business line, could you explain if you plan to have also regional P&L and balance sheet for its subsidiary, which will be consistent with the consolidated global unit or we are not going to have that detail?

    "text": "Thank you, Carlos. I mean, I think it's important to understand basically the dynamics in the market. If you see the fees, for example, in the first 9 months, we grew 6% year-on-year. It's basically customer growth and the global network business is basically helping out, mainly CIB and payments. It's important to say that global and network businesses now contribute to around 42% of the total fee income. And by '25, that would increase from 42% to 50%. So basically, it's according to our plan.  It's important also that risk appetite increase is changing the portfolio mix. And volume growth and transactionality increase is going to help out. And we see also -- and you're going to see that it's going to complement the revenue. It's actually what you're asking. You're going to see a strong CIB that is basically up 15% year-on-year. PagoNxt is the payment side and merchant acquiring is up 12%. We have weaker wealth management that is around 1%, but it's market conditions, because exactly what's happening in the market.  The auto business is generating 5% more across the board. You see very good performance in Mexico and the U.S., and Europe is a little bit impacted by regulatory changes. And retail, you're going to see a growth of around 5% year-on-year because we had active customers coming in that are helping us out, mainly 2 million active customers that we didn't have. So in that sense, what I'm telling you is that we see that fees are going to starting to come up, also helping out by what's -- the dynamics that we see in South America and Mexico mainly. So in that sense, you're going to see that it's going to perform well.  And also, as credit picks up, that's also going to help us in the fee revenue. That's basically what has been one of the ladders that fuel revenue. The seasonality in the U.S. has always been like that. I mean that's basically the way people perform in this particular market. I mean, it's a little different than it performs in Europe. And in that sense, it's always been marked in the third and the fourth quarter and normally becomes a lot better when people get more money during Christmas and start to pay us back, et cetera.  The dynamic that I basically explained given that there is a very strong second-hand car market in the U.S. and also that people basically don't want to refinance their cars or don't see the availability of loans on cars for the next few months that basically shall help us out, and that's why you see better numbers, and I don't see the cost of risk going beyond the 200 basis points. And Jose gave you a very good explanation of how was the level of the cost of risk before and what is it today, and we expect it to continue. And also the change of mix is helping us out. So it's very important for you to understand that, but this is the way the market has been always and you can see it if you go all the years behind.  In terms of the reporting changes, we're going to continue to basically show the countries as a secondary segment. So you will continue to have that information. I don't know, Jose, if I left anything out. ",

And in particular, I took note of your data on repossessions now at 60%, 65%, it was 58%. I think you quoted that number earlier in the year. How quickly do you think the repossessions are going to go back to historical levels? Because presumably this is savings, COVID savings and now you have student loans picking up, is that something we're going to see sort of going back to historical levels already in 2024? Or do you think it could take more time? Just want to understand how you're thinking about the U.S. within that flat group context.  And the second, hopefully, easier one is on the U.K. You've done pretty well considering some of your competitors in the U.K., has been a bit of a car crash. Can you maybe talk about the outlook there, specifically for U.K.? Given what we're seeing in the market, pretty tough competition on deposits. You had your own offering out in September. So maybe you've got a bit more visibility now for Q4 and 2024. ",

    "text": "Yes. Thank you, Alvaro. Actually, I was expecting your question on the U.S. So let me give you exactly what is the important different dynamic that car has to the loans and different things. The car in the U.S. is quite interesting. It's not as in Europe, as in Latin America. Actually, people in Europe and Latin America pay first the mortgage and then the auto loan, et cetera. In the U.S., it's the other way around. The U.S., if you don't have a car, you don't have a mean to go to work or to move around. I mean you're completely isolated.  So the behavior of the auto loans in the U.S. is completely different to anything you see because of this particular issue. Without a car, you cannot work and you cannot generate money. So that's exactly why the performance of the portfolio has turned it in that way because people basically take a lot of care to that. And that's exactly why the behavior of delinquencies basically are performing that well. I mean, normally, if the economy complicates, you're going to see that number of 60% to 62%, 63% maybe going up. Let's see how the U.S. evolves. And if we have a soft landing or not, that will all depend on that.  Also, it's important to acknowledge that we are changing the mix of the portfolio, as we have said already. So that's quite important because we are much more concentrating with the funding that we have from our bank to be more in prime and in near prime. And even though we will continue to do so prime because it's a business that we know well, and we manage pretty well in the terms of risk underway, but we are trying to change a little bit the mix of the portfolio. And also, we are offloading some of that risk through asset sales, et cetera. So it's quite important to understand that we are being very cautious about that. I'm very cautious on the way we're managing cost -- sorry, cost of risk. So I hope I answered your question correctly.  And then on the U.K. The U.K., as you have said, we have performed well. We'll end up having a really strong year. We are working really hard to follow a strong strategy in terms of cost. We are also, it's very important, advancing of One Transformation. We believe there is a huge opportunity there, leading to probably -- and the U.K.'s leading probably to its best year in bottom line. But it's important that you see that there is an opportunity there in transforming and decrease the cost that we have in that country. So I really do see the U.K. with a huge opportunity. I've been spending a lot of my time there because I believe there is opportunities.  NII has grown year-on-year 9.3%, is driven by higher rates, as you know, and a strong -- what -- we have a really strong focus on managing the spreads and profitability. So you'll see that we have been lowering the portfolio debt because we're very focused on that. You see that in Q3, I mean, we are, as the rest of the market at 2.2 [ph] both -- and we are offset -- offsetting the increased cost of the retail funding and a slowdown of new originations by basically playing that and also using a different mix of the portfolio and trying to see other opportunities.  It's important to tell you that we are putting profitability ahead of market share. And we have lower risk appetite, as I told you. And we believe that we could have a NIM expansion by doing that. ",

    "text": "Thank you, Andrea. Let me do the following thing. Let me answer your question on the digital euro, and then Jose will basically talk about the structural tax rates and the capital. First of all, it's quite important to understand that the European Commission has published a proposal of regulation last June, which basically sets a framework and it's a necessary condition for the digital euro to be launched. They have publicly stated the discussion should not be rushed ahead of European elections in June '24. And they're saying that instead, they were examined in a quiet and slow way by the new commission and the new parliament. So we expect a long negotiation process to achieve a common agreement in that sense.  In parallel, what we have seen is the ECB has just finalized investigation phase of the digital euro, as I said. The government counsel published last week the results and they decided to initiate a 2-year preparation phase, as we have heard, basically focused on the actual implementation of it. It will evolve finalizing in the rule book and the selection -- selecting providers that could develop the infrastructure. This is quite important. And this phase will pave way to a potential future decision on issuing the digital euro or not. But we see that it's going to happen.  And as the decision on the digital euro, I don't believe will not be taken before the regulatory proposal is approved. So I don't expect to its release before 2026. On this context, I mean, also as Banco Santander, we are aligned with the European authorities to design the European -- the digital euro, also develop the pan-European integrated payments market. It's basically very important that we believe we generate value for consumers, companies and the financial institutions. And it's also important to say that we will continue to monitor the potential impact the digital euro may have on our banks in Europe. And also it's important for us to have greater clarity as the ECB and the European Commission finalize the regulatory proposal and implementation phase. So that's the way we see it at this point.  With this, I will basically pass it to Jose to tell you. ",

Tax rate -- the -- in terms of structural tax rate for the group going forward, I think using 30% is the right number. This year is going to be a bit lower because of the tax benefits on EV in the U.S.  And then organic capital, well, the higher the profitability, obviously, the higher the organic capital generation. We don't expect any significant regulatory charges other than the ones we mentioned, and obviously, always subject to available-for-sale impacts, et cetera. But we don't see any significant inorganic or extraordinary charges to our capital buildup. So you're right. I mean the higher the profitability, the better.  We also have a very strong focus on asset rotation. We have started a team that is going to be looking at ways of optimizing risk-weighted assets across the group. In the first 9 months of this year, we have already rotated the equivalent to around €15 billion to €18 billion in risk-weighted assets. We think we can do more or less €30 billion -- close to €30 billion -- €25 billion to €30 billion this year, and that will be the focus going forward. The focus will be to rotate the balance sheet because we might not be the best tenors of some of the assets that we have in our balance sheet, so -- on our balance sheet.  So the focus going forward is going to be optimizing risk-weighted asset consumption and maximizing profitability.

When we look at yield on loans, in the fourth quarter of last year, yield on loans in Portugal was 2.4%, 3.3% in the first quarter, 4% in the second, 4.6% in the third. So the yield on loans basically increasing almost at the same rate every quarter this year. Yield on deposits, 4 basis points, 14 basis points, 26 basis points, 38 basis points, also more or less growing at the same pace. So one quarter, there's obviously seasonality, balances, number of days, all of this may explain the differences. But again, when you look at the trends, the trends in Portugal are very consistent.  We would expect, as Hector said, obviously, there is a limit to the repricing of assets. And mortgages in Portugal, contrary to Spain, are linked to the 6-month Euribor, the 12-month Euribor in Spain. So the flattening out on the asset side in Portugal is going to happen a bit faster than in Spain. But again, the cost of deposits in Portugal is really, really low, and we don't see any competition there. So we remain constructive in the next few quarters in Portugal. ",

I'm talking about PAT. And CIB is also achieving a substantial growth and net margin growth mid-teens, maintaining a superior profitability levels. So you're going to see that.  We expect double-digit NII growth in '23. And in terms we see very factors to consider. We see, as Jose explained to you in detail, assets repricing at least during the first half of '24, clients continue to grow, and betas will be key in this particular issue. We see no meaningful deposit movements in Spain in reaction to prevailing rates. Our deposit base is extremely atomized. 80% of our deposit base have an average balance of €20,000, which basically contributes to the stability.  Also, it's very important to take into account that the One Transformation I explained is going through in Spain as well, and we're very focused on the product simplification. As I said, we're reducing 21% the product portfolio. We're doing a process of optimization there. But I see that exactly that's the trend that it's going to happen, exactly as Jose basically detailed. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement, but you already gave a lot of detail. ",

    "text": "Yes. Britta, let me tell you, yield on loans -- it is the same explanation that we have for Portugal. Quarter-on-quarter, it basically has to do with many -- probably many small things. But when you look at yield on loans in Spain from the fourth quarter of last year at 2.5%, first quarter 3.3%, second quarter 3.8%, fourth quarter 4.3%. So very much almost a straight line increase. And in the case of deposits, also the same, 22 basis points, 53 basis points, 72 basis points, 19 basis points, in the last couple of quarters, 18, 19 basis points increase. So very much flat.  So the point here is that we still have a substantial part of our balance sheet in Spain that will reprice up in the first half of next year. I just use the figure for mortgages, it's €77 billion and around 60% reprices in the first half. So I think the yield on loans will continue. Although the rates -- interest rates in Spain might stay or in Europe may stay flat, the repricing of assets in Spain will continue for at least the first half of next year.  And in terms of the pressure on the cost of deposits, again, most of institutional deposits, corporate investment banking deposits have already repriced. So the question is to what extent the cash balances in the current accounts will move to time deposits. To what extent customers have excess liquidity in their current accounts to be put aside for time deposits? And we do think that is a limited -- is a very limited amount. So we see not a lot of pressure on that particular part of the business for increased cost of deposits.  In Chile, we have 2 balance sheets, so 2 sensitivities to the balance sheet. One is to rates and the other one is to inflation. Obviously, the relative movements of inflation and rates is what explains what we've seen. So we have seen already inflation going down, rates going down slower. So as inflation continues to go down and rates follow, we will see the reversal. So we see NII in Brazil actually expanding, again gaining momentum towards the second half of next year, but expanding substantially in the second half of next year relative to the second half of this year because, again, the relative movement that we have between inflation, which is the U.S. and rates.

First of all, the rates increase, but most of that is basically because of the change of the mix that we have performed in the country. We saw an opportunity of basically switching a little bit of the portfolio into credit cards and unsecured loans and payroll loans to individuals. So to have a much better structured mix than we used to have before. So Mexico is helped out by the rates, but also by the change of the mix of the portfolio, all right? So it's quite important to see that.  We see that Mexico will continue to have a really good trend. I mean, Mexico, as you have seen, has grown pretty well, pretty nicely over the past few months, and I believe it is going to grow strongly also on '24. The important thing to understand exactly how rates are going to perform, and that's going to depend a little bit on what happens in the U.S., all right? But I see that if rates continue to be stable and the economy performs well, I believe that Mexico should develop very good on '24 and continue to have very good growth on NII.  In terms of Argentina, as you have seen, we have a, I would say, complicated environment to say the least about what's going on. We really -- and I wouldn't like to basically make a prediction of what could happen, but looks that may -- things may stay as they are. We have, as you know, a potential difference between the -- in the exchange rate -- between the official exchange rate and what's happening in the black market.

So very early stages of this proposal, and I am almost 100% sure that some other form of proposal, if any, will be conducted because again, this is a proposal of the existing government, not the upcoming government.  The ALCO -- sorry, also Britta about this and I forgot. We have more or less €27 billion, almost €30 billion of ALCO in Spain at an average yield of around 3.4%. We expect to end the year at around €30 billion. We might increase the ALCO a little bit more next year, obviously, taking advantage of the higher yields. So depending on how you measure the profitability of this, if you measure this against average cost of deposits sort of against the marginal funding cost, you have different profitability.

We had really good growth in terms of loans, but the majority of those loans -- a vast majority is basically stock financing. Given the dynamics that the auto market has had over the past few months, first of all, there was not enough production, then the production started and now basically, we are financing a huge amount of the car dealerships. We expect basically to start -- the dealerships start moving that inventory out and that basically will produce more -- the normal auto loans and then will give us the normal NII that we are accustomed to at this point. So that's basically the way we believe that this is going to evolve.  It is important to acknowledge that also we have been able to finance a lot of this portfolio with our own deposits instead of going that much to wholesale. And also, you're going to see a dynamic of what Jose was telling you about of selling a lot of these portfolios out into the market once we basically start out giving out loans, direct to individuals. So we believe that the outlook would be good.  It's important to see also how the economy evolves mainly in Europe, and that would also depend on how fast the inventory is moved. ",

Although we have a neutral position into rates in DCB, obviously, the higher the rates, the more difficult the business is, particularly when rates start going up. So once rates stabilize, the business also stabilizes and increases the profitability. The difficulty in managing DCB is when rates actually go up because although we do not have sensitivity to that movement, obviously the customers do not react well to that. So that is one point I wanted to make.  The other point is on cost of risk. We would expect the cost of risk in DCB to gradually trend towards the normalized level of around 50 basis points a year, taking into account that this will depend on asset sales, securitizations, et cetera.

We continue expecting an improvement both in NIM and NII in the coming quarters. Rates, as Jose explained to you, have started to curve down, I mean, 100 basis points in the Q3 '23. Our numbers basically tell us that maybe they will come down towards the end of the year to 11.75%. So that basically tells you, reflecting the Q2 decline in rates plus credit activity increasing plus market-related NII no longer a drag, NII improvements. So that basically tells you that we -- yes, we believe that the second -- sorry, that the fourth quarter is going to be better than the third.  In terms of what do we see in the future is exactly as Jose explained to you, is that we see a trend going upwards towards -- more towards the second half of the year, next year. And that's the way we see it. It's going to help out if rates continue to come down and volumes continue to go up, but that's exactly the beauty of the diversification model that we have at this point.  In terms of the U.S. coverage, it's basically, I mean, the normal seasonality that we have discussed. And we have an update in loan-to-values including the current value of the cars. And in addition on the quarters, we have CRE charges due to downgrade rating of several companies in the sector and fintech charges due to originations in that sense. But I see that this will normalize towards the beginning of next year, as I said. So in that sense, I don't see a problem in that is -- also, there was an increase in provisions mainly, as I said, I mean, the LTV and the Stage 3 balance with the GST remediation. But other than that, I think it's quite what -- it was quite normal.  Cost of risk, as I said, is 1.77%, and is below the 200 basis points that we indicated as guidance for the year. And total coverage ratio is double. The total loan portfolio is flat year-on-year, 2.7%. I don't know if that answers your questions. And in terms of the capital return, please, Jose? ",

We've delivered double-digit. What's very important is that what you've seen this year is not just a context and the retail side in Europe, of course, with higher rates, but it's very much backed by strong customer activity across all businesses. You can see that, for example, in our transactions per customer, which grow 10% year-on-year. As I said, the retail Europe business has had very strong tailwinds. We do expect this to continue. We have positive momentum in all our five global businesses. I want to be clear on this. They're going to come from different regions and different sites. I'll give you a high level and then maybe Hector can give you a bit more detail. So again, revenue growing at mid-single-digit, the high level summary of the drivers of this, on revenue would be first positive revenue growth in our retail business, very high double-digits in South America, Brazil, Chile, with a positive sensitivity to falling rates. You've seen that already in Q4 and of course, very strong momentum in Mexico. If you look at the other important global business consumer, which this year suffered from the higher rates, this year it's exactly the opposite. So, you're going to see consumer in Europe and consumer in the U.S. with much better performance next year in terms of the top line than they had this year with volume growth and positive sensitivity to lower rates. Again, that's also going to be good for fees. Overall in fees, they're going to be driven, as Hector said, by customer growth, increased transactionality. And very important, as we implement these global platforms, you're going to see much more of that. But again, the high performing fee businesses will be corporate bank would be payments. But maybe Hector, you want to give a couple of the highlights for on revenues. We'll take net interest income maybe in another question, otherwise it's going to be too long a reply, but net interest income we also projecting that to rise again, mostly in retail and consumer.

You're going to see also that, the main driver will be South America and what's going on in Mexico, and then also you're going to see good growth from coming from the U.S. Okay. So, in that sense, you'll see also the consumer business globally in NIR both in Europe, in the U.S. it should grow benefited by credit growth and the progressive re-pricing that we have. Okay? And you're going to see in CIB higher income from financial transactions. Both answering your question in terms of fee, we expect the fee income to grow and that's very important. As Anna was saying, supported by the strategy of being the number one bank for our customers. This is quite important. The moment that you become the number one bank to your customer, fees basically and different revenue growth exponentially, and that's going to help us quite a lot. You have heard a lot about connectivity several times, but let me tell you why it's very important. Okay? Connectivity between the global businesses and platforms and the countries is the one that drives a strong free generation. Okay. That basically leads to double-digit fee growth for most of our global businesses in '24 so we can reach the mid to high single digit growth ambition that we have on the fees. Okay?

We're aiming for, I would say, flattish cost. So, the goal is to grow customers, grow top line have positive operating leverage of flattish cost that is below 43% by the end of '24. You also said, how do we see it in '25? Obviously, we see it better. As I said, we intend to go step-by-step sustainably getting better. We've had big improvements in '23, '24. We expect also improvements in '25 and reaching at least our target, if not better. I'm not changing the guidance. I'm just saying we to do better than that. So I want to be clear on that. But yes, we see many more benefits. And I want to again insist on the structural change in the model, and that is what one transformation is allowing us to do. We're reducing not just efficiency as a ratio, but the cost to serve the customer. We see a very, very strong acceleration in the numbers that you have in the presentation in the second half of the year, and we hope to carry that. We have positive momentum in all our markets. And again, I use the example of the U.S. because the U.S. is the place where we have an upscale auto business. But with our common platforms in the consumer and retail banks, we will get to be very competitive on the deposit gathering side. You saw in the slide that Hector showed that we had targeted around 400 million in savings in our consumer business in the U.S. by '25. With delivered 200 million this year. We are, of course, investing investments in the U.S. transformation will not be as large next year. So you are going to see a much better performance for the U.S. as a whole in '25. But what I said before, we will migrate our existing retail customers in '25 to this new platform. So in '25 and again, this is only one example with the U.S., driven by one transformation by the common platform that technically is already up and running, which is in the regulatory approval process. So that should drive increased efficiencies. And then again in Hector's slide. You saw that one transformation is helping us across the board in many other areas in technology. So our investments, one transformation investment in technology have reached 2.4, but they've been more than offset in real terms by savings in the global tech platform. So again, we're very confident that these numbers will be delivered and will get better. You want to give a bit more on the one transformation.",

Then the second is automation, which basically allows us to automate a huge amount of processes and basically have people in the branches and mainly a lot of amount of our products in our apps, which basically allows us to spend more time with clients selling products, et cetera, and also diminishing the cost. Opti means better service user experience, less cost per transaction and client, more revenues, which is best basically means, profitability. And then you're going to see an inflection point that goes through '24, '25 when the platforms are being deployed and cost should start coming down in a much faster way.",

And secondly, your structural hedge notional in the UK increased by 7 billion or 7% quarter-on-quarter.

    "text": "So yes, let me just frame the answer in terms of the UK NIM in the context of our retail business. So again, our overall retail business for '24 will do better than '23, driven more by the Americas, in this case, both Latin America, but also the U.S. because it's on the consumer side actually. So, what's very important is again, single and mid single digit growth is what we are guiding in terms of revenue growth overall. With mid single digit growth overall, I mean, also for net interest income. Within that, the UK, this year has delivered a 13%, I believe, 13% RoTE. Will continue to be double-digit, but will be lower profitability. So, as you as you know volumes and the top line net interest income, I'll let Hector and Jose give you a bit more detail on that, but has not been as strong because we have basically managed the UK for profitability. So, we have a very strong business in mortgages, very strong business in current accounts in the UK at scale and competitive. And for '24, we expect still double-digit profitability, but lower than this year. What's important and again, as we think about the one transformation, that is going to help maybe not as much as in other countries next year in the U.S. in terms of the top line, but is going to help already on the cost side. So, we're guiding UK should be flattish cost next year with low cost of risk, in a very, very strong balance sheet. And so, again, leading to lower profitability overall in the UK, but still double-digit RoTE. So, in terms of, I don't know if you want to give a bit more detail on volumes or on NIM in the UK?",

    "text": "Sure. I will do so. But mainly, I think it's important to tell you a couple of things. As Ana said, basically, retail represents the bulk of the business in the UK, mainly mortgages and the current accounts that we have. We anticipate in terms of your question in terms of cost, flattish cost. This is benefiting for the change of the model that we're doing. And also, we believe that cost of risk is going to remain low given the quality of the portfolio and the focus on profitability that we're telling you. Okay? It's important to understand that high rates and economic slowdown are continued to affect the loan volumes and the market deposit growth continued to be subdued. Okay? So, in '24, we anticipate a challenging competitive environment as the one that you saw during the third and fourth quarter with rates on deposits growing through the year and across all the banks, which is basically what's going on there. Mortgage rates have started to fall since December '23, you saw that, following a drop in the market swap rates and in the number of mortgages approvals have started to recover since then. So, we see a little bit changes in the volume. The outlook is driven by an increased competition also, which will keep focusing on profitability as Ana basically said. And we're going to leverage on the group platforms to maintain the cost of better levels and to find new revenue streams. Cost, as I said, flattish. And as a result, we anticipate and a slightly lower RoTE. But I don't know, Jose, if you want to beat exact details.",

That shows it's very stable and we would expect it to keep it stable. This is structural, so we would not use the hedge to bring forward profits.

So you've disclosed your guidance for 2024 at 16% RoTE, which implies a net profit of more than 12 billion on current tangible book value. And this one has been growing, so we hope that continues. So you'd be implicitly guiding between 12 billion and 12.5 billion net profit this year, which I mean will be a strong number if delivered. Now I won't ask you to confirm if that's right, but it will be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing this year, particularly Europe, Brazil and the U.S? Actually, when you talk about Europe, if you could comment about Spain and the UK given the weakness this quarter that I think would help. My second question is on strategy. So you're adding a decent number of investment bankers in the U.S. And now over the years, we've seen a few of European International peers have ambitions, change the allocation of capital in their CIB businesses in the U.S., which is almost systematically resulted in negative jaws and higher capital consumption. Can you talk us through what your expectations are here, please? And possibly share with us some numbers in terms of size of the investment and expected returns on these investments?",

    "text": "So in terms of the guidance, again, we're not going to give specific numbers, but you can do the math. I think what's important in terms of how we see revenues profits, costs, et cetera, is that the key here is the operating leverage. So as I said, this is going to be partly revenues and partly costs due to the change in the model, this is really important because obviously we have a lot more control. We control the top-line to a certain degree but there's some external impacts. And so, what really matters is the operating leverage and the change in the model. So we have a structurally lower cost to serve. So we're going to work very hard on both of those. As you know, we've moved to managing the bank primarily by global business. So if you allow me, I'm going to give you the vision by global business because this is really how we manage, this is how we predict. We have been managing this way forever, by the way, at the country level. So, we've been predicting retail commercial by country. It's not anything different. We're now just putting that together and working together in a common business model that Hector explained in detail. So again, we expect all our five global businesses to do better in 2024. This is really important. So we expect revenue growth in all our businesses. Retail commercial DCB in terms of NII is 80%, so it's obviously very important. Both our retail commercial and DCB should grow mid-single-digit. Again, our retail commercial, as I said, will do better in the Americas this year than in Europe. But with the exception of the UK, the top-line will grow in all the countries, including Spain. So, revenues will continue to grow in Spain, Poland, Portugal. So again, very diversified and I would say very strong, momentum, in some cases, more now fees than net interest income. Hector mentioned on the retail commercial side, fees were negative to flat this in 2023. It should be much more positive in '24, including in Europe, by the way, because there's more activity. We're seeing positive signs already the last few months that activity is picking up, so fees would grow in retail commercial. What's going to be doing better, and Hector and I mentioned that already is our consumer business, DCB, and that is both in Europe and in the U.S. So again, here both net interest income and revenue growth should also continue to grow, fees growing much faster because of higher activity. So, again, very balanced across all the businesses and with different contribution from different geographies and different businesses that are more positive sensitivity to the lower rates. The Corporate Investment Bank will continue to grow very well, mostly on fees. As you've seen there, we've put specifically some operating metrics that show that we are not planning to increase the size of the business, we just wanted to be more profitable, but not the size in terms of capital. So, that should remain basically where it is today. It's a 13% of our revenues, but the composition of our business is really different from our peers. So, a lot of transactional banking, a lot of corporate customers that we now expect to do more fee and advisory business with, I mean, both Hector and I have met with a number of top CEOs that are now already engaging with us in this new context, right? So, we are very, very focused on what you said of playing to our strengths of not doing, what we are not either the best or could be the best at and leveraging on our corporate relationships, which are incredibly strong across Latin America, Europe and increasingly the U.S. So, that is really the focus of the strategy there. In terms of more specific guidance on specific countries, I think I would suggest that the CFO reach out to you if you want some more. Thank you.",

The thing is that fee income is the area where you have sort of under delivered, you promised a stronger growth and only grown by mid single digits in '23. I would like to understand why do you think that was the case and why are you bullish for 2024? Or were you again expect to grow by high single digits? I understand the hiring in the U.S., but other than that, what is driving that strong growth across the board? And the second one is about the cost income ratio in digital consumer versus retail. It's just a little bit comparative. We're looking at similar cost income ratios in both segments where in theory, we would expect the digital consumer to be and more efficient business line than retail with the network. Could you explain what extent the cost income ratio in the retail consumer is affected by investment needs and IT development? And what will be a more normalized cost in commercial? Thank you.",

    "text": "So, let me just very briefly answer the second question. You're totally right. There's a lot of upside in our consumer business. Remember that this is mostly Europe, but also the U.S. So, we invested a lot in this, especially on the retail side -- sorry, on the, well, its retail and consumer. The bank side is exactly the same backend. But you're totally right. So, that should improve a lot next year. So, we're actually targeting lower cost absolutely, for our consumer bank again driven not just by Europe but also by the U.S. So yes, absolutely, that is a big goal we have. Fees, so again, we're not always going to deliver exactly how we said, but we're going to deliver because diversification, because we're working on different angles, and so you're going to get some lags. One of the reasons, our retail commercial bank has had much lower activity, especially in Europe in some markets, and that is a big driver of fees. We are targeting fees in our retail commercial to turn positive next year. So from zero growth this year as you saw in Hector's presentation that should be up maybe not much. We're expecting fees to be much higher in our consumer bank. Again, as we said, our diversification is a huge strength. It's differential against most of our peers, if not all of them. So as rates stabilize and come down, you're going to see a much better performance in our consumer business, not just on the cost side as I just explained, but also in revenue growth, net interest income and fees. And fees should be high-single-digit in our consumer bank, which is pretty big. And yes, absolutely, our Corporate Investment Bank should grow fees much faster. That is one of the goals. That is one of the reasons that we brought the team we brought in the U.S., because they can help us grow fees on the back of our existing customer relationships. So you're going to see CIB fees doing as well or maybe a bit better than this year, double-digit for sure. And you're going to see a lot of that in the U.S. Again, so you will see the U.S. as a country, both consumers doing better, CIB doing better, the whole of the U.S. going to, above double-digit returns next year. But again, you're going to see hopefully. You see payments also doing very well this year and next year and Wealth Management doing better next year than this year. So that is the reason we are confident that our fees will improve more in '24.",

Cost of risk in the fourth quarter was 250 basis points. If I look at the secondhand core value, they've dropped over 30% in peak value. And in addition, you're doing more EV financing, as far as I can see, given the tax rate, given that you had heard dumping 20,000 EV vehicles in the U.S., I think up to 80% discounts. And the secondhand core price is coming down so much and asset quality already showing signs of deterioration. How should we think about the cost of risk in the U.S. going forward? And if you could just remind us what a normalized cost of risk level is? And then my second question would be on the Corporate Center. As far as I can see, the first time you make a profit in the corporate center since the global financial crisis. You also made a positive net interest income in the Corporate Center.

We are guiding and we are confident our cost of risk will stay around 1.2%. That is probably a through the cycle number, roughly. So, it could be lower, it could be a bit higher, but should be a 1.2%. We're not seeing really, we have said previously 1% through the cycle. We have a bit bigger balance sheets in some emerging markets, but we haven't given this, but I'd say and maybe Jose wants to address that, but I'd say around 1.2%. What's important is that and this is not just zero but it's mostly Europe. Our balance sheet is very low risk and highly secured. In the case of Europe, a lot of that is mortgages. So, 33% actually of our total balance sheet is prime mortgages with very low average LTVs. We're not anticipating a big change in those numbers, maybe a few basis points, yes. That's why we, as you know, the 1.13 is the underlying. So, we do have some space to grow there, but this really is about basis points. And the big driver and that's the reason we're not seeing any deterioration in our big portfolios is that we had record low unemployment and this is the biggest driver of cost of risk in most of our balance sheet. So again, we are confident the economy will remain resilient. If you look at the latest actually to date, the IMF just upgraded growth, especially for Spain and some of our key economies. And then our consumer portfolios, and maybe Hector wants to comment a bit more on the U.S. But yes, there will be some normalization. But to be honest, everything we expected this year has happened in our consumer portfolios. Brazil is trending down. The U.S. is normalizing as we expected. There will be some normalization in consumer next year, but very much within the expectations of what we've been seeing in the last year. I'll let Hector answer on that, but let me just address the corporate, the corporate center. Maybe that's for Jose. But just to say that that it's very important that different banks have different policies for the corporate center. So, in the corporate center, for example, we place our excess liquidity with the ECB. Then we have transfer pricing. And so again, you should see some of that and I'll let the detail for Jose in the context of our commercial business, for example, in the euro balance sheet in Spain and Portugal. Again, part of that is, let's say, more financial and part of that is depending on how you choose. And our policy in high-level terms is to take out some of the volatility and really try to have a more market based transfer pricing. So you can see the actual commercial business. And so, some of those financial benefits of higher rates, sometimes in our case, as you've seen this year, go to the corporate center. So maybe you want to take the U.S., maybe autos, and then, Jose, you want to also expand on the corporate center?",

Sales volume are 26 billion is basically helped by the new, relationship we have with some new OEMs that we have included in the portfolio. And we have, as you know, a continued dominance in the so prime used car segment, which, we are the leaders in the market. This volume basically rebounded as you have seen on the back of the new OEMs agreements that I explained, okay, and also compensated for some declines on volumes that we had in other OEMs. Okay? And then, you basically see that we have seen a reversion to normal in credit performance with delinquencies and losses increasing, seasonally as we have every single year through the last quarter, but it's still below the pre-pandemic levels. Okay? So we expect the performance to continue through '24 and we see lower roll rates of charge-offs and lower delinquencies driving that of the shift that we have to prime and near prime loans and a generally U.S. recovery in the U.S. economy. So, I wouldn't say recovery but robust U.S. economy. New vehicle prices basically continue to be higher by pre-pandemic period, and use prices are falling, but they continue to be higher than four years ago and also are being supported by a robust recovery rate that we have. Remember that I explained last quarter about after 90 days delinquencies, We're still below pre-pandemic levels at about, I mean, 67% compared to above 90%. So our outlook for 2024 is a positive on the U.S. auto, sales growth in both loans and leases and the sustained net income delivery as losses basically stay below the historical term.

And there are two different balance sheets in Spain. One is the commercial balance sheet in Spain and we make it as an like an independent bank. So we charge to Spain the TLAC MREL costs. We charge the financing of the ALCO portfolio and a couple of other things. So net Commercial Spain balance sheet, we charge around 1.4 billion for those items. And then, we also have a CIB balance sheet in Spain. That's group CIB booked in Spain, plus the branches. And like Ana said, we isolate the CIB business from interest rate risk. So, there is an intra group transfer pricing for the CIB business that is in the balance sheet of Spain, and that's around 800 million. So, although we remunerate the commercial gap in Spain, you see a commercial gap that is the difference between loans of 228 billion and deposits of 308 billion, the difference is 80 billion we remunerate that gap at the central bank rate, but then we charge these items that I explained, making Spain equivalent to a country and isolating CIB against the TTI. So obviously, when rates are up, we have at the corporate center higher income from the TTI coming from CIB. As rates will come down, that should also come down.",

And just very important, it's over 12% fully loaded after Basel III, so, again, really important that we are comfortable. We have ample buffers in terms of the regulatory requirements. The second point is that every year, we're generating more and more capital organically. We are a compound compounder. We're adding to equity, and we're investing in profitable growth for the future and this is really important. So this is allowing us enough capital to grow. We have put in place a very ambitious and successful program in terms of rotation of the balance sheet. So as you can see, the net RWA growth last year was zero, but increasing the front book, profitability. And so again, we're aiming to, in terms of capital build this year, on a like-for-like basis, we went from 12 to 12.50. We're now accruing the buyback in December, so that means 12.30. That goes up from 12, and that's after increasing the payout to 50%, as you know, from 40. So again, we're generating more and more capital. We generated 10 billion of capital this year. It's much, much larger than the last few years. We continue to aim as you've seen to grow profitability next year, which should increase the capital generation and give us space to both fund out growth, increasing returns to shareholders as we make more money and we generate more capital. And next year, we will have the Basel III, but the number that we are projecting for the end of this year is 12.40 to 12.50 from the 12.30 for the end of '24, we expect that number to be exactly the same on day one. Again, 12.40 to 12.50 by the end of the year and on day one in January, the same, the final impact in '28, we estimate 25, 30 basis points. So, that would mean that on January 1, '25, we would be compliant already with the fully loaded down the road, with the 12.40, 12.50 that I'm saying.

First of all, I mean, we see really good trends as you can see in retail due to the fact that we had really good growth in clients. I basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well, which we can basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients. It's important to say, and as I commented, that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to go. All the different business basically are doing quite well. As you can see, I mean, CIB is also performing quite well and the commercial business, too, and that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong 2024 all along in NII in Spain.

    "text": "Thank you, Héctor. Let me complement those comments. With the current forward rates, as Héctor said, we see NII still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NII in Spain year-on-year, up low single digits. Remember that we expected NII in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in 2024 relative to 2023 with the current level of interest rates and forward rates, we see actually NII up in Spain year-on-year. In the Corporate Center, the first quarter is a bit abnormal, because we increased the hedging. We always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies. So I would expect the NII in the corporate center to gradually perform better, as future charges might be lower. Capital, Basel III. Let me make a general comment before I go into Basel III. There are a few elements -- well, several elements of uncertainty to European bank's capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters. The first is the U.S. has stated that they will not implement FRTB for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed Basel III rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. impacts. It is therefore very likely that both the FRTB and the Basel III rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage. It is not unlikely though that the commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of FRTB beyond January 1, 2025. However, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EBA needs to publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive -- capital directive. The EBA mandate is that in aggregate, all these -- the impact of all these papers must be neutral. But that doesn't guarantee that everyone and all these papers will be neutral themselves. This is the case, for instance, in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation. So all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimate for a very low day one impact of Basel III. So on January 1, the impact will be very low, zero to 20 basis points, and the fully loaded impact of between 30 to 50 basis points as we had commented before. So all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully loaded and phase-in once Basel III comes into effect. Countercyclical buffers. If in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk-weighted assets for the group. So any countercyclical buffer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50 it will be 12 basis points. If it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember, however, that from the time countercyclical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, there is a one-year lag. So any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year. It most likely will not impact 2025 capital requirements or they might impact year-end capital requirements in 2025, but not 2024.",

Should we expect an acceleration of growth, driven by the good performance of CIB and Wealth Management insurance? Linked to this, I just wanted to see if there was any kind of one-off in the fees reported in the US, which jumped out quarter-on-quarter? The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate. And I just wanted to better understand what is the organic generation that you expect, I mean, as profitability improves, I feel that 10 to 15 bps is to be a bit low and you could probably generate a bit more or you would be able that to additional growth of our revenue base?

Retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth, and it's basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and it's continued to do so, okay? You talk about the outstanding performance in CIB, that's 39% quarter-on-quarter. That's record revenue. This is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking, and there is no one-offs whatsoever in all the bank and in the U.S. It's basically business as usual and client flow from all accounts, okay? In wealth, we have also a very strong recurring activity in private banking. Also, we have higher volumes in asset management. And as well in the insurance business, we have seen a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that could help us out, okay? Consumer growth came mainly from Europe, okay? Volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe, and that shall help us as well. For 2024, we expect that trying to continue, as I told you, the fees are growing to reach mid to high single-digit. This is not an official target, but I can tell you that this is a trend that we see. This is mostly driven by the increase in CIB with the connectivity we have on wealth and payments and the growth in customer and transactionality. And most of the global businesses, we experienced double-digit fee growth in 2024 as we changed the business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account. It's very important that you understand what the model change is about. The model change is exactly about that. When I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients, this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we used to do in the past, okay? So, this is the basic change that we're executing today. So, you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of RWAs. With that, then I'll leave on the capital question to José. Thank you.",

It's -- and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have I think we will have a very good trend. But as you know, that will all depend, I mean, how the market basically goes. But what I can tell you is that, the market is basically helping us out in that sense, and we will continue the trend if the market helps us. I'm sorry to repeat myself. In what we're looking at in Brazil is exactly you were saying, I mean, we had a one-off in payments that we had on the first quarter last year, which is not going to repeat itself. It was a big one, €195 million. So that basically slowed us a little bit, but I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see payments growing nice. And I also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth. And what I saw towards the end of the year, we see that if we continue that trend, that should help as well in insurance, in retail, so that will help us as well, okay? So I see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that will continue to be strong. In terms of NII in Spain, Brazil and the UK, I could tell you that the indications we gave at the beginning is that with -- if the rates continue the way they are, this is going to give us -- I mean, first of all, see the volume growth that we're having in Brazil. So it's important to understand, and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly. And NII, in Spain, already Jose gave you a very good explanation, but I will allow Jose to go deep into that detail on that one. In terms of the UK, let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is. I mean, as you have been seeing the UK basically will behave the same as our competitors are behaving, okay? The business, as you know, is very focused on retail. It's our core business, and we continue to improve their offering and the user experience. And we also are gradually continued growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail, okay? NII is down 4.4% in the quarter, similar just as I said, to the UK banks. And all the big ones have the similar trends of us, but we're taking actions to improve the NII. We're doing pricing changes. We announced both deposits and lending in the first quarter, and we are trying to use the betas and to manage them in a much better way. And asset mortgage spreads also are improving in the UK market, so that shall help us towards the next quarter. So it wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year. And then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that. That is basically the main part that you're going to see in the UK. And the cost of risk is basically very well -- I mean, under control, and we expect it to be very much there. So with that, I'll ask Jose to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NII.",

So year-on-year, for the full year, NII down a little bit, mid-single digits, something like that. With all of these estimates, we believe NII for the group should grow quarter-on-quarter this year.

In terms of the US, a particular thing is, first of all, I mean, as you know, we've been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses, which is consumer on one side, which is a business that we have at scale. We have also expanded a little money on the CIB side to be for our presence there. And we're also investing to become domestic in our private banking and wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today, we are just basically for non-US alliance. So those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% RoTE. And I believe it's going to be more towards the end of 2025 that we're going to be able to get there, but still we're working really hard in order to be able to complete that. In terms of the asset quality in the US, let me explain you exactly how the trend is, first of all, we still see a strong labor market in the US. And the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well. What has been happening is that we continue to see the trends in delinquencies above 90 days behave much better than pre-COVID, that remember pre-COVID was about 90%. We went all the way down to 59%. Today is more around close to in between mid-60s, and it continues to be like that. So as you can see, our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels, and we expect it to continue to be like that towards the end of the year. We don't see any surprises and the way the portfolio has behaved. So circa around 2% that's where I see it. And now what we have done also is very much focused on profitability. We've been very strong on capital allocation. And we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good. And also, we are focusing on credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around 40% prime and near prime, okay?

So the Bank of Spain were to introduce the CCI of 100 bps, that is 25 bps for you, but that would leave your 12% fully loaded core equity Tier 1 ratio, leaving or implying an MBDA buffer of just about 177 basis points, which is pretty low for European standards. So do you think that 12% fully loaded Tier 1 ratio target is still the right one in that event? And the second question is on the U.K. So the bottom line is now 25% smaller than last year. Is the shrinking going to continue? Or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels? And just quickly a clarification on a previous question. The revenue growth that you are foreseeing, is that just reported revenues? And is that in constant or current euros? Thank you.",

But at the Investor Day a year ago, you targeted, I think, 75 million new customers. Just like a strategic question, maybe it doesn't make it different if you only have 5 million new customers or does it make it difference?

    "text": "Thank you, Sofie Let me answer you the last question first. I mean, what we've been doing here is basically, we are cleaning up a lot of our customer bases. And even though we are growing quite hard, we've been cleaning up that and basically that's, at the end, what's going to be telling -- I mean, moving up towards the number of customers that we are able to include. We're going to be working on that. And -- but I mean, the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses. In terms of the cost, I was basically -- as I explained to you, I mean, this remained fairly stable for the third quarter in a row, okay? As you have seen, that's close 1% quarter-on-quarter. If you exclude Argentina, that's minus 3% because Argentina is moving the numbers up and down. That's plus 2% year-on-year in real terms, and that's a cost to income at around 42.6% and this is in track to our 2024 target of below 43% cost to income. And I believe that we're going to be able to get to that. Cost efficiencies are just coming from operating leverage through simplification of products. If you see the amount of product that we have simplificated, we have 10,000 different products, today, we're down to 7,500 and automation, which is a very important part. And I was explaining you in the change of model how we're changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs. And this is something that, in time, will help us to control costs much better than we've been doing, okay? That's basically the efficiency gains. If you look at that simplification gave us 17 basis points year-on-year of savings. Automation is helping us out, 58% of product services are now digitally available, okay? That's 2 percentage points in help versus December 2023. And if I can tell you an example, the U.S. have captured €10 million in efficiencies just in Q1 alone. And that's €210 million since we started the process in 2022, and that's just in consumer and retail. So, it's very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a really cost-cutting exercise for the creation of the single model and with several other benefits, and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank, okay? So, to reiterate is basically to tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost-to-income for the rest of the year.",

In the UK, it's plus/minus €200 million; but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros, in Spain, in particular, significantly. Let me make first 1 particular comment about the UK. Our structural hedge in the UK is £113 billion with an average duration of £2.4 billion. It was £106 billion in December. So £113, 2.4 years, average duration. And in Spain, we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions, basically originating -- adjusting the origination buying ALCO portfolio. We now have €30 billion ALCO in Spain at an average duration of between six to seven years at 3.25% yield. And we have been also writing some hedges. The result of that is that of the €240 billion risk-weighted assets, €250 billion average earning assets, we have in Spain, 60% is floating, 40% is fixed. That's significantly higher fixed portion than before. So now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe.",

    "text": "Thank you, Andrea. You're right. I mean, we are confident that we are going to reach the 16% target that we set in terms of ROTE for the year. And as we said correctly in our Investor Day, we said 15% to 17% towards 2025. And we are working towards that, and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it. But today, I reiterate to you that we're going to be at the 16% that we have set, okay? In terms of cost, what we have said is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income. If you see the numbers that we have been, we've been very disciplined in terms of -- and what we have said, I mean, if you said it, is you saw is quarter-on-quarter is around 1% top, and we're going to be very disciplined about it. And if you see the operational leverage that we have on the -- what I presented on retail, you see that the operational leverage is working like that, okay? So our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is. And I believe that the trend would continue like this. So I feel very confident on the way we're managing things. And I believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flattish in terms of cost. The question of insurance is quite a good one. We love that business. We believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil, I could tell you, Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low. So we see huge opportunities on that, and we continue to better up our systems. For example, we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way. Today, average by market, we have 222 different products per market. The idea is basically to go down to 25 basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be much more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the clients exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend. So that's a huge opportunity, as you say. The other side of the coin is that we have JVs that in place on the long-term basis, mainly in Latin America and Spain and Portugal. And then we will continue to have them over the years because they are long term. I would love to internalize that business, what unfortunately is what it is. We have the JVs and we need to respect what we have there. But as you say, there's a huge opportunity in that sense, not just because of the change and sweets in regulation, but also because of the -- the advantages and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the low penetration in the different markets.",

And you mentioned the delegated act provision for FRTB here in Europe.

And then second, on Argentina. So clearly, it has quite a distortive effect on the group figures. And then there's the associated cost of hedging, and it's below 5% of group earnings.

This is basically a very important change for us given the high capabilities that we have to originate assets, okay? So this is basically helping us to rotate and also giving us a new, basically, I would say, a turbocharger in the sense that with every single time that we sell something, we basically reduce that capital, already deploy the capital within the organization at a much better price. So that's exactly what we're doing and rotating the capital in a much better way. As Jose was explaining you, we rotate a third of the balance sheet every year. And since we're very focused on profitability, we're actually reinvesting better and better, and that's actually a new way of basically managing the balance sheet of the bank. Then Jose can give you a little bit of the details in terms of what you were explaining about it. In terms of regulatory capital, as we told you, our guidance is basically to be above 12% after regulatory charges, et cetera. So we continue to basically hang on to that number, 12%, above 12% we believe. And as we -- and as I said -- and Jose basically reiterated, we're going to be above the 12% after Basel III as well.

So more or less 40% of this is SRTs, but the rest is other types of transactions like asset sales, hedges, et cetera. The cost of mobilizing this €30 billion was around RoTE equivalent, okay? We always look at RoTE, but just to use the same currency everywhere in RoTE equivalent, the cost of mobilizing this €30 billion was slightly below 10%. And we reinvested the capital, as I said, at 23%. So there was at least 13 percentage points difference on this €30 billion in risk-weighted assets. €30 billion in risk-weighted assets is close to €4 billion in capital times this 13%. So on an annualized basis, we generated increased profits with the same capital of around €500 million. We expect to continue doing this. The demand for private credit is significant that we have a very busy second half of the year. It's difficult to replicate the same figure in the second half of the year because of holidays, et cetera, but we expect to mobilize much more than last year. And as you can see from the figures I gave you, this is very profitable. Capital headwinds this year, we still expect 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. Basel III, as Hector mentioned, fully loaded. And when we mentioned fully loaded, is fully loaded, even taking into account those impacts that come in 2029, we will be comfortably above 12%. And the day one impacts will be very relatively small, as we mentioned before. And in the case of Ebury, we're always looking at ways of managing the capital and maximizing capital usage. So there were some news that we are contemplating an IPO in Ebury. Again, we are looking at all types of alternatives to maximize the capital. This is one of them. That doesn't necessarily mean that this will be executed. And again, this will be put as one of our several capital management initiatives that we have across the group.",

LatAm has been lagging a bit behind with Brazil being softer. How should we think about the revenue performance going forward in the second half? When you have upgraded the revenue guidance to high single digits from the 9% currently so we expect second half in line with these levels kind of getting a bit of a sense whether LatAm should offset the weakness of Europe that you have flagged Jose during the call in margin? And the second question is on the U.K. If you could elaborate a bit what should we expect in terms of NII for the UK, are stabilizing so try it getting your thoughts on the outlook for the UK? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Ignacio. I mean, first of all, let me tell you, as Jose said, revenue has been very strong, much stronger than we believed at the beginning. Rates have helped, but also the good performance of our different businesses. As you know, we're very focus on profitability in the way we're restructuring things and that basically is paying off, right? I believe that, I mean, revenue will continue basically to give good results. I don't see that LatAm has a weakness. I see that actually, LatAm is going to be doing very well in the second half. And you can see also very good results coming out of what we're doing in retail in Brazil, okay? And also Chile is doing quite a good performance. Mexico, basically on retail, we're changing the mix, and that's why you see the flat NII on there, but I mean we will continue to give very good results. So we expect a very good second half of the year in terms of revenue. And in that sense, on basically what you were asking about the UK, UK was pared a better second half. First of all, we see that the market is a little bit more rational. Competition has been much rational than we saw during the first quarter. Second quarter has stabilized. We also -- some of the strategies I have done in terms of betas are paying off, okay? So I believe that all in all, UK will have a much better second half of the year than we have seen. In terms of detail, basically is more rational behavior, as I told you, fees are not going to be doing that well due to the switcher campaign that we structured and -- but benefits will come over in the third and fourth quarter, much better than the way we basically saw it. And what you're going to see is also a very good cost control because we have cost control initiatives coming into the U.K., which are going to make the business perform much better than we saw. I don't know, Jose would like to complement a little bit on the revenue side, but...",

    "text": "I think I'm sure that you will ask about -- you mentioned that revenue in Europe is better than you expected. At the beginning of the year, we guided for a drop in NII in the Eurozone. We now see NII in the Eurozone, particularly in Spain, Portugal, et cetera, up mid-single digits. Obviously, rates are higher for longer, so much better performance in NII. We have hedged a substantial amount of our balance sheet in the Eurozone, basically through the ALCO portfolio, hedging the assets, particularly mortgages and also swapping our fixed liabilities into variable liabilities. And it means that the sensitivity of our NII in Europe going forward is going to be significantly lower than we had before. So as Hector mentioned, we expect fairly stable, maybe slightly down NII in Spain in the second half of the year and next year. But at the same time, we continue to see good momentum coming from South America, Brazil and particularly Chile. So we are constructive on the future evolution of NII and revenue in the second half.",

But if you can maybe sort of give us some kind of color on split on, is it ECM/DCM, just perform an opinion of how sustainable it is going forward. If I can slip in a third, you mentioned over 12% capital, but I thought the target was 12.5% at the end of the year.

    "text": "Thank you, Alvaro. First of all, let me talk about capital. In capital, we have always said we're going to be above 12%, okay? And that basically has been the guidance. We're at 12.5% right now. And we said -- as Jose basically reiterated that we're going to be above 12% even after Basel III fully loaded, okay? That's exactly the guidance. In terms of performance in the U.S. fees, okay, the majority is basically the CIB business. CIB is the one that is driving and also a little bit in terms of good performance in retail that we're having a little bit also in the U.S., but CIB is the main driver, okay? It's been growing -- it grew 38% year-on-year, 1.3% quarter-on-quarter. As you know, CIB business is cyclical. So we have pretty good mandates. The business is basically doing well and also a very good connection in between -- what we're doing with the U.S., as I explained during the presentation, with the business in Latin America and the business in Europe. What's happening, and let me explain a little bit is some of the businesses that we used to do in terms of DCM that we wouldn't get because we wouldn't be seen as a dollar house, we are becoming one, and you see us top three in the league tables right now in Latin America, doing dollar transactions, not just to the corporates, but also to the governments. I mean, when UMS did their transaction at the beginning of the year, €7.5 billion, we were one of the principal book runners in the transaction. So you're starting to see that because of the beef up that we did in the U.S. So that's starting to pay off. I believe that with the four teams that we added, I think it's going to complement the rest of the business and will continue driving fees up, but let's see what happens with the cyclicality of the business. On the other side, retail is also performing well in fees, and we believe that it continues to do so over the rest of the year. In terms of what we gave -- in terms of Spain, okay, performance, loans are starting to reprice lower at lower rates, but deposit betas are behaving very well. This is helping contain the cost of deposits. Also, as Jose explained you in detail, ALCO volumes are hoping and the lower cost of the hedging, which were not in place before and now are in place. So that's going to help us. NII, as Jose said, is reaching to speak, but I expect NII to grow mid-single digit in '24, better performance than we expected at the beginning of the year. It's also because of the higher -- for longer rates environment that we're experiencing, okay? I don't know, if Jose would like to add something?",

So I don't understand where you get the minus 9. If we go quarter-on-quarter, NII in Spain was started in the third quarter of last year, 174, fourth quarter 174. First quarter of this year, 182, second quarter 184. We would expect the 184 to be the peak and then slightly down in the second half, probably to very, very similar levels that we had in the second half of last year. And we expect to be able to keep that same level in 2025. In terms of capital, 20 to 30 basis point headwinds, taking into account that we generate 20 to 30 basis points BAU, you should expect our capital ratio to be basically at these levels by year-end.

    "text": "Thank you, Marta. Okay. Let me explain you a little bit what's going on in the U.S. If you look at by business, you're going to see that retail is actually having lower cost than you used to have because of the transformation even with the strong investment we're doing in transformation. But we have done a really -- good cost reduction, and we believe we're going to perform better. Their jaws are negative due to the fact that we're investing in CIB. And CIB, as you understand, I mean, cost a lot to do it. So if we're going to have a second half that is better, it's going to start looking better, but it's going to depend on the cyclicality of the CIB business and some of the still people that are coming into the team that will start to come in, in the next few months. As you know, there is a period of garden leave et cetera. But the main reason is the investment we're doing in CIB, which by in any way is not creating a big investment bank or anything like that. This is basically, as we said, complementing the rest of the business that we have. Our size is not going to be huge. It's the size of a really small boutique, but it's helping us out to beef up and to help us in the remainder of the business. And you can see fees are starting to basically be up due to that fact, okay? In terms of the P&L, it's at easy to understand. The DTAs are basically what we said last year when we started doing the electric vehicles. I mean we signed contracts with some OEMs that are generating the DTAs. And that's why you see that the P&L is affected by that, and it's going to continue due to the fact that we will continue to be absorbing, I mean, that volume. So we have now three things, and this is basically leases on electric vehicles that are creating the DTAs in the U.S., all right? And you're going to see that throughout the year. In terms of the new reporting, it's very important to understand what we're doing. The new reporting is helping us a lot in the way we are managing the business on a day-to-day basis, okay? Because it's making us work together, is making us spend a lot less. In the past, for example -- and let me give you a really stupid example. I mean we used to have 10, 11 different apps in our 10 different banks. Right now, we're just having one app being deployed in all the countries. For example, one app is being deployed. Today, it's being deployed in all of Europe. The last deployment we did was the U.K. and they were deploying Brazil and then we will -- we are deploying also the U.S. So what happens is basically, you use the same around 80/20, and that's the goal that we're basically going through, investing jaws ones and those 80% common, 20% customization for each country. So that basically will enable us in the future through these global platforms to work much better in a much cheaper way. We gave you a pretty good example in what we're doing in acquiring. When the acquiring platform was deployed in Mexico, it took us in 18 months to number two, and you saw the results that I explained, I mean, how EBITDA is growing. And I showed you in the presentation that is helping us quite a lot in terms of positioning ourselves to be very competitive and with really high margins in every single market. And jaws 1 platform, the one that is being deployed. Now this platform is being deployed down to Chile, is being deployed to Argentina, and they will -- we will deploy it in Europe in the near future. So this is basically helping us to work together and to manage the business in a much better way. Then in terms of how do you see the businesses and the way they're reporting, I mean you're going to start getting used to it because it's going to be a lot easier for you to understand every single business in the way we're managing it. We're reporting now, as you can see, the operational leverage that we're getting by working together in which revenue is going up, cost is staying stable and is giving us a really profitable run. So it's very important that you understand that. Also, let me give you a great example. In CIB, where we have been working together for a long time, the same factories that we use for Mexico, Brazil, Spain or the U.K. are completely the same and it's the same product, and we just made them once. So that basically tells you how we're going to be able -- I mean we have been able to make it a really profitable business with growing revenue every single year and with profitability at around 19% that I gave you. So this is exactly the points that we're doing, and I believe that this will enable us to give a lot more value to our shareholders. There is no way we're going to give you more value if we don't work together and do things in a much cheaper way.",

So if you can comment on the main drivers of the NII in the coming quarters and also update on the sensitivity of the NII to select rates in Brazil? And the second question is about NII in the U.S. We have seen this is bottoming out in this second quarter, but they have also seen the deposits falling for a couple of quarters now. So you would need to pay up for deposit gathering in the second half of the year or not. In this context, if you can also comment on the plans to launch Openbank, shall we expect there? Because when I look, for example, at the digital consumer bank, the deposits are growing there by 20%, but net interest margin is still falling, despite the shift to retail deposits?

    "text": "Thank you, Francisco. Let me start with Brazil. First of all, as you have seen, I mean, very strong and solid numbers coming from Brazil. NII, once again, a very strong quarter, up more than 3% and it's up more than 22% in the year, okay? What's behind the performance is the combination of the healthy volume growth, the change in mix and lower rates, okay? It is true. First of all, rates outlook has changed. The market is expecting a smaller than initially anticipated rate cut by the year, by year-end, and this ultimately means that NII growth will be a bit less intense than what we thought at the beginning of the year. That's a fact, okay. Having said that, we still expect Brazil NII to grow in the mid-teens mark by the end '24, okay? It's a good performance that should continue in '25. And let me tell you that to take the opportunity that Brazil has delivered a 16% RoTE. We believe that the end of the year should end up between 16% and 17%. A strong profitability improvement is not just relying on NII growth, but on the good delivery on fees also, the cost contention that we have had and expected cost of risk is stable during the year. So I remember very optimistic in Brazil and the ability to continue funding the profitability, as you have seen. In terms of Openbank in the U.S., Openbank will come into the U.S. with the deposit gathering facility towards September, October, okay? We expect that to come. The first phase is the deposit gathering. And I believe it would be quite successful. We had a pretty good plan in place. And then we'll come -- and we'll be improving the platform as we see fit. In terms of deposits, the deposits -- the transactional deposits that SG&A has had remained stable during the year. What is -- what you have seen the movement in deposits in the U.S. is basically the deposits that we have in CIB, which are the ones that we decide on profitability, what's better for us or not. So sometimes because of profitability, we basically let them go and we move out if we see fit. So there is no problem into that, and we will continue to see that working profitability towards every business that we do.",

This was post-COVID, and we have historically high profitability levels. This year is going to stay -- this production is going to stay in our books for three years. So it's still in our books in 2024 and it will gradually disappear between '24 and '25. The new business that we are writing in 2024 is at RoTE's of around 20% RoTE was of 2.3%, 2.4%, which is much, much higher than '22 and '23 annual production.

So what you're going to see is revenue continue to go up quietly fairly strong. Let's see how we do in fees, as I said, due to the cyclicality of the CIB business, but revenues will be doing fine. In terms of the seasonality, let's see how we do in terms of the provisions, but we believe and the indication that we have had in terms of provisions show us that are coming better.

The negative -- the sensitivity to rates in Europe has been much decreased, as I mentioned before, and we should have positive tailwinds coming from NII in South America, both Brazil and Chile.

And then secondly, in the U.K., in the deck, you mentioned that 100% of your hedge income is already locked in for 2024. This suggests that either you do not have any maturities this year or you pre-hedged some of your maturities. If you have been pre-hedging, what proportion of 2025 structural hedge maturities have you pre-hedged and what rate did you look in at given the swap rates have been volatile?

First of all, it's very important to tell you that increase in provision is exclusively linked to the loan growth that we have in the country, okay? Cost of risk, as you have seen, is flat quarter-on-quarter, 4.77% and credit quality in Brazil remains sound and solid. It's very important to understand that the recent vintages that we have are performing very well and no signs of deterioration. So it's performing than we expected. It's very important to understand that we're also changing the mix a little bit on the portfolio. Just to explain you a little bit, for example, credit cards where in '21, we were making around 800,000 to 900,000 credit cards per month. Today, we're just growing by 400,000 credit cards a month and just to our client base. So the important thing and the big change is exactly that we're not going to the open market, which was the 1 that hurt us quite a lot during '22 and '23. So that's exactly the change of mix that is helping us. Also, it's very important to understand that we're very focused on profitability, and we have been very opportunistic, and we used the proceeds of a corporate transaction to further reinforce the balance sheet at this point. And we reiterate that the '24 guidance of delivering is a flattish cost of risk versus '23, okay, excluding the one-offs. So that's what I see in terms of Brazil.

    "text": "Hi, good morning. My first question would actually be a follow-up in Spain. I'm sorry to insist on this again. But if I understood correctly, and the message was that in 2025, NII should be roughly aligned with the second half of this year where you already expect NII to drop somewhat towards the mid-single-digit growth in the full year that you are mentioning? And then my second question was actually on the U.S. tax rebates that you have been booking. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on how the rebate works in the sense that -- or basically, for how long is it in place? Is it something that we should also witness next year? And also, is it this federal level rebate or something at the state level? And to what extent the potential changes in -- political changes in the U.S. could drive that to disappear or not. Just to have an idea on the time frame for which this is valid right now. Thank you.",

The year-on-year growth, '24 against '23 will be somewhere between 5% to 7%. And then next year, NII should be fairly flat relative to the second half of this year, which means that NII should be down slightly low single digits. Because, again -- and this is using the forward rate curves today. So if this was to change, obviously, we would need to update these estimates. But using forward curve rates today, that's our best estimate for NII in Spain next year. And as Hector mentioned, this is thanks to the substantial reduction in NII sensitivity that we have conducted in the Eurozone in the last year, 1.5 years.",

We don't know if this is going to be sustained. If there is a change of government in the U.S. or not. You -- I mean, I don't want to speculate on that one. Exactly what happens is every single time we do a lease on an electric vehicle, we buy the vehicle in the bank, okay? So what you see is basically a situation in which we own the vehicle. And then we get the cash back or -- sorry, the tax credit and you show the cash credit in 1 lump, okay, during the month in which we do that, right, to be exactly how it goes. So you don't see the impact in the revenue but the impact you see it in the taxes. So that's exactly how it works.

Firstly, in the UK, your NII was slightly up quarter-on-quarter in Q2. So just wondering how you see it progressing from here? And is it fair to say that Q1 was probably the low point on NII and it should start building from here supported by the hedge and what is the shape of this into H2 and also into next year? Secondly, just a clarification on your U.S. business. You were talking about some seasonality into the second half of the year in provisions. Could you please explain what is driving this seasonality? And then lastly for Brazil. Also taking into consideration your comments about changing the mix of your business. When do you expect to see a full normalization in cost of risk and around what level would this normalization be? Thank you.",

In terms of revenue, we see mid-to single-digit decrease in NII, down mid-single digits versus last year and fees down low double digit due to the fact that I was explaining about what we're doing with the switcher campaign and the higher cash back. You're going to see that it's going to be much better in '25 because exactly we're preparing the bank towards that. Also, we're very focused on profitability.

The mortgage dynamics in the U.K. seem to suggest that margins in this business will pick up substantially from the fourth quarter of this year into next year, just as an additional comment. Brazil cost of risk, we still believe the cost of risk this year should be somehow below cost of risk last year. Remember that when you look at cost of risk quarter-on-quarter, it was a substantial increase in the fourth quarter when we look at year-on-year X the fourth quarter and we look at cost of risk for the full of 2024, we would expect to see an improvement in the cost of risk. So year-on-year because the fourth quarter will come out in the fourth quarter of this year, you should see the most significant improvement in cost of risk in the fourth quarter. And then provisions in the U.S. are normalizing. Cost of risk this year should be somehow around 2% or slightly below 2%.",

    "text": "Thank you very much, Jose. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's presentation, as always, first, I will talk about our results in the context of our strategy, then Jose will review our financial performance in greater detail, and then I will conclude with some final messages as Jose said, we will then open the floor for all your questions. So the main highlights of our results in this first are the following: Q3 was another record quarter for Santander, which continues to demonstrate the benefits from the execution of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reached €3.3 billion, 12% above the Q3 on '23, on the back of a solid franchise of 171 million customers that continues to increase as we improve our customer experience through simplification, automation and leverage of our global platforms. Profit reached €9.3 billion in the first nine months, also a record of 14%, supported by strong customer revenue growth across regions and all the global businesses. We achieved this as we invest for the future, and we continue to make excellent progress towards a simpler and more integrated model, which has helped us to improve our efficiency by 229 basis points and increased our RoTE to 16.2%. Finally, our balance sheet remained solid with a sound capital ratio and robust credit quality and contributed to the strong profitable growth, shareholder value creation, and attractive remuneration. Dividend per share increased by 14% and the cash dividend per share will be 39% higher in '24. Going into more detail into our income statement. As always, we present growth rates in both current and constant euros. This quarter, there were no material differences between them year-on-year, but as Jose will explain later there are most significant on the quarter-on-quarter. Our P&L remains strong from top to bottom. Number one, strong top-line supported by all our businesses and regions, NII fees, both at record levels accounted for over 95% of total income, driving the vast majority of our revenue growth. Number two, expenses grew below revenue and inflation, showcasing the possible effects of our transformation -- sorry, the positive effects of our transformation. Three, loan-loss provisions were fairly in line with average lending and credit quality also had an excellent performance. All in all, as shown over time, our results are sustainable and less volatile than peers due to our business and geographical diversification, the high quality of our revenues and a prudent approach to risk. We are on track to exceed the targets we set in January and upgraded in July. Solid business dynamics reported high-single digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved as we accelerate ONE Transformation and increased operational leverage. Cost of risk is expected to remain in line with our '24 target on the back of active risk management, strong labor markets and interest rates dropping in most of our countries. As a reference, year-to-date cost of risk improved to 1.14% even with the additional provisions in Poland in Q2. Our CET1 ratio ended September at 12.5%, and we are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation fully loaded. And our RoTE is already above the target we set for the end of the year. Our execution of ONE Transformation continues to boost our operational leverage, structurally improving both revenue and cost performances, simplifying and automating processes and our active spread management have already contributed 259 basis points of efficiencies, since we started surpassing the levels, which we expected to reach at the end of '25. Our global businesses continue to drive the group's profitability and have delivered 82 basis points in efficiency gains. Finally, our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated 72 basis points inefficiencies so far. Remember that we are focused on going back to basics, offering the best products and user experience to our customers and boosting operational leverage through our global platforms to support value creation for our shareholders based on profitable growth with minimal volatility. This is already reflected in the great performance of our businesses. All of them showed solid revenue growth, retail and consumer and will strongly improve our efficiency ratio, leading to higher RoTE, while CIB and payments reflect our efforts to develop new products and global platforms which has started to deliver results. This is a fantastic example of how our model works. Higher interest rates benefit some of our retail franchises, while other parts of our business perform better under different circumstances. But overall our combination of highly diversified businesses allows us to deliver consistent profitable growth and value creation. The global businesses and the cross collaboration are helping us to extract the full potential from our unique combination of local leadership and global capabilities with a cost of infrastructure that delivers efficiency and scalability. This allows us to reach our '25 profitability targets. In retail, which is at the heart of our banking business, we are working to become the number one bank for customers. Let's look at how ONE Transformation is delivering results. Innovation is key. We're enhancing our digital onboarding and promoting simpler customer journey and better experiences across the bank. For example, in Brazil, we have reduced onboarding time by 50%, which has contributed to a 3% customer growth only this quarter. We are progressing fast towards a common operating model across our banks, which together with automation and digitalization, free stop time of our people to focus on commercial activities on our branches. Dedication of resources to non-commercial activities has dropped by 11%, since we started with ONE Transformation. Deployment of our global platform remains on track. And for example, in the U.K., customer has been migrated to our global app that already operates in Spain, Portugal, Poland and Openbank with great success. As a result, our profit grew 29% year-on-year, with RoTE up 400 basis points to 18.5% on the back of revenue up close to double-digit on good performance of NII and fees with all regions growing especially Europe and South America. Cost is well under control, down 5% in real term, reflecting structural benefits from our transformation and provisions improving and the cost of risk fairly stable at really comfortable levels. Going forward, our improvements in customer experience, the implementation of a common operating model and the deployment of our global tech platform will drive additional customer growth, better efficiency and profitability. In consumer, our priority is to continue expanding our leadership across all our footprint. Our best-in-class global solutions are integrated into our partners' processes. For example, we have integrated our front in Hyundai systems, providing our customers the best digital experience, faster credit approval and time to pay. We are making great progress in our deposit strategy to increase NII stability and reduce the funding cost. Deposits increased 12% year-on-year on the back of our deposit gathering platforms. The deployment of global platforms is key to scale of business, reduce our cost to serve and improve profitability. Last Monday, we reached an important milestone in the U.S. with the nationwide launch of Openbank. In the last four weeks, we have already gathered around €200 million in deposits and welcomed over 7,000 clients. We also launched Zinia, a co-branded card with Amazon in Germany, and we are deploying a new operational functionality. Consumer continues to grow a strong operational leverage with a 9% net operating income increase and some profit growth on the back of, number one, strong revenue with solid NII performance and 25% fee growth; number two, cost falling 2% in real terms, thanks to our transformation efforts, even as we continue to invest in growth; and third, LLP is normalizing in Europe and in the U.S. in line with expectations. Overall, we continue to see positive operating trends, and we expect them to improve on the back of lower rates and volume growth. We are building a world-class CIB business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to grow profit, while maintaining the same low risk profile. Number one, we are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the U.S., building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across group. Revenue in CIB in the U.S. rose 41% year-on-year and is expected to boost cross-border revenue across the group as we continue to progress on our U.S. build-out initiative. We continue to execute our global markets plan, which is starting to pay off with institutional sales doubling in Europe and more than tripling in the U.S. Number two, we're expanding and sophisticating our centers of expertise, while strengthening our financial sponsor franchise, which is leading to business opportunities in M&A, capital markets and GTB across the group and continues to pay off with several first deals. This quarter, for example, for the first time, we were appointed sole bookrunner for an IPO of a SPAC, and we acted as the lead left underwriter in an LBO transaction with one of the largest industrial focused investment firms and these are just a few examples of a long list. Third, we are driving cross-border revenues on the back of enhanced client solutions and global collaboration. We had a great number of cross-border deals in Q3 such as also resulting from the collaboration of our teams in Mexico and Spain, France and Brazil, Peru and Mexico or Italy and France, among others. CIB reached solid results with revenue up 9% after a record '23 making the first nine months the best ever fees growing at double-digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from client flows. And the best is still to come. Growth will accelerate going forward as we continue to execute our strategy on a global basis. Moving on to Wealth. We continue to build the best wealth and insurance manager in Europe and the Americas. How? Number one, by improving customer relationships through the best customer service and right solutions resulting in double-digit growth in private banking customer and fees. We are shifting our product offering towards value-added solutions, such as discretionary portfolio management, advisory and alternative investments, and this has also supported Spain double-digit increase in the number of private banking customers and a 22% total revenue growth. Number two is promoting collaboration with other businesses, especially with retail and CIB, which is a major driver for growth and allow us to capture network benefits. Collaboration fees increased by 13% year-on-year. Number three is developing global platforms across all the businesses and digitalizing our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and really promote growth. Good examples of this are the recent implementation of a single operating platform from alternative products and the deployment of San Conecta in Mexico and Brazil, which boost the distribution network capabilities and provides real-time information about funds and markets. In summary, we are accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. Attributable profit rose 15% on the back of a strong activity and fees growing at double-digit across the three businesses. Finally, efficiency improved 210 basis points year-on-year and RoTE rose 400 basis points to 81%. Finally, payments. As I already advanced last quarter, we have a unique position on both sides of the value chain, issuing where we manage more than 100 million cards group-wide and merchant acquiring. In merchant, we are one of the largest acquirers in Latin America, Spain and Portugal, with the right balance between growth and profitability. Get the total payments volume and PagoNxt open market revenue keeps growing strongly, which is helping us to consolidate our presence in core market, such as Brazil and Mexico, where we maintain a leadership position. And at the same time, we build up market share in fast-growing markets, such as Chile, where we recently launched Getnet. Our payments hub already processes all type of payments, for example, credit transfers, direct debits or instant payments and international payments for several countries and businesses. We have already migrated 800 million transactions this year. This is 5x more than the same period last year. Also, we continue to deploy part our global cards platform. In Brazil, we currently manage more than 8 million debit cards through [indiscernible], and we are on track to full migration by Q2 '25 to manage around 17 million total cards. In a second phase, we will start with the credit card portfolio. At the same time, we continue to boost our cards proposition through our Risk Data Lab, our solution based on AI. Payments delivered strong results with good revenue trends in both businesses, cost under control and sound credit quality in cards, which drove to a 10% profit growth, excluding the non-recurring items with cost in Q2. PagoNxt EBITDA margin improved to 23% backed by Getnet with one of the best ratios among our competitors. We expect cost efficiency and CapEx optimization to continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters. Our capital ratio has improved this year from 12.3% to 12.5% backed by strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and shareholder remuneration. As a result, we continue to grow our value creation, which in terms of TNAV plus EPS increased 14%, which represents around €10 billion year-on-year, and we are increasing our shareholder remuneration. In September, the Board of Directors approved an interim distribution against H1 '24 results, which is being executed in two equal parts, a cash dividend of €0.10 per share, which will be paid from the 1st of November and a share buyback program up to €1.5 billion. This is currently underway. Cash dividend will be 39% higher in '24, and at the same time, since '21, if we include the full amount of the current share buyback program, Santander we have repurchased 12.5% of its outstanding shares. I'll leave you now with Jose, who will get going our financial performance in more detail.",

    "text": "Thank you, Hector. Let me go into more detail the P&L and the capital. As Hector has mentioned, we are yet again reporting record results as our transformation continues to drive operational leverage. Revenue grew 8% on the back of the highest NII and fees in our history and the best efficiency ratio in the last years, boosting the net operating income, which rose 13% year-on-year. Provisions grew only slightly even after the expected normalization in consumer and the Swiss franc provisions in Poland, we recorded in the second quarter, while cost of risk fell in the quarter. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the upward trend in profit, which grew 1% quarter-on-quarter in euros, 5% in constant euros, driven mainly by customer revenue and lower provisions. This quarter, there is an effect from the depreciation of some currencies affecting the quarter-on-quarter comparison, but as you can see in the P&L, the impact year-on-year is not material. Please remember that the last quarter, we decided to take a more conservative approach to value -- to recognizing the value of the results obtained in Argentina. So we began to apply an inflation adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso, which in the quarter was 1,618 compared to the official exchange rate of 1,069 to the euro. And obviously, this is a much more conservative exchange rate than the one used by our peers. This approach caused some distortions in the quarter-on-quarter comparison that I will comment during the presentation only where relevant. Total revenue increased 8% with all businesses and regions growing driven by customer revenue growth, which made up more than 90% of total revenue. This strong growth was primarily supported by our retail business, which continues to grow close to double-digits with good performance in NII and fees, especially in the Americas and also by CIB growing across the three lines of business on the back of good activity levels, mainly in global banking and markets. Consumer revenue also rose supported in this case by volumes and active asset repricing and double-digit growth in fees across our geographies. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in wealth, driven by solid commercial activity, both in private banking and in asset management. Payments is growing at good trends, showing relatively good underlying performance. As both PagoNxt and cards increased, even more so if we exclude the onetime positive fee recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year. Finally, the Corporate Centre's revenue improved on the back of less negative impact from FX hedging. Turning to NII, net interest margin. Most of our revenue came from net interest income, which increased 9% year-on-year, supported by all our businesses and regions, basically due to active price management, particularly in retail in Europe and in consumer and higher volumes and the benefits from negative sensitivity to rates in South America -- in retail, South America, which is now very evident, especially in Brazil and Chile and also good activity levels in our Global Banking business in CIB. NII was resilient quarter-on-quarter, rising 1% in constant euros in a new interest rate environment, particularly driven by retail, but it was up 2% with the vast majority of our countries positively contributing in the quarter, especially Brazil, driven by higher average volumes, Poland due to better spreads and higher volumes and the U.K. supported by good price management. In terms of profitability, we improved our net interest margin year-on-year. This is explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spread focusing on profitability, not market share, which more than outweighed higher funding costs. We were able to contain thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration in Europe and deposit repricing downwards in South America. As we commented last quarter, we have seen a slight deceleration in net interest margin and net interest income in line with our expectations. Please remember that the decrease in net interest margin in the second quarter was due to the prudent adjustment we made to the exchange rate in Argentina. And this quarter, net interest margin was also affected by the hyperinflation account in Argentina and the depreciation of the real and the Mexican peso and to a lesser extent, the beginning of a new interest rate cycle in Europe. Over the last few quarters, we have gradually adapted the sensitivity of our balance sheet to position for this new monetary policy cycle. This and the positive contribution we expect from our consumer businesses put us in a good condition, in a good position to mitigate the effects of margin compression expected in Europe and North America going forward. In an environment of low credit demand in general, we generated another record in fee income, reflecting our transformation efforts to promote connectivity across the group and provide the best customer service. Retail increased as more customers chose Santander as the primary financial service provider. We added 5 million new customers over the last 12 months to a total of 171 million customers. Outstanding performance in consumer, largely driven by increased insurance penetration in Europe. CIB also grew from record levels last year, especially in the U.S. on the bank of strong dynamics in Global Banking. We had a 16% increase in wealth, with all three businesses growing at double-digits, and payments was impacted, as I mentioned before, by the one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter in 2023 in Brazil. Our transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model continued to deliver structural efficiency gains. Our cost-to-income ratio for the nine month period improved to 41.7%, the best level that we have reported in the last 15 years, one of the best in the sector and is already at better levels than the guidance we provided for 2024. Costs declined 1% year-on-year in real terms despite the lagged effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs on our investments in transformation. By business, costs remain very well under control in retail and consumer, which represents 70% of our cost base. More than 90% of the nominal cost increase came from CIB as per our strategy to reinforce our CIB franchise. Costs remain contained in wealth, even with higher commercial activity and were fairly flat in payments even as we invest in global platforms. As we look ahead, structural improvements from our new operating model, which help us achieve our target of maintaining cost to income at around 42% in 2024, while it should improve further next year. Credit quality remains robust, around and across our footprint in line with our expectations with record low unemployment rates in most countries and easing monetary policies. Credit quality improved year-on-year as reflected both in the NPL ratio and lower coverage needs. The NPL portfolio has collateral guarantees and provisions that account for 90% of its total exposure. 12-month cost of risk improved to 1.18%. In our retail and consumer, 12-month cost of risk improved in the quarter. In retail, there were some underlying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved across Europe and remained at very low levels in the U.K. and Portugal. In Brazil, it fell for the second quarter in a row. And in Mexico, it also declined in the quarter following a year of expected normalization. Similarly, in consumer, 12-month cost of risk was impacted year-on-year by the normalization we expected, but it dropped in the quarter to 2.12%. The cost of risk in the first nine months of the year was 1.14%, putting us in good position to end the year comfortably within our target of 1.2%. Finally, turning to capital. Our fully loaded capital ratio remains at a comfortable level backed by strong organic capital generation and significant risk-weighted asset mobilization. This quarter, we generated 43 basis points organically on the back of 52 basis points from profit generation partially offset by risk-weighted asset growth and by minorities, we recorded a 26 basis point charge for shareholder remuneration in line with our 50% payout policy. We had 18 basis points of regulatory charges, mostly related to model updates in low default portfolios. And finally, we had positive impacts from the placement of Santander, Poland and ALCO portfolio valuations, which were offset by impacts on deductions, pensions in the most part -- for the most part. We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital profitability and productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.9% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above that of our back book at 16%. Our centralized asset management desk, which aims to optimize capital deployment is achieving outstanding results. In the first nine months of the year, we have disposed of an amount of capital equivalent to €40 billion in risk-weighted assets, the cost of capital of half of that of new originations. In addition, one-third of our balance sheet that matures every year is being substituted by more profitable new business. The combination of these actions explains the expanding profitability and resilient capital ratio. That's all from my side. Hector, back to you. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Jose. It is important to say that our progress towards the targets we set for '25 in our last Investor Day is ahead of plan as we continue to leverage our unique competitive advantages and excellent execution of our strategy by our teams. Sound CET1 levels and strong execution of our capital allocation plans, further improving our profitability to about 16% and delivering 14% value creation and increased remuneration to our shareholders. In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are evident. Q3 was another record quarter on the back of strong customer revenue with all regions and businesses contributing, which results in the best nine months profit ever with all-time high NII fees and net operating income at a 19% EPS growth. Sustained progress in our structural changes towards a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale is driving both higher revenue and lower cost to achieve the vast efficiency ratio we have reported for the last 15 years. Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder value creation. As a result, we remain on track to exceed the '24 targets we set in January and upgraded last quarter, and we are in a great position to continue growing, increasing profitability and delivering shareholder value creation. The progress of the last 10 years to simplify and align our model in all our businesses and now deploy our own tech stack is already evident. And as we continue to execute our strategy, we will deliver on primary target of double-digit TNAV per share plus EPS growth through the cycle. And now we're very happy to take your questions. Thanks.",

    "text": "Let me give it a first keep and then Jose basically could be give you a better idea. It's interesting to see that if you see NII in constant, you'll see that it's 1% up, okay? The effect of Argentina is the one that's hitting us in the current euros, okay? It is important to explain, first of all, that the sensitivity of our balance sheet to movements in rates is mostly concentrated in retail and commercial business. This is about 60% of the group balance sheet with some parts showing a really positive sensitivity in Europe and other is a negative one like the one we have in Brazil, as we already know. Europe and Brazil concentrate about 80% to 90% of the rate exposure. Over the past few quarters, we have been very proactively managing and working to reduce the sensitivity of the different balance sheets and position them to lower its environments. For example, in the case of Europe, we have reduced the sensitivity to around 25%. That's one quarter of what was at the beginning of the rate cycle. In places like Brazil, for example, we are taking measures to reduce the sensitivity further by doing some things to the ALCO and also taking some hedges. As you have already seen this year, the retail business is operating leverage is 10 points. We are growing the top line, not just because of higher interest rates, but also because we're changing the operating model, which is the most important part that you guys need to concentrate. We're growing customers, for example, 2.6 million in the third quarter alone. And we are keeping costs flat, which is quite important because that's creating an operating leverage and improving our margins. And this basically think that we will continue improving thanks to, first of all, the geographical and business diversification, the strong focus on capital allocation and the strong focus on profitability that we have up to this point. I don't know, Jose, if you would like to complement on the margins and then we'll take on cost.",

    "text": "Yes, definitely. Thanks, Hector. So let me explain Argentina in a bit more detail. In June, we used an exchange rate of 1,499 and we explained at the time that we are devaluating depreciating the exchange rate with inflation, independent of the official exchange rate. The official exchange rate as of now is 1,069. for the quarter -- for the end of the quarter, we used 1,618. And remember that when you use 1,618 inflation accounting, you adjust backwards all the accounts to that exchange rate. So we have two impacts on our P&L. One, there is over €100 million negative quarter-on-quarter increase in the monetary position that comes in other income. And in Argentina, as interest rates come down, and we have a very liquid balance sheet and is invested mostly in bonds. The yield earned on this bond portfolio is lower. And quarter-on-quarter, it is over €200 million drop in local currency, when you look at local currency, there is over €200 million drop in the yield coming from these investments. So Argentina actually explains most of the drop in net interest income quarter-on-quarter, but also it means around €300 million -- over €300 million impact on total revenue. So as Hector explained, we have been reducing our sensitivity to rates, both in euros and in Brazil, which obviously outside Europe is the highest sensitivity we have. In Europe, we have been buying an increase in the ALCO portfolio. If we look at the total euro ALCO portfolio we have, which is Spain, Portugal and the consumer finance. We have €50 billion in euro government bonds with an average maturity of over six years and a yield of 3.2%, 3.3%. The second action we took was to float the liabilities, the market liabilities, and we also hedged the repricing of our mortgages in Spain by signing some forward stocks. So this has reduced the sensitivity of the net interest income in euros quite significantly to around a quarter of the sensitivity we had prior to entering this cycle of higher rates. In Brazil, we did the opposite. In Brazil, we are changing the mix of the liabilities and also floating the assets. Net-net, when we look into 2025, for 2024, we see NII down a little bit in current euros, but we see NII up in constant euros. Thanks to these measures that we have discussed. And these estimates are based on forward curve rates -- forward rate curves, sorry.",

    "text": "Thank you, Jose. Ignacio, in terms of cost, it's very important that you understand the following. This is not about a cost cutting exercise. This is about changing the model and the go-to model. We're basically introducing in the whole group. He's talking about, I mean, take a look at the amount of the catalog of products that we have in the group. We have diminished them by almost a third from 10,000 products were down to less than 7,500, for example. We are changing completely the model we're doing a strong simplification. We're doing a lot of automation, but most importantly, by deploying the global platforms we are working together and spending less money on what we do every single day. So ONE Transformation is driving structural efficiency gains and operating leverage. Just a piece of that, the costs grew less than half of the revenue growth. We're delivering positive jobs that are helping to reduce the efficiency to 41.7%, which is 229 basis points lower than a year ago. This is placing us on track to meet the target being at 42% in '24. So we're going to be much better, and we believe that we're going to continue that. The new paradigm is focusing on absolute cost, okay? Our ambition is not to lower cost, it's exactly to lower cost in absolute euro million terms, which is quite important given all the different countries that we operate. It is true that costs are up 2.5%, but we look at the cost performance in real terms. In real terms, costs are down minus 1% year-on-year. That's a remarkable performance although the operating leverage with the strong declines that I described in retail, reflecting the transformation effort and the cost containment in consumer and payments, while we invest in the global platforms and continue to grow, all right? So the higher cost, as Jose explained, reflect also the currency depreciation and the seasonal effects, the salary agreements bonus accrual and CIB is the bulk because we're investing in the business to basically get out of it more revenue and is actually getting there. So in 2024, efficiency ratio is around 42%. We acknowledge this ratio is already at the level we committed for the '25 ID target and all the investments we have been doing will not only help maintain costs flat, but grew the revenue faster. So our ambition is, therefore, to do better than initially planned next year in '25 in the cost to income, as we described. So I don't know if that basically answers your questions.",

First of all, let me tell you that as you correctly said, it's not possible this time to reliably predict the financial impact of the ruling other elements that affect the financial impact on our accounts. This said, in any event, the potential impact is not expected to be material for the group's financial position, okay? It's very important, nor will affect the achievement of the group financial targets for '24. So if you make the numbers, and we are reiterating the guidance of above 16% that basically tells you where do we believe the number is, okay? So it's very important, and I will reiterate that again, that it will not change our '24 guidance. So that basically gives you a ballpark idea of what do we believe the number should be.

We still believe that it's going to be this 20 to 30 basis points. So this doesn't change our target. So our target for capital for year-end, remember, since the beginning of the year has been between 1,240 to 1,250. We are at 1,250 in the upper end of the range, and we think we could -- we will close the year more or less at this level. For next year, day one Basel III impact basically close to zero, slightly negative or slightly positive, but it's not going to change much. So day one capital ratio for Santander under Basel III will be more or less the same with which we will end 2024 and the fully loaded. And when I mean fully loaded, I mean fully loaded, taking into account all the charges we expect up to 2033. So we are not excluding the 2029 to 2033 charges. So fully, fully, fully loaded, we think the impact is going to be 40 basis points, which means that we will be on day one above the 12% that we set as our target.

So you've given basically a very limited impact for the next 10 years, which you're already at 12.5%. And with the mobilization you're doing on the balance sheet, it does look like you generate -- you're going to generate capital above the 12.5% you're currently sitting on. So the question is, as we think about '25, '26 are you willing to operate in a range of 12.5%, 13%, let's say? Or do you expect to grow into that 12.5% or would you consider sort of increasing distributing any excess or increasing the payout? I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that capital generation if we do have that excess capital generation? And on -- and I apologize to follow-up on the Santander U.K. that's the only explanation in my view, why the share price might be down this morning. You've been quoted Jose saying that it's less than €600 million. And I understand it's not an impact for 2024, but it might be an impact beyond that.

    "text": "Thank you, Alvaro. Okay. Let me explain you a little bit what is very important. I mean, as you know, Jose explained exactly what we're doing in terms of rotating the balance sheet, okay? You've got to understand that we're changing completely the model of the bank in the world we used to. The bank used to consume a huge amount of RWAs to generate profits, okay? We're changing the model in a way. And the most important thing of that changing the model is becoming the number one bank to our clients. But becoming that, basically, you generate quite a lot of revenue by something different than just used RWAs in order to generate those. That basically explains you the good fees momentum that we're having. And you're going to continue to see that over in the future, all right? So if we continue changing this model use less capital to become actually much more profitable that basically will tell you that we could be able to accumulate much more capital that we're doing today, all right? We feel really comfortable that we can manage the bank very well at these levels of capital, but I do believe that we will be accumulating capital. Also, as we have a tremendous capacity to generate assets. We also have now with the asset desk in place to amend those capacity to move those assets out of the books, right? So -- and by the way, if you saw what Jose said, we are doing so and making money on top of it. Also, we're servicing, we're getting fees and servicing the assets that we sell. So it's over one in the sense. So the model of the bank is changing in that sense, and it's becoming much more profitable and less dependent on capital. So yes, I believe that capital generation will be much better, and we believe that we could be accumulating more capital on organic way in the future.

We need to clarify the perimeter of commissions. We need to clarify the vintages because the ruling talks up between 2005 to 2024. The FCA focus is between 2014 to 2021, the percentage of redress, the claim rate, the compensatory interest. So there are many moving parts. The ruling has been taken to the Supreme Court. We expect the FCA report in May. So there are many moving parts. We are analyzing this. And obviously, we will make a very conservative assumption once we are able to come to a conclusion on all these variables that need to be put into the estimation. However, we are very confident that, as Hector explained the impact, and I'm talking about what we will charge in the next few weeks with this conservative approach, will not be material for the group, and we will still meet our objectives, our return on tangible equity target for the year, which is 16% or slightly above 16%. And that's all we can say. What happens with the FCA report in May, that's basically speculation. So obviously, we will make a decision based on the actual ruling based on if we have time to take into consideration the Supreme Court guidance on this, and in any case, obviously, the provisioning that we will take will be a conservative provision.",

If you could remind us how many months in lag that is? And my second question is with respect to the U.S. profitability. I mean this is a part of your business that's negatively correlated to rates.

In Brazil, also, we are changing a little bit the model that we have today. As you know, we used to use very hardly RWAs. We used to basically give out a lot of loans. Now we're changing a little bit the way we do things. We are basically focused on profitability, okay? Laser focus on profitability, which is basically changing a little bit of mix, also changing a little bit, I mean, the way we manage and we're managing the loan portfolio as a portfolio by division. We used to basically grow in every single segment. Now we're not doing so. We're basically looking at the segments that basically have the best profitability and the best cost of risk in equal. So we're being very choosy in the way we manage that and we're doing that all along the group. Also, we're very much focused on increasing the amount of clients and the amount of transactional clients that gives deposits and have their deposits with us, also their payrolls. And it's quite important to understand that, that basically is going to improve margins because we're improving the funding of overall of the franchise in Brazil, okay? NII, if you see this is good quarter, it's up more than 3% in the quarter. It is more than 22% in year-on-year. What's behind the performance, as I told you, healthy volume growth, changing the mix and the lower rates because we're doing and increasing the number of clients. If you remember in my presentation, I talked about the new onboarding that basically is very competitive and is basically getting us much more clients. It is true that the rate outlook has changed, but now the market is having some rate hikes that will mean the NII growth will be a bit less intense than we expected. And we thought at the beginning of the year. But nevertheless, we still expect Brazilian real to grow around the mid-teens marked by the end of '24, and we will have further growth in '25. And if we continue with our strategy and gaining clients and getting more deposits at a good place, I think we could be better off, okay? And let me take the opportunity also to flag the opportunity that Brazil has delivered almost a 17% RoTE. This is strong profitability improvement. It's not just reliant on NII growth, but also it's very important, the good delivery on fees because also, as I explained, we're becoming the number one bank to our clients. So selling other products, insurance, some of the things that are basically helping us out. Also, it's very important to take a look at the cost contention that we have had and also a stable cost of risk in the year. I believe that -- and I don't believe, I really remain very optimistic on Brazil and the ability to continue expanding its profitability through '25, okay?

So it's very important to understand, first of all, that we are not a full-fledged commercial bank in the U.S. We are focused on the businesses we are focused, okay? We are focused mainly in our consumer business. The consumer business, as you say has negative sensitivity to rates. That's exactly why we launched Openbank there. And we're also using SBNA, our commercial bank to fund that all right? We've been also changing the mix in a very strong way. I was looking at the numbers in terms of the new mix we have. And as you're talking about a mix that is 42% with FICOs really on the prime and near prime level, okay? And we're decreasing the amount of risk that we have to deep so prime and subprime. So that basically makes combination and it's going to give you a pretty good idea of what we're doing there. In terms of consumer, it's very important that you understand that, I mean, as you know, we are at scale player. We are also leveraging the relationship we have with the OEMs and we were able to capture very good agreements with INEOS, Lotus, Tesla and Mitsubishi. It's very important for you to understand that some of these changes in the P&L, you're not going to see them at the revenue level due to the fact that a lot of this is basically done, for example, on the electrical vehicles. And electrical vehicles, we're buying them because it's mostly leasing. So that basically tells you that it's not going to appear on the revenue line, but you see it on the page back we have on the tax that we get back for the electric vehicles. So that basically changes a little bit the outlook. But all in all, I really see that the U.S. will continue to thrive over the next year or so, okay? Also in the commercial side, the business is doing well. We have this expertise. We also you know that we have the JV with the FDIC, which has been tremendously successful and I think will continue so. I have had a solid performance. And then you talk about the CIB advisory services. CIB just grew 41% year-on-year in terms of the fees that we are collecting on that business. But also, you don't see how the U.S. is helping the rest of the business to thrive. If you take a look at the fees and CIB Europe also are being pushed up by all the businesses we are doing by using the U.S. teams to help us out, getting some of our new business that we didn't use to get. Also in Latin America, if you take a look at, for example, not just cross-border M&A, but if you take a look at what we've been doing in DCM, you will see that we have become one of the three most important players in DCM in that market just because of the expertise we got into the table. So when the Mexican UMS did a €7 billion transaction at the beginning of the year, we're one of the four banks, and we're the only non-American bank in the game. So those are the particular things that are happening to us given that now we have with the local strength that we have, we're combining the global expertise that we're bringing on to the table. And wealth or also, we have a leading brand in Latin America. That business is basically working as a Swiss clock. So I really do believe that the U.S. will continue to thrive very good outlook for '25 and really good numbers coming up in terms of the P&L we see there.",

So the cost and the volumes are flat in the quarter. We just only launched Openbank in the country. On your website, you said are paying 11x the national average for deposit? How much do you expect in terms of volumes to gain from your Openbank franchise and where do you see the cost above -- and just quickly [indiscernible] effective corporate tax rate for 2025.

In terms of the manage changes we have done to Spain, basically, they're not going to change the plan that we had before is we're going to basically very much focus on profitability. That's number one. We're also changing the model. Spain is one of the most important places where we believe we have an opportunity on ONE Transformation, okay, due to the fact that we believe there is a huge opportunity of simplification, automation in what we have there. A lot of -- if you compare one of our branches for example in Portugal versus our branches in Spain, 90% of what we do in a branch in Portugal, it's basically taking care of clients. 50% of what we do in Spain is taking care of incidence problems, different situations, et cetera. So it's very important that we do that simplification and then transformation and automation that we need to do on the back in Spain, so we make our business much more reliable, much more efficient and with a much better cost structure. Thirdly, we are, as you know, deploying the global platforms and Spain is one of the places that we're going to be concentrated the most in the near term, all right? So it's quite important to understand that we will continue doing that and we will continue basically focusing on managing the deposit betas as we have done, right? So very much concentrated on that. Getting new clients. It's very important to acknowledge that for the seventh consecutive month, we have grown on clients in Spain in a mature market that basically tells you that the model is working that exactly we're delivering on what we believe is the right thing to do. So we will continue to do as we have been doing in the past in terms of transforming Spain in what we need to do, but also with global platforms, we're going to be able to be much more competitive, more and more efficient and better for our clients. Also, this structure of being the number one bank to our clients is very important in Spain because this basically will allow us to sell them more products. One product that is very important, and we are punching below our weight, is insurance, for example, in which some of our competitors are much more bigger than us in that sense. So there is a huge opportunity of where we can do that. Also, if you take a look on CIB. CIB, we have had a really interesting and important lever, given that we're using our U.S. teams to support what we're doing here in Spain. So that is helping us out quite a lot. And we've been actually number one in the market for the whole year. So Spain will continue, as we say. In terms of the tax rate in the U.S…",

Should we expect margin expansion to prevail? Or should we expect it to stabilize the customer spread to stabilize more or less around these levels, just basically how do you see the outlook for NII in the U.K.? Then if I may pick up a bit on the interest rate sensitivity questions that were raised before. You mentioned that you lowered the NII sensitivity in 20% to 25% of what it was prior to the change in rate cycle. I was just wondering if you could update us on exactly where the sensitivity lies now particularly for Spain, but also for some of the larger geographies, that would be much appreciated.

    "text": "Thank you, Carlos. Okay. On the U.K., I would like to tell you, I mean, I think it's one of the countries that we have one of the greatest opportunities in terms of ONE Transformation. We have a very good advantage of simplifying. That's something that we are very concentrated on also the automation of what we're doing there, we are actually lowering the amount of people that we have. We started the year with 20,000 people. We're going to end up with 18,000. So simplification and automation is well underway. And then as I said on the presentation, it's quite important that we already start deploying the global platforms. OneApp came in U.K. just about. We did the big bank and change all our clients there, and it's becoming really helpful in order to gain new clients helping us in the deposit base and also helping us in terms of NPS, okay? It is important to say that we believe that we have much better market economic dynamics, okay, lending activity, we see it picking up. We are very much also focused on profitability in that market as well. We see more rational behavior of the U.K. banks, better pricing on the new loans, plus better pricing of deposits. We are proactively managing deposits as I told you, first of all, with the new clients coming in with the new H [ph] account that we launched, that's been helping us. So we reiterate our view that NII will improve in the H2 versus H1, okay, as you have said. We're going to finish '24 with NII down only mid-single-digit instead of the minus 9% that we have reported in the first nine months, and we expect further rate cut in the remaining of '24. But the outlook of '25 is positive in the sense of what we have seen so far.",

In constant euros, as I said, we would expect NII to increase next year, maybe 2%, 3%. In Spain, you've seen a 2.5% interest rate in Europe for the mid of next year of 2025. We would expect a slight decrease in NII in Spain. In the U.K., as Hector just commented a slight increase in NII. In the U.S., we would expect high-single-digit increase; in Mexico, mid- to high single-digit increase; in Brazil, this is quite important. The outlook for interest rates in Brazil is really important to estimate the future evolution of NII, we expect average interest rates in Brazil next year to be around 11%, 11%, 11.5%, with this level of interest rates, NII in Brazil should be up mid-single-digits. And basically -- and finally, in DCB, also high single-digit increase with the level of interest rates that we just talked about. So as I said, if you compare these with the sensitivity in the way up that we had in the countries in Europe, for instance, or in DCB as interest rates were going up, the sensitivity we have in the way going down is significantly lower.",

You are currently growing profits at 14% year-on-year in the nine months. And I know you usually give guidance in February, but do you think 2025 profits will actually be above 2024 in your view? And the second is a follow-up on the capital aberration we've done before. I'm looking at Slide 23. With our regulatory headwinds, you would have built 35 basis points of capital in one quarter after distribution. Can you confirm with Q4, we should exhaust the bulk of the expected regulatory headwinds? And is the higher profitability than yielding to higher capital buildup versus the 10 basis points per quarter guidance that you have given us? Final thing is a clarification on Basel IV. Before you said that on day 1, CET1 should be flattish. If I remember correctly, there were 20 basis points of impacts this year that should have reversed with Basel IV adoption. Can you clarify that? Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Andrea. Let me give you a little of what we believe. First of all, I must tell you that I have great confidence that we'll deliver. And in some metrics like cost to income over deliver on the financial targets that we set on the Investor Day for the period of '23 to '25, okay. '25 will be better than '24. For '25, we expect to continue to grow revenues, especially fees, as I explained with the new mobile deployment that we're doing. We're going to further improve the operating leverage and we're going to deliver higher profitability. And we will do this how by leveraging further the global and network businesses, okay? We're putting a lot of focus on increasing the network effect. We're doing more with less. First of all, leveraging also our products and global factories, like, for example, from our corporate bank into our commercial banks, what we're doing between CIB and the commercial business on the midsized companies and SMEs. Also ONE Transformation is leveraging platforms that help reduce the cost to serve in retail. We're talking about minus 4% on year-to-year cost per active customer and 6% year-on-year revenue per active customer. So since the start of the program, the number of products, as I said before is down almost 36%, okay. 60% of the products are now digitally available to our customers. That's 9% points up since we started the program, right? In summary, the strategy and business model diversification, disciplined approach to capital allocation, we will, we believe deliver a consistent compound effect that will continue yielding positive results for the years to come.

So on Page 23, we show 43 basis points of organic capital generation post AT1's cost of hedges, et cetera, which includes 19 basis points negative from organic risk-weighted asset growth, which is €8 billion growth partially neutralized by risk transfer initiatives of around 11 basis points or €5 billion. Remember that so far this year, we've mobilized €35 billion to €40 billion in terms of risk weighted assets. And on markets and others, we have 7 basis points from the sale of Poland. So with this, I think you can conclude both more or less the recurring capital generation, we will be able to have going forward. Obviously, the net risk-weighted asset growth, gross risk-weighted assets net of asset mobilization initiatives is the other key component. Obviously, that excess capital is being -- or that capital has been reinvested at 2.9% return on risk-weighted assets, but obviously risk capital that is being reinvested. Basel IV, you're right. The maturity will the impact -- the negative impact of the 21 basis points or 22 basis points we had in the first quarter of this year will reverse in the first quarter of next year, and this will compensate the other negative impacts, the one impacts that we have, mostly from technical adjustments to low default portfolios, corporate portfolios, et cetera. So net-net, it's obviously 0 is the net of some positives and some negatives. And amongst the positives is this 20 basis points from the maturity we used in derivatives transactions. You are right.",

And specifically, how much of that is going to follow on 2025? I'm sorry, if you have referred to this actually, but just one clarification. And then related to this, going back basically to what Alvaro was asking before, I mean what is the preferred use of any potential excess capital that you're building you're thinking basically of accelerating growth, spending a little bit of that? Or is a question basically of also considering the possibility of increasing distributions? And then final, on the capital, actually, if I may.

So that 72.5% limit to the benefit of internal models relative to standard models, we are not affected by that. That is backlog. That's what comes later from 2029 to 2033, if I'm not mistaken. We are mostly affected the 40 basis points is mostly the result of operational risk. That will come over the next four or five years, if I'm not mistaken. So that's how these 40 basis points are going to be added to the phasing in our case. I think Hector already answered the question about the excess capital and budget. On a recurring basis, obviously, the demand for private credit today is enormous. I'm not going to say it's infinite, but it's huge. So obviously, I don't think we are going to have this type of demand as interest rates come down, obviously. But we think that on a recurring basis, we should be able to mobilize somewhere between €35 billion to €55 billion in risk-weighted assets. Both obviously, SRTs will only be maybe a third of that, €15 billion a year. It's reasonable to assume that 10 to 15 will come from SRTs and the other will be from other types of hedges, another type of transactions, asset sales, et cetera, like we did this year.

Solid evolution on cost, okay, flat quarter-on-quarter. But we have a really resilient behavior of the credit quality. Cost of risk is stable at 4.78% and the more recent vintages are performing well, and we don't have any signs of deterioration. It's very important that you acknowledge what I explained at the beginning in terms of the change of mix and the change of the work we're looking at the Brazilian portfolio, okay? So as I was telling you before, we used to grow in every single segment of the market. Today, we're not doing so. We're much more focused on profitability and also on the cost of risk that we have. So you're going to see a much better performance of Brazil over the next years because we're exactly doing so, all right? So it's quite important that you see that and you're going to see basically that the outlook that we have for ours towards the end of '24 is a stable cost of risk versus '23 around 4.6%.

So we will get back to you after the call. Carlos will give you a call and clarify that. But let me just very quickly in Spain. Obviously, the betas that we ended up this year having this year were much, much lower than the ones that we expected. So we manage our cost of deposits pretty well. Basically, thanks to avoiding the transfer of current accounts to time deposits. As rates come down, those parts of the current accounts that are tied to interbank rates or the Euribor, basically private banking, corporate banking and the large corporations is adjusting as well. So going forward, we should see actually a positive contribution from year-on-year deposit cost in Spain from '24 to '25. Other Euro countries in Portugal, the situation is a little bit more extreme. So in Portugal, we would expect NII to actually go down a little bit more than in Spain next year because there, obviously, the situation is a little bit more extreme than it is in Spain.

You mentioned earlier 2.5% at the midyear 2.25% by the end of next year. Would we need to recalibrate the sensitivity if we start to get towards 2% or below 2%?",

    "text": "Chris, thank you. It also depends on how steep or flat the curve is, a curve that flattens would have a more negative impact on margins that curve that remains steep. So obviously, if rates go well below 2% and approach 0, obviously, from 2 to 0, the impact on margins is greater than from 4% to 2%. So it's not linear. But if rates stay between 2% and 2.5%, I think we are going to have a pretty good outlook in terms of NII because again, the cost of deposits at those levels will gradually approach 0, basically, and we will have at least that 2% to 2.5% margin on the asset side.",

    "text": "Thank you, Hugo. in terms of the trading income, okay, it's in any case, very small in the context of Brazil. Total revenue in -- Brazil's total revenue and it shall not overshadow the very strong operating performance in the quarter and in the improvement in profitability, okay? The client-related trading income has had a strong performance in Q3, okay? However, recent market volatility around the Brazilian real and the yield curve led to an important deterioration in local assets during Q2, following Q3, but we have stabilized those, and I believe that the outlook would be much better. This is a challenging market environment, and we've been basically offsetting this during Q3, and I believe Q4 is going to be much better. NII for the Corporate Center, NII in the corporate center should gradually decrease because of the remuneration of the liquidity that we have at the corporate center. So you should expect NII to reflect the lower rates on the liquidity that we hold at group level. And finally, the tax rate for the group, it should be fairly flat next year, maybe that's below what it will be this year, but just marginally. So for model purposes, we use the same tax rate in '25 than we will have in '24, same tax rate. And I think we've answered all the questions. Thank you very much, everybody. Investor Relations, myself, Hector are at your disposal to answer any follow-up questions that you may have. Looking forward to seeing you over the next few weeks on one-on-ones.

How excess capital ranks in terms of management priorities in 2025 and 2026, especially in the context of the M&A that we are seeing in the European banking sector?

    "text": "Thank you, Ignacio. So yes, it's important to remind -- and this is not different, but how we are thinking about the capital allocation going forward in the anticipated higher profitability and excess capital. So first of all, our capital allocation framework has, as I said already been a fundamental pillar of our strategy and the results we're delivering and we have been very disciplined and strict. So first, we prioritize profitable organic growth, investments across our businesses. We see ourselves as a compounder. So again, this organic growth creates a compounding effect on earnings, returns, book value and distributions. Second, this is followed, of course, by ordinary dividends and share buybacks to our shareholders. In terms of inorganic capital deployment, we are very clear that it has to be complementary to our strategic aims and generate attractive financial returns that have to be ahead that surpass those of any organic investments or share buybacks. And last but not least, and this is what we announced today, any incremental capital that exceeds our targets, our target range actually. And again, I want to be clear that we are not changing the target for capital above 12%. We are saying, as you've seen in the guidance that we will be at 13% in 2025. So any incremental capital following this hierarchy that I just described will be returned as additional remuneration to shareholders. In terms of cost, and I think I said that and the CEO said that also, this is incredibly important because our transformation -- ONE Transformation still has a lot of upside, especially in the retail and consumer areas that are 70% of our PAT and 70% of our cost. ONE Transformation is already delivering. You can see that in Hector slide where you can see that our cost basically flat across retail consumer with the top-line growing. But very importantly, we've grown 8 million customers. This is something you will see in the next few years that we have a strategy and a model with ONE Transformation that scales. We don't have to increase cost to grow customers and grow revenues. I said it also in my presentation that the fact that we have reduced our product on offer and retail by almost 40%, you're going to see the effects of that on the cost base, by the way, also on the revenue side in 2025 and 2026. And critical to all of this is that we are aligning our business and operating model and deploying our own tech platforms. This is going to help much more down the road, okay? Just to give you an example, Gravity, our core system, which drives a lot of the efficiencies and the front-end customer tech platforms, is operating in 30% of the Group, okay? We expect to be at 60% by the end of 2025. This is hugely important. So again, new paradigm for 2025, we are focusing on absolute cost base going down versus 2024 despite FX and inflation, this is something we feel very confident about. Given this is important, I don't know if you want to mention maybe Hector, a couple of the precise numbers on the different global divisions?",

    "text": "Yes. Thank you, Ana. As Ana has said, I mean, what is very important to understand is ONE Transformation is just starting, okay? Let me provide you a little bit more color on the cost evolution in the quarter by businesses and also the 2025 outlook. First of all, I mean, as you can see, in 2024, cost increased by 4% year-on-year, but in real terms, cost only grew 1%, okay? That's basically thanks to the operating leverage in retail and the cost containment that we have done in consumer despite the investments and growth that we have been able to do. So it's important to say that we are basically changing the engine while flying the plane at the same time. Retail and Consumer represents around 70% of the Group costs were flattish, while the revenue was up 9%. CIB and Wealth that's around 20% of the Group cost and they used to increase by 13%, as I said in the presentation, with positive jobs and showing sustainable fee income growth around 21%. That's basically -- what is doing, the investments we're doing are actually representing much more growth in the businesses. The remaining 10% is Payments, which increased by 8% year-on-year, but that reflects our strategic investments. Let me go directly, I mean, retail and on 2025, we expect cost down versus 2024 in current euros, and we expect to reiterate or improve the guidance that we provided for each business at the last Investor Day. So that's retail cost to income below the early target of less than 42% and flat ex-Argentina, so that our -- that was basically around 39.7%. Consumer cost to income is down, and it's going to be less than 40% and CIB is going to be below 45%. Thank you.",

And if that's the case, where do you see sustainable returns in an environment where you have to compete against stronger deposit franchises and new entrants with deep pockets. My second question is on the U.S. You've delivered $1.2 billion this year of net profit, but you're still benefiting from EV tax credits. I think you've mentioned on the call that you expect the U.S. to be the largest contributor to earnings growth in 2025. Could you be a little bit more specific about how much you expect it to contribute, what are the levers and what is the tax return -- sorry, the tax rate assumed?

    "text": "So we're not -- let me answer the last one first. We're not putting a threshold. We've said we will be at 13% by the end of this year. The buybacks will happen in 2025, 2026. I have explained the hierarchy. So it will depend on what organic growth we will have, we're going to be very mindful as we have in terms of the reference being buybacks for shareholders, organic growth, supporting our franchise. It's hard to be so precise. We don't have a crystal ball. What we do have is a track record that shows that in challenging times, we do better than our peers. We are confident that we can deliver the Group targets that we just said. So let me just UK, U.S. So in terms of the UK, first is that the outlook for our business in the UK, which is 88% retail, continues to be very resilient, and we are committed to the UK. Just as a number, UK retail within the Group is 9% and UK retail; we're expecting to do better. So again, a good outlook for our business in the UK. And by the way, UK NII has bottomed out in the second half of 2024. And we expect that to be slightly up next year. Second is crucial to our results and performance in the UK is, of course, our mortgage -- we're mortgage lender essentially. And what we are seeing is that asset quality continues to be resilient. We are being very conservative in terms of how we stress. I think we stress around 8%, maybe Hector or José can confirm that, but be that's a number, so we are very -- we have very strong underwriting criteria, and that is essential for our returns. And third, what we are very confident is that Hector has explained it for ONE Transformation. We can do much more in the UK by leveraging the global platforms, bringing our global scale to benefit the UK. We have already migrated the UK to Gravity and some of the improvements are going to be ahead as we improve customer experience but also reduce the cost to serve. So again, there is more upside to our profitability. It remains a core market, as we have said. On the U.S., so I want to first say that we are very committed to having a strict capital allocation. This is really important for us and has been important throughout. The UK has been top of all our countries, all our geographies over the last decade and top also the last five years. This is really important because we are committed and have been on this capital allocation and returns in euros to our shareholders. Part of that is the strong dollar. And it is a natural hedge against and even more now that the earnings are going up. So that's the first point. The second is that we refocused our strategy in the U.S. a couple of years ago, and we were very clear. We're not trying to be all things to all people. We want to deliver profitable growth anchored on four pillars. First, our consumer bank. That is 70% of what the U.S. as a geography is and it continues to improve consumer will be one of our best-performing divisions in terms of the delta, and that is not just the U.S. but also Consumer Europe, with lower rates, Consumer, which is about 20% of our PAT, we'll do better and will improve profitability driven by results in the U.S. We're not going to give a specific number, but it's hundreds of millions more if you do the math. Very importantly, the launch of Openbank is going to help us optimize funding and even more so in the context of maybe not so much lower dollar rates. In terms of the corporate bank, it's been hugely accretive to our network. If you look at our corporate bank within the Group, most of the returns are coming in country, so over half of our corporate bank is actually Brazil and Spain. The U.S. is helping us to leverage that network. We've said we will not materially increase capital allocation, and it's been a very significant driver of fee growth in the U.S., corporate investment banking is up 81% year-on-year. And finally, we have a very profitable, again, very much focused on our LatAm franchise wealth business. So we will continue to allocate organic capital to the United States and to the Americas.",

I mean, in the UK, just to give you an idea in terms of you were asking revenue is going to be up mid-single-digits, and we expect a lot of around 11%, okay? I'm talking in constant. We have no view on FX at this point, okay? It's very important also to tell you that, I mean, we have 40 million clients in the UK. We're starting to sell different products to them. As Ana said, we have a basically mortgage franchise over there, but we're starting doing some other businesses with them. We're starting to do credit cards, cards are starting to grow. It's the second largest market in the world. So we'll start to cross-sell into that client base. And that basically is helping us out to have a much better franchise and we have the capabilities to do it because we have a business at scale that allow us to do so. In terms of the U.S. just give you, I mean, in terms of guidance that you were asking, I mean, we see revenue up high-single-digit, okay? And accounting RoTE will be around circa 10%. If you adjust the RoTE because of the excess capital that we have, we're talking about 14%. So it's quite good. And in regards of what the tax -- on the tax, I understand, I mean, I explained to you very well the situation due to the fact that what we're doing in terms of leasing, we're not really going to find out exactly the numbers until we see how we're going to allocate that one throughout the year, so.",

    "text": "Okay. Let me give you the high level on Brazil. Let me just first say that with or without Brazil, we will deliver on our guidance. That's what we've done for the last 10 years. In terms of the Group, let me remind you, €62 billion approximately flat cost, stable cost of risk with an RoTE after AT1s of 16.5%. In terms of Brazil retail business, which is the one sensitive to moving rates, and these are numbers that with the additional transparency on the global business, you can actually hopefully have as much confidence in that we will deliver as we do as a management team. So Retail Brazil contributes about 38% of Brazil net profit, and that is 7% --7% of the overall Santander Group attributable profit. The rest of our global businesses in Brazil, which contribute more than 60% Consumer, Corporate, Payments and Wealth, we expect to continue to do well. By the way, this is more or less the same as for all the other countries, i.e., for the group, 50% roughly of our bottom line, 60% of our balance sheet is Retail. All the other businesses, I said that in my presentation, should grow revenues more than -- much more than Retail next year. So this is part of the work we've done in ONE Transformation in Consumer. It's part of the work we're doing with our network businesses, leveraging on our customer relationships. All in all, what we expect is Brazil RoTE to be stable in 2025 as a country driven by higher customer revenues and especially fee income, contained cost, and this is really important. ONE Transformation will also be very important in Brazil with a flat cost to income roughly in 2025.

    "text": "Okay. So on the U.S., I've said that many times, operating context matters. So yes, other things equal, if the operating context improves in the U.S., that will naturally drive better returns, other things equal vis-à-vis other regions. So we cannot be too specific right now. We really don't know what's going to happen, but everybody and ourselves included is anticipating a better operating context for banks in the United States, which again, other things equal, should drive over time, at least, increased capital allocation, as I've said before, I mean, our investment in the U.S. has always and even more now since we are in a growth mode, leverage the Group. If on top of that, we get a better environment, we should do better. And that's what I said before; the U.S. asset geography will be one of the biggest upsides in our P&L without being too specific. But I think we said that the RoTE, Hector said it, he said 14%, I would say, Hector respectively between 14% to 15%, adjusted RoTE, I hope you agree on that. So yes, 14% to 15%, and the reason is very simple. Consumer business is 70% and that already is higher and what's dragging down this year, but not next year. And of course, with very positive contribution is the CIB investment, which, as I said, is leveraging the network. In terms of other, I would let either Hector or José to answer in a bit more detail. But yes, in that other, there are some one-offs, for example, over €300 million, if I remember correctly, in PagoNxt restructuring. This is going to drive a much better performance in our Payments division next year. Again, that's going to be one of the biggest upsides. So we are very -- we have been very disciplined not just with our -- where do we put our capital in terms of lending, but where do we put our capital in terms of growth. We decided to get out of acquiring in Europe that is going to drive a much better performance by focusing on our core markets and acquiring, which is mostly LatAm. There's a couple of things that are recurring there and a couple of others that are not. So maybe do you want to take that, Hector?",

    "text": "Hi, good morning. I've got a couple of follow-ups on one on capital and another one on the global platforms. On capital, there's a sort of a trend globally seems like around deregulation. I just wanted to pick your brain, Ana, maybe on how do you think that's going to manifest itself for Santander because ultimately, I heard cross guiding for another close to 60 basis points capital headwinds this year, similar to last year. Obviously, there was a press report earlier this week where you've taken the ECB to court [ph] around the DTAs in Brazil. So can you maybe sort of give us your latest thoughts on how regulators are going to treat the banks going forward? And in particular, how do you see that playing out for Santander? And second, on platforms on your Consumer and Retail, I think your cost to income is now 40%. I've heard your comments during the call; could you maybe walk us through which countries still need to roll out Gravity from here? And when we think about how low are those costs and all those -- that cost income can go, who do you benchmark yourself against. Can you give us an idea of how good it can get, thank you, medium-term, it doesn't have to -- I heard your targets for this year. Thank you.",

    "text": "So Alvaro that is a tricky question. You're asking me what the regulators are going to do. I wish I knew. But I would say that for the first time in 10 years, the probability, and I've said it publicly, I've said it in many different occasions in recent meetings, including, I think, in yours, I think, first, Europe has built €300 billion in capital, something like this over the banks last few years. The fact that we have built capital in many cases, twice. I mean our economic capital, we've said many times is lower than our current targets, and we will keep those targets, of course, because it's something which the market and regulators have surprised us. So we don't -- we are -- we don't want to be surprised. As we said, 12 to 13 is a big buffer on buffers. But I would say that, again, for the first time in 10 years, and especially given the outlook for the U.S. regulation being, I would say, less rather than more, means that at least, and this is, again, what I've said, let's take a pause, not just on regulation, but how you interpret regulation. We need to be able to compete on a level playing field. DTAs in Brazil, even in the case of a dissolving the bank have value, the direct claim against the government. We feel very strongly that puts us at a disadvantage as we compete with the U.S. and local banks in Brazil. So it's not a big number, by the way. It's more a question of principle because every single bank in Europe has similar issues. So I do think we should be in a more predictable area, but there's still CRR, there's still models, and so we want to make sure that. And the big difference is that in spite of that, given our strong profitability outlook, the change in the model, the fact a lot depends on us. That's why we are saying we are aiming for additional distributions beyond the regular distributions. In terms of retail and the platforms, you've seen it in -- we call ONE Transformation for the whole business model across the five divisions, but the biggest upside is on retail and consumer. You've seen that. I think Hector just gave you some numbers. There's a lot of upside. Gravity is an enabler. It's not the biggest contributor to scaling. The fact that you have Gravity allows you to bring through APIs; a lot of the other products that we are building, a lot of the other benefits of being cloud native, Payments is another one Payments Hub, which is still being rolled out. So a lot of the work is about aligning business model, aligning the organization and then comes the technology. And that is why we see a lot of upside in our retail consumer platform, basically bringing together 170 million customers, which, we have about 4 million companies, commercial corporates, but a lot of that is retail consumer.",

But are you amending the 10 to 15 basis points organic CET1 client per quarter, which was based on a much lower profitability and approach to risk-weighted assets.

    "text": "So the answer to your first question, without being very specific on numbers is we will grow our bottom line and we will grow our profitability in 2025. And I think I can say that our expectation is this will continue in 2026, 2027. You will get a lot more detail in our next Investor Day, which we expect to do towards the end of this year or beginning of next year. The model still has a lot of upside. As I've said today, we're only scratching the surface of our potential as a Group in a context that we do anticipate and we count would be volatile more challenging, we are saying we will grow profits and profitability with stable cost in euros and costs coming down and stable cost of risk. So again, yes, Santander will continue to deliver increasing profits and profitability with all the evidence and with all the, obviously, market assumptions we're making. So yes, in terms of ONE Transformation, at the end, we are aiming to grow customers, grow revenues and improve efficiency. This is not about cost savings. This is about changing fundamentally how we operate the bank. We are working across the bank to make sure there's end-to-end accountability for example. The same way we're building payments hub or Gravity, we're going to build investments and others. What this means is that you're going to see the savings, not just in one country, but in the global business benefiting all the countries. This is a very important difference. As I said before, by being part of Santander, we are generating €20 billion already today of network efficiencies. This is how we will generate further efficiencies. Today, we're still building investment products in Openbank, in Retail, in Wealth. As of next month, we're going to have and Hector, please confirm this because that's actually between both of us. But under Hector, once we create a single investments platform across the Group, we're going to save money, we're going to build a better investment platform, and we're going to grow faster. And so you need to think of this by global businesses. Having said that, what is, at the end, the bottom line best performing division next year? In terms of the delta, Retail will be more or less flat in terms of profitability because, yes, rates matter. Not as much as people think because if you go country by country, it's only 50%, roughly, 55%:45%. That is retail. And of that, there is diversification by country. So again, you'll see absolute cost savings across the divisions and some of that will benefit one countries more than other. Maybe Hector, you want to add to that briefly in terms of in a minute. But in terms of capital, just going regulatory hurdles, maybe José, you can take that more detail one, 12% to 13% is our operating range. We've been very clear on that. 13% is not a new minimum, but it is where we want to be by the end of this year. We will distribute excess capital following a capital hierarchy of more or less organic profitable growth. And again, that's difficult to predict. We want to make sure we maximize shareholder value creation, 10, 15 basis points per quarter that is actually much more than that now. But why don't I let you answer that?",

And if you analyze country by country, you're going to see -- for example, in Retail, this is the biggest change that -- and that's why we basically guiding you mid-high single-digit growth in terms of fees, okay? That's a change of the model. Remember that also change of the model is not just a platforms is basically simplification, which is helping us and is dropping the amount of products. Now we just offered more than 50 products to our customers, we still have a lot of the backlog, but we're automatizing all of that. So automation is another very important part. And then, the deployment of the platforms where, for example, we finished the deployment of OneApp, all of Europe. You see the results of NPS on the UK. Now it's coming down to Brazil. Mid-part of the year is going to be in Mexico and then it's coming down to Chile and Argentina.

In terms of growth, and this is important. Retail will not grow much in the next year. 2026, we'll see what happens to growth and revenues. We are putting much more emphasis at least for now on profitability. We've grown 8 million customers. We're growing the top-line, not just because of the euro rates benefit this year, but also because 8 million customers is a lot of customers. So again, given the context, our top-line in Retail will not grow as much in 2025. Within that, there will be differences as I've said. If you look at -- within Retail, what are the countries that will grow more or less, I mean, obviously, in the euro area will grow less because of the impact, but fees will grow to compensate partly and 50% of our businesses that are not Retail will all grow the top-line and the bottom line, including consumer in the U.S. and Europe. That is why I said the U.S. will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the lower rates, even I want to stress, not as low as probably the market thinks. I will let maybe José give some of the assumptions behind these numbers. In terms of NII in Spain and Portugal, let me go back again to the global business, and I will tell you within that. So if you look at Retail, the countries that will grow will not be the European countries, top-line, I'm saying profitability will be the same, maybe a bit lower in some of them and higher in others within Retail. Overall, the Retail -- and again, the four big countries are roughly 70% of Retail. The other 50% is not sensitive to higher rates -- sorry, it's not rate sensitive, but that's at least as well, if not better, again, given the investments with a lower rate environment. For Spain, you can give the -- maybe the guidance for Spain, which is one of the guidance we're going to give.",

    "text": "Okay. So let me very quickly go through the measures we've taken to decrease the interest rate sensitivity in the eurozone. We have taken three very important measures. One, we have an ALCO portfolio that has grown -- has been created in the last year and a half. Right now in the eurozone, we have a total of €67 billion of government bonds. The second, we implemented hedges on the asset side of the balance sheet, particularly mortgages through forward starts that go up to two years. And we also increased the percentage of liabilities at variable rates. With this, if you look at NII in Spain in the fourth quarter, which basically concentrates on the retail business, you see a negative impact of around 2% from volumes and also margins that decreased around 17%. But this was compensated by the positive impacts of these measures that I just mentioned. Hedges added around €100 million to NII and the ALCO portfolio around €180 million to the NII. That's why NII in the quarter was basically flat. Going forward, NII in Spain, again, which is mostly and primarily concentrated in the Retail business. If rates stay and stabilize at around 2%, we would expect to see NII in Spain to drop between 5% to 6% next year. So that is the sensitivity. But let me reiterate again that we have decreased the percentage of assets and liabilities subject to rates in Spain. In December 2022, 70% of -- 76% of assets was floating, 46% of liabilities was floating. In December 2024, only 64% of assets were floating and 51% of liabilities were floating. So we decreased the sensitivity on the asset side while increase the sensitivity on the liability side. So we are much better prepared for lower rates.",

So again, not a huge contribution on Retail, which is going to be the one most sensitive to volumes. Half of our business, and I'll let Hector go into that in more detail is with Corporates and Affluent. We have a lot of high-quality business in Mexico. Actually, the biggest opportunity is in the Retail, i.e., in the mass market. We have also launched Openbank there to take advantage of that. And we have been very prudent in terms of our lending much more than other peers we have focused over the last few months actually on a higher quality segment.

But with the third quarter results, you gave guidance kind of on a country-by-country level for net interest income. Would that be possible to also get now for 2025? And then, my second question would be, I know you've mentioned that UK is the core part of Santander, but and you focus on organic growth. But if you could kind of talk about M&A how you view your peers that are heavily involved in M&A?

    "text": "So we're going to give -- just on your first question, thank you. We are not going to give detailed NII by country. We're going to give most of the countries, and José can explain that. I'd like to go back to what we are committing and it's on the last slide or I think the last slide in the presentation. Revenues in euros €62 billion, roughly the same as this year, mid-high single-digit growth in fees. And then by divisions, I think we have given also and I think Hector has mentioned, retail, which is 50% of the group flat revenues and more or less flat returns, consumer. Again, mostly 90% of that is Europe and the U.S., revenues up mid-single digit and profitability improving significantly, including in the U.S. Our Corporate Bank, which is about 20% of our profits and 14% of our revenues. Revenue is up, profitability improving to 20%, which is roughly where we said would be by this year, wealth 10%, payments a big delta because of the restructuring. So I think that is much more detail we’ve given you, and I think I don’t -- I cannot add much more on that. In terms of the UK and M&A, I want to say several things. First, we do not need to buy yourself to allocate capital to the more interesting opportunities for Santander shareholders where we combine profitability growth franchise, and that’s what we are doing in a very dynamic way across our footprint. In terms of how we think about this, I want to go back to what I said, I think, at the beginning of the call in terms of how we think about capital allocation in a context where we anticipate excess capital given the higher profitability we have been very strict and very disciplined. First, we prioritize profitable organic growth and investments across our current footprint. Santander, this is how you should think about. We are a compounder. We’re going to compound earnings, returns, book value and distributions. Second is ordinary dividends and distributions, including buybacks. Third, inorganic. Let me just say this again. It must be complementary to our strategic aims, generate attractive financial returns, which means that they have to surpass those of organic investments or share buybacks. And then -- and this is the first time in 10 years, we anticipate excess capital given our plans. I want to reiterate again, we are very good at predicting within a range of 2% to 3% on average the last 10 years. Actually, you can go back more. Some of our shareholders know this. Every quarter, we have very little earnings volatility. This perception of volatility is not based on fact, it’s based on perception. So again, any incremental capital that exceeds our target range operating -- we’re not actually -- sorry, no, that exceeds the other opportunities I just mentioned would be returned as additional remuneration and that’s how we think about inorganic. Let me just say that the framework in Europe. It’s not there for cross-border M&A, and that is why you’re seeing some of our peers that don’t have alternative profitable growth looking more at in-market M&A, but that’s not where we are.",

    "text": "Hi, good morning. It’s Antonio from Bank of America. Just two questions for me, please. So you’ve introduced this new commitment to pay €10 billion buybacks over 2025 and 2026. You talked about shifting capital within the group rather than asset sales, and this has been an important part of your strategy. Maybe can you talk a little bit more about that point to give us a sense of the flexibility that you retain to shift capital across the group, meet your profit guidance and still achieve the buyback commitment should the macro picture worsen just to get a sense of the flexibility that you retain there on the capital optimization. And the second point, you’ve mentioned the group is highly diversified. You’ve given, I think, a very good overview of your expectations for 2025 across products. Can I just go back to Brazil? And could you share the same for the region. It’s a relatively large share of your group and it’s a market focus region, particularly dig more into the link between net interest margins, loan origination and affordability, ultimately reflecting cost of risk for Brazil and maybe the measures that you’ve put in place at your local unit to go through the cycling cycle, please.

    "text": "So I mean, just to give you some color on organic capital across the group. So we started working on this 10 years ago. We didn’t have the tools to manage regulatory capital. We’re always very good at managing economic capital. Today, we have a very dynamic capital allocation strategy. So we shift on a weekly basis where we put more or less capital, depending on the opportunities. Of course there’s a franchise consideration. I mean, why would we write lots of mortgages in Spain below 2% when I can get much better value in mortgages in Mexico. This is one of the reasons that giving guidance very specifically on countries is not something that we’re very keen on because we will deliver at the group level, and we’re making more and more profits, an increasing profitability because we are managing in a dynamic way. We do not have a crystal ball, right? We don’t know what the peers are going to. We don’t know exactly what the rates are going to be. So we managed this it reports to the Chief Investment Officer to the CFO and to the CEO who have topped down managing this with the global business in the countries. This is really the huge advantage you have with Santander, 87%, and we are prioritizing profitability ahead of growth. But as I said, 8 million customers, new customers in the context of focusing on profitability. Can you imagine, once we are at the levels and our operating platform is more competitive, which it will be, we can have organic growth for many years to go. So yes, that is what we do every day. That’s I don’t want to exaggerate, but every week. So going back to that, and I defer to Hector or Jose, but on Brazil, I think we’ve said. So Brazil as a country, I think Hector has said it, but if not, let me reiterate, we expect revenue to go up and more or less stable returns. That is where we see Brazil. But let me just be very clear that, as I said before, if you look at the retail business and how much of the retail business, which is 50% and the most sensitive one, to what rates might do or not, Retail Brazil is about 23%.",

In terms of NII, being -- I mean, being not the driver, but actually being fees the driver in the sense that we’re doing things, okay? Deposit and fees, it’s exactly what we’re concentrated on. We have changed the mix of the portfolio. This base Mexico, basically making us most resilient to rates and has reduced the sensitivity to higher rates through the hedging. We are 100% hedged for 2025 on the P&L in Brazil. So it’s very important that you know that, okay? It’s also important to tell you that the current yield curve stepping we have a similar smaller impact than previously expected, as I told you, and as of December, a 100 basis point upward move on the selling has an impact of around €120 million of NII. So we’re pretty much hedged all the structure is basically in place. And we believe that on credit quality, even though we remain vigilant over the past few years [indiscernible] has grown lending is lower than peers, and we have tightening the underwriting criteria. So the current economic forecast for GDP and growth to slow, but we remain positive during the year. On cost of risk in an adverse case scenario, due to changes in the portfolio. We see the cost of risk to perform marginally weaker than in 2024, but really not changing the outlook for the overall cost of the risk. This is exactly going back to what Ana was saying. It doesn’t impact the rest of the group, it’s quite small, and it doesn’t change overall picture. Diversification is the essence in the group.",

As long as we are not the best tenors, the best holders of some of the assets we originate, and someone is willing to buy these assets below our cost of capital, we will to -- we will continue mobilizing the assets. Last year, the average cost of equity at which we mobilize the assets was around 8% compared with our cost of capital of whatever, 14% or 15% or whatever. So as long as that’s the case, we will continue to mobilize the assets. Now going forward, as we optimize the back book, most mobilization will be related to the front book.

    "text": "Okay, Sofie. First of all, I think it's important to say that we have a lot of confidence that we can achieve what we have said in terms of the ROTE target of 16.5% under the new economic scenario, okay? I mean, given to the NII. Our business model, first of all, it's important for you to know, has a high degree of earnings predictability despite the macro volatility we have seen. For example, and as you were asking, I'm reiterating the NII guidance despite the outlook for rates being lower than we previously anticipated. Rate count that would be 16.3% normalized. So in that sense, we believe that we will continue in that regard. Excluding Argentina, we reiterate the NII. We believe there's going to be slightly up in constant euros and year-on-year current euros. We're assuming end rates at around 1.5% by the end of '25. The current outlook is around €0.169. So I believe we are able to get it. It's important to acknowledge that the ALCO portfolio has grown to €152 billion in the whole group, that's around €7.5 billion more quarter-on-quarter. Most of the group's sensitivity to rates is concentrated on retail, it's 60% of the loan book, but we have drivers that offset each other. So in that regard, I believe that we have control over it. Retail NII is positive even with the decline of the NIM, thanks to the hedging strategy that we -- in Brazil, session to lower rates, outlook is improving right. We expected a peak of around €60 million, that's €120 million. So we continue to proactively manage, and we believe that we're going to deliver what we have said. In that regard, begin for you, okay? I know we acknowledge a recent speculation about the regarding a potential transaction involving Santander Polska. I can tell you that this is a great bank has a great 22% routing and we have interest from several parties, and we are currently in discussions with [ Erste ] for the potential sale of the 49% stake. The discussions will lead to an agreement with them. And in any event, completion of any transaction, we will be subject to closing conditions and different things and regulatory approvals, et cetera. So if required, we will make a further announcement. But at this point, I would like to discuss any asset disposals or anything like that.

It's important to tell you that we reiterate our guidance to deliver the lower cost in current euros versus '25 versus '24 despite the potential inflation headwinds and the FX pressure in the current macro environment. Costs were 2% higher year-on-year in Q1 in constant euros, where they declined 1% in current euros. You have lower cost in retail, as I said, lower by One Transformation. It's very important for you to understand the operating leverage that we're generating in which the model is allowing us to generate actually more revenue while we maintain cohorts. It is important also to say and it's important that you acknowledge that we are a consumer and a retail bank. And in that regard, that's exactly what we're working on to lower the cost of the operation. We're investing a lot in the platforms, and that also will allow us to basically have lower cost in the future. And you are only seeing the beginning of what we're doing. If you look in detail, our retail and consumer, as I was saying, 70% of the group cost is flattish and revenue grew in terms of the operational leverage that we're getting. CIB, wealth and payments is around 30% of the group cost in terms of everything that we're doing. And we see sustainable fee income of around 13% year-on-year, and we continue to infer positive operating leverage across all the group. So in that sense, I do believe that we will continue to increment efficiencies in years to come. And much more while the model is being implemented and where we are basically deploying all the platforms, which right now, I could tell you is probably, I would call it a transition year because we're actually changing the engine at the same time we're flying the plane due to the fact that we have still some of our platforms working and this is going to take probably the next 18 to 24 months. On DCB Europe, okay, it's important to tell you the facts. It's important to tell you, first of all, that NII continues to do very well and is on track to benefit from the lower rates in the future. Also important to say that market share is growing with the current OEMs that we represent. Fee income was impacted because of regulatory change in Germany, which we indicated last quarter, if you remember. And this has now been rebased by the regulatory changes. Impairments were higher, driven by -- partly by a mix of the items, including Germany, but we are not concerned about the credit elimination is meeting the returns hurdles and returns will improve with lower rates. Remember that in the past, part of the stock is at lower rates that we are originating today. So that basically is helping us out. And the cost of risk normalization and the potential macro model adjustment, especially in Germany should peak in '25, all right? So I don't know if you want anything else or Jose anything to add?",

So in Poland, there is not much I can say at this point. As you know, we have a [indiscernible] as I said, to basically review any offer that comes and we're exactly doing that. So as of today, there is not much I can tell you about what's going on. Once the transaction, if it evolute or not, we will basically give you all the details on banking system that we are developing everywhere. And we are increasing the speed at which global deployed, at least important what I said just before, Andreas. We are not at the transit. We are running the old platforms together with deploying the new platforms and that basically doesn't help a lot in the cost or it in some cases that basically is also because we are gaining market share and we're gaining customers. Just we gained 9 million customers in a year. So that basically tells you that the model is working and clients are liking what we're doing. In terms of what we're doing or what's going on in the Brazilian cost of risk, I'd be very brief, first of all, okay, it's important to understand that we are taking actions to strengthen the balance sheet. First of all, as I explained last quarter, we're changing the mix towards lower risk portfolio. It's less payroll and unsecured lending is down 10% year-on-year, and we're also increasing collateralized products, which basically are much better in terms of cost of risk, but doesn't have those high margins that we have. Also, we have tightened quite a lot underwriting criteria. In a scale of 1 to 10, we moved from 6, 7 up to 8 and higher. So it's exactly what I was telling you about. So what you're going to see is that over time, the Brazilian cost of risk is going to get better, probably today, I would say if you look at the rates. The rates went all the way from 2%, and we're almost going to get to 15%. So that affects a little bit of the portfolio in that sense. And also the calendar effect in DCB, lower working days in the quarter that impacted the loan renegotiations. Whatever at the end, we see better performance in retail though to the cautious and we also remain it, all right? So in that sense, in Brazil, I believe that we have seen okay. And I believe the fee outlook in the next quarter as well. So the U.K. is performing quite well and we already mentioned in what we're doing there. And we have seen a very good behavior in terms of all in all, the operations on the bank and the portfolio.",

We are still, as I said, very much concentrated on delivering that 15% royalty. And we will continue to deploy capital into the U.S. as long as it's profitable. It's very important, and I'm going to give you the hierarchy in terms of where do we deploy capital. First of all, we'll concentrate on organic growth, okay? Because organic growth we've been having is above 20%. So we will continue to do that, and we will concentrate again on organic growth. It's very important also that we are deploying money to the buybacks, as you have seen the returns that we have done. I said, I mean we have repurchased over 14% of the capital and returns at around 20%, so quite good. And we're going to be very much concentrated on running the businesses we are doing it today. I think that's the most important thing is concentrated and focused on continuing the growth on our own businesses and continue with the transformation. That's the best way to deploy our capital and to get the best returns to our shareholders, which I believe we're delivering in a quite a strong way.",

    "text": "I mean what we're doing in the motor finance business is exactly what we're doing in the rest of the world. I mean we are actually doing that in every single one of our units due to the fact that it's very important to have them separate from the rest and fund it in a different way. That's why we call it the consumer bank, and that's why Openbank is together with the consumer bank because that's secular thing of many of the different markets we operate. And you're going to see us continuously doing it in that trend, okay? So it's part of the strategy there. And I believe it's the right strategy given what was going on in Europe. We have been -- as you know, DCB Europe has been independent all along, and we have been able to grow it very well. Also, it's interesting to know that we have been able to find out that this business can be without having a retail bank. And the same thing we're doing in Colombia without having the retail bank and doing this combination. So -- and we have been able to really grow in an important way in these countries with just this business. So we believe that managing it independently makes a lot of sense and allow us to go into further countries. As you know, we are in 28 countries right now with the auto business. We continue to be a big auto lender. We really believe in that business, and we will continue to do so in that regard. In terms of Mexico, the Mexican business, as you know, Mexico is actually the one that is most more affected, not by the tariffs bought by what happens to the U.S., okay? So Mexico is very dependent on the U.S. economy. And if the U.S. basically has a hard time, Mexico has a harder time because 1/3 of the economy is the U.S. exports. You're talking about above €500 billion in terms of exports at Mexico as to the U.S. with a GDP of €1.8 trillion. So that basically gives you a perspective on the size of it and how dependent is Mexico on that. Nevertheless, the Mexican economy is doing quite well, is at a very good level of unemployment, and we have seen a very good behavior for our credit portfolio. The cost of risk is actually behaving much better than we expected. And also, we have not seen the local economy down bad. The other way around, we have seen consumption and everything going very well. So we are positive on Mexico, positive on growth and positive on the long term in Mexico. Now going back to your question, we are very much concentrated on the organic growth that we have there. We will continue to invest in such things as Openbank. Openbank is doing quite well. It's just starting, as you know, and is actually getting very good momentum. We're growing customers every single week. And actually, I must tell you that we are doing a little better than our competitors in terms of clients coming in week per week. So and also deposits coming in at a good way. We are giving a better treatment in terms of the we are paying a lot a little bit more on deposits of what we pay in Santander, and that basically is enabling us to increase the client base there but we are normalizing it as we speak. So in that sense, what I could tell you, Mexico, we will continue pushing on organic growth and continue managing our bank the way we have been, and we believe that we have really good room for growth in that market.",

At that time, we thought rates could -- the terminal rate in 2025 could be around 2%. As I just mentioned, we've been working very hard to decrease interest rate sensitivity, lengthening the duration of the ALCO portfolio €34 billion of government bonds yielding 3.3% at an average maturity of 7 years. On top of that, in the euro zone, we have a total of €61 billion in government securities. So the interest rates in euros is very much reduced. So even if rates were to go down and as long as we estimate where we had it at the beginning of the year. In terms of cost of risk in Spain, we expect cost of risk to be below 50 basis points in my presentation. The key variable is unemployment is the labor markets. Obviously, GDP needs to be updated in the models, but the impact of a downgrade or slower GDP growth, it's very, very -- it's very small compared to the impact of unemployment. So as long as labor markets remain what they are, and they are very strong everywhere, we don't see for the year. Again, remember that this €115 million comprises different behaviors, countries where cost of risk is going to be very much flat like in Mexico. Countries where cost of risk could be a bit better like in the U.S. or Spain, countries that are normalizing from negative cost of risk to very low but still positive cost of risk like the U.K. and countries where we expect a slight deterioration in cost of risk, as Hector mentioned in Brazil.

So a substantial improvement in pricing and also better outlook for volumes. So we are quite constructive on the outlook for activity in the U.K. On the liability side, at the same time, yield on deposits is down from 2.23% last year to 1.99% this year, and that is what explains the very good evolution of net interest margin in the U.K. And in Brazil, the new legislation on payroll lending.

    "text": "Thank you, Magda, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of this year has been a notable one for our industry. The economic shocks and unexpected fragility we have witnessed across the U.S. and in Switzerland raise question about both banks' strengths and how they're operating day to day. These were idiosyncratic and specific to a segment of our industry with limited read across to European banking. However, they do highlight the need beyond regulation for banks to be managed efficiently, effectively and responsibly, and continuing to strive for excellence, principles which are at the heart of UniCredit Unlocked.  While the recent approval of our €3.3 billion share buyback and 1.25 billion early redemption of AT1 evidence, UniCredit's specific strengths and resilience, the results I will present to you today further underscores UniCredit's transformation, a journey, which whilst accelerated is far from being over. Every day, we continue to unlock internal value, and today's results are just one of many additional milestones to come. We're winning and are well on our way to becoming the bank for Europe.  Let's start our presentation. We have delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of profitable growth and the best first quarter ever for the group. UniCredit Unlocked is releasing our banks potential and the management of our three levers is delivering financial success. We now move into phase two of our industrial transformation. We have outperformed our prudent macro assumption. Our alpha actions and strong lines of defense have further propelled our results and will position us to outperform in all environments in the future.  We are upgrading our 2023 guidance and setting a new floor for the future, underpinned by the actions we are proactively taking to prepare for an eventual, less supportive macro environment. We continue to build a sustainable competitive advantage, resilient and growing results and a robust balance sheet. All this amounts to an Unlocked UniCredit bank focused on continuously seeking to improve itself and create value.  This is the ninth consecutive quarter of profitable growth and the best first quarter ever delivering a 2.1 billion net profit, 20.4% RoTE at 13% and 3.4 billion organic capital generation. The supportive macro is further boosted by our industrial transformation, and our operating performance is protected by our lines of defense. We feel that these two levers are not often taken into consideration. We are investing and strengthening our bank for the future.  We're investing in the network through hires, upskilling through training and the rollout of the UniCredit University across the group and in our technology through exactly the same levers. We're extracting inefficiency from our complex organization, our complex processes, way of working, products and technology. This is about constantly transforming our bank into one fit for the future. Our results show that this is working with record performance across the board.  Net revenues are up 57% year-on-year. This is especially impactful given the targeting of profitable quality gross, so a gross that shows risk discipline and is EVA positive. Costs were reduced 1% and RWA 9%, in spite of growth, inflation and our investment in the future. The strengths of our operational and capital levers are shown, respectively, in a best-in-class 39.2% cost income ratio and 7.7% net revenue on RWA. These are also our best ever.  As a result, our return on tangible equity exceeded 20% at a 13% CET1, which is more comparable versus our peers as it extracts some of our excess capital. And we generated 111 basis points or 3.4 billion of capital organically reaching 16.1% in CTE1. The strategy we're implementing is uniting our bank as one franchise capable of delivering consistent quality, profitable growth over the long term.  As such, we are upgrading our net profit guidance too in excess of 6.5 billion for 2023. This is pre AT1 and cashes coupon of 400 million, but post 300 million of restructuring charges as we continue to strive for operating excellence. Accordingly, we're also upgrading our distribution guidance to equal or in excess of 5.75 billion.  Let's turn to the next slide. Our value proposition is simple. We are reengineering our bank into one with a sustainable competitive advantage. We are already well underway in the execution of UniCredit Unlocked and are now determined to go further. We have a clear vision to set a new benchmark for banking and be the bank for Europe. Our winning strategy is client-centric, focused on our strengths and continuously striving for excellence.  We have a four-pillar industrial plan, which reinforced our commercial machine and will now improve our operating machine. Our three financial levers will continue to deliver alpha-driven results and create value over the long term. So that is how we win the right way together. This value has already been within UniCredit, but we are able to release it now because we have established a common vision and are united by our distinctive culture. Our people are striving for excellence, and it is this which enable us to capitalize on our unique and irreplaceable model. Next slide. Our strategic plan UniCredit Unlocked continues to leverage our inherent strengths and unlocking net value. We have 15 million clients across Europe and our unique gateway to the continent. We have 75,000 people in 13 leading local banks, 40% of which are in A or better rated geographies. We have two product factories and an evolving ecosystem of best-in-class partners, which enables us to deliver top quality solutions and products. We aim to grow by combining our world class factories and our local reach to provide products and services that competitor cannot replicate.  Our digital machine is resilient, and we have a strong data set. We're investing in both, to become a truly digital data-driven bank, positively impacting our clients and employees journeys. All of this is anchored by our shared ambition, principles and values. We strive for excellence and lead by example in ESG, always aiming to fulfill our purpose of empowering communities to progress.  We will now take a closer look to our industrial transformation plan in the next slide. Phase one of our industrial transformation plan is well advanced. This is about reinforcing our commercial machine. It has brought us closer to our clients and set the base for new run rate. Our people are unified. Our organization is empowered within a clear risk and capital framework. And we are integrating our frontline and product factories.  Phase two is just underway. This is about significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating machine, which we are reengineering to further support our business. Our technology and product factories deliver scale and scope. We're simplifying our processes to increase speed and reduce cost.  We continue to broaden our product offering, automate and digitalize to enhance client experience. Our commercial machine now shows the right drive, the right mindset and an ability to deliver for clients. And we're just started. We now intend to support it with a more efficient operating machine. The combination of these two is what will create further value.  Next slide. We are already a different bank. Our transformation is well advanced, but we're far from being done. This slide highlights some of the many milestones we have already achieved with many more to come.  Let's turn to Slide 8. We aim to deliver differentiated financial results in any macro environment, thanks to our relentless focus on alpha. We're executing on all our three levers of cost, net revenue and capital. We continue to reduce non-business cost to invest while creating positive operational jaws where both revenues and cost contribute. We have grown revenue while maintaining structurally lower cost of risk. We're on course to achieve sustainable best-in-class RWA efficiency, all coming together to drive superior profitability [indiscernible] enabling outsize distribution.  As regards to beta, we were prepared for was one of moderate NII growth and high inflation. The scenario we currently face is one of improved rates and better GDP growth. We are boosting the supportive macro through our industrial transformation. We are protecting our operating performance with our lines of defense. We're therefore capable of differentiated results in all environments.  Next slide. Our results speak for themselves. Our gross revenues are up 18%, while our cost of risk has declined 93% to 8 basis points, thanks to the rationalization of our Russian provision, no longer needing to accrue overlays, and our strong asset quality and coverage which resulted in significant write backs. Our operating leverage is a key feature of these results and is now among best in class, as is our capital.  We note our 35% improvement in gross operating profit year-over-year. This confirms both the increasing strengths of our business and of our lines of defense, which as intended are currently propelling our profitability and organic capital generation. All of our business areas are contributing to this excellent performance.  We continue to create exceptional value for our shareholders. Our return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 reached 20.4%, increasing not only because of positive macro but also and more importantly, thanks to our ongoing industrial transformation and our lines of defense at work. Share buybacks continue to further enhance our value creation, especially given our low valuation. Note our tangible book value per share growth of 22% year-on-year. The 2022 share buyback currently in execution, combined with improved guidance, will further underpin these numbers going forward.  Let's turn to the next slide. Our product factories are growing organically and through partnership, strengthening the level of cooperation towards a full service client-centric bank. They are the engine of our capital-light revenue generation at 2.5 billion. We have begun to unlock the value of these factories, but there is more to come as we continue to invest in them. Corporate solutions grew revenue 3% year-on-year, an excellent result given the strong Q1 of last year because of the market situation then. Client risk management, transactions and payments and more recently, advisory and capital markets continue to drive growth. This compensate for the rightsizing of specialized lending due to the TLTRO reimbursement and the removal of Euribor flooring.  We're investing organically in advisory to capture market recovery. We are rationalizing and further enhancing our payment solutions through partnerships. Individual solutions have been more negatively affected by the environment year-over-year, but they are now accelerating quarter-over-quarter. Protection continues to be a standout while life insurance, which in our case includes mostly unit linked and not [indiscernible], and funds and portfolio management are recovering. The expansion of our nonlife product offering beyond CPI is bearing fruit.  Italy; our Italian business had yet another outstanding quarter, demonstrating its ability to deliver sustained quality profitable gross. Net revenues were up 13% year-on-year, gross revenue 20%. This was driven by NII up 66%, thanks to strict management of the pass through, thanks to our strengths. While fees suffered year-on-year, they were up 8% quarter-on-quarter thanks to strong performance in protection and asset under management sales.  Costs were reduced 2%, thanks to our continued focus on simplification and streamlining whilst funding circa 200 new hires in the network. RWAs were reduced by 15%. As a result, we achieved our best ever leading operating and capital efficiency with a 36.1 cost income ratio and 9% net revenue over RWAs. Profit before tax in Italy was up 29% to 1.3 billion. RoAC exceeded 25% and the region contributed 50 basis points or 1.6 billion of capital organically to the group. Our continued innovation in data was recognized by the Italian Banking Association as well as our innovation in products, for example, in home and health insurance. Finally, we continue to support communities by investing in our branches and restarting purchase of tax credit for Superbonus. ESG underpins all that we do reflected in our award for Best ESG Bank in Italy and in Europe 2023.  Germany; Germany's structural transformation continues powering excellent results. Net revenues were up 13% year-on-year, gross revenues were up 11. This was driven by NII up 8% and fees up 1% with an acceleration of a latter quarter-over-quarter. Costs were reduced nearly 6% while the ongoing transformation more than -- with the ongoing transformation more than compensating for inflation and investment.  We expect significant further efficiency through '23 and '24. RWAs were down 6% as well. Germany also reached its best ever operating and capital efficiency with a 40.4% cost income ratio and a 7.4% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax landed up 65%, up 700 million. RoAC reached 19.5%, more than twice its cost of equity.  The region delivered 30 basis points or 900 million of capital organically. We're supporting SMEs in their ESG transition by matching platform from green tech startups and have extended our smart banking model to micro businesses. We extended lending to medical services in underserviced regions to play our role in the community.  Central Europe; Central Europe has also set a new improved run rate. Net revenues were up 23% year-on-year, gross revenue 27%. This was driven by NII up 43%. Fees were stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs were also down 1% driven by our continued transformation in Austria. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 39.8% cost income ratio for the region and 6.6% net revenue on RWA ratio.  Profit before tax was up 72% at 400 million. RoAC was 15.6% and the region delivered 9 basis points or 300 million of capital organically. Each bank is progressing its industrial transformation, while continuing to support clients' green and social transition. A significant progress in retail digitalization, Austria has enabled all startup products in mobile, while Czech Republic and Slovakia is now acquiring one-third of new clients remotely. We excel in our markets. UniCredit Hungary was awarded as the best international private bank in Hungary, while UniCredit Czech Republic was recognized as top acquirer in the Czech market.  Eastern Europe; Eastern Europe continues to deliver record profitable gross. Net revenues were up 39% year-over-year, gross revenue 32%. This was powered by both NII up 41% and fees up 6%. Cost gross was contained to 6%, less than half inflation and in spite of continued significant investments in digitalization and automation in the region. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 34.6% cost income ratio and 9.3% net revenue on RWA ratio.  Profit before tax landed at 400 million. RoAC was 33.1%. And the region delivered 11 basis points or 300 million of capital organically. Our strong profitable growth is supported by each bank in the region. Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia reaffirm their market leadership position, introducing new products to help enhance the value of customer saving and improving overall quality of customer care.  Romania and Serbia further accelerated their retail growth and drove best practice solution in micro business, all in addition to their existing strengths in the corporate sector. Social impact banking initiatives have been rolled out across the region, as well as the first ever government bond issuance and numerous award.  Russia. We continue to take a clear and conservative approach to Russia, maintaining our support for Western companies while looking for opportunities to continue to derisk, minimizing current and future potential losses to the group. In the last year, we have decisively resized our operation, substantially reduced our exposure and increased our coverage of risk, both locally and cross border.  We have proactively enhanced our lines of defense and the impact from our extreme loss assessment has been reduced from 128 basis points to 38 basis points year-on-year, while group CET1 pro forma for an extreme loss impact has increased from 13.3% to 15.7%. We will continue in this direction.  Let's turn to the next slide. Our robust balance sheet is underpinned by broad-based increased strengths. We continue to see the visible outcomes of a conservative approach to capital, to asset quality, to liquidity and to interest rate risk. Our CET1 ratio has been driven by our high quality capital stock, transformed organic capital generation and sustainable distribution, all part of our long-term approach.  Our cost of risk is driven by a number of factors, including our high quality asset portfolio, low and higher quality NPEs, sound proactive staging, and superior coverage. In addition, we have substantially enhanced our overlays to best-in-class, enabling us to either protect or propel our operating results going forward and strengthen our risk discipline across the business. Finally, our liquidity buffers are strong. This is due to our high quality and diversified deposit base, our strong liquidity ratios, prudent asset and liability management, and finally our significant net positive exposure to ECB.  Next slide. We benefit from the highest CET1 with lowest dependence on AT1 which we continuously strengthened by best-in-class organic capital generation. This combined with distribution that works best-in-class continue to be set significantly below our organic capital generation results in an ever strengthening CET1. We do not believe many can claim that.  Next slide. Our solid credit portfolio means that our cost of risk is structurally lower than in the past. And we are prepared to meet future headwinds. Our gross NPE stock has declined to 12.6 billion with a much improved mix, three quarters being UTPs. Our net NPE stock is 6.5 billion. The bank is also surpassing peers when it comes to staging and coverage.  We continue to have the highest stock of overlays at circa 1.8 billion that will either protect or propel our result as they are released and they will be. Finally, we continue our discipline approach on new business with our expected loss of 26 basis points, 7 basis points lower than that on our stock, excluding Russia.  Next slide. Our robust liquidity profile allows us to better manage pass-through, balancing the interest of our clients with current and future profitability. Our deposit base is sticky, diversified, stable and high quality. Our liquidity ratios are all strong. We maintain a prudent approach to ALM, managing liquidity and interest rate risk separately. Excess liquidity is placed with ECB and this is well in excess of our residual TLTRO borrowings.  I will now handover to Stefano Porro, who will provide you with more detail on our excellent results of the first quarter. Stefano?",

    "text": "Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 22. Before I take you through the first quarter '23 results, please note that my comments are based on a year-on-year comparison, that is first quarter '23 versus first quarter '22, unless otherwise noted. Let's look at the P&L in more detail, starting with revenue. As a reminder, the majority of systemic charges are always booked in the first quarter.  This year, they amounted to 640 million, a decrease of 11% year-on-year, mainly driven by a lower single resolution fund contribution, partly offset by the tax on extra bank profits in Hungary, as flagged before, which was 49 million this quarter. In first quarter '23, we generated 5.9 billion of revenue, up 18% thanks to net interest up 1 billion. Excluding TLTRO, tiering and excess liquidity fee which no longer benefit from, revenue is up 23%.  Please note that trading no longer includes client hedging fees, which relate to the markup on client hedging transaction where the markup can be immediately locked. These are now reported under fees as they are characteristic aligned with other fee lines. Trading was ELF [ph] at 0.5 billion in first quarter '23, the lion's share of which is fixed income, currency and commodity business. This is 15% lower compared to a very strong first quarter of '22 that benefited from realized gains of the investment portfolio.  Let's turn to the next slide. Let me share some highlights of UniCredit's strong balance sheet and a robust liquidity position. Our favorable liquidity position starts with the structure of our balance sheet and a loan to deposit ratio well below 100% at a sound 90% where we're resilient and diversified the deposit base. More than 80% of our deposits are from retail and SME clients and are granular.  For retail, the average balance is below €20,000 and about 70% is guaranteed. Retail deposits are mostly sight, almost entirely so in Italy, while the term deposit share in Germany is higher at about 25%. Our deposit market share across the group is generally stable, while the decrease in volumes in the quarter mirrors our market trends and our focus on pricing. Thanks to our superior liquidity profile and balance sheet strength, we are in a position to be able to do so.  The pricing focus and single ticket large corporate use of excess cash explains the volume decline quarter-on-quarter. At the same time, retail deposits are only slightly down as some clients diversified their savings and shifted to assets under custody products, for example, BTPs in Italy. The clients are keeping their asset with us and our TFAs are up 7 billion in the quarter as a result of strong net assets under custody sales and the market performance.  Total deposits are still well above pre-2020 levels. We expect the overall deposit volume to continue slightly declining in 2023 as there is further rotation to asset under custody or asset under management, and as we prioritize pricing management and quality NII. This is also reflected in our deposit beta, which I will discuss in more detail later. We have about 220 billion liquid assets of which some 190 billion are regulatory HQLA.  The bonds in our investment portfolios are swapped to floating so we have virtually no interest rate duration risk. The large liquidity buffer translated to strong regulatory ratio. At first quarter '23, our liquidity coverage ratio was 163%, net stable funding ratio about 130%. The managerial target for LCR is at 125% to 150% range, and will also be met net of our TLTRO repayment in June.  We're in a comfortable position for our remaining funding plan this year. We have limited need for TLAC/MREL funding and no need to issue additional Tier 1 in the foreseeable future, thanks to our very high 633 basis points CET1 fully loaded MDA buffer, pro forma for the recently announced call of our 1.25 billion additional Tier 1.  Let's turn to Slide 24, and focus again on the quarter. Net interest income was 3.3 billion, up 10% quarter-on-quarter net of TLTRO, which no longer contributes to NII and was 0.4 billion in fourth quarter '22. We continue to experience a positive net interest dynamic driven by higher loan rates and still low deposit beta, net interest margin at 2%, up 11 basis points in first quarter '23.  Customer loan rates are up 66 basis points in the quarter across our region, leveraging on higher interest rates and thanks to our commercial action, which also led to front book margins being slightly higher than back book in the quarter. Average client loan volumes relevant for net interest are down 3.4 billion in the quarter, driven by Italy, mainly loans for ME and retail mortgages.  Client's appetite for lending as in general declined in the first quarter across Italy and Germany, while loan volumes are supported by 2.5 billion in USG lending in the quarter as we continue supporting our clients during transaction. Average client loans are stable year-on-year with focus on profitable clients, despite active portfolio management including the reduction of low performing businesses. Demand for loans is expected to be curtailed on the back of higher rates and we will concentrate on more profitable capital efficient loans.  The increase of customer deposit rate is limited to 21 basis points in the quarter, while the average Euribor three months was up 86 basis points. The IR customer deposit rate at 67 basis points is mainly driven by Germany and Central Europe, where our corporate business and IR term deposit composition play a prominent role. The rate also depends on the country.  In Italy, for example, where we have the higher stock of deposit, the customer deposit rate is 12 basis points, higher versus last quarter at 25 basis points. Our deposit pricing is below the system across most of our regions. Average commercial deposit decreased by 8 billion in Q1 '23, mainly in Germany, driven by the single ticket item I mentioned earlier, and it was also related to clients using part liquidity for corporate transactions. At the same time, deposits in Central Europe were stable and slightly grew in Eastern Europe. Average client deposit volumes are up 9 billion year-on-year.  Regarding the deposit dynamics this year, we expect stability for the less rate sensitive part of our client base, in particular retail and small businesses, while we are focusing on the deposit beta. Corporates will continue to be lumpy. We expect clients to keep investing or shifting the [indiscernible] excess liquidity to other assets. Let's take a closer look at our updated net interest outlook and sensitivity on the next slide, 25. We've updated our managerial net interest income guidance, considering the latest deposit beta and rate assumptions. Based on a 3.5% ECB deposit facility rate by the end of Q2 '23 and the remaining stable thereafter, and the deposit beta around 40% at the end of the year, we expect and improve fully our 23 NII guidance of over 12.6 billion. This is mainly thanks to a better average deposit beta for the year at around 30%.  The observed deposit beta for the group for both sight and term deposit in Q1 '23 is about 22%. The deposit beta for retail and corporate clients is at around 11% and 37%, respectively. This slight increase by 2 percentage points in the quarter is mainly driven by Germany and Central Europe. While in Italy, we still have a low level of circa 10%. We continue to see a shift from sight to term deposit, in particular in Germany; however, sight for the group is still about 8% of our retail deposit and nearly 70% of our corporate deposit base.  We actively monitor the client behaviors and level of competition and we'll see how the upcoming TLTRO maturities impact the market. The net interest income sensitivity for a 1 percentage point of deposit beta is about 120 million at current rates and deposit volume assumptions. The net interest income impact from ECB deposit facility rate increase of 50 basis points is over 0.3 billion, which also depends on how client behavior and competitive dynamics develop. If the ECB starts reducing short-term rates, our deposit replicating portfolio which is factoring into our NII guidance will continue to support our net interest income.  Let's turn to Slide 26. Fees in Q1 '23 were 2 billion, down 2% year-on-year, mainly as lower asset under management impacted investment fees in Italy. Quarter-on-quarter, fees are up 11% thanks to an increase across all three categories with investment and financing fees in Italy and Germany particularly strong. We are well diversified and balanced, as you can see from the following year-on-year development of our different component parts of fees.  Investment fees were down 8%, as more than 8% reduced asset under management stock negatively impacted management fees and lower market levels combined with conservative client portfolio management led to lower asset under management upfront fees. This is partially mitigated by better assets under custody fees, thanks to certificate placement and some shift from deposit to asset under custody.  Investment fees quarter-on-quarter are up 13%, thanks to a recovery in assets under management upfront fees at 246 million in Q1 '23. Financing fees are down 4% due to higher securitization costs stemming from our active portfolio management strategy and lower credit protection insurance linked to retail mortgages in Italy. Financing fees are up 24% quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by a recovering global capital market activity following a seasonally low Q4 and also loan fees in Germany. Transactional fees were up 7%, thanks to payment and card fees driven by client activity across the regions and property and casualty insurance growth in Italy. Current account fees in Italy started to reprise reflected in new operating rates environment and are expected to negatively impact transactional fees worth about 20 million per month from April to around 2023. Client hedging fees were broadly stable as we continue to support our clients in defending their business outcome in this volatile environment.  Let's turn to Slide 27. As Andrea already took you through, costs fell 1% year-on-year. Let's take a closer look at HR and non-HR cost developments. HR costs down 2% year-on-year benefiting from lower FTE, down 4% as we keep focusing on the rationalization of non-business-related activities, while maintaining investment in key areas. The outcome of the negotiation within unions [ph] in Austria at about 8% increase for our population is considered in our full year '23 cost guidance. The trade union agreement in Italy is currently being renegotiated on a national level, while the German is valid until mid '24.  Non-HR costs are up 2% due to higher energy costs and the overall inflation impact. Net of the energy costs increase, non-HR costs are flat year-on-year. We will continue managing the impact of inflation effectively and structural cost improvements will help us keep our costs well managed beyond this year.  Let's turn to Slide 28. Cost of risk was at low 8 basis points in the quarter supported by our still low default rate at 0.8% and the good performance on repayment and back to bonus. Please remember that in Q1 '22, LLPs were almost completely related to Russia. And in Q4 '20, LLPs two overlays, we kept our overlay LLPs on performing loans stable in the quarter at around 1.8 billion to be used for any shop or to be released in the following two years.  Please remember, existing overlays are equivalent to over one year cost of risk of our only creditor log guidance. In Italy, the cost of risk of 29 basis points reflects ongoing sound asset quality and is mainly driven by provisioning on NPs. Cost of risk for Germany is low at 10 basis points and were the reduction in LPs. In Central Europe and Eastern Europe, we had negative cost of risk as a result of NP repayments leading to LLP releases.  Our updated spillover analysis confirmed the soundness of our group risk profile, which you can find in the annex. Also, in the annex, there are incremental details on our exposure to commercial real estate. The group commercial real estate portfolio towards clients operating in the construction real estate sectors is at 37 billion, with sound LTV of about 50%. Regardless of the industry in which the counterparty operates in, commercial real estate exposure financing and our corporate loans collateralized by commercial real estate is 60 billion.  In some Central and Eastern Europe countries, there is greater tendency to get real estate collateral on short-term working capital lines and other products amounting to about 8 billion which is included in increasing the commercial real estate exposure. Our exposure to commercial real estate versus total loan is in line or below market in Italy, Germany and Austria. The portfolio has been stable over recent years with declining gross NP ratio at around 4%. We have a high portion of fixed rate component and limited refinancing risk, thanks to our maturity profile and large portion amortizing repayments versus bullet. The portfolio is high quality and diversified by region and type of property. The group's expected loss on new business at 26 basis points also confirms the credit quality of our portfolio origination and how this discipline is ingrained in our organization. We continue to be vigilant to our underwriting standards, which were already reviewed and refined and post the war breakout, reflecting the uncertain macro outlook.  Let's turn to Slide 29. Our underlying asset quality remains robust, gross NPEs at 12.6 billion reduced by over 5 billion year-on-year. NPE coverage is stable at 48%. NPE coverage does not include overlays on performing loans which come on top. Our strong asset quality, high level of provisioning for NPE and overlay LLPs, we are uniquely positioned to absorb macroeconomic impacts.  Let's turn to Slide 30. In Q1 '23, our risk weighted assets to date to 299 billion, down 10 billion quarter-on-quarter driven by continued active portfolio management measure worth 2 billion. We will focus on reducing low performing businesses and 5 billion of business dynamics, which includes about 3 billion lower market risks and the effect of lower loan levels. There were no meaningful regulatory impacts in the quarter and are not expected through end of 2024. Risk weighted assets are down 31 billion year-on-year and are expected to stay below 300 billion also by year end.  Let's turn to Slide 31. Andrea has highlighted our strong CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter at 16.05%, including the accrual of 0.7 billion cash dividend. In Q1 '23, we organically generated 111 basis point of capital, 67 basis points from the profit and 44 basis points for our proactive risk weighted asset management. We're at our plan. We have started to execute to the 2.34 billion first tranche buyback for 2022. As of 28th of April, UniCredit purchased shares equal to 2.6% of the share capital for a total consideration of some 940 million. We expect to commence the second share buyback tranche of circa 1 billion shortly after the completion of the first tranche. This is highly accretive for both DPS and EPS.  Let me please finish my part by highlighting some specific items for Q2 '23. As indicated by Andrea before, we expect about 300 million integration costs for 2023, a material part of which is envisioned to be booked in Q2 '23. At the end of April, the Hungarian government changed the methodology for the calculation of the 2020 free extra profit tax, which is expected to lead to about mid 20 million higher tax for this year, which will be accounted for Q2 '23.  And I will now hand back to Andrea. Please, Andrea, the floor is yours.",

    "text": "Thank you, Stefano. I will now finish with some closing remarks. Turning to our group guidance for the full year and beyond. Given improved macro, accelerated progress on our industrial transformation and the effectiveness of our lines of defense, we meaningfully improved our guidance. As regard 2023, we now expect net revenue to exceed 20.3 billion, up from over 18.5 5 billion.  There is no change to our guidance on broadly flat fees on a rebased basis. They will be down slightly year-over-year due to a rising cost of securitization to support RWA efficiency and a one-off impact of the removal of current account fees in Italy, which is effectively compensated by a higher NII as we have already discussed.  I would like to bring again to your attention our expectation for cost of risk, between 30 and 35 basis points structurally lower than the past and with potential significant tailwinds that could drive it even lower. We expect our cost base to be less than 9.6 billion, down from less than 9.7 billion despite high inflation and continued investments, evidence of the ongoing benefit of our transformation.  We expect systemic charges of around 1 billion and restructuring charges of around 300 million to continue improving our efficiency in the foreseeable future. We expect stated net profit to be over 6.5 billion. We're referring to stated net profit to align with broader industry practice and for comparison purpose versus peers. It does exclude around 400 million in AT1 and cashes coupon, while it does include 300 million of restructuring charges that we expect to take mostly in the second quarter that will benefit us in the future.  The guidance does not include the potential positive impact from DTA write up. Our organic capital generation should be circa 250 basis points this year, up 100 basis points on previous guidance, supporting a 2023 distribution of at least 575 billion, an increase from our prior ambition of around 5.25 billion. Finally, we expect our return on tangible equity of 13% CET1 of circa 15%, an increase from 12.3% in 2022.  For 2024, we currently aim for net profit and distribution to remain broadly in line with 2023 guidance. This is based on a Euribor of 3% and an average pass-through at 42.5% with an exit rate of around 45%. We also assume there is a meaningful decrease in systemic charges by several €100 million.  Let's turn to Slide 34. Our unique investment case derives from the fact that the benefit from the current macro environment is amplified by our continued transformation and lines of defense, while they also further protect us from any reversal. As such, our current gross revenue, cost and capital numbers further benefit from our alpha generation while our gross operating profit is protected by our structurally improved cost of risk and the future release of overlays.  Finally, our outsize while sustainable distribution are supported not only by the continued improvement in profitability through the levers we have just described, but also are protected by our substantial excess capital that shall be deployed to underpin it when necessary. As such, the downside risk to both our profitability and distribution is significantly lowered by the levers I have just explained.  Let's turn to the last slide. We are crystallizing the net value from the macro environment particularly as it regards to the positive effect of rates, net of inflation and cost of risk. However, we also continue to be relentlessly focused on generating alpha, using phase two of UniCredit Unlocked to further propel current results. We aim to offset as much as possible of the expected reversal of the positive macro effect in the second half of 2024 and beyond to the benefit of our business and all our stakeholders.  As a management team, we see our job to be constantly and sustainably producing alpha and looking forward to the medium and long term to protect the bank from possible headwinds while benefiting to the fullest from possible opportunities. As such, we have accelerated and are now going further than UniCredit Unlocked with a further positive impact on fees, cost, capital efficiency and cost of risk.  We aim to ensure that the positive beta that is benefiting us today is replaced in as much as possible by additional alpha once it is reversed in the future. What we have shared today as we did with each one of the last eight quarters is evidence of what can be achieved with a common ambition, the right strategy and a distinctive culture and mindset positively obsessed with creating alpha sustainably.  Thank you. And I will now open for questions.",

You seem to be building deceleration basically into the rest of the year from the Q1 level. And considering calendar effects, et cetera, you would probably be expecting a little bit of a more stable revenue increase basically through the year. So I understand actually you have a quarter of your NII in CE. These days where probably rate expectations are a little more subdued into the next 12, 18 months, but if you can elaborate a little bit actually what is driving the slowdown through the year? And then the second one is on the cost side. Recurring question for me in the last two to three quarters, Stefano has alluded to that actually in the presentation, but just trying to understand if there is some degree of kind of hockey stick basically on the cost number beyond 2023, given those ongoing negotiations in Italy and the fact that you probably need to renegotiate trade union agreements again in Germany, mid '24 it was mentioned?

    "text": "So, Ignacio, in relation to net interest income, so as explained before, let's differentiate. So first, which is the level of pass through that we have, as alluded before in '22, is differentiated by country. So let's say is around 10% in Italy. To give the flavor in Germany is a little bit more than 30%. And in Central Europe is around 35%. So that is differentiated. The dynamic of the NII will be dependent on, one, the increased level of rates to the dynamic of the pass through. We are expecting, let's say, a good dynamic in Q2 as well. We might arrive to a peak, let's say, midyear clearly depending from the dynamic of the elements selected before, especially the pass through. In relation, you mentioned Central/Eastern Europe. In relation to Central/Eastern Europe, it is important to take into consideration also the dynamic of the average spread on the new lending, because the average spread on the new lending is positive, especially in Central Europe. So the front book pricing is better than the back book, by the way, not only in Central Europe, also in Eastern Europe. So this is also positively contributing to the dynamic of the net interest income. I leave the floor to Andrea for the cost.",

So as we said already last quarter, while we face continued inflation and accelerate at high levels, and while we are not relenting on the investment that we believe we need to continue doing on the frontline and in technology, it is our job to offset as much of the inflation as possible. And I remind you that while we're guiding for below 9.6 billion at the moment, UniCredit Unlocked used to aim for 9.4 billion exit rate in 2024. And while I cannot tell you that we will be there, I can tell you that the management team ambition is to get as close to that number as possible. So our job is to continue to work on simplification, rationalization, streamlining, and bringing two common denominator of a scale of a group in the renegotiation of external contract and a number of our initiatives that are not very flamboyant, but are very effective to offset the inflation or repression on our cost base.

    "text": "Thank you, Britta. Let me start. So cost of risk. The first comment I would make is, if you look at our cost of risk across '22 and you extract Russia and overlays, we have been at single digits for now four quarters, actually five now. Okay. So the cost of risk at the moment is and remains very benign, and is very benign for us because we have a discipline origination and discipline cost of risk on new business that is offset by significant write backs, given our conservative provisioning and staging that we continue to have. If you do a simple average and you look at a cost of risk of 8 basis points in Q1 and you exclude the additional overlays and/or other things that I do not anticipate, you will find that it is very difficult for us to exceed 30 to 35, as we do an average for the rest of the year. Now this is just math. I don't know how the business will take that. But for the time being, this is the numbers. With respect to overlays, so at the moment, if I were to tell you where we see April, we see April exactly as we saw January, February, March in cost of risk. So we continue to have a benign environment. We continue to have write backs. We continue to see a benign environment. Will this change? It will absolutely change. But at the moment, it depends on when it will change and the significance of a change. As time progresses, obviously, the cost of risk of a year becomes more and more benign because the average moves in that direction. If the shock or when the shock arrives or when the worsening of cost of risk arrives, we have 1.8 billion to release to keep the cost of risk at our guidance or below our guidance. As we said in previous call, we cannot just keep the overlays going. We need to release them. So either we release them to absorb a shock and reduce any upward movement or eliminate any upward movement or release them because there is no reason to keep them, and therefore we will take the cost of risk down. So I think what we need to think in terms of cost of risk is that we are structurally lower than the past. At the moment, it is a benign environment where we benefit from write backs given our conservative provisioning. Going forward, there will be an increase. That increase will be offset by overlays. And if the increase is less than we anticipate, the cost of risk will be further reduced by overlays. With respect to RWAs, I would say the following. What we're doing on RWAs is progressive, methodical and recurrent. So the way we originate new business is very discipline, very focused and we need to originate business very simplified EVA positive. That means slower gross, but it means that all that we book flows to a profitable bottom line. If it flows to a profitable bottom line by definition, our net income generates or more than offsets the RWAs that are used to generate it. That is continuing and improving as the discipline flows through the entire system. Boosting that, we have our legacy book. Our legacy book, while very disciplined from a risk standpoint, was not very discipline from a capital allocation standpoint. As that book rolls or is reviewed or is renegotiated, we apply the same metrics. We are applying on new business to the back book. That is boosting the RWA reduction and is boosting our organic capital generation. We said at the beginning of UniCredit Unlocked not knowing well what UniCredit was capable of but we would generate 150 basis points per annum of organic capital generation that underpinned in excess of 60 billion of capital distribution. We have made 200 basis points in '21, almost 280 basis points in '22. And while we felt that it was difficult to keep the momentum, we are now confident we can do 250 basis points this year, and in excess of 150 going forward. That brings us to an organic capital generation that allows us to underpin prudently for our distribution while building capital. So that's the macro, but maybe Stefano wants to add a few points.",

So to give a sense is 0.3 in Germany, 0.5 in Central Europe, let's say around 1% in Italy. As alluded by Andrea, the dynamic in April is fundamentally in line with Q1. Important to consider that on the expected loss side, the new production in Italy is done at 36 basis points that is a lower expected loss than the stock and please remember 1.1 billion out of 1.8 billion of overlays are in Italy. With regards to risk weighted asset, 2 billion down in the quarter is active portfolio management action, primarily focused on EVA negative clients. So our specific initiative either not rollover, getting guarantee on repricing on active portfolio management client, vast majority of that 2 billion of credit risk is fundamentally loan dynamic that we are recommending before, better mix of the credit portfolio and a little bit of reduction of temporary different EVAs. Free below market risk is fundamentally reduction of the exposure and around 1 billion [indiscernible] from the FX hedge of the structural FX risk.",

    "text": "Thank you, Benjie. So industrial transformation and factories. So we continue to execute on the build-up of factories. So the plan is simple. What we want to have is world class factory, so to the level of quality that global banks have, but deliver for our client base, which usually is reached only by our more regional competitors. The combination of this two creates a competitive advantage, providing our clients with access to products and solutions that they would not otherwise have access to either because the regional competitor cannot scale the factory or because the global bank cannot reach them. We have been building that up either organically or through partnership and we continue on that trajectory. So you could say that advisory and capital market is an organic build. And to be very clear, we do not -- we are not planning to become a global investment bank. What we're planning to do is to offer our SMEs advisory and capital markets services that of the quality that they would not otherwise be able to benefit from. Client risk management, same thing on hedging of risk of FX, rates and commodities and that can continue. On the retail side, we are doing the same thing in asset management. So we went from maybe simplistically, but to make the point, a simple pass through between our providers in asset management and the client to creating more of a brain in asset allocation, in selection, in design of products to distribute through our network and therefore adding further value. That was phase one. Phase two has moved on identifying the part of the value chain. So the asset classes that we can produce internally while maintaining the quality of the product, that is the sense of onemarkets. That is the sense of Nova. That is the sense of [indiscernible]. It's that. And we are continuing, plotting around and going forward on the same direction. You take insurance, we have identified a partner. It's the best partner we can have. And we're integrating technologically. We are expecting the release of further product in protection from them. We are -- because of a partnership, offer training, we are offered a number of other benefits. And that is going through our network with an increased growth of protection that is growing at almost 20% year-on-year in spite of a reduction on CPI. And if I continue, I will repeat exactly the same thing for every partnership, meaning it's always a reinforcement of our capability, either internally, organically, or through partnership, but through partnership where we have a two-way relationship with our partner, and not a relationship of provider/distributor. And this continues, and I don't think we're done, I think we have a couple of years more to continue at least. With respect to overlays, I would say the following. That has nothing to do with regulator. It has to do with accounting. We have taken overlays which are done above and beyond the conservative provisioning that we have on the portfolio. So while we look at the environment and we see an environment that is relatively benign, we are worried that it may degenerate and degenerate very quickly. For that reason, we have created overlays. And we identify very clearly what those overlays are linked to; energy costs, other things, there is a whole bunch of things that we identify. Within a reasonable period of time, which I would say is this year and next, either those events occur and therefore we are releasing overlays. And therefore, the increased cost of risk is reduced by the release of overlays, keeping our risk under control, or our cost of risk under control, or those events do not occur. And I'm still obliged to release them because there is no more any reason to keep them. What I think may have been missed is that this is not a new thing. If you look at 2020, '21, '22, we have released overlays every year. The point has been that because of the volatility and because of the uncertainty and because of the emerging of new risk, we have released them and rebuilt them. And therefore, you net-net saw no change in '21 and an increase in '22. But we have released the legacy overlays we had that we had built in 2020. This time, we don't think -- we don't expect new unexpected shock beyond the one we have in the overlays, so we don't expect that we will need to rebuild. And that's why we're going to flow through the P&L over the next two years.",

    "text": "Okay. Thank you, Andrea. So the shareholder remuneration policy, as of now, we're keeping it unchanged, meaning 35% of net income is going to cash dividend, and the rest is going to share buybacks, as of now. I think we look at the value we generate with our share buyback. And therefore, depending where we go, we may change that percentage in favor of cash. Secondly, what I would say is, we realize that an increasing number of our investors expects a gently upward increasing of our cash dividends per share. And therefore, we look at the dividend yield. And we take all of these things in consideration to potentially make changes. We do recognize that once we change a percentage upward 35, 40 or whatever, it stays there as a minimum floor. You remember that when we had the shock from the invasion of Ukraine, we suspended the share buyback for prudency reason. We didn't touch the dividend. And we actually said that we would calculate the dividend on net income, excluding the shock for Russia. So we understand that the cash portion needs to be defended as much as we can reasonably. With respect to the probability of the government introduction of a banking tax in Italy, I think your guest is better than mine. I just know that it is unlikely to be part of the current introduction and that the discussion has been postponed. I don't think the probabilities are 100%.

So I would call it the dynamic of our deployment of capital is driven solely by our focus on EVA positive deployment of capital. In Italy, you see a greater impact, because we feel that lending in certain segment, take mortgages as one, take large corporates as another is not recognizing the risk reward. And therefore, the profitability of a segment is not to the level that we think covers the cost of equity. I'm generalizing, it is not true everywhere. But as a result of that, we are showing a declining market share in mortgages and a declining market share in the corporate sector. And given that those two segments are large, a mortgage is larger than a consumer loan and a large corporate loan is larger than a small corporate loan, you're seeing a compression. We think that that dynamic is about to find a floor, because obviously as we have reassessed, we will not continue to lose forever, i.e. we're finding a place where we're happy with the client base and with the portfolio that we have, and the decline will stop. At that point, the gross in other segments like consumer lending or SMEs will be more visible. Now I'll pass it to Stefano.",

You have also a question in relation to pricing that was partially mentioned before, so when we're looking to the pricing of the new production, so for example new near and long term [ph] production, declined rate on the front book is definitely higher than the back book. So what is expiring was either repaid. But also when you are looking to the client spread, so taking also into consideration let's say the funding costs, we are currently repricing, so around 20 basis points more, especially in Germany and in Central Europe, less so in Italy. So still when you're looking into the client spread in Italy, the new production is few basis points lower than the spread of the back book. But within that, the situation will normalize in Italy over time. With regards to systemic charges and the potential, let's say, implication in relation to the charges of single regional fund and deposit guarantee scheme. Before Andrea was highlighting the expectation for '24, the expectation for '24 is a reduction in relation to the single resolution fund component. Already this year, there was a reduction for next year. We are expecting a reduction of few 100 million. Considering the overall liquidity situation and liquidity framework of European banks, currently we are not expecting any change in relation for this approach.

    "text": "Good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me please, the first one on capital and the second one on mitigating book NII. Starting with the first one, you've generated 100 basis points of organic capital this quarter, which is impressive. Your guiding for risk weighted assets to drop below 300 billion by year end. And of course, we know you gave guidance and distribution on earnings. So your capital is going to continue to move further away from the 12.5%, 13% target range you had. And admittedly, it's a lot more capital than you can consider distributed. So I wonder where does your strategic priorities stand here aside of distribution which is very clear? That's my first question. The second one, there’s a lot of focus on banks hedging strategies. If you have a replicating book of 170 billion of roughly [indiscernible] with a relatively low back book yield, is there any of the investment contribution in your full year NII guidance? Or are you just focusing mostly on the commercial side? Can you share any more details on the contribution? What the back book yield looks like? And what could be the potential benefits going forward? Thank you.",

    "text": "So I'll start with capital. So at the moment, we are clearly much more organic capital generative than we had expected. This allows us both to be a positive outlier in terms of our distribution and, and I underline the and, continue to increase capital. So not only we're not using our capital access to underpin our distribution, but we're also continuing to increase capital. Why are we doing that? And what is the plan? Well, number one, we're doing that because we're already an outlier in distribution and was just a point, but until it's fully appreciated, continuing to go further and further does not seem to have a lot of impact. The second thing is that we are in an uncertain environment. There is a lot of volatility. And while we see a positive base case, I continue to say that the only certain thing is uncertainty and we don't want to be found on the back foot. The third reason, and probably the most important one, is that for as long as our organic capital generation allows us to beat the sector on distributions, that's great. But we want a, let's say, recurrent sustainable level of distributions. And as I have said before, our excess capital can play a role anytime we get a shock or if our organic capital generation starts going down, which we do not anticipate this year and next, to underpin regeneration and keep the distribution at least at the same level that we have this year for the foreseeable future. So what we offer investors is for organic capital generation underpinned and through a gradual release of our excess capital, if and when it is necessary, a foreseeable future, lesser risk level of distribution at the level that we have today or higher. That's why we took floors. Not forever, but certainly for the foreseeable future. There is no other big plan about it. It is what it is at the moment. And that's where we take it.

    "text": "Thank you, Giovanni. So allocation of capital and more resilience, so I think the way we look at it is very simple. As we now have a granular assessment of the profitability of a deployment of our capital both by macro location through regions and more granular within every country. Every time that we see that we have an opportunity to deploy profitably above our cost of equity, which has increased, we do that. So there is -- given our overall capital position, we have absolutely no restriction in deploying the capital correctly in all of our geographies. The only restrictions are discipline on risk and discipline on returns. Beyond that, we're doing exactly what you're saying. But obviously, discipline on risk, discipline on return, and we will continue this way. And we find opportunity because others are retrenching, maintaining discipline on risk, discipline on returns, we will continue to do so. So you should anticipate that we try to do that. With respect to -- and obviously, as I said before, you do not see that because some of the growth that we're doing is obscured by the optimization of improvement of efficiency of our loan portfolio, as we get out of lending position that are unprofitable. And those mask some of the growth that we're already delivering. The second part on the deposits, and then I'll pass maybe more detail to Stefano, I think it's important that we look at deposit and liquidity in two ways. So if you are considered a flight to quality bank, you can benefit to that in two ways. One, you try to attract as many deposit as you can. Two, you try to improve your profitability as much as you can. And if you think about it, what is happening in the market is that depositors are giving a greater value to banks that are better capitalized, better covered, more liquid, less risky. So as it's normal, but we haven't seen that in many, many years, depositor will say, I'll take a slightly lower deposit base rate because this bank will give me the money back, simplifying okay. So given that our loan to deposit ratio is below 90%, we have no need to hover deposits. We look at them closely, but we have no need to press on increasing the deposits. But maximizing or the improvement or the maintenance of our pass through or rather maintaining our pass through as low as possible is critical. And why is it critical? Not only for current profitability, but because we will have a rate reversal, we will have a rate reversal. That rate reversal will occur sometimes in '24. We hope the second half, it could happen earlier. At that point, the pass through that will have been considered is the pass through that will exist. So you will have lesser rates, a higher pass through margin gets crushed. Effect number one. Effect number two, the costs that have not been defended and have increased are not going to go down just because inflation goes down. They're going to stay there. Revenue down, cost up, crush. Thirdly, the cost of risk will come at the tail end of a cycle as it always does. So revenue down, cost up, cost of risk up, crush. So what we're focusing on relentlessly is to avoid that and making our profitability sustainable in '24, '25 and beyond. How are we doing that? Defend the pass through in as much as possible. So the NII crushes less, develop further the fees through the transformation of our factory, keep the cost down, and if possible, lower. So when the revenues go down, our costs are not found to be higher, and keeping all of our provision and buffers so that when cost of risk goes up, we have buffers to offset it. In this way, we should be able to maintain a much greater degree of the profitability we have found for the first time in 15 years in the foreseeable future. And all of this is connected in such fashion.",

So as commented more than once for pricing reason and for some transaction done by these corporates. When we are looking on the other end on the average deposits, so average Q1 versus average Q4, I think it's a better metric to avoid some volatility.

Just in terms of the outlook for '24, given that -- because data you’re assuming 42.5%, and based on the sensitivity 1 percentage increasing, the probability is quite high. So it sounds like we're going to get a 1.5 billion potential headwind from the probability to increase. Just wondering on the other moving parts, do you expect anything to offset that? I know you mentioned a couple of 100 million for application portfolio, but just wondering if it is possible to maintain NII flat next year or even increasing? And then my second question is regarding capital and other big dynamics. You talked a little bit about how you’re optimizing the legacy portfolio which is not capital efficient.

    "text": "So, thank you, Delphine. First of all, let me be clear that the impact on our NII is an industry thing. It is not specific to UniCredit. If anything, we think we are a little bit more asymmetrical on the way down, meaning we are going to suffer a little bit less on the way down. Why do we think that? Number one, because as we're demonstrating, we're capable of managing the pass through because of our strengths and liquidity position a lot better than average. And that will help us when rates reverse. So if we are at that level of pass through, then we expect the industry to be on average higher, or we will be below that level of pass through. So that's the first thing. The second thing that underpins our NII symmetrically is the replicating portfolio, because we have replicated less in the past and we can now benefit for replicating more in the future, or rolling further in the future. And the new loans are obviously stripping at better rates. So these things will reduce the shock. The other thing that will reduce the shock is, as I said before, a lesser drag from the continued optimization of our portfolio by pulling back from segments that we think are EVA disruptive that will not continue forever. And when you stop that, the benefit from what we're doing in consumer finance and we're doing on SME loan and in other places will come much more clearly visible. In any case, our expectation at the moment is that we see NII peeking between second and third quarter. And we see, because of the conjunction of rates in Europe getting to their maximum level and pass through being higher, but not as high as the exit rate of a year. From there, it will follow a trend in our opinion where rates will be held at that level for a certain period of time, and then will decrease while pass through will start converging. The speed of those two things is very unclear and depends on the strength of the economy and on the dynamics of inflation. So we can have a scenario -- the scenario is in the presentation, but it can change. With respect to how we are offsetting, because what you're saying is correct. If all of that happens, banks will have a very significant reversal of the NII tailwinds quite soon, relatively soon, is continue to working on the factories to boost our fees. So part of the boosting fees will occur physiologically, because when rates drop, our asset management fees are going to improve. Part is due to better integration in protection, new products in protection, what we're doing in payments, et cetera, et cetera, that should be giving some tailwinds from I would say the second part of '24 onwards to our fees. The other thing that we're doing is obviously driving costs down and keeping our cost of risk as low a level and keeping buffer to protect it going into '24 and '25. So I do think that for us, the real challenge or the real ambition is not so much what we're going to generate and make in 2023. In a certain way, while we're doing well, the dies are cast. What is the challenge and the ambition is to be able to protect as much as this newfound profitability on a sustainable basis in '24 and '25. And that's what we have been doing through the transformation and the lines of defense starting the summer of last year. And we will continue to do.",

So let's break down into our portfolio. So if you look at our risk weighted asset and their related credit risk, around 70 billion are the retail portfolio, 180 billion is the corporate portfolio. The main focusing on the corporate portfolio, so on the 180 billion, let's say, that you have 10% of that that you can optimize is around €18 billion. It's clear that not everything done via reduction, because we can also work on that portfolio via repricing working with the clients and so on. So this is more or less a portion of that can be also securitized and so on. So in your eyes between '23 and '24, that is the portion of the portfolio that we'll be looking at.",

As far as the regulators are concerned, I will not answer, but the significance of our distribution is looked at considering both our profitability, our organic capital generation, our starting and ending level of CET1, and they're all in our favors.

    "text": "Liquidity has remained stable, pass-through and cost of risk more benign and profitability at elevated levels. We continue to push into the future, the expected shocks within this environment UniCredit's excellent results are a demonstration of a resilience of not only Europe, but of the European banks. Yes, risk remains and inflation combined with a possible further economic slowdown and the development of new technology needs to be managed. So we remain vigilant. We take pre-emptive actions, prudent and ready to adapt. But what this presentation will demonstrate is the excellent progression of UniCredit unlocked and of our industrial and cultural transformation, but our people are leading the evolution and doing so as one team united by the same principle, the same values and with the same mission.  The vision driving that mission is for UniCredit to be the bank for Europe's future and a new benchmark for banking. Let's start our presentation with slide two, I guess. Is it working? 1 second. Okay, let me start with a snapshot of our current results. This show just how well we are progressing towards realizing that vision. We have delivered our 10th consecutive quarter of profitable growth, the best second quarter and first half ever. Underlying net profit in the first half of the year was €4.5 billion or in excess of that. This is adjusted for €230 million of integration cost that we are expensing to continue supporting our operational efficiency improvements in the face of inflation whilst becoming more agile and self-funding significant investments. Net revenue rose 38% year-over-year. This is especially impactful. Sorry, we seem to be having a problem with slide, one second. Here we go. Sorry. Yeah. Let's see if they stay. Yes. Okay. So net revenue rose 38% year on year. This is especially impactful given the drag from targeting quality growth, one that shows risk, discipline, improvement of mix and a focus on EVA positive transaction. Costs fell 1% and RWA 7% year-on-year in spite of gross, inflation and our investment for the future. The effectiveness of our operational and capital levers is shown in our 39% cost income ratio and our 8% net revenue on RWA ratio. Both are best ever, industry-leading and a result of improvement on both variable of the ratio, so both numerator and denominator. So far this year, our return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 is at 21%. It is still at 17%, considering the excess capital that we still carry. Our CET1 reached 16.6%, structurally higher than our target of 12.5% to 13%, whilst at the same time we will have distributed in excess of €15.5 billion between 2021 and 2023, well above our initial target. This is thanks to our much higher than initially expected profitability and organic capital generation. Indeed, we generated 210 basis points or €6.5 billion of capital in the first half alone. The strategy we're implementing is uniting our bank as one empowered franchise, capable of delivering consistent quality, profitable growth and outsized distribution over the long term. As such, we are upgrading both our net income and distribution guidance respectively, to equal or greater than €7.25 billion and €6.5 billion, while absorbing yet upsized integration cost of €500 million and continuing to increase our CET1 year-over-year, all providing a strong foundation and outlook for 2024, as we expect to be broadly in line with the increasing higher bar set this year, we've clearly identified levers to achieve it. What you're seeing with this result is the combination of a sector benefiting from generally supportive macro, some of which is structural, as we're not going back to negative rates and the large contribution from the relentless execution of UniCredit unlocked. The latter is what continues to drive our differentiation versus peers and enables us to beat expectation. Let me take you again through its essence, understanding it is understanding our transformation to date and our further potential. Let's start with our winning strategy to achieve our vision. We have a group-wide determination to put clients at the center to understand what they want today and what they will need tomorrow. We serve them across three foundational countries, boosted by ten of the fastest growing and most innovative markets in Europe coming together as one. This is a bank that represents a new and emerging Europe powered by a renewed single group mindset that truly unlocks the unique value for our clients and other stakeholders of being pan European. We provide our clients with a differentiated service that combines local reach with European interconnection and group-wide product factories that leverage an ecosystem of best in class partners, powered by an increasingly harmonized, forward-looking digital data and operations across our group. All is underpinned by solid principle and values that our people chose, live and breathe day to day.  Then we move to our ongoing industrial and cultural transformation, unique in that from within and employee led. We are strengthening our client proposition, distribution power and product factories while streamlining our organization, processes and way of working across all banks, all supported by our technology evolution. We continue to invest in the business for the long term, making the necessary structural changes to be future-proofed and resilient. This allows us to support our communities through social programs, our clients and people to go through challenging times and our commitment to use and education. This approach serves all of our stakeholders well while delivering exceptional targeted financial outcome. As we continue to strive for excellence and execute relentlessly on UniCredit Unlocked, I am confident that our financial performance is set to continue through 2023, 2024 and beyond. Let's turn to Slide four. Let me now take you through how we are deploying our strategy in further detail. Clients UniCredit Unlocked is primarily driven by around our 50 million clients across Europe, serving them and their communities locally, but benefiting from tools available to a group of our size and nature. For most of our franchise countries, experts make up 50% of GDP. So our footprint is a unique gateway to the continent and possible expansion. We have overlaid this with industrial actions designed to ensure our clients not only connect, but also have access to premium tailor-made products, access the way they prefer. This is supported by investments in our network, which we continue to upgrade and technology aiming to create the branch of a future in which an omnichannel approach combines a digital offering with passionate skilled people delivering best in class solutions, all within a higher quality and seamless client experience. Our clients are served by 13 banks who are leaders in their own market. We have refocused our previously inward looking organization towards our clients. We have reunified our client franchises, harmonized group segmentation and return coverage and day-to-day decision to our banks and within our banks to the frontline. This model relies on both a clear unified framework of reference and our diverse talent who have the best understanding of the local market and dynamics. Talent which is critical for us to attract, retain and develop, which is why we hired around 2,000 people and we are providing them with circa 30 hours of training to maintain pace within digitization, product development, risk and ESG. Each market is now equally served by group product factories, which we pulled out from the individual banks and centralized. These in-house factories leverage our group-wide scale and scope, also to support an ecosystem of top class partners. The most recent example is Mastercard. We signed a ground-breaking partnership in June the first time any large commercial bank had put in place a single card exclusive multi-market strategy of this scale in Europe. This partnership underscore our one UniCredit approach and are further unifier across all of our market. The centralization of our factories and group-wide partners, combining with delayering, simplification of processes and way of working, training and putting back decision capabilities in the right places are delivering the divisional result you have witnessed today and in the last 10 quarters, best-in-class, in each market, in each business. All of these pillars are being facilitated and enhanced by a gradually more streamlined and group-wide approach to technology and operation. The first phase of our digital evolution is nearing completion, taking back control of our heavily fragmented and outsourced technology, bringing it in house and selectively investing in it. We have hired more than 700 developers since 2022 and are upscaling our people to ensure that we have the right capabilities engaging our providers from a group standpoint, instead of individually and streamlining the way of working to lower cost and most importantly, time to market. We have invested in cleaning and simplifying products and processes, freeing up resources, time and investment dollars, which can be repositioned towards what we really need. The second phase will be the gradual transformation to a modern, digital and data-driven organization, which will see the acceleration of automation, design of new tools and best-in-class platforms to improve our client responsiveness and more efficiency in the increasing of our consumption of technology. All of this is united by a holistic culture driven by core values and a common set of principle chosen by our people and embodied in our actions. Our industrial and cultural transformation has powered our last 10 quarters, delivered differentiated performance, and rebased our key financial metrics. We now have a sustainable competitive advantage that we are determined to further consolidate. Let me take you through our new transform core financial KPIs and their drivers. We believe we have cost leadership. This is critical to maintain a differentiated level of profitability, particularly given recent and prospective inflationary pressures. It is also critical to maintain our edge over fintechs and other market players. We have moved from force to efficiency leadership in Q1. This is a structural change versus the past and is driven by targeted cost reduction that does not affect, but rather invests and propels the quality of our revenue growth. In absolute terms, we have reduced our cost base since 2017 by 18%. Critically, however, since 2021 this was done while substantially propelling and increasing both gross and net revenue, rather than shrinking them. We aim to continue and even strengthen this competitive advantage. Quality revenue growth, we transformed both the growth and quality of our earnings. We moved from revenue laggard to revenue leader, delivering 10 successive quarters of top tier quality growth. We fundamentally transformed our ability to grow our revenue base, while improving our mix. Targeted quality revenue growth has meant being disciplined on risk, delivering EVA positive new business and focusing on fees and other capital light EVA positive sources. Net revenue to RWA improved from 10th to third, whilst fees to RWAs improved from fifth to second as we're strengthening our factories. We have and will continue to address weaknesses generated by past retrenchment, but so are selling or constraining quality businesses. We have made significant progress in rebuilding our high value added client content in a number of ways. Firstly, organically by hiring best-in-class talent attracted by our ability to deliver 15 million clients across Europe in a captive fashion. This is the case in both advisory and capital market and client risk management, demonstrated by the caliber of talent NineHouse and the visible results. These are targeted to our existing client base. Secondly, by selectively internalizing critical part of the value chain, for example in asset management building central product selection and packaging, able to deliver projects such as Nova and One Markets. Thirdly, through our two way partnership with best-in-class product provider such as Allianz, Azimut and more recently, Mastercard. Finally, we are reviewing further opportunities of growth, for example in payments both corporate and retail, where we see a significant opportunity and in unit linked, where we could internalize our dominant business in Italy. All of this requires significant investment in talent, in training, in technology, to both power group-wide factories and local distribution channels and deliver seamless integration between them. Let me give you an example to explain that point. Let's take insurance. We have already rationalized our providers from nine to four and transformed them into partners. Today Allianz designs best in class protection products tailored for our clients. Together, we have trained our people and provided insights to our clients. The result is a step up in our Italian protection market share to 14%. We're taking it even further. An integrated tech platform at group level is being launched, allowing real time access to product with streamlined processes and technology solution. This will further power our growth in the segment. Our transform quality revenue capacity is another competitive advantage that we will continue to focus on. Structural lower cost of risk; over the past few years, our gross net NPs have fallen dramatically respectively to 2.6% and 1.4%. Our underlying cost of risk has structurally declined from at least 40 basis points to 50 basis points to 20 basis points to 25 basis points, so subject to confirmation within a longer time series. Indeed, our underlying cost of risk, excluding Russia and overlays between 21 and in 2023 year to date, has been well below 20 basis points, reaching single digit basis points over each one of the last six quarters. It has benefited from a particularly benign environment and write-backs from repayments, which underscore how conservative we are on staging, classification and provisioning generally. This is due to the substantially higher quality of our credit portfolio as compared to the past that we have markedly accelerated since 2020. Second, the substantial more conservative absolute and relative to peers both backward and forward looking staging and provisioning policy, we are covered much higher in every NPE stage. We believe we have moved firmly at the forefront of our peer group in this matter and are better prepared than any to weather the current macro and geopolitical uncertainty. As a result, cost and cost of risk are much more within our control now in the next few years than most of the market had realized. We are prepared with this healthy provision and overlays in a quality credit portfolio to provide a solid buffer and positively differentiate cost of risk, both for now and in case the market turns. This is another competitive advantage and we are determined to continue strengthening it. Capital excellence, our transform capital efficiency has been a major contributor to our sustainable performance and we ranked first on this measure relative to peers in Q1. This has three main drivers. First, we focus on deploying, sorry, slide. We focus on deploying capital above the cost of equity. 77% of corporate RWAs are now to SCBA positive clients as we improve the profitability of our legacy portfolio and our discipline in new business. Second, we improve the profitability of our commitments via crosssell and pricing or ultimately exiting or securitizing position where accretive. Third, we are growing capital-light products. This is yet another competitive advantage that supports our return on tangible equity and organic capital generation. We are determined to continue building upon it. Our P&L advantages combine with those of our balance sheet, creating performance with strengths. Our CET1 remains best-in-class among peers. We continue to grow capital in spite of our best-in-class distribution, thanks to our outsized organic capital generation. Our liquidity ratio remains strong, sustainable and well above peer average, allowing better management of margins. We maintain a high quality credit portfolio with conservative proactive staging and provisioning, further improved by high overlays and lower default rate. We are focused on investing wisely to maintain profitable risk-adjusted return for the long term to the benefit of all our stakeholder and in many forms. These last two slides have sought to explain what a dramatically different group UniCredit is today, despite being less than two years into our strategic plan. Our commitment to continuing this fundamental and holistic transformation remains, as does our commitment to delivering strong, sustainable result and distribution. It is our knowledge of how much more this transformation can unlock that gives us confidence in the future beyond the effect of this positive macro. Let's now get back to the present. This is our tenth consecutive quarter of quality profitable growth. We have balanced our three levers to deliver this in a sustainable fashion. Net revenues rose significantly in both the half and the quarter, driven by quality NII growth and a tightly managed pass through. Fees remain robust, especially if we exclude the impact of lower current account fees in Italy that had not yet been waived by all banks. This is €20 million adverse per month and cost of risk at very levels, both given macro and the new change UniCredit I have just described. Of particular note is the dynamic of our deposit pass through below expectation at circa 24% and showing signs of approaching more normalized levels outside of Italy. This supports our new pass through guidance. We have been able to more than compensate the inflationary pressure on cost, both in the half and in the quarter while continuing to invest. Integration cost enable us to continue on this path, and we're stepping them up. The positive momentum in our gross operating profit continues again beating expectation. It rose close to 52% in Q2 and 42% in H1. Our capital excellence continue with both outsized capital generation and further consolidation of best-in-class CET1. UniCredit return on tangible equity continues to rise and we are surpassing our peers on this metric, having significantly lagged until a few years ago. At the same time, thanks to our substantial share buyback at depressed valuation, we are further propelling a very significant per share value creation. We are fairly unique in this respect. Let me take you now through each country or region. Our Italian business had yet another excellent quarter, demonstrating its ability to deliver sustained quality, profitable growth and outstanding returns well above peers. Net revenue rose 19% year-over-year to €5.2 billion, gross revenue up '23. This was driven by NII growth of 66%. Thanks to strict management of the pass through. Fees were down 5.2% year-on-year, mostly due to active relief provided to customer on current account applied since April. Without such relief, our fees would have been down only 2.6%. We saw good result in asset under custody, products and excellent ones in protection as was commenting. Costs fell 2% in Italy, thanks to our continued focus on simplification and streamlining and despite continuing investment both in the front line with Circa 370 new hires in 2023 and in our branches with Circa 550 completely renewed branches from the beginning of 2022. RWAs were reduced by 12%. As a result, we achieved a strong operating and capital efficiency with a 35.5% cost income ratio and 9.1% net revenue to RWAs. Profit before tax rose 31% to €2.9 billion, RoAC exceeded 25% and the region contributed 86 basis points, or €2.7 billion of organic capital generation to the group.  Our commitment to our community, clients and employees remain undiminished this quarter, delivering amongst other things, the launch of a second tranche of UniCredit per l'Italia a €10 billion package to support clients, both individuals and business. We also introduced a package of up to €1 billion to support those impacted by the May floods and offered mortgages dedicated to energy sustainability to help family and individuals in the realization of their housing projects. Today's strong set of result and the very concrete step we have taken to support families and businesses confirm that financial and social objectives are not in conflict, demonstrating that UniCredit can deliver for the benefit of our investors and of Italy as a whole. Germany; Germany's structural transformation continued to power excellent result. Net revenues were up 13% year-over-year. Gross revenues were up 14%. This was driven by NII up 9% and fees up 5% driven in part by the successful delivery of our capital-light corporate financial advisory business and also asset management fees. Cost fell nearly 5.3% in Germany with the ongoing transformation more than compensating for inflation and setting a new run rate for the future. RWAs were down 5% year-over-year. We also achieved a very strong operating and capital efficiency in Germany with a 41.7% cost income ratio and 7.3% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax was up 36% at €1.3 billion. RoAC reached 18.7% and the region delivered 57 business points or €1.8 billion of organic capital to the group. We continue to invest in our clients and our frontline delivering the introduction of a cashless advisory branch model for local high quality customer advice. Our corporate client portal has released further functionalities including the introduction of power of attorney self-service. This quarter has seen Germany continue to deliver simplification with integration of COO and Digital to deliver a full end-to-end and customer-focused approach. All of this is resulting in US being named top employer in Germany for the 13th time in a row and receiving the EDGE Move certification for D&I in 2022. Central Europe, Central Europe's quarter was defined by consistent stability and delivery of high profitability. Net revenues were up 29% year-over-year, gross were up 27%. This was driven by NII up 39%, fees slightly down following general market pressure but up in transaction and financing. Costs remained flat year-over-year as the discipline continue across all countries and our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a €38.5 cost income ratio and 7% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax was up 65% to €1.1 billion. RoAC was 20.6% and the region delivered, sorry, delivered 29 basis points or €0.9 billion of capital organically. We have made significant progress in retail digitalization signing up 67,000 new clients in first half, '23 in Czech Republic and Slovakia alone. We launched our first green mortgage covered bond in the Czech Republic and succeeded in obtaining the Green Start Certificate in Slovenia. We established the inaugural Girls Go Finance Event to strengthen girls' understanding of finances through our partnership with Teach For Austria, an initiative we intend to roll out across all of our Teach For All markets. Eastern Europe; Eastern Europe profitability continued at pace this quarter, driven by business intensity and further efficiency gains. Net revenues were 47% year-over-year, with gross revenue up 31%. This was powered by both NII up 44% and fees up 4%. Our focus on active cost management continued to balance a continuous efficiency drive with investment in digitalization and automation. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 34.1% cost income ratio and 9.2% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax landed at €800 million. RoAC was 34.4% and the region delivered 18 basis points or €600 million of capital organically. We continue to invest in our network and business and customer transformation. This quarter, we introduced cashless branches in Bulgaria. We effectively balanced our S with our E commitments, rolling out a number of social programs for vulnerable groups focused on use in Romania, whilst also supporting the employees of this group. At the same time, we saw €170 million of new lending to renewable energy within Bulgaria. Client Solution as we have discussed extensively about our investment in our factories, we will now provide just some key highlights and additional data for this quarter. Client solution revenue was resilient in the first half and relative to a strong base. Revenue fell 3% year-on-year and would have been up 1% excluding Russia. Corporate solution revenue fell 2% in the first half but grew by 3%. Excluding Russia, overall fees were up 5% year on year with RWA consumption down 13%. Driving record profitability, transaction and payment revenue rose 12% year on year, while advisory and capital markets was up seven and reached the number one fee ranking in its home market. Client risk management revenue fell 13% but would have been flat excluding Russia. Specialized lending was down 9% year on year, but flat normalized for TLTRO and one large one off. Individual solution revenue fell 4% year-over-year. Strong performance in protection continued while life insurance remained under pressure, particularly as we kept discipline around RAMOPRIMO. Brokerage and custody showed the strongest growth up 90% led by strong client demand for bond products. Our commitment to our purpose begins with us and the actions and decision we take with respect to our own people, our clients and those communities that we are intrinsically part of. These actions were evident in the overview that I gave for each one of the regions, action targeted for the need and challenges of each local market, but beyond that, whether it is closing the gender pay, the partnership we forged to fight discrimination, supporting arts and culture, the work of our foundation, which will now invest this year alone €20 million in project to support, use and education of our UniCredit start lab, our commitment to deliver on our purpose a central tenet of our strategic plan. I am now handing over to Stefano, who will provide more detail on our numbers on H1.",

    "text": "Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 18. Before I take you through the second quarter '23 results, please note the my comments are based on a year-on-year comparison, that second quarter '23 versus second quarter '22, unless otherwise noted. Let's look at the P&L in more detail, starting with revenue. In the second quarter, we generated a record €6 billion revenue up 25%, mainly thanks to an increase in net interest of about €1 billion. Revenue in second quarter includes the €60 million negative impact from current account fiat pricing in Italy. Trading activity at €0.5 billion, up 32%, supported by the fixed income, currency and commodities business. This quarter also benefited from higher treasury contribution. We took €0.1 billion impairments in profit for investment in the quarter, mostly from participation in Russia, Italy and Austria. Systemic charges in second quarter include €27 million tax on extra bank profits in Hungary as the government changed the methodology for the 2023 calculation as flagged last quarter. Let's turn to the next slide. Let me share some highlights of UniCredit's strong balance sheet and robust liquidity position. Our favorable liquidity position, starts with the structure of our balance sheet and a loan-to-deposit ratio well below 100% at a stable and sound 90%. We have a resilient and diversified deposit base. More than 80% of our deposit are from retail and SME clients. Our deposit market share across the group is stable. The decrease in volumes in the quarter are mainly driven by corporate, using their cash buffer and our focus on pricing. Thanks to our superior liquidity profile and balance sheet strength, we are in a position to be able to do so. Retail deposit volumes were broadly stable. Clients kept diversifying their saving into more asset under custody products, in particular BTPs in Italy, and they are keeping their asset with us with our TFAs up €11 billion in the quarter. Total deposits are still comfortably above pre-2020 levels. We expect the overall deposit volume to continue slightly declining in 2023 as we prioritize pricing management and quality net interest income, and as there is further rotation to asset under custody or asset under management. This is also reflected in our deposit beta, which I will discuss in more detail later. Our liquidity cover ratio at second quarter '23 was above 100% the after TLTRO repayments, in line with our managerial target range at 125% to 150%. We have a large liquidity buffer with about €215 billion liquid assets effectively unchanged, compared to the quarter before. Let's turn to Slide 20 and focus again on the quarter. Net interest income was €3.5 billion, up 6% quarter-on-quarter We continue to experience a positive net interest dynamic driven by higher loan rates and still low deposit beta. Net interest margin at 2.1%, up nine basis point in the quarter. Customer loan rates are up 43 basis point in the quarter across our regions, leveraging on higher interest rates and thanks to our commercial actions. Average client loan volumes relevant for net interest are down €4.3 billion in the quarter, driven by Germany and Italy, mainly short term loans for SME and large corporate. Clients demand for lending has declined in the first half of the year and is expected to remain contained as a consequence of higher rates. We remain focused on more profitable capital efficiency loans while supporting our clients. Loan volumes are bolstered by €3.3 billion in USG lending in the quarter as we continue assisting our client screen transition and support social initiatives. The increase in the customer deposit rate is limited to 20 basis points for the quarter, while the average Euribor three months was up 73 basis points. Our average deposit pricing is below the system across most of our regions. Average commercial deposit decreased by €8.9 billion in second quarter, mainly in Germany, but also Austria, driven by a few large corporates. We expect retail deposit market share to remain stable, while corporate deposit dynamic will continue to be lumpy. We have updated our managerial interest guidance and sensitivity. Based on a 3.75% ECB deposit facility rate from the third quarter, remaining stable thereafter and a deposit beta below 40% and the end of the year, we expect an improved full year '23 net interest income guidance at least €13.2 billion. This is mainly thanks to a better average deposit beta for the year slightly below 30%. The observed deposit beta for the group for both side and term deposit in second quarter is around 24%, an increase as we expected, but less than assumed. The slight increase in the quarter is mainly driven by Austria. In Italy we still have a low level of circa 11%. We continue to see a shift from site to term deposit. However, site for the group is still 75%. The recent TLTRO maturities did not have a material impact on the market or UniCredit funding cost. The net interest income sensitivity for a one percentage point of deposit beta is about €130 million at current rates and deposit volume assumption. The net interest income impact from an ECB deposit facility rate increase of 50 basis point is about €0.3 billion, which also depends on our client behavior and competitive dynamics develop. If the ECB starts to reduce short term rates, our deposit replicating portfolio, which is factored into our net interest income guidance will continue to support our net interest income. At today's interest rate levels, the run rate net interest income will be supported by about €0.3 billion per year. Let's turn to Slide 21. Fees in second quarter were €1.9 billion, up 2% excluding the current account fee reduction in Italy were €60 million in the quarter, in line with our guidance. Continuous strong performance in transactional fees and better financing fees more than offset still subdue investment fees. We are well-diversified and balanced as you can see from the year-on-year development of the different component parts of our fees. Transactional fees were up 1% or 11% excluding current account fee reduction in Italy, thanks to robust payment and card fees driven by client activity and property and casualty insurance growth in Italy. Repriced current account fees in Italy will continue to negatively impact transactional fees by about €20 million per month to yearend 2023. Financing fees are up 2% thanks to a recovering global capital market activity and loan fees in Germany more than offsetting higher securitization cost stemming from our active portfolio management strategy and lower credit protection insurance linked to retail mortgages in Italy. Investment fees were down 3% on reduced management fees due to lower average asset under management stock, mainly in Italy. Asset under management gross sales. And upfront fees are stable. Client aging fees were stable as we keep on supporting our clients in defending their business outcome in this volatile environment.  Let's turn to Slide 22. We reduced costs 1.2% year on year, while inflation in our footprint was above 8% in first half 2023. Let's take a closer look at HR and on HR cost developments. HR costs down 1% year on year benefiting from lower FTS down 4.6% to 73,000, supported by earlier retirement plans becoming effective in Italy.  The trade union agreement in Italy is currently being renegotiated on a national level, while the German one is valid until mid-2024. Austria closed the annual agreement at the beginning of 2023, and the mandatory salary increase of about 8% is already included in second quarter '23. Results non HR costs are down 1.4% thanks to a tight cost management and remediation actions compensating the overall inflation impact. Although integration costs are not included in the cost line, we incurred €214 million in second quarter '23. We expect for the full year to have around €0.5 billion. This is to further allow us to reduce the structural long term cost base of the group while keep hiring and investing. Let's turn to Slide 23. Cost of risk was at very low two basis point in the quarter, supported by our still low default rate at 0.8% and the good performance on repayments and back to Bonnies. We kept our overlay LLPs on performing loans stable in the quarter at around €1.8 billion to be used for any shocks or to be released in the following two years.  Our underlying cost of risk net of overlays in Russia has reset and was single digits basis point over the last six quarters. The cost of risk in the quarter includes our Biannual IFRS nine macro scenario update with corresponding LLPs stable in Italy. The cost of risk of 21 basis points reflects ongoing sound asset quality. Cost of risk for Germany and Eastern Europe is low at seven and four basis points respectively. In Central Europe, we had the negative cost of risk because of MP repayments leading to LLP releases.  Our updated spillover analysis and details of our commercial erect exposure can be found in the Annex and confirm the soundness of our group risk profile. The group's expected loss on your business at 27 basis points also confirms the credit quality of our portfolio origination and our discipline is ingrained in our organization.  Let's turn to slide 24. Our underlying asset quality remain robust gross MPs at €12.1 billion, reduced by about €0.5 billion in second quarter. The MP reduction was driven by unlikely to pay portfolio disposal in Italy, which lowered the share of unlikely to pay impasse due.  Still comparable AI at 76%, MP coverage ratio at 48%. Broadly stable quarter on quarter MP coverage does not include overlays on performing loans which come on top. Let's turn to Slide 25 in second quarter, our risk weighted asset stood at €295 million, down €4 billion quarter on quarter, driven by continued active portfolio management measure worth €3.5 billion including securitization and the reduction of low performing businesses.  Risk weighted assets are down €22 billion year on year and are expected to remain below €300 billion also by year end. Let's turn to slide 26 in second quarter, we organically generated 101 basis point of capital, 77 basis point from net profit and 24 basis point through our active risk credit asset management way ahead of our plan. We completed the two point 34,000,000,001st share by back tranche and launched the remaining €1 billion second tranche for 2022. As of 21 July, UniCredit purchased shares equal to 6.5% of the share capital for a total consideration of some €2.4 billion. Before I hand back to Andrea one item of note the Hungarian extra profit tax has been extended to 2024 as well and we it to be broadly in line with this year amount which was €75 million. Please Andrea, the floor is yours.",

    "text": "Thank you, Stefano. I will now finish with some closing remarks we're now incorporating in. The improved assumption on rates and pass through as well as cost of risk. We are also further stepping up in the execution of Unicreated unlocked key industrial drivers. As such, we are upgrading again our net profit guidance for 2023 to at least €7.25 billion, an increase of around 1.6 billion from our initial guidance at the beginning of this year, despite absorbing €500 million in integration costs that were not budgeted at the beginning of the year.  Accordingly, our distribution intention for 2023 has improved to a minimum of €6.5 billion, €1.25 billion higher than our guidance at the start of the year. Ass cash dividend shall be at least €2.4 billion up 25% year-on-year versus €1.9 billion of 2022 and circa 35% up.  Based on the current number of shares, we are confident that we will maintain this profitability and distribution at broadly this level for 2024. Given our clear levers to deliver within this reference macro, sorry, this would translate to total distribution of €22 billion between 2021 and 2024 versus the €16 billion we announced with UniCredit unlocked while substantially increasing at the same time. Our CET1 and our capital that should also benefit shareholders in new course. We have our sights also firmly set on future success with clear management priorities that I have already touched upon. We will. NII reduction by managing passthrough across each one of our banks, focusing on targeted volume growth and pricing optimization, and reaping the benefit from our asset and liability management strategy. We have a number of ways to further increase our fee generation across advisory and capital markets, private banking, private the banking payments, and overall insurance. This will provide further support to NII compression when it occurs. Our cost reduction remains targeted effective in further declining our cost base while continuing to fund our investments. We will execute this reduction by simplifying processes, rationalizing our organization and in new and renegotiated supplier contracts. At group levels, our cost of risk should remain structurally low, thanks to our disciplined quality growth, the quality of our credit portfolio and its coverage complemented by conservative provisioning we are well prepared to maintain our cost of risk below 25 business points; even in eventual forecasted peaks resulting from unexpected exceptional and we have €1.8 billion or 40 basis points of additional overlays that we charge to our P&L in '21 and '22 that can be used exactly for this eventuality, reducing the peak we continue to pursue through RWA efficiency.  We will continue our disciplined management actions, remain focused on capital light products, and increase further the efficiency of our loan backbook as it rolls. These are our current priorities for 2024, which should enable profitability and distribution broadly in line with 2023. This will be supported by the significant foreseen tailwind of a reduction in our systemic charges and benefit in lower integration cost.  Let's now turn to the last slide. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to give you my view on how we look at distributions. We're often described as having outsized distribution, but our ability to offer attractive returns is based on our extremely strong organic capital generation. We're in an enviable position and fairly unique position, a compelling and growing shareholder remuneration an increasing CET1 ratio, even post distribution, and very significant per share value growth.  Our approach to striking the right balance between cash dividend and buybacks is determined by our prevailing valuation and with a view to having a sustainable increase in the dividend year by year. As our valuation improves over time, we're open to gradually increase the cash dividend payout.  To ensure a more attractive cash dividend yield, we are able to deliver outsized distribution versus our peer group whilst significantly increasing our CET1. Our distribution are not relying on distributing our excess capital. That said, we also recognize that we are carrying an ever increasingly larger amount of excess capital that the market seems to currently value at zero. We will return this excess to shareholder if no better use of the capital can be found. This success also gives us confidence in being able to maintain our 2023 distribution for the foreseeable future. Regardless of external factors, this is an advantage relative to our peers. Thank you, and I will now open for questions. ",

    "text": "Hi, good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me, please. The first one is on capital and the second one on the net profit outlook for 2024. Starting with the first question, which is actually a follow up based on Andrea's remarks. When I look at your increased distribution, even as it stands, you will end basically every year with quite a large stack of excess capital and growing. Your policy has been quite clear. On Slide 30, I think you show the payout as a percentage of organic capital generation, which is now at 70%, but even then, it's starting to look somewhat conservative. What do you think it takes for you to increase that payout to 100% of your organic capital generation, because with that, you wouldn't even be paying any of the excess capital out? At the risk of sounding a bit harsh here, you've marked down your Russian exposure. You have large overlays. You don't really guide to any significant regulatory headwinds going forward. So why not pay 100% of what you generate given, as you said, you have a lot of excess, and so I'm wondering why they need to grow it further. That's my first question. The second question is to do with your net profit guidance. You're guiding to be broader in line to this year also in 2024, so at least €7.25 billion. Could you talk about how you see the drivers year on year in 2024 versus 2023? I think on Slide 29 you provide some very interesting color on a qualitative basis. Can we maybe talk through and help us understand better the bridge in profitability across those three drivers? Thank you.",

    "text": "Okay. So thank you, Antonio. So let's start with capital and distribution and everything else. So firstly I take note and noted on the fact that if we look at our capital as a proportion of organic capital generation or as a proportion of net income, we seem to becoming less aggressive, meaning that if we look at the proportion of distribution, vis-à-vis net income in '21 and then in '22. Then the indication we're giving for '23 we're distributing ever less relative to net income, a little bit more relative to organic capital generation, which is what drives us. Why are we doing that, because we're not at the end of the year. We have been very clear in saying that our distribution are equal or above to the numbers we're giving you and the numbers will be finalized when we reach the end of a year. We see what the future will take us in 2024 and we have all the elements to take a judgment call. But in general we maintain the fact that we will maintain prudent distribution, which for us are keeping them within our guiding capital generation with an eye on what they are as a proportion of net income, as net income seems to be an industry practice, but I am committed in fulfilling my commitment on distribution, actually on beating them through results. On the excess, it's something different. At some point we will complement what we do organically recurrently and ordinarily, which is what I'm talking about now, with an integration of return of my excess capital over time to complement what we're doing. We are on the second quarter of the year. There is still a lot of uncertainty at the moment. The guidance is what it is. We will refine it as we go through the year.  The second thing is 2024, which I think is quite critical. I think that the whole UniCredit is delivering as best it can for 2023. The role of a management team is to prepare for 2024 and beyond. So as we look at 2024, we look at it in this fashion. Firstly, NII will have an adverse headwinds, assuming that our macro is correct, given that interest rates are going to have plateaued, will have plateaued, and the path through is going to continue to converge.  Now, that effect for us is a little bit greater than peers in Northern Europe, a little bit less than our peers in Italy, given that the markets where the passthrough has the biggest effect are Southern European markets. Now, this adverse effect will be partially offset by what it will be offset by selected volume growth in SMEs and other segments and products across the franchise in retail, which we are in a position now to do at even positive levels. This is also helped by the fact that we continue to grind down our backbook and that grounding. Is an adverse on our loan growth but it's not going to last forever at the same rate. The second thing is that we were, as we said several times originally, let's say under replicated and conservatively replicated, as we bring up our replication to the right run rate for this level of rates, because we expect them to go down at some point, we are bringing in additional revenue.  And Stefano has mentioned it at the current level of interest rate is €300 million of additional revenues per year. If rates increase, that's more. So these factors together we're anticipating a reduction of NII but a reduction of NII that is less than what you may think because of these offsetting factors. Still a reduction then the second thing is what happens on revenues overall? Well, we are anticipating strong or solid fee income as we continue to invest in our factories. The fee income from our factories is dependent on the macro.  Much lower rates means better fees in asset management, in life insurance and in other things. So there will be a beta effect against positive beta effects on the fees of setting in part the negative beta effects on NII and in our case, let's say propelled by all the investment we're doing in asset management action, in payments, in advisory and capital market, in client risk management, et cetera, et cetera. So that will bridge the gap further or compensate the gap depending on the speed of pass through flowing in our account so that's the revenue line then below the revenue line. We have two other factors. One factor is cost. We're determined to keep our cost base down this year and flat or down next year. We said we had an ambition to still hit UniCredit unlocked pre inflation. That means our cost line still has further room to go down and that I think is a competitive advantage because when NII will reverse people who have not managed their cost line will get a margin squeeze. People who have will not and we will keep on driving this down. I think that's a competitive advantage and we will deliver that. That could give us 150,000,000 of lift again, then we have a cost of risk.  Cost of Risk we are not anticipating a meaningful divergent between what the cost of risk will be for the whole year of '23 and '24. Why that? Because even if we assume an increase in cost of risk underlying due to the deceleration of the economy, we think that the more conservative level of provisions that we have relative to benchmark and the release, the gradual release of overlays. To bash down that peak will allow us to remain at a cost of risk. That is in the ballpark of what it will be this year, given what we know today. So as you see, revenues will go down a lot less or not depending on what we do on the outsetting fashion costs will go down so that's a positive cost of risk remain the same. Now, we have two other buffers that we believe we are unique in having. Number one, as a GC fee we have very significant reduction in systemic charges coming in next year. I think Stanford [ph] has indicated more than one times that is several hundreds, millions of dollars, €300 million to be the case and we also have that we have told you that this year €7.25 billion are done absorbing. So after having expensed €500 million of integration cost to support our efficiency gains, but I don't have to do €500 million in immigration cost next year. So theoretically I have another €500 million in there. When you pull it all together, you see that. Of course, we don't have a perfect picture of what the future will be, but based on what we do today and the levers we have that we control, we think we can remain broadly in line year on year and everything is quite granularly explained within our management team.",

    "text": "Well, if I had the answers, I would do your job, but Andrea, what can I say? I do what I control. Let's look at the silver lining. Number one, I'm never going to sell a share and number two, I am buying stock which is undervalued by the bucket load and the people who are in it are going to see explosive distribution yield and at some point consistent, resilient, recurrent, repeated outperformance is going to trickle in. Why is that today, now being serious? I have my personal understanding of my personal views given my last job. My personal view is that the market has very few specialist investors in banks and how many of us are still left after a decade of drought? Not many. And the money from specialist investor is limited, is long only and moves very slowly as it should. Most of the money that makes the difference is from generalist and generalists by definition don't understand banks.  So what they do is they invest through the cycle on macro rates and rates are capped. They're going down cost of risk cycle and at least looking at the past, which is the one way of looking at it in my opinion, the cost of risk is going to explode. So if you are looking at macro drivers, looking at past performance of European financials, that's what you're doing in order to buy banks. And you are seeing a substantial increase in share price which has occurred anyway.  You're not moving money into it or you are reticent to move money into it. And if on top of it you're based in the United States, you're looking at your own system, which for once is a lot weaker and less resilient than the one of Europe. But you don't know that from the standpoint of what you're looking at. So that's my rationalization. All the management team can do is continue to prove people wrong every quarter by delivering on results ahead of expectation, if we can. And then at some point, hopefully, it trickles into the share price. Thank you, Andrea. Thank you. The next question is from Chris Hallam with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yeah, good morning, everybody.  So my first question, it's a bit of a follow up from Antonio's earlier question, but just around the phasing of revenues in prior quarters, you've talked about Q2 or Q3 this year being the peak for NII and for fees growth really kicking in from the second half of next year. But given what we're seeing on betas as well as a more benign macro backdrop, are either of those time frames moving at all i.e. NII peaking later or fees recovering earlier? That's my first question.  And then second, you talked about being a benchmark bank and rot for the first half as over 20% at 13% quarter one. So there's clearly a lot of operating leverage in the business right now given all the momentum in NII. But I wanted to hear your thoughts about what you think a sustainable level of return on capital could now be for unit credit through the foreseeable future given the progress you've made on cost and capital efficiency.  And if that longer term Rot is higher than you previously expected, whether that changes where you want to take the business and where you want to invest capital. Okay, so peak and II. So peak and AI is we still feel it's probably, as we said, between Q two and Q three pick and II is driven by two factors, obviously. One is rates. When are we going to peak in rates? And we all assume an increase in rates this week, and some of us assume there will be another one, but very few assume there will be yet another one after that I don't know, but we are reaching the back end of a rates increase cycle. The second thing to which banks are now a lot more, let's say, sensitive to is pass through. As rates have gone where they are, pass through is continuing to converge. So, as we said in the presentation, we see signs of normalization of path through outside of Italy. That is due to the fact that they have reached levels that are, let's say, much more in line to what they were when rates were at this level in the past. Actually, in many cases they have surpassed that, but then at that level it normalizes. In Italy not yet the case. We're still lagging behind, and we're lagging behind because of the structure of the market and the structure of the client base.  But the progression is inevitable. And we are conservatively assuming in our numbers that the path through in Italy will exceed what was the case at similar rates in the past. So, given that rates are at the end of the increase and pass through continuing to grind up, especially in Italy, we think that second to third is the peak.  So far we have been overly cautious on passthrough and so. I don't exclude that the peak is third to fourth if the pass through grinds up slower than we are anticipating this quarter, given that the rates are still going up, but that's the order of magnitude. Okay, then the dynamic is that getting into next year, you're going to have rates that, contrary to the past, we assume staying at higher level for a little bit longer than we were anticipating before.  A few quarters, and then that pass through, given that the exit rate is lower than we had anticipated, takes a little bit more time to get to the levels we were anticipating before. So the support on the commercial side of NII is a little bit better than before on the non-commercial side.  So let's call it the replication and the commercial side with volume growth, we think we can offset some of that. That's why the scenario is more benign than we were anticipating in 2024. Fees? Fees are progressing and it depends on the factory, if you want to put it this way.  If you look at protection, we're talking increases depending on the reference time of 50, 70, 90% volume growth. If you look at our market share and protection, we went from the low single digit to 14% of the market. So that is occurring. Obviously, the base of start was low, but the base of start, when you're growing volume at that rate, does not stay low for a long time. It becomes visible quite soon. If you take asset management, we're still being grinded down, but at the same time, that is giving us time to roll out our initiative, Nova, one market, and other things that we're doing to internalize more of a value chain.  So that is something that. Is going to offset. And when Asset Management cycle comes back in, we think we're going to grow faster than people expect because of this internalization. Then we have payment. I think it's premature to look at the numbers, but I think it will be a contributor advisory capital market and client risk management has given us a lot of satisfaction. And we think that now it's plugged on our captive franchise and delivering. Let's see how the market goes, and so life insurance, we are going to perform, in my opinion, a little bit less well than Peer because we have a much more cautious view on Ramo Primo, which is high volume and high fees, and we're much more focused on unit Linked, which is the market where we have a market share above 40% in Italy and that we're looking to potentially internalize in the next in time, which takes it will take time for us to do that. If that compromise is confirmed, that alone will bring a significant portion of additional other income into our P&L, so all of these things are small, incremental things that are increasing our fee and other income incidents. On revenues that is currently a bit masked by the excellent performance on NII. The other one was sustainable. Rote. Yeah, that's really what I asked myself. If I take RoTE at 13% and I take an environment of rates that is structurally higher than what we have seen in the last decade and this is a very important point that I think is also missed. The rate cycle may be peeping out, but we're going to go to you tell me 2.5, 2.75, 2.25 positive rates for a commercial bank going from minus 50 to those numbers it's massive. You have 60, 70, 55, whatever it is of your P&L that is now production in production and yields, and that combines with a focus gross on EVA positive, has an incremental impact on your rote. So without, if you ask me, a number of gut feeling, we need to aim something around 15% on sustainable basis with a real cost of capital when everything stabilizes 1011, these kind of numbers, maybe twelve, I don't know. But we are determined to exceed the cost of equity and to exceed it by a margin. And I think we can do that, maybe a couple of remarks. Thank you very much. You mentioned also the timing. So the RoTE tangible equity excluding the excess capital for this year, we gathered for around 17%.  Considering that we guided for a profitability for next year broadly in line, you can also draw the consequences in relation to the return on tangible equity for 2024. In relation to the fees, we are not expecting the growth in the second half because all the elements highlighted by Andrea, so all the commercial actions, the normalization of the rates and also an increased level of GDP with the positive impact on the client activity is expected for next year so for '24.",

If I'm not mistaken, you seem to assume that your ambition is to keep the cost base for '24 as flat. That in my view would be a great achievement. I was wondering first of all, whether I got it correctly. And secondly, seems like in Italy there are clearly strong pressure to increase the cost of employees.

    "text": "Thank you. Okay, so peak and AI profitability. So our job is to try and offset the peak NII and reversal with other levers. And I think that that in our case is the result; one of good normalized deliver, but also all the actions that we're doing with UniCredit unlocked. So that means that without repeating all the things we can offset some of the NII reduction or some of the impact on NII from rates and pass through more gross in volume of the segments of clients and products that we want better replication because we were more replicated before.  Less replicated before and that is adding better fees as we continue to invest in our factories and we continue and that will be significant, lower cost and a cost of risk that going forward will be structurally lower than it has been in the past. To that you're adding that when we are through with a lot of the actions, we are going to have run rating some 800 million more between systemic charges and avoided or no longer necessary integration cost that can support some of the gap.  But it is clear that the challenge is to keep it stabilized to this high level and then over time find a new gross trajectory. Obviously the macro is better than I am telling you now the upside exists but at the moment we see what we are cost is. If you look at what has happened in '21, in '22 and now in '23 we have seen act the inflation and attacked the efficiency of a group since day one front loading and aggressively streamlining their organization.  You can't just cut cost across the board. You need to cut cost in a disciplined and surgical fashion. We have done that, we have supported that with hundreds. In integration cost. And we continue to take down what we take down a headcount significantly. Look at our headcount when we start and what it is today. We take down the non HR cost which are linked to all the contracts that we have. We had providers with 19 different contracts at Unicredited.  Now we go for one and bring significant offsetting on cost reduction given volumes and other things. So cost has been an obsession of ours, but it has been an obsession on of others that is executed while keeping a very attentive eye to continued investment and to reinvesting in the front end and in digital, so that it doesn't affect negatively revenue. It actually supports the further growth. This approach has still quite a bit to run, certainly all of '24 and certainly all of '23 -- sorry, certainly all of '23 and certainly all of '24. It's premature to see. What we do in Italy will be totally consistent with agreement with the trade unions through pre-retirement and through whatever the negotiation of a new contract is, which we have seen coming for a long time and we have already prepared for.",

    "text": "Thank you. Okay, so excess capital position, obviously, is dependent on how much capital we're going to distribute this year, which will be equal or in excess of €6.5 billion. What we have said that we're committed to is whatever that distribution will be, our CET1, that performer for total distribution was 14.9% at yearend, 2022 will be no less, actually will be materially more.  So whatever the distribution that we do, we will have materially more CT One at the end of this year. That means that our excess capital, you can calculate, is about €1.5 billion. It's about €3 billion per point above 12.5%, 13% and that's what we are carrying. Going into 2024, we are set to do exactly the same i.e., we will have distribution that are broadly in line with the one of this year, given the condition that I have discussed in terms of profitability and everything else, and organic capital generation.  And we will target again to distribute while not reducing the excess capital also, the CET1 that we will have accumulated at the end of '23. So if you look at the trajectory, we've gone from the 13.5% area, then we have climbed to 49%, we will be above 49%, and then we will climb again to above whatever numbers we have at the end of this year. That is what we are doing with the ordinary distribution. Clearly it leaves us room to improve them because we are, I think, one of the very few, if not the only one to distribute and increase CT One.  At some point we're going to distribute and not increase CT One and then at another point we're going to distribute and give back to shareholders the excess capital. Most peers are in the third phase, we are in the first phase and we need to flow through the other two, which gives us very strong confidence on the absolute amount of distribution being defensible for the long term on cost, cost saving.  Where are we? So inflation first as a reference, inflation in our footprint 2023, about 7.1% excluding Russia, 5.5% in Eurozone, 6.2% in Italy, 6.1% in Germany. Inflation in 2024 expected 3.1% in our footprint, 2.4% in Eurozone, 2.4% in Italy, 2.8% in Germany. This is the reference points that we're using and on the reference point that we're using, we will continue. So this year we will decrease cost year on year from 2022 to 2023 and in '24 the minimum we're aiming to do is to keep them flat.  If we can, we're going to go below. And how are we going to do that? With continuous streamlining, simplification way of working, deburocratization of the organization, targeting processes that used to have 25 steps and no automation. And we are going to end to end automated process. So it's a long grading hygiene that we roll and roll and roll process after process, releasing resources and supporting these changes. Clearly the axis of FTE are negotiated with every trade union in every market where we are and are consistent with those negotiations. No more, no less.",

That's €4.3 billion. I don't think anybody else has done anything like that. Okay. The impact of in this quarter alone I think we have compressed locally another billion. We continue to grind down. What we're doing there is to be consistent with local laws and sanction and with the sanctions and the directives that western governments give us and the strategy is identical to what we have said. It's a gradual, progressive, orderly reduction of our exposure towards the country. That's what we do and it has been quite successful. We will continue to do that.  In terms of added attention, I think the attention is the one that there has been since day one and its maximum from everybody and we continue to execute on that basis. Just as a reminder, the impact on capital of the local participation in the absolute worst scenario from extreme loss is about 30 basis points locally and another about 10 basis points on what remains of our cross border portfolio.  The last thing that I would like to say so that you have an idea if you look at net loans so net of provisions at constant effects our cross border exposure to Russia has gone down in five quarters 69% and our local 48% for a blended 54%. So I don't think you could ask from anybody to do something more decisively within obviously regulation and laws and everything else. And that's what we are going to continue to do maintaining the risk under control.",

Just coming back to the deposit mean your assumption does include a small acceleration in the increase in the pass through. So I was just wondering what you think are the main drivers for the acceleration. And then my second question is going back to excess capital. There's going to be a little bit of a gap on share buybacks between the second tranche of 1 billion and the one you're going to run for four year 23.  Is there any possibility, given where your CT One and NDA buffer stands to kind of already anticipate a buyback ahead of four year results announcement to start something that is maybe extraordinary buyback you talked about, complementing it and what's preventing you from starting other way now?

    "text": "Thank you. So I'll take the excess capital and the SBB and everything else. There's nothing stopping us. And everything is possible at the time being. It doesn't seem that the market is very sensitive to our distributions, but seriously, nothing is stopping us and we are reassessing the situation because one thing is to be consistent with our sustainable ordinary distribution and getting to a level that we are confident we can support over time.  The other thing is the correct judgment on two factors. One is how much cash dividend in the mix. And two is whether we should overlay earlier the return of the excess capital to our ordinary distribution or not and we are reviewing those topics all the time. And obviously the higher the excess capital, the more there is a, let's say, driver to consider extreme redistribution on top of the ordinary. For the time being, there is no decision, nothing is stopping us beyond shareholder approvals and obviously ECB approval, but we are relatively comfortable on those on net interest income dynamic, especially in relation to the deposit beta assumption. Less are from the current situation. So. The average deposit beta is around 24%.  That's very differentiated by each country or geography. So Italy is around 11%. In the case of Germany, we are above 30%, Central Europe is around 35 and Eastern Europe is 25%. Andrea commented before in relation to the assumption for 2024, these are assumption.  So we are assuming to have a general deposit beta above the historical levels that for the group were between 30% and 35%, where we are assuming to be slightly below 40%. That means in every geography we are assuming to be above the historical levels. So to give you the sense, for example, in Germany and Central Europe we're assuming to be above 40%, while in Italy and Eastern Europe to be above 330. In 2024, in each geography we're assuming to be above historical levels. The dynamic of the rates in terms of velocity was unprecedented. In some of the countries, the increase of the deposit beta is normalizing, so is moderating, and in some other country, like Italy, is low, is very low, is currently sticky and below the historical level. So that's why we think it's appropriate in terms of future projection to assume, let's say a normalization towards the level that we had many years ago and being conservative in terms of assumption as already allied before. If the dynamic will be different in comparison to this assumption, we will have tailwinds on the dynamic of the net interest income.",

First off on NII, I understood you will assume that the beta will continue to go up after the end of this year. So you're ending at below 40%. So where do you think the average next year will be? Second, on the capital distribution, are you also considering the potential introduction of an interim dividend or interim dividends? And then third, your comment on the sustainable RTE of 15%, is that net of the excess capital that you already have?

    "text": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we will walk you through what you have achieved thanks to our UniCredit Unlocked plan, our goals and our outlook for 2024. I have always stated that my ambition is to build a bank that is strongly grounded in the right principles and values, one that delivers long-term quality growth and value for all our stakeholders, our shareholders, our employees, our clients and our communities. As we report our 12th consecutive quarter of quality profitable growth across all regions, I can proudly say that in these last three years we have fulfilled this ambition. For our shareholders, we delivered quality growth, operational and capital excellence, sustainable profitability, capital generation and distributions, all underpinned by strong capitalization, liquidity and asset quality. For our employees, we have focused on providing a motivating vision, a rewarding and merit-based environment, a culture to which they identify and ultimately pride in what we are achieving. And for our clients and community, they are at the heart of everything we do. We have improved the quality of service and support we provide, offering best-in-class product through diversified, integrated and strengthened channels. This commitment to delivering and pursuing excellence has been our guiding principle and driven all that we have done so far and it will continue to be our focus as we move ahead. UniCredit had its best year ever in 2023, the culmination of a three-year journey which delivered for the present while transforming our bank and preparing for the future. We will review our past accomplishments and look ahead to 2024 and beyond, where our sights are set on new heights. This is the year we grew our net profit to €8.6 billion, up 54% while continuing to invest in the future and expensing €1.1 billion of integration costs. Without these, our net profit would have been €9.5 billion. We delivered a record return on tangible equity of 16.6%, 5.8 points higher than last year, or 20.5% with a CT1 ratio of 13% adjusting for our notable excess capital. Fourth quarter was much better than expected, with net profit up 19% despite higher integration costs to secure our future. Without them, net profit would have been up 37%. We generated €12 billion in capital organically this year, underpinning our proposed distribution of €8.6 billion, or 100% of net profit, €3 billion dividend and €5.5 billion share buyback, while reinforcing our CT1 ratio by 100 basis points to 15.9%. Following new EBA rules, we adjusted Q4 CT1 and will continue to adjust going forward as we accrue distribution, both cash and share buyback. Our cumulative past three years distribution exceeds €17.5 billion, more than our market cap at the beginning of 2021. At the same time, we increased CT1 by circa €10 billion in the period. Our per share growth continues to be industry leading, with EPS up 74%, DPS 80%, and tangible book per share up 17% this year. The quality of such growth is underscored by the progress on our three financial levers and a 12% reduction in share count over the year, 30% reduction since the beginning of 2021. In 2024, we aim to maintain net profit broadly in line with 2023 record level, normalizing our best year ever while further improving the quality of our results across the P&L, delivering double digit growth in EPS and DPS. We expect the tailwind from interest rates and cost of risk to gradually fade. The impact from continuing to scale down Russia while our fees, which have grown to represent 32% of our revenues, should further increase their weight. As we work to deliver these results, we will reward our shareholders with outside calendar year distribution of approximately €10 billion. We consider 2024 the start of a second phase of UniCredit Unlocked, rooted in the same vision, the same strategy and mostly the same levers as we continue our transformation. We will defend our profitability and the leadership achieved in operational and capital efficiency as well as cost of risk. We will strive to further improve the quality of our results, continuing to deploy our capital profitably while growing our capital-light businesses. We shall strive to sustain best-in-class distribution while strengthening our bank and continue to deliver value for investors through substantial earnings and dividend per share growth. Let me now take you through UniCredit's best year ever, a testament to our commitment to excellence and our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. 2023 has been an exceptional year for UniCredit, with a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter in which we took the opportunity to absorb even more integration costs than anticipated. Our key metrics highlight the outstanding performance across our three financial levers. Net revenue increased 26% to €23.2 billion, with gross revenue up 17%. We have continued to improve our operational efficiency, reducing costs by 1% to €9.47 billion, while absorbing inflation and investment. Our cost-income ratio has further dropped by 7.2 percentage points to 39.7% for the year. Similarly, we have continued to improve our capital efficiency, with RWA decreasing 2% to €284.5 billion, with net revenue to RWAs reaching 7.9% up 2.1 points. We reached a record return on tangible equity of 16.6%, notwithstanding €1.1 billion of integration costs and a significant capital buffer. Indeed, our underlying return on tangible equity at 13% CT1 ratio reached 20.5%, 22.4% if we excluded integration costs. All these lead to €12 billion or 389 basis points of organic capital generation, underpinning our proposed increased distribution of €8.6 billion or 100% of 2023 net profit. Let me now take you through the main item of our P&L in greater detail. We report a significant increase in net revenues, growing 26% year-over-year. This was driven by excellent net interest income and resilient fees, while our cost of risk remained significantly lower than our guidance of 20 to 25 basis points through the cycle. Our trading revenues continue to show resiliency and stability as primarily driven by client business. Our NII grew 31% year-over-year and was sequentially flat in the quarter, driven by rates rising 218 basis points on average in the year and 21 basis points in the quarter across our footprint, coupled by strict pass-through management, which reached 28% in Q4 and averaged at 25% in the full year. We continue our focus on quality risk adjusted, simplified EVA positive origination, profitable and capital efficient client business rather than value-destroying volumes, which together with subdued loan demand led to client volume dropping €8.5 billion in the quarter. The rise in customer deposit rates was small with clients continuing to shift their savings into assets under custody products. However, our already strong liquidity position improved, with LCR increasing to above 145% and loans to deposit ratio decreasing to 86%. Our NII sensitivity is updated to €130 million per percentage point change of deposit beta and €140 million per 25 basis points change of the ECB deposit facility rate. We view NII and cost of risk as intimately linked, both in the way that we look at our numbers and the way we manage our franchise and our KPIs. These numbers demonstrate what we have said quarter after quarter. We have a robust and high-quality credit portfolio at €428 billion with a low default rate, a very meaningful reduction of NPE to €11.7 billion with improved quality mix and coverage, as well as a lower expected loss on new business, confirming our vigilant approach towards new origination. The last 12 quarters show a structurally lower and less volatile underlying cost of risk net of overlays in Russia, at an average of 16 basis points and always below 22, versus approximately 60 basis points on average from 17 to 19. This transform and strong asset quality underpins our 2023 cost of risk of 12 basis points, 28 basis points in the quarter as we took the opportunity to further build up our market-leading overlays and provision to protect or further propel our future results. We have and will continue to make substantial progress in our fee line. Notwithstanding consistent macro headwinds, we have grown our fees each and every year since 2021. We've compounded annual growth rate of 2% from 2021 to 2023 once we exclude the impact from current account fees and accelerated securitization cost. In 2023, fees grew 1% excluding €180 million reduction in current account fees in Italy to the benefit of our clients and higher securitization costs. Today, UniCredit fee structure is well diversified. It is balanced with a top tier fee to revenue ratio of 32.3%. Full potential from past and future investment as the impact from internalization is yet to be realized. Despite inflation across our geographic footprint and investment in our people, franchise and technology, we have been able to reduce cost 3% in a targeted fashion between 2021 and 2023. Growth of such investment and inflation, our costs would have dropped 13%. The fourth quarter of 2023 saw [Indiscernible] flat year-on-year in spite of a significant increase in our bonus pool. This is evidence in our commitment to paying for performance and recognition of the hard work of our people. Our focus on profitable capital deployment led to a net revenue to risk-weighted asset ratio increase to 7.9% in 2023, up from 5% in 2021. We generated 389 business points of capital organically in 2023, or €12 billion, well above our net profit, leveraging our quality focus and excellent portfolio management with proactive RWA management. Risk-weighted assets stood at circa €285 billion, down almost €25 billion in the year. In 2023, UniCredit CT1 ratio increased almost 100 business points from 14.91% to 15.89%, showing our ability to distribute capital whilst continuing to substantially strengthen our capitalization. Over the last three years, our CT1 ratio has grown despite absorbing business requirements and substantial regulatory headwinds and returning €17.6 billion to our shareholders. Let me now outline our results through the prism of our business, starting with client solutions. Our factories generated €9.9 billion in 2023, of which fees accounted for 64%. This is a 1% rise from the previous year if we leave out Russia, which we continue to scale down, showing the steady performance of our banks, backed by our factories in spite of challenging market conditions. Corporate solutions brought in a revenue of €4.9 billion, a decline of 6% from the previous year, mainly due to the cutback of the Russian business and TLTRO, without which we would have been flat. Within corporate solutions, advisory and capital markets were up 11% and trade and correspondent banking 5%, as they both continue to leverage our unique footprint. Deals of note include the Eurogroup, L'Automatica, [ph] Ferretti IPOs and Upower [ph] Leverage Buyout. Payments increased 12% driven by NII growth, boosted by our better leveraging of our European presence and recent investment in the business. Please remember that 90% of payments revenues are fee driven. Individual solutions still face a difficult macro environment leading to a 4% drop. However, we see positive signs in the growth of managed funds and especially in non-CPI protection, which was up 40% year-on-year. Our Italian business delivered another quarter of outstanding results. €5.6 billion of profit before tax, up 29% year-over-year. Net revenue reached €10.5 billion, up 19% with gross revenues aligned. Net interest income grew 50% whilst fees were almost flat when excluding current account fee reduction done for the benefit of our clients and securitization cost. Cost of risk remained low at 22 basis points, stable at 19 basis points in the quarter. Cost decreased by 1.8% leading to a cost income ratio of 35.8%, and down 7.8 points year-on-year, with continued focus on shrinking non-business activities and optimizing processes also through technology. Our focus on capital efficiency improved net revenue to RWA by 2.5 points to 9.3% in Italy, with an increase of ROAC by 8.5 points to 25.7%. Italy generated 168 basis points of €5.2 billion of capital organically this year. Significant progress has been made industrially. We launched 28 one market funds. We hired over 600 people while shrinking non-business staff by 700. We provided 1.2 million hours of training through UniCredit University to our staff. Finally, we continue to invest in our distribution channel, including by refurbishing our branches and launching buddy R-Evolution. We have remained steadfast in our commitment to supporting individuals, households and businesses investing €10 billion euros through UniCredit per l'Italia. All these efforts have been recognized with UniCredit being named Bank of the Year Italy 2023 by the banker. Our German franchise achieved its best result in over a decade, reaching profit before tax of €2.1 billion up 18% year-over-year. Net revenue reached €5.3 billion, increasing 13% with gross revenue up 8%. NII was up 4% and fees 1%. Cost of risk of 14 basis points was down 16 basis points versus 2022. Germany showcased operating efficiency, reducing its cost base by 4% whilst hiring an additional 320 full time equivalent employees in the business. This resulted in a cost income ratio reduction of 5.5 points to 44.3%. Our focus on capital efficiency improved net revenue over RWA by 1.4 points to 6.9% in Germany, leading to a return on allocated capital of 16.1%, an increase of 5.2 points. Germany generated 98 basis points of €3 billion of capital organically this year. These results were propelled by our ongoing industrial transformation where we are investing in harmonizing and consolidating our training activities and technology. Banks were being an example of an enhancement to our digital offering. We have also made available 24 different onemarkets Funds in the country. Central Europe delivered excellent performance in the year with profit before tax up 62%, reaching a total of €2.2 billion. Net revenue reached €4.2 billion, increasing 27% with gross revenue up 24%. NII increased 25%. Fees remain flat, net of higher acquisition cost in the Czech Republic. Cost of risk reduced to 4 basis points. Costs remain broadly stable despite inflation and investment and cost-income ratio decreased by 8.8 points to 38.1%. Our disciplined approach on RWA continued across countries. Net revenue to RWA was up 1.4 points to 6.9%. ROAC reached 21%, up 6.7 points. Central Europe generated 62 basis points, or €1.9 billion of capital organically this year. In addition to strong financial results, we are progressively rolling out 23 onemarket Funds in Austria, 16 in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia. And we are proud to have issued the inaugural green mortgage-covered bond in the Czech Republic and led the third series of green bonds on the Budapest Stock Exchange. Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe confirmed its consistent profitability and demonstrated its role as a major growth engine for the group, with profit before tax almost doubling to reach €1.7 billion. Net revenue was up 48% to €2.7 billion, with gross revenue increasing 30%. This was driven by NII up 47%, fees up 3.8%, and a net reversal of LLPs with negative cost of risk of minus 22 basis points. Cost-income ratio decreased by 8 points to 32.9%. Costs increased by 4.9%, substantially below inflation. Our approach towards capital excellence moved net revenue to RWA up 3.1 points to 9.6%. ROAC increased 17.7 points to 36.9%. Eastern Europe generated 39 basis points, or €1.2 billion of capital organically this year. The region is continuing its industrial transformation to support its present and future financial performance. We introduced an end-to-end digital process on overdraft and credit cards, as well as a voicebot in Croatia, to better serve our clients quickly and efficiently. Our retail offering was revamped in Romania, resulting in a market share increase of approximately 80 basis points year-over-year. We also began to exploit the synergies resulting from the merger with Alfa Bank. Our onemarket Fund offering is already available in Bulgaria, with 16 funds, and soon to be launched in Romania. These actions led us to be awarded as the best bank in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Croatia, and best mobile bank app in Bosnia Mostar. 2023 was not a standalone achievement, but rather the result of a three-year journey. I will now briefly guide you through the factors that underpin and sustain our outstanding performance. At the core of our journey lies our unique vision and winning strategy, underpinned by our industrial transformation, all guided by our shared principles and values. Three years ago, UniCredit was falling short when it came to serving its clients. A siloed model, burdened by bureaucracy, with a corporate center that had lost its focus on the client. We have redefined our operating model, putting clients back at the center of the bank's strategy and operation, to unlock our inherent potential and deliver value for all our stakeholders. We are rebuilding UniCredit block by block, that will result in long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. We are empowering and unifying our team through a common vision and a clear culture, promoting ownership, accountability and learning from mistakes. We are all parts, working in lockstep, with our purpose and values as the lynchpin. We are simplifying and delayering, creating a leaner, faster and efficient structure that cultivates empowerment within a clear framework. We are rationalizing and strengthening our partnership and our approach to procurement, leveraging group scale and bargaining power to build long-lasting relationships with our suppliers. We continue to invest in our people on the front line, distribution channels, products and in our franchise, with full value yet to be realized. We are modernizing and enhancing our digital and data capabilities, taking back control of core competencies, streamlining and enhancing our digital organization and standardizing and modernizing our technology. As a result, UniCredit has gone from laggard to leader, both in terms of its model and its financial performance. Since the unveiling of UniCredit Unlocked, we have adapted to a changing environment to deliver unmatched value to our stakeholders, consistently over the last three years. Our financials have been excellent, with our 2023 return on tangible equity and net profit increasing respectively over 3x and 2.6x versus the 2017-19 average. We have generated over €27 billion of capital organically in the 2021-23 period, supporting a total distribution of €17.6 billion above our initial market cap, while substantially increasing our CT1 ratio. Our 2023 EPS, DPS, and tangible book per share are up 3.1x, 9x, and 46% respectively, versus the average of 17-19. Our total shareholder returns have exceeded the peer group 3.5x over the last three years, whilst we have continued to build lines of defence and invest for the future. While the future is still uncertain and the challenge is significant, there is still meaningful value to be unlocked and we face the future with confidence. Looking to the future, 2024 is a normalization year. We should absorb most or all of the headwinds facing us by further improving the quality of our earnings, our operation and capital efficiency and risk-taking, while greatly rewarding the investors willing to embark with us on the next phase of our journey. We expect NII to face headwinds as deposit pass-through continues to increase. We stand firm on profitability rather than volumes, and continue to scale down Russia, with an impact estimated at €300 million, partly upset by circa €400 million positive impact from our replicating portfolio. Our cost of risk should increase from an all-time low of 12 basis points, but still remain below 20 basis points. We expect fees to grow by a few hundred million, thanks to our investment and more favourable environment. Trading should normalize, also in light of the assumed euro zone rate reduction during 2024, all resulting in net revenue of around €22.5 billion, based on our underlying assumption. The continued scaling down of Russia should account for roughly half of the gap with 2023. We will drive our costs down further. This is while absorbing the effect of inflation and contract renegotiation through the exit financed by our integration costs, and supported by continued streamlining and simplification. Our non-operating items deserve a special mention, as they shall significantly reduce due to the integration costs that total €1.1 billion in 2023, trending to zero, and systemic charges reducing by more than €200 million. As such, we expect net profit to remain broadly in line with 2023 level, with improved P&L quality. Return on tangible equity at circa 16.5%, and organic capital generation to exceed 300 basis points, all underpinning sustained distribution pre-NE capital usage. We are aiming for double-digit growth in our EPS and DPS. We intend to reward investors who embark with us on the next phase of our journey with circa €10 billion 2024 calendar year distributions. The sum of €7.2 billion of remaining 2023 distribution, after the 1.4 billion share buyback already executed in 2022, and the introduction of an interim distribution of around 40% of our expected 2024 distribution to be executed in the fourth quarter or in October. Around €4.3 billion will be in cash, leading to a dividend yield of approximately 10%, an expected DPS growth of more than 2.5 times, and around 5.8 billion share buyback, more than 20% higher than last year, a total distribution yield above 20%. Looking beyond 2024, the second phase of UniCredit Unlocked entails the continuation of our vision, of our strategy, driving further achievements. We have transformed ourselves and as such are comfortable committing to continuing to do so to deliver significant value, quality and predictability over the long-term. We are uniquely positioned to continue outperforming, delivering sustainable, outstanding profitability and distribution in 2024 and beyond. We face the future with optimism. We have anticipated the main expected headwinds and taken steps to address them. Our profitability is underpinned by targeted, proactive action that will pay dividends. In the face of pressure on NII, we are maintaining our focus on quality, not volume. With our fee-to-revenue now aligned with top-tier peers and set to grow further. We have substantial P&L buffers and provision, a high-quality credit portfolio with low non-performing exposure coupled with overlays of €1.8 billion, €1.1 billion in integration costs trending to zero, and a reduction of over €200 million in systemic charges. The above supports us in an uncertain macro with changing rate dynamics, coupled with a best-in-class capital generation, they enable us to maintain our bottom-line profitability and outsize distribution without denting capital, which however remain well in excess of our target and shall be used going forward. Finally, we sit on a bolted balance sheet with strong asset quality, low and stable cost of risk, leading CT1 ratio and healthy liquidity ratio. When we look at our trajectory and performance over the last three years, peculiarities emerge regarding how the market perceives us. We are less dependent on interest rates than sometimes assumed. Our NII growth is aligned with our European peer group average. We benefited less versus Italian peer due to our geographic diversification and an approach based on profitability rather than volume. We are much more fee-driven than people perceive and are among the top-tier banks in terms of fee-to-revenues. We have a diversified fee base with future potential from recent investment, including an additional €1.4 billion in fees at run rate from our best-in-class product factories. It is worth noting that a significant portion of this fee growth is locked in. It is not dependent on market dynamics, rather a function of ongoing managerial actions linked to internalization of value chain in asset management, internalization of life insurance, renegotiation of main supplier contracts across value chain and action in payment and advisory and capital markets. These slides present the details of UniCredit fee growth consistent with the information shown in the Q3 results presentation. As such, I won't spend time discussing it now as I have already done so at Q3. Before I open for questions, I would leave you with five key takeaways. Firstly, we have delivered outstanding profitability, significantly up year-on-year, well above expectations. Secondly, our capital generation and distribution continue to be best-in-class. Thirdly, EPS, DPS and tangible book value per share growth are unparalleled, underpinned by continued progress across our three financial levers, coupled with substantial share buyback. Fourth, Phase 1 of UniCredit Unlocked is effectively completed one year in advance, beating all KPIs, resulting in a transformed bank. The foundations for Phase 2 are set and rooted in the same philosophy. And finally, we have a clear direction of travel. In 2024, we expect to normalize 2023 record profitability, improve the quality of our earnings, while delivering record calendar year distribution of circa €10 billion, and continue to grow EPS and DPS significantly. Thank you, and I'll now open for questions.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me, please. The first one on the outlook for capital distribution and the second one on your guidance for this year, perhaps with a focus on NII. So starting with the first one, if I think back when UniCredit first launched a buyback program about three years ago, that came with a signaling effect of sort of balance sheet strength, suggesting the cleanup and the restructuring journey had been completed. Today, nobody seems to give much attention to balance sheet strength, and it's all about sustainability of earnings. Now, you're lifting dividend payouts to 40% with a commitment to pay at least 90% of earnings before 81 in cash, which is a welcome change in the definition. What makes you comfortable that this can be sustained and why do you think this is the right mix of capital distribution? That's my first one. The second is to do with your four-year guidance, specifically on NII. I mean, you're guiding to be broadly in line to this year, also in 2024, so close to €8.6 billion. That consensus has some catching up to do. Slide 20, I think you provide quite a bit of qualitative color on the key drivers. Can we talk about this in more detail, please, and particularly on the outlook for NII in 2024, and if possible, your assumptions or your early thoughts about 2025? You're less sensitive than Italian crystal rates, so it would be great to understand the moving parts on NII from here. Thank you.",

    "text": "Okay, I'll take the first question, and Stefano will take the second one, and we'll integrate each other. So, on distributions, what we have done this year is two things. One, we have aligned to new EB8 guidelines that require everybody to express distribution as a percentage of net income. And we are saying that going forward, we commit to distribute an amount of net profit or net income which is equal or in excess of 90%. We have put, because we continue to believe that what drives our distribution is organic capital generation, not net profit. We continue to put a cap on the overall distributions at 100% of organic capital generation. So, it acts as a cap to, for the time being, keep us honest at that level. By definition, if we do that, we are recurrent, we are sustainable, because it means that year-after-year, what we distribute is what we can afford, and we do not use the excess capital on the ordinary to fund the distribution. That does not mean we will not distribute the excess capital. It just means that in the ordinary distribution we are talking about here, we're not including the excess capital. The second thing is we have had a relatively low payout ratio in terms of dividends in the past few years, at 35% of net profit post 81 in cashes. And we have done so, one, because we wanted to be absolutely certain that our transformation was bolted, and secondly, because we considered our shares to be such a good bargain for us to buy back. As we move forward, and as a number of investors have highlighted that they would like an improvement in our cash yield, we've done two things. One, we're now calculating the payout before 81 in cashes. That has a significant impact. And secondly, we are increasing our payout to 40%. That does not mean that we will not increase it further, but at the moment, that's the number. In addition to that, and that's the third point, as we are now at a significant level of distribution, we are smoothing the distribution by considering an interim distribution in October that will be equal to 40% of the distribution anticipated the following year. And therefore, as the year in which this happens, the total distribution in the calendar year will be circa, or depending on how we do, in excess of €10 billion, of which a significant portion in cash.",

    "text": "So, net interest income, let's start from 2024. So, key assumptions. Rates, assumption of average rates of 2024 equal to 2023. We are assuming an ECB rate cut between May and June. The starting point of the arrival is around 3.9. We're expecting that in Q4, the arrival will be below 3%. With regards, the net interest income sensitivity connected to rates, as highlighted by Andrea, is lower than the previous quarter, so every 25 basis points is €140 million. We are expecting a further reduction of the sensitivity during the course of 2024. One of the important elements to be considered is that we have increased the size of the replicating portfolio. So, we move from around a little bit more than €170 billion during Q4, 2022, to around €190 billion at the end of the year. So, this has increased the contribution to the margin of the replicating portfolio, but has also reduced the net interest income sensitivity. Second assumption is deposit pass-through, i.e., the ratio between the client rate and the average interbank rate. We closed around 25% for the full year of 2024. The average of Q4 was around 28%. We're assuming that the pass-through will go up during the course of the year, especially in the second half, when the rates will go down. The average that we're assuming is around 30%, so you can look at 23, average 25, 24, the average is 30%. As also highlighted by Andrea, the net interest income sensitivity deriving from deposit pass-through is around €130 million, coherent with the assumption that I told you in terms of rates. What about GDP? GDP that we're assuming in the footprint is below 1. That's a very important element to consider the expected growth of the lending. We're expecting still a lending stock reduction in Italy, also in Germany, differently from Central and Eastern Europe where we're expecting a growth. This is one of the elements that will change during the course of 2025, when the GDP growth that we're expecting is around 1.5, with also some positive implication on the lending growth. For 2024, the key drivers are the two that I mentioned. Average rate the same, deposit pass-through going up, replicating portfolio contribution €400 million, and as highlighted already in the speech by Andrea, a reduction of the contribution by Russia for around €300 million. We're not expecting meaningful impact deriving from the volumes and client spread trend. On top of GDP, improvement in 2025 is fair to be assumed that the average rate in 2025 will be lower clearly than the average of 2024. You have the sensitivity, but please do consider that, as I told you before, we are expecting that net interest income sensitivity can be lower at the end of 2024 in comparison to the beginning of the year.",

    "type": "answer",
    "text": "Okay, so I think we're very comfortable with the distribution that we have. So from day one, we insisted that what drives distribution is capital generation. Fundamentally, very simply, what capital do you have at the beginning of the year? What capital do you have at the end of the year? And if you have an excess and you distribute that, then you're sustainable, you're current. Of course, there is a period in which that capital generation is significantly in excess in the profitability, and then the net income. Then there is a phase where it converges to net income, and then at some point there will be a phase where it will be less than net income. UniCredit has been in the phase in the last three years where capital generation has been significantly in excess to net income. As a result, notwithstanding distributing €17.6 billion to our shareholders, we increase our excess capital very materially. So if you look at the trend and you look at our expectation going forward, we're saying in excess of 300 business points on a profitability of broadly in line, which is about 8.6. So there is a beginning of convergence of the organic capital generation to the net profit, which we think will remain above over the next three years, but we will see what happens. But we think it will remain above. So allowing us to peg very strongly on net profit, our distribution, and we said equal or above to 90% to be, let's say, realistic or conservative with respect to where we are moving. Then there is the question of where we will be at trend line. Well, if you go beyond three years, although I don't have a crystal ball, hopefully we will have even greater profitability. The organic capital generation will be close to net income but below, but because net income will be higher, we will be able to distribute similarly to what we distribute now. And I don't know exact landing because we need to look at that. When we look at the composition of what we're distributing, in the composition of what we're distributing, we've had shareholders that were very vocal on at this price by your shares. And we've had also shareholders would say, okay, but as you're trending towards stabilization or normalization, increase your payout because we want more dividend yield. So we are responding to those shareholders by slightly increasing our payout. But it is clear, and I have said in other calls, that we will continue to increase the payout at some point, and 35 or now 40% is not the end game. We cannot be a bank that prides itself on generating through profitability outsized distribution and remaining with an under-peer payout ratio. So over time, we will progressively increase that percentage. Now, I'll speak what is over time. It will be judged based on our share price evolution, are we stabilizing, are we normalizing, a lot of factors in there. But we're committed to increase it over time. Then you see the interim. Given the amount of distribution that we're doing, both in terms of dividend payout, but remember, we're still majority share buyback, we need to spread. Because otherwise, we create a situation where we're too concentrated on one part of a year and indeed in terms of dividend on one date, which is not the best thing in our opinion. Which is why we introduce the interim dividend by spreading the number over two parts of a year. Finally, I think that with respect to our view, with respect to where we're going, we absolutely are comfortable that this direction of travel and the way we're stating it is consistent with regulatory expectations. And going forward, the only question mark that remains, that as I said, I will clarify after the AGM, because it's a commitment for the following three years and I don't want to anticipate anything, is what we will do with the excess capital. If you ask me, now on an individual basis, that excess capital needs to be used. And it will be used either by complementing the distributions on an extraordinary basis, so we will have the ordinary number that we have just discussed, plus an underpin of excess capital return to our shareholders over a certain period of time. Or used in acquisition, if the terms and conditions, in particular pricing, leads us to be able to demonstrate to investors that as we focus on value, that acquisition fulfills that objective and benchmarks correctly with buying back our own shares. So far, we have not been able to do that, but I don't exclude that that is possible in the future.",

    "text": "Okay, let me take the first part and then Stefano will come after me. So, first of all, the philosophy question, what do we do with overlays or with the excess provision we have created vis-à-vis benchmark? Well, it's a question of where we see the cycle. So, the overlays and the excess provision are there to protect us against the cycle or if our expectation and the expectation of the industry on the cycle are less negative to then be released as we should and therefore propel further our results. So, we have capacity in there. When are we going to do that? Well, if you tell me when the back end of a cycle arrives in terms of risk, I will tell you when I will release them. At the moment, our anticipation, which may be right or wrong, is that we are going to see an increase in cost of risk gradually more visible in the second part of the year and in particular starting Q4, getting into 2025. Why? Just because you will have had the time on the rate increase, on all the challenges, the geopolitics to go through our clients and potentially you're going to see some increase in cost of risk. We are more optimistic than I think some are, but we are prepared for the worst. So, assuming that in Q4 we see an increase and then it will continue in 2025, we have this 1.8 billion plus excess provision we have on a specific basis to make sure we deliver on the commitment we took to keep our cost of risk between 20 and 25. If the cycle is not like that, two things can happen. One, you see nothing at the end of 2024 and 2025, I doubt it, or you see much less. In any case, we are going to be obliged to release these overlays. Those overlays are there for specific reasons. They are not there to stay there. And therefore, in that case, our results and our cost of risk will trend significantly below the 20 to 25 as we release. So, that's in general how we look at it. In general, on life insurance, and then I'll pass it on to Stefano, and on asset management, the strategy is still the same? On insurance, we were clear on two things. One, we would rationalize our partners and heavily tilt towards alliance. We've done exactly that. Secondly, we would internalize life insurance, which for us is unit linked primarily, if and when the Danish compromise was confirmed. It was. So, sometimes in 2025, we will internalize the life insurance unit linked as per contract by buying the insurance company that we share with one of our partners and concentrating there most of our unit linked and life insurance. That will have an impact on our rate income that Stefano can take you through. Nothing has changed. The only thing that is changing more and more positively is that our progress on non-life insurance, in particularly ex-CPI, and in particularly in Italy, has been very, very positive. And we have converted quickly, and as you see, the volumes are going up very quickly, and we have a market share of new business in the mid-teens, which is quite good for us. And on asset management, I think it's not a restructuring. As for many other things, it's a progressive improvement. It's an improvement that we started by improving the way we set our asset allocation, that we provide strategies that are consistent to that for our clients, that we improve the design, the selections, and use our bargaining power to buy products at a better price. And that allows us – we used to have a rough cut of making €1 on the value chain. We used to maintain low 60% of the value chain in-house. We've moved that over the last three years to low 70%, and we think we can get to low 80% in-house by doing what we have just said. When I tell you that one market is getting rolled out in all of these countries, this is part of our grabbing the value chain to a greater extent for UniCredit. And this is a gradual movement that will continue to occur, and that has nothing to do with the market. If the market then bounces because of rates, that's on top. But this is what we're doing on our own value chain.",

    "text": "So, in relation to numbers, insurance. So, the insurance base for -- revenue base for this year, let's say, is around €900 million. The expected growth in terms of a run rate that we are aiming at is around €400 million. The growth is arriving from on one end, re-insourcing a part of the chain, but also to increase the revenues that are coming from the long life, both in relation to CPI and in relation to property and casualties. So, the expectation is to have a double-digit growth in relation to both in the next three years. In relation to payments, the base is clearly higher, so it's around a couple of billion. The growth that we are expecting is around €300 million. In relation, let's say, the two categories where we are also expecting a CAGR that is around 10% are cards and acquiring. With regards to overlays, we have slightly increased the overlays at year-end. We have slightly changed the composition of the overlays. Overall amount is 1.8. We need to use or to release in the next couple of years. What we cannot anticipate now is, let's say, how and when, if we look 2024, 2025, but in this couple of years, we don't believe there is another option, rather than releasing or utilizing if the overall evolution of the credit portfolio is worse than what we are currently expecting. With regards to the deposit cost, at the end of 2024, I would differentiate between the different countries, because we have a different composition of site and term deposit depending on each country. So, the average of the group is 75% site, but if you look, for example, to Italy, we are at 95% site. In general, we are expecting that if the rate dynamic is in line with our assumption, we will have a progressive reduction of the cost in the country where we have term deposits. While, for example, in countries where we have mainly site deposit, I believe this is unlikely. So, in relation to Italy, we believe that this is unlikely. We are not expecting a meaningful increase of the cost of the deposit, but a reduction is not very likely.",

The €200 million difference is partially rounding, partially spread all over, but mostly driven by payments. As we said, we will give you an update on that at the end of Q1, but the payment side of the equation will be approached in exactly the same way, block by block of the value chain, as we have approached asset management and insurance, and we are going to go to payment and do the same thing. As we do that, we should have, one, the benefit from higher focus than the market, but also the mechanical impact of potentially internalizing more, streamlining more, or doing other things in this direction.",

    "text": "On cost, a few things just not to induce you in error. The first thing is, with the exception of Central and Eastern Europe, but in particular Eastern Europe, but Central and Eastern Europe, most of the effect of inflation are backdated or at the tail. So, the impact of inflation for the Italian contract renegotiation is in 2024, is not in 2023. And many other contracts go in the same direction. So, the integration costs that we're taking are going to compensate the real effect in inflation that we anticipate in 2024 and 2025, not in 2023. What happened in 2023 was taken care of by the integration costs and what we did in 2021 and 2022, and so on and so forth. So, there is some lag. So, while, yes, we took 1.1 billion in integration costs, it's also true that most of the inflation impact on the Western European, let's say, employee base is in 2024 and 2025, not in 2022 and 2023. Okay? So, that's point number one. Point number two, costs are not only people. Costs are also non-people, and we still are at run rate on what we invest in technology, on what we invest in the build-up of our factories, on distribution channel integration, on hiring at the front end, as we shift people from the center to commercial activities and we streamline. So, while the, let's call it HR cost is declining, the non-HR cost is increasing, and it should, because we are investing in digital as we go forward. So, if you look at all of that and you pull it all together, I think this organization has delivered very good performance on cost by trending down every year between 21, 22, and 23, in spite of maintaining investment. And just to remind you, as we said that we were trending down a few percentage point, but that number becomes 13% if you eliminate the investment in technology, in new people, in the factories, etcetera, etcetera. These investments are continuing. We're not relenting from that. So, I think that if this organization is able to take the cost in 2024 slightly lower than 2023, and as I said in another call in Q3, our ambition is to match or slightly overcome what we had in UniCredit Unlocked without all of this inflation when we started, and keep it there for, let's say, a couple of years. While we continue to invest in technology, in our front end, in refurbishing of our network, in new channels, in hiring, etcetera, etcetera, I think that's a good outcome, and I think you should bank that, not more. I think the only thing, and then I'll pass it to Stefano. Look, I think at the moment, as you see, our real underlying return on equity, so our ROAC, is you can call it 20.5 or more if you take away the integration cost. But when we look at the deployment of our capital, we're not deploying our capital at 20% and above. We're deploying our capital, or the bar that we put, is at our cost of equity. Our cost of equity is 11% to 12%, the real one. So, if we have an 11% to 12% assumed return from the deployment of our capital, we do it, and if we do not, we do not. And I think that that discipline pays dividend in the long-term because that's what drives long-term profitability and distribution. Otherwise, it could drive volume, show you a nice dynamic on NII, probably a nice dynamic on net profit, a much less positive dynamic on profitability and on distributions. So, we will continue in that direction. Obviously, when we look at clients, we look at clients. We don't look at lending. We look at the entire relationship. So, if you're a client sitting in our legacy portfolio and you've been there for years, and your returns are below our cost of equity, and we give you one last chance to align, if a client is not aligning, that's structural. And I think it is correct for us to gradually, orderly, de-emphasize that relationship. If instead, it's a new relationship, or it's a client that is aligning to our cost of equity or exceeding it, we will invest in the client and we will do it. But again, not a 20% return at 11. But I'll pass it to Stefano for more details.",

    "text": "Okay. So, I will take it first on cost. So, HR cost. Let's look to the key variables. So, the average FTEs, if we look at 2023, in comparison to the beginning of the year, are down for more than 5%. So, and just a couple of percentage points, if you look at Q4. The expectation is that we will have a further reduction, but at a slower pace. Solid drift is [Indiscernible]. The full impact of the Austrian contract was already there in 2023, fundamentally, but not the Italian one. And so, as a consequence of that, the solid drift increase in 2024 will be higher than 2023. With regards to non-HR cost, we will see an increased level of IT cost, on one end. But on the other end, in comparison to 2023, we are expecting a reduction in the real estate cost. That will include action on the footprint, but also the energy-related cost that we are expecting to be lower in 2024, in comparison to 2023. On volumes, fundamentally, there are three components. Rates and GDP. Rates are high, and as a consequence of that, there is an impact on the demand. So, this will be there also during the course of at least the first half of this year. Then there is the GDP. I told you before, there is a differentiation. So, GDP of Italy and Germany, expectation is lower than 1. But then, if you look, Central Europe, it will be above 1. And Eastern Europe, it will be above 2. So, this is why also the expectation in terms of lending trend is differentiated by country. The third topic, as already highlighted by Andrea, is the pricing. We do see pricing competition in many geographies, also by cooperative banks and so on. Considering that we go for profitable and quality growth, there is also part of the expectation that is depending from our strategy. This is especially on the corporate side. So, this is impacting a portion of, let's say, the lending, especially on the corporate side. With regards to inflation, the inflation expectation for 2024, maybe that is an important driver. Because on our footprint, the inflation in 2023 was around 7%. In 2024, we are expecting to have 3%. This is not automatically translating in cost drift. The salary drift is impacted by what we will negotiate. Just to remind that the renegotiation for German contract is expected in the second part of 2024. So, not before this moment.",

    "text": "Hello, good morning. Thank you very much. I want to ask you about your push for fees. Life insurance has suffered in Italy from a shift in the savings flows into BTP. What does this imply for your expectations on life growth now that you are planning on internalizing? Do you think this is a trend that will reverse soon? Maybe now with potential rate cuts? Then, within the asset management fees, you are mostly a distributor of collective investment products. You say you want to optimize the value you retain from your distribution agreements. But, for example, your agreement with Amundi is still in force, I think, until 2027. So, should we expect a big part of this value retention strategy to materialize with some sort of delay? And if I may, as a follow-up. So, the guidance for the 90% payout on flat net profit next year implies that distribution will be at least €7.7 billion against 2024 earnings. When you talk about the sustainability of this payout, would you also expect a sustainability of this sort of absolute amount? In the case the distribution cap of organic capital generation falls below net profit before the three years that you were mentioning, are you willing to use excess capital to top it up? Thank you.",

    "text": "Okay, let me start with a second one because it's more straightforward. The answer is yes and yes. So, fundamentally, we have done a lot of work on what we can do in the next three years. We feel that the current levels of profitability are sustainable, plus minus, obviously, plus minus. With those levels of profitability and those levels of net income, and most importantly, organic capital generation at the levels that we are anticipating, let's say at least €7.7 billion is sustainable as an ordinary level of distribution. Like any other organization, if our profitability starts dropping or organic capital generation starts dropping, it will go down. But that happens to anyone. If you ask me where I see going in the next three years, I think €7.7 billion is sustainable. As a minimum. Now, in addition to that, you said what about excess capital? It is clear that when you look at your distribution, you should be looking at two things. One is the profitability sustainable. I think with the lines of defense and the investments we have, it is. Secondly, what happens if you miss? Everybody can miss. Well, we have a ton of excess capital, and at that point, we would chip in. And if we chip in, obviously, we can sustain it. Consider one thing, that if we were to deploy some of that excess capital acquiring something, the share count will be non-changing because we are using excess capital. We are not issuing new shares, but the net income would go up because we are buying net income effectively. So, it is another way of creating more generation of our distribution going forward. That is how we are looking at it. The second thing is, and I will let Stefano add. So, with respect to life insurance or unit linked, yes, they suffered because of flows into BTPs. But at the same time, like the rest of asset management, they should come back. They should come back when rates normalize and things normalize. In general, given the levels at which we can buy back our joint ventures, we are comfortable that they add value even at the current level of flows. With respect to Amundi, Amundi does not provide all of our asset management. We have a substantial portion, 20%, 30%, depending, that is in inverted commas “free”. Most of the value that we are creating on the value chain is focusing on that 20% 30% today. Beyond, we will see. We will see about our agreement with Amundi, etcetera. But I don't think it is an all or nothing between now and 2027. It is a progressive, with 2027 obviously being an important year as one of our key agreements is up for renegotiation.",

I think before you were guiding to NII to decline moderately, you don't specify moderately and there is no precise guidance now. I am just kind of wondering, looking at your comments on the replicating portfolio or Russia, it seems that actually NII could still be resilient. I just wanted to have a bit more comment on that. Also, if you could just clarify on your rate sensitivity, the €150 million for 25 years, what is the assumption you are making on deposit beta? Then my second question is more broadly on excess capital and M&A because now you are doing more than €6 billion of buyback per annum. I am just wondering, is the excess capital still based on a 13% CT1 level? How much capacity is there really for exceptional buybacks? Or do you feel like there is more pressure now to go the M&A route? Thank you.",

In relation to the ingredients, coming back to the ingredients, fundamentally, on one hand there is Russia, which is very important because the more we are reducing the exposure and we are scaling down Russia, the more we have an impact on net interest income, is €300 million. This is one very important component. The second element is the deposit pass-through that we already commented before. Then I will arrive then to the sensitivity. The third one is the replicating portfolio. The replicating portfolio is there, is impacting. The contribution to the net interest income in 2024 has allowed around €400 million more compared to 2023. It has also reduced the net interest income sensitivity because increasing the stock of the replicating portfolio over time has also reduced our net interest income sensitivity. The sensitivity to rates moved from 150 to 140 and is coherent with the deposit beta that we have allotted. The deposit beta is in Q4 around 28% while the average for the year in terms of expectation is around 30%.",

Secondly, obviously, there is an impact from Balfour in 2025. That impact for us is about 80, 85 basis points which will reduce that excess at least nominally if we remain at 12.5%, 13% target. You can calculate what it is after that. Now, is there more pressure on M&A? I would put it differently. There is less pressure on M&A given the results that we can continue to deliver internally but potentially there will be more opportunity if the divergence between results of winners and losers in the industry becomes more marked.",

    "text": "I'm just -- okay. So, RWA optimization, I will pass to Stefano on the numbers. But I think as we told you at the beginning, at the moment we're generating capital through two levers. Profitability, so net profit minus the cost of the business. Minus the capital we use to generate it. That capital, as we become more and more efficient on our revenue per RWA, decreases per unit of profit we generate. Obviously, the more fees and the more. And we go back to the question before. We deploy capital above our cost of equity. The more capital we generate per unit of net profit. And the second part, which is more transitory. The, let's say, rendering efficient, managing the legacy portfolio. So, what we have, the 430 billion of portfolio that we have bringing it as much as possible above the cost of equity. That will always be there. But obviously, not even close to the amount that we have done in these three years. Gradually, it's coming off. So, we cannot generate 400 business points of capital on 12 billion of capital on 8.6 billion of net profit forever. I wish it was like that, but it's not. So, gradually, it's coming off. And so, I do think that in 2024, it's going to still be. So, the contribution from that brings us above net profit in 2024, in terms of organic capital generation. We feel that that will happen also in 2025. And potentially in 2026, but we need to see. We will become, and are becoming more and more over time, in inverted commas, “net profit” dependent. But, as we increase that net profit, and we increase the efficiency of our capital deployment with more fees, and more deployed above the cost of equity, the amount of distribution that we can distribute from that net profit continues to rise. And so, we hope that at the end, you almost won't see a change, because our net profit will be higher, and the percentage of net profit we distribute in distribution will be almost a continuation of where we would have landed you in the years prior to that. But, it's a gradual course. If you wish, if we were to apply the same methodology to our targets or to our acquisition, or whatever, we then replenish what we're trying to do. But, for the time being, there is a finite life, and beyond that, Hugo, it's difficult. I would love. So, with respect to the question, I would say, it's up to shareholder and more broadly stakeholders.

This organization was highly centralized, and the level of center, non-business cost, administration, bureaucracy, call it whichever way you want to call it, was far exceeding what I think was the levels of average peers, and I still believe organization needs to go further. So, what we have done is embark in efficiencies that are very targeted. This is not a socialized efficiency. This is efficiency that attacks the area one by one, whereby redesigning processes. Take one that I used the first day I came here. We used to have in one of our countries 23 people to sign off on a mortgage. If we go to an end-to-end process, we don't need 23 people to sign off on a mortgage. So, when we talk about organization streamlining, delaying, process redesign, change of way of working, what we're talking about is going into the mechanics or the industrial of every process, the way we do business, the way we sign off business, etcetera, rethinking it, redesigning it, making it more efficient, improving the speed, and reducing the cost of doing it. That part does not touch the front, does not touch the factories, does not touch digital. Actually, it does touch digital in one way, and I will explain to you how. That part effectively not only reduces cost and increases speed, but also releases a lot of energy because the people who are doing anything, something, i.e., in commercial, have a lot less weight to carry on their shoulders and can take decision and can move much quicker. So, that's where we have targeted. So, if I take your list, head office, absolutely, IT, I would say, not the IT you think. We used to have more than 50% of our IT organization that had non-engineering software developer coding roles. In best-in-class organization, that number is below 20%. So, we have taken away that, so the layers, or are taking away that, and are reinvesting in the one that matters to transform our organization, which is software engineers, etcetera, etcetera. That applies to the entire organization. So, we're taking away and shrinking the bureaucracy to what is needed, and invest in hiring or technology or any other thing that we need to make our business more efficient. So, it's a targeted cost reduction to finance the rest. As you can imagine, at some point, we reach the end. We're not at the end yet, but that's where we're going.",

Our Q1 ’24 results are the embodiment of the continued hard work by those at UniCredit and our commitment to continuously pursue excellence. They underscore again, that UniCredit Unlocked is the right strategy as we build on our momentum, adapting and navigating the changing external environment to the benefit of all our stakeholders. We remain an attractive investment opportunity as our past performance and future prospects are still not reflected in our valuation. Both our price to earnings and price to distribution multiples remain at a substantial discount to both sector and top peers. Our commitment to excellence has resulted in our best first quarter ever and our 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year profitable growth, setting new benchmarks in performance across all regions, product lines and metrics. This success is underpinned by resilient, profitable net NII, robust fee generation and improved operational and capital excellence with every region and business contributing to making a better whole. We have spent the last three years securing a position of industry leadership as we continue to outperform expectations and peers while building strong foundations of investments, capital, asset quality and liquidity to support our future. During the next three years, we remain committed to completing our UniCredit Unlocked transformation, further growing our results while delivering outsized returns. We will increase our focus on clients to counteract macro headwinds and further improve earnings quality. We will propel our top line by further expanding our fee base, crystallizing the investments and the work of the past three years while defending our unique high-quality net interest income net of loan loss provision that already exceed our cost of equity. All while striving to maintain our leadership in operational and capital efficiency. Finally, we will benefit from the gradual release of our extensive profit and loss buffers. We are confident in our ability to deliver our mid-term guidance of strong growth in EPS, DPS and tangible book value per share, return on tangible equity above 15% and overall distribution above 2023, thanks to our expected organic capital generation and excess capital return. For UniCredit, excellence means consistently delivering superior results, exceeding our strategic objectives and leading the industry across all KPIs. The mindset, this mindset, is our competitive advantage. Our growth is profitable, constantly outperforming expectation while investing and creating lines of defense for our future to ensure sustainability. Our outstanding performance is across all our three financial levers. Net revenues reached €6.3 billion, up 7.5% year-on-year; NII was up 9% with LLPs flat and low; fees up 3%, or 8% excluding current account fees, reduction in Italy and securitization costs. We have continued to improve our operational efficiency, reducing absolute cost by 1% to €2.3 billion while absorbing inflation and propelling investments. Our cost-to-income ratio improved further to 36.2%, three percentage point better than a year ago. Similarly, we have continued to improve our capital efficiency with net revenue to RWAs reaching 8.9%, up from 7.7% a year ago, with RWA's down €5 billion to €280 billion. All contributed to deliver a record return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 of 23%, up 2.6 percentage point year-on-year; a net profit of €2.6 billion, up 24% year-on-year; and an organic capital generation of €3.4 billion or 118 basis points, which allowed us to accrue €2.6 billion or 100% of our net profit in Q1 for distribution whilst increasing our CET1 ratio by 35 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 16.2%. These translate into an EPS up 42% year-on-year; a DPS up 64% year-on-year; and a tangible book value per share up 25% year-on-year. These results are built on strong foundation across leading capital levels, sound asset quality and strong liquidity ratio with LCR above 140% and NSFR above 125%. All regions and all product factories contributed to these results. Our net revenue is broken down into three categories, Net Interest Income net of LLPs, Fees and Trading & Others. Our focus on quality growth has resulted in structurally low loan loss provision and a net NII that continues to exceed our cost of equity. We believe to be only one of two banks who have achieved this. Our Fees have experienced strong and broad based growth leading to a top tier fee-to-revenue ratio, reflecting our investment in product factories over the last three years. Our Trading & Other revenue has been primarily driven by core client activity which has supported its resiliency. We recognize that NII net of provision plays an important role in our top line. We have successfully focused on keeping it above our cost of equity while laying the foundation for its profitable future growth. Gross NII and margins are slightly down quarter-on-quarter as rates have peaked and volumes have not recovered. This appears to be a better dynamic though than peers particularly given our focus on profitability rather than volume. Adjusting for the effects, NII was flat quarter-over-quarter. We successfully managed pass through to increase only two percentage point to 30% driven mainly by Germany and Central Europe. Deposit volume stabilized Q-on-Q with growth in Germany and Central Europe and Eastern Europe while Italy reflected some rotation to BTPs. As our approach of prioritizing profitable client segments grows over volumes, moderates overall NII growth, our risk adjusted NII net of LLP remained above our cost of equity and is up 5% quarter-over-quarter. This focus on quality growth will continue to sustain superior profitability, organic capital generation and ultimately distributions. Our cost of risk which is structurally lower thanks to disciplined underwriting, improved asset quality and coverage, has contributed to the increase of our net revenues and the decrease of their volatility. This is a differentiated advantage which we intend to defend. Our stated cost of risk remained very low at 10 basis points mainly due to the continued writebacks primarily from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia. We are reiterating our guidance for stated cost of risk below 20 basis points for 2024. Our default rate increased from circa 1% for the full 2023 to 1.3% is exclusively driven by two single names, one of which is mostly State guaranteed. The underlying default rate is at 0.9% down year-on-year. We have taken an average of €100 million of writebacks from back to bonis per quarter since Q1 2022 and this quarter is no exception. The circa €14 billion reduction in Stage 2 performing loans this quarter is largely due to good performance of underlying portfolio. We still have circa €1.8 billion of overlays to protect our performing portfolio, highest among peers. We have a better quality of NPE with above 70% of unlikely to pay and past due to total NPE. These demonstrate our strong asset quality combined with a conservative classification and provisioning policy. To report our fees more simply, we have changed their classification as detailed in the annex. Our fee base which accounts for 34% of total revenues today, 41% in Italy, grew 8% year-over-year ex-current account fee reduction in Italy and securitization cost. Investments were up 18%, Insurance 5%, driven by Non-Life up 12% and Payment up 11%. We are particularly pleased with the diversified and balanced nature of our fee streams. The positive momentum across all fee categories reflect our strategic investments in our product factories and renewed client appetite. We see continued potential for differentiated growth as we internalize and focus on capturing more share across each product value chain. A significant portion of this fee growth is locked-in and not dependent on market dynamics, rather managerial actions. We therefore aim to achieve €1.4 billion higher run rating fees in 2026 versus 2023. Cost management remains disciplined, supporting investment in our business and people, absorbing inflation and driving overall costs down while increasing our top line. We are continuing to streamline our organization, automating processes and reducing bureaucracy. We maintain a continued focus on hirings, training and remuneration as a direct route to enhancing our product factories and digital capability. As a result, our overall costs are down €170 million quarter-on-quarter and €16 million year-on-year, offsetting 3.4% inflation in our footprint this quarter by proactively acting to manage salary drift. Our cost/income ratio reached a leading 36.2% in Q1, down 3 percentage points year-over-year and 5.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. Q1 was one of our strongest quarter yet in organic capital generation, 118 basis points or €3.4 billion in the quarter. This allowed us to accrue our full net income of €2.6 billion for distribution while further increasing our leading CET1 ratio by 35 basis points to 16.2% and retaining a best-in-class MDA buffer of almost 600 basis points. Our disciplined focus on quality net income growth complemented by an obsessive focus on operational and capital efficiency is key to maximizing profitability and organic capital generation, enabling outsized ordinary distribution whilst strengthening capital. This model is a competitive advantage for UniCredit. As I now take you through our regions and product factories, please note the differentiated strengths and value add that each one of our regions brings to the overall group as well as the value that the group brings to each one of them, making UniCredit better than the sum of its part. Let's move to Italy. Italy has again delivered outstanding result with its ROAC reaching 31% and profit before tax €1.6 billion, up 18%. Italy continues to drive the increase in our group's fees and insurance income and profitability of NII net of LLPs. Our consistent improvement in client focus and delivery across our three financial levers, have brought us closer to our ambition of becoming the bank of choice in Italy. Net revenue grew 7% year-on-year to €2.8 billion. NII was up 13% on rates and strong pass-through management. Cost of risk increased to 33 basis points driven by the full write-off of a single name credit which is largely State guaranteed. As such, net NII was up 14%. Fees were up 11% when excluding the current account fee reduction and securitization cost, 3% otherwise. They reached 41% of overall revenues including insurance results. The continuous search for operational and capital excellence drove cost to income ratio down to below 34% and net revenue to RWA up to 10.4% with RWAs decreasing 9% or €211 billion. Our people, clients and communities remain central to how we operate. It is testament to the support that we provide our people that we have been named top employer in Europe for the eighth year in a row. We launched Buddy, a full-service fully digital branch fully integrated in our distribution channels to provide our client with a choice of how, when and where they access us. We unveiled our Third Edition of UniCredit for Italy totaling €10 billion of additional credit. Germany, with its AAA rating and leading European player status, Germany has again delivered a strong result with ROAC exceeding 23%, up 4 percentage point year-over-year and profit before tax €800 million, up 24% year-on-year supported by a standout 7% reduction in their absolute cost base. Net revenue were €1.4 billion, only 4% below our stronger ever quarter in Q1 ’23. Strong growth in high quality NII, investment and payment fees were unable to offset last year extremely high client demand for hedging and low cost of risk. NII was down 9%, however it is slightly positive, net of higher funding cost on market positioning which are counterbalanced in trading result. Cost of risk increased to 21 basis points driven by a single name. Investment fees were up 5%, payment fees 10%, fees overall down 3% due to the exceptional high base of hedging fees in Q1 2023. The continued search for operation and capital excellence drove Germany cost/income ratio down to 38.5% and net revenue to RWA up to 8.1% with RWAs decreasing €9 billion. Our sustained commitment to supporting entrepreneurship and inclusivity has seen us reaching circa 1700 beneficiaries in underserved areas with training and workshop during the first quarter. Central Europe. Central Europe continues to deliver on our ambition to become the leader in the region both in terms of franchise and performance. ROAC reached 22%, profit before tax rose 43% to €600 million. Net revenue grew 12% year-on-year to €1.1 billion as our approach to quality growth paid off. NII was up 11% on a strong rates environment, cost of risk remained negative reaching minus 20 basis points driven by continued writebacks. Net NII was up 15%. Fees were up 10% driven by investment products. Our cost increased only 1% despite high inflation leading to an improvement of our cost to income ratio to below 37%. Net revenue to RWAs improved to 7.4% with RWAs decreasing €600 million. Our innovation in the region continues with Hungary launching onemarkets adding to successful launches in Austria, Czech Republic and Slovenia. We launched end-to-end investment via mobile in Czech Republic and Slovakia and we have issued a €750 million Green Mortgage Covered Bond in Austria. Eastern Europe continues to increase its number of primary clients driving top-line growth while maintaining sustained operational and capital efficiency. ROAC reached 39%, profit before taxes was up 29%, lending at €500 million. Net revenue grew 16% year-over-year to €700 million. Our approach to quality growth resulted in a 23% increase in NII driven by strong commercial dynamics and a favorable rate environment. Cost of risk remained negative at minus 27 basis points. Net NII was up 18%. Fees were up 13%, thanks to our focus on payments, financing and advisory. Our cost growth of 4.8% in the region was half the average inflation level contributing to a decrease in our cost to income ratio to circa 30%. Net revenue to RWAs reached 10% with RWAs increasing 10% however half our gross revenues. This quarter, we were the joint lead manager on the €1.5 billion Zero Bond offering by Republic of Croatia and the first in the Bulgarian and Bosnia and Herzegovina markets to sign a Green Renewable Energy source. We continued the rollout of our onemarket funds with 16 funds in Bulgaria and launches in Romania. Our partnership with Alpha Bank in Romania and Greece is off to a strong start. Client Solution has delivered excellent results with gross revenues up 6% to €2.9 billion of which 65% were fees, up 8%, thanks to our focus on superior quality products for our banks while contributing to capital light growth. Our Corporate Solution revenue increased 4% to €1.4 billion whilst RWAs declined 12%. Within this Advisory & Financing generated strong fees particularly in DCM and M&A, up 23% year-over-year. Payment Solution revenue increased 1% to €600 million driven by payments, up 14% which were able to offset lower current account fees to our clients in Italy. Individual Solution revenues increased 14% to €900 million driven by investments up 18% to €600 million, thanks to demand for in-house products such as onemarkets, bonds and certificate leveraging on interest rate stabilization and product innovation. Insurance was up 5% to €300 million driven by Property and Casualty up 12% and a recovery in Life Insurance up 2% from a week 2023. As promised, we are going to now go through briefly a couple of deep dives, firstly, Corporate Solution. Our ambition for Corporate Solution is to become the go-to bank for small and mid-corporate clients in our core market. We're well on our way to achieving this. This business delivered €4.9 billion of revenues in 2023 of which 37% or €1.8 billion were fees but we expect to increase by €300 million by 2026. In Advisory & Financing which contributed €2 billion in 2023, we have grown our talent base and built an advisory and capital markets -- capital-light value-adding business to both balance and benefit from our financing. This is working well with fees reaching 25% of total revenues. We expect them to increase their weight to circa one-third by 2026. Our Trade & Correspondent Banking business which contributed €1.1 billion in 2023, is a leader in Europe where we secure twice the cross-border market share that we have in any domestic market as we accompany our clients end-to-end. We continue to invest in improving our client experience, digitalization and overall quality of the service with fees representing more than half of our revenues. Our Client Risk Management Solution which delivered €1.8 billion in 2023 are designed for SME clients to whom we provide targeted offering on rates, commodities and effects. We remain focused on improving our client's connectivity and client-driven business. Fees account for 42% of total revenues. We shall reduce RWA usage and cost further through to our trading engine centralization project. Let's move to Payment Solutions. Payment Solution is a core area of investment and growth for the Group. It offers transactional payment, issuing and acquiring and current account to our 15 million clients across our 13 banks in Europe with the ambition to be every European client's first bank of choice for payment. We are well advanced in consolidating Payment Solutions into a centre of excellence, creating a united factory alongside Individual and Corporate Solutions that can provide best-in-class products and growth to our 13 banks. The business delivered €2.5 billion of revenue in 2023 of which circa 90% were fees that we expect to increase by €300 million by 2026. We are ideally positioned to be a gateway to innovation, leveraging partnership, global platform and group data intelligence. Our strong payments DNA and flexible technology make us a standout in the market. We are the number one EU bank for transactional payment with a cross-border payment market share of over three times that of intra-country payments. The business delivered €1.3 billion of revenue in 2023 of which 82% were fees which we expect to grow at a 4% CAGR out to 2026. Our inherent success factors include advanced international payments, sophisticated cash management and treasury-related solutioning FX, rates and commodities and our ability to leverage our unique pan-European network. We have three key strategic priorities here further boosting our leading position in the pan-European payment space by expanding our capabilities in mature markets to other CE and EE countries. Second, maintaining our domestic leadership in each market by extending and enhancing our product offering. Third, evolving towards a truly client-centric approach to counter emerging threats and increase our share in the business. In both Issuing and Acquiring we are in the top three leading positions in six European markets including Italy. We intend to further strengthen our position in all our 13 markets expanding our capabilities and exploiting digital payments especially in CE and EE. The business delivered business delivered €500 million of revenues in 2023 of which 91% were fees which we expect to grow at a CAGR of 8% out to 2026. In Issuing we are positioned to win in the market with 13 banks having issuing licenses performing over 5.5 million pure POS or cashless transactions per day in 2023. We have a direct issuing license model in all markets and we've insight from extensive card transaction data through a highly diversified product offering including consumer and commercial cards across prepaid debit and credit card products. In Acquiring we operate across 10 countries with a principal license model performing 5.75 million POS transaction per day in 2023. In-house acquiring is a cornerstone of our strategy which gives us a competitive edge. To further enhance our offering, we're also revamping this business proposition and product offering becoming a merchant acquiring bank with fully integrated Acquiring Solutions. Overall, we have the potential to be the standout player in the payment industry and are committed to meeting that ambition and providing excellent services to our clients. UniCredit Unlocked has already fundamentally transformed our bank laying the foundation for sustainable and profitable future. This has led to UniCredit delivering 13 consecutive quarters of profitable growth taking us to the top of the industry in terms of EPS, DPS and tangible book value per share growth, return on tangible equity, organic capital generation, distribution, operational and capital efficiency and CET1. All while continuing to invest to propel our future results and continuing to accumulate significant buffers to further protect our delivering and our distribution in the future. These include €1.5 billion non-operating items, €1.8 billion in overlays and more than €6.5 billion of excess capital going forward. We are far from being finished. We're determined to achieve our long-term ambition of excellence and have the levers to do so. We have made substantial progress in making UniCredit more efficient and effective. We shall now accelerate our journey towards a truly client-centric organization serving them as efficiently and effectively as possible. Our strategy has a dual focus. The first pillar is our operating machine. We're continuously simplifying our organization, streamlining our processes and operations and upgrading our technology. This supports our second pillar, our commercial machine. Firstly, this means continuing to empower, motivate, train and focus our people on understanding and addressing client needs. Secondly, it is developing and fully integrating alternative distribution channels to ensure that clients can access that when, how and where they want. And finally, it is about ensuring the seamless delivery of top-tier products provided through our factories and best-in-class partners via our integrated distribution channel. Going forward, we focus on continuing to expand our fee base, defending and further enhancing the profitability of our NII net of provision and the stability of our trading operations. This ensures a well-rounded and resilient top-line. Our capital accretive, NII net of LLPs, exceeds the cost of equity in its own right with low volatility. We believe to be one of the only two banks in Europe in our peer group that have delivered this much. Our quality backbook and higher strategic flexibility on volumes, along with our strong replicating portfolio, shall partly offset rates headwind and the continued compression of Russia. Our fees have substantially grown in importance and now provide a strong starting base, stable and diversified. We now have an improved mix compared to our peers, with fees at 34% of revenues and strong lever with which to grow our fees by a further €1.4 billion out to 2026, thanks to past investment and clear action to further unlock our in-house product factories. By integrating these diverse revenue streams, we are creating a high-quality top-line unmatched amongst peers and one of the critical factors to superior sustainable return on tangible equity, organic capital generation and growth. Our ability to maintain industry-leading operational and capital excellence is critical to delivering on our profitability and organic capital generation ambition and ultimately distributions. We currently rank first in cost to income ratio, cost of risk and capital efficiency. Our absolute cost base has been consistently reduced despite inflationary pressures while investing for the benefit of the business in line with UniCredit Unlocked. We have taken significant integration costs, preparing the ground for continued future cost reduction, leveraging ongoing simplification efforts. A decade of de-risking, vigilant origination and continued conservative provisioning have resulted in a structurally lower and much less volatile cost of risk, which we trust we will be able to maintain below 20 basis points this year and within the 20 basis points to 25 basis points over the cycle, leveraging the release of our €1.8 billion of overlays. We have improved our capital efficiency since UniCredit Unlocked, delivering now best-in-class organic capital generation to support sustainable and significant distribution without denting CET1. Our discipline is now embedded and we expect it to continue unabated. Our unique BNL buffer substantially derisk our ability to deliver our bottom line and combined with the usage of or return of our excess capital shall support greater total distributions. We are upgrading our net profit guidance to in excess of €8.5 billion versus our previous guidance of broadly in line and you all know what my personal ambition is. This is driven by a strong Q1 which puts us ahead of our run rate for the year and a better outcome on systemic charges which we now expect to be around €400 million lower than ’23 or circa €200 million better than we had anticipated. Given our healthier profitability and most importantly, organic capital generation and excess capital return commitment, we are upgrading our expected 2024 total distribution to circa €8.6 billion in line with 2023. This continues to represent the highest total distribution yield in the industry. Accordingly we are accruing 100% of net profit in the first quarter. Our dividend payout remains at 40% of net profit or circa €3.4 billion. Our 2024 calendar distribution could now exceed €10 billion. We aim to commence the first tranche of a remainder of a 2023 share buyback as soon as possible after results. There will be more tranches soon thereafter. We are confident that in the next three years we will continue to offer a compelling investment opportunity across strong growth of EPS and DPS, profitability and best-in-class total distribution underpinned by organic capital generation and excess capital deployment or return, no later than 2027. In the event that our excess capital cannot be deployed and is therefore returned in full to our shareholders, we anticipate based on our profitability an organic capital generation assumption that our total annual average distribution ’24 to ’26 will be either equal in ’24 or above €8.6 billion in ’25 and ’26. As such, we should be able to return in this event half of our current market cap to our shareholders within the next three years. Should any of the excess capital be deployed, the level of total annual distribution shall remain best-in-class but depend in their amount on the return on those investments. We confirm that traditional bank acquisition shall be executed only if they fit strategically and if their POS synergies return compare favorably with those of our share buyback. Our transformation efforts have delivered consistent outstanding results across all KPIs, surpassing our peers. As of Q1, we are the leader in terms of EPS, DPS and tangible book per share growth, return on tangible equity, cost/income ratio, CET1, organic capital generation and expected 2024 distribution yield. And we're not done as our guidance for ’25 and ’26 and in general for the next three years demonstrates. We remain an even more attractive investment opportunity as our past performance and future prospects are still not reflected in our evaluation. Both our price to earnings and price to distribution multiples remained at a substantial discount to not only top peers but also to the sector particularly when adjusted for excess capital and the comfort provided by our lines of defense. Before I open to question, I would like to leave you with three key messages. One, this quarter has once again demonstrated the effectiveness of our UniCredit Unlock strategy. Our metrics of growth, profitability, and distribution set a benchmark for the industry. Two, looking forward we have plenty of runway left and are excited at the opportunity to show what we can do when rates and cost of risk normalize. In addition, we shall maintain a distribution yield and strategic optionality that are unmatched. Thirdly, our valuation is far from reflecting the above and we remain focused on continuing to deliver the results and distribution but will ultimately drive it to where it should be. Thank you everyone. And I now open for questions.",

Can I ask you for a little more color in terms of the breakdown of net profit growth in absolute terms and the share count reduction over ’25 and ’26? And you seem to be suggesting a strong EPS growth. Again I'm looking for a little bit of color basically in terms of the absolute versus the per share. And then the second one is, maybe you can give us a little bit of information around how much seasonality the fee number has included this quarter. This is very strong everywhere. I mean I've seen that the gross fee [indiscernible] have increased I think from €9 billion to €14 billion. So just trying to understand the path of the fee line actually through the year?

    "text": "I'll start and then Stefano will continue, Ignacio. So in terms of EPS and DPS what is which? I think we have purposely gone on EPS and DPS because it all depends on the speed and significance of the rates reduction and how the pass-through is managed. So we anticipate to be able to absorb the headwinds but the speed at which that happens vis-a-vis the offsetting levers, i.e. fees, i.e. cost, i.e. cost of risk which is going to normalize and the release of some of our buffers is at this point in time difficult to predict exactly. But suffice to say that we intend to defend our line of profitability at the moment at least and hopefully once we normalize, grow it further from there. With respect to the fees what I would say is that everyone has had very strong fees in this quarter. A lot is driven by clients moving in anticipation of rate reductions. It's difficult again to understand how much of that move will continue into second and third. I personally would not multiply by four, if I were you. But there is definitely a very positive trend going forward on rebalancing from other investments that were let's say preferred while we were in a higher interest rate environment to investment that are more in line to what it was before the rising rate. I would also highlight that in our question, that goes back to your first question, timing is important because for example our fees next year will benefit from internalization of insurance. Our fees in asset management are benefiting by internalization of some of the value change as we develop our in-house products. That's timing. Our fees in Payments are benefiting by the rollout of a MasterCard agreement and our agreement with Nexi and other initiatives. So it's a question of timing between what our idiosyncratic industrial transformation of the factories and of the very fee engine occurs and at the same time how fast the NII comes down and to which level due to the rates environment. But maybe Stefano can add to that.",

It looks like your cost of risk is definitely running better and revenues in general. I take your point on investment fees and part of that is, could save a bit in the next two quarters but Q1 is a very strong performance in trading as well. So just trying to think about what does that mean for net interest income and if you could just give us a bit of color of what are the moving parts and if there is any concerns or from the deposit pass-through increasing a bit higher maybe? And then my second question is on M&A. Thanks for the update but just kind of wondering a little bit so the criteria are clear. Now just thinking, the horizon is 2027 or should we -- could we consider something a bit earlier than that? I mean what are you thinking here in terms of also areas of interest, M&A wise?

    "text": "Delphine, if I bought all my shares this year the market could not absorb it, so now seriously. So I'll frame a little bit and then I'll pass to Stefano. Let me start with the second one. So we said at least 2027 and I think we are committing given our expectation with respect to net profit and organic capital generation more than committing, we're guiding to exceed €8.6 billion in distribution. So we have a buffer. I mean you can do €6.5 billion in -- up to the end of ’27 or you can do it a little bit earlier but that should give confidence that total distribution can be supported. And how much every year will depend on a number of factors including how well we do on the ordinary and how well we do and what do we do in deployment of capital and other things. But we have set a line of trying to beat the ’23 distributions. More generally and then I'll pass it to Stefano. I had that question before, why are -- what is our guidance and what has changed? I think what we have just done is before we were broadly in line now we say in excess of €8.5 billion, so we have broadly in line may mean plus minus €200 million. We've cut the downside and we said we're not going to be below €8.5 billion and actually above and we've kept the upside, that's what we have done. So if you look at Q1, one thing is certain, the results are well ahead of trend line that we expected and they have given us the confidence to be more secure that the downside is -- that we can manage with any downside. Now we're only in Q1, so we're not going to give you more than that. In terms of fees, we expect the same -- similar performance to what we were saying. In terms of NII, at the moment we have more encouraging results. But let's see what happens not only in the second but in the second part of a year when rates should decline and how fast they decline. So there are still quite a lot of moving parts so I would say that the general message is given where we are and what we're seeing we have cut the bottom and we have left open the upside.",

    "text": "So integrating on net interest income, so key elements, one is rates, a few basis points less rates in Q1. All-in-all, the average of ’24 should be higher than the average of ’23. This should positively impact the net interest income but as rate [indiscernible] in the second part of the year there will be a reduction of the rate so from that perspective is important to bear that in mind. Replicating portfolio contribution is slightly better than the expectation, so for the full year in comparison to 2023 will be above €400 million, so that's a positive side. Russia contribution negative, so concerning the leveraging ongoing you can expect few hundred million less net interest income in the next three quarters. Pass-through, I have to say, pass-through it's a couple of percentage up so we are at 30%. We are expecting to close the year with a average that is slightly above 30% so we then an exit Q4 close to 35%. So all-in-all, this should negatively contribute to net interest income, however as commented before the two positive news, rates on one end and the replicating portfolio contribution on the other end. Volume side, we do expect during the course of 2024 an exit level of the lending stock lower than the beginning of the year mainly for the trend that we are seeing here in Italy. It will be different for 2025 with regards to client rate trend on the lending side so far so good, so the repricing is ongoing and especially on the new lending production but it's not such to have a meaningful contribution to net interest income in comparison to what we've gathered for.",

Some comments in relation to the region, so Italy we are at 14.5%, in terms of deposit pass-through, we are up from 13.8%. Overall, the deposit mix is still tilted towards site deposit, so we have 96% of site deposit, so there is fundamentally no contribution to term. There is a not meaningful change in the behavior of the clients and from that perspective, yes, the composition is there especially on term offer but it is not such to meaningfully impact the pass-through. In Germany, the deposit composition is a different one because the site depo, to give the flavor is around 55%, so it is a completely different one. There the competition on term deposit is different, it is there. In Germany, there was an increase of the deposit pass-through and as a consequence also of the overall client rate, the deposit pass-through move up from 41% to around 43%. Central Europe, we move from 41% in Q4 to around 44%. Main country where there is an increased level of pass-through competition is Austria in line with the market rates. And Austria move from close to 40% to around 43%, Eastern Europe was 24%, now we are at 27%. All-in-all the trend of the pass-through is in line with the expectation as later the competition is higher especially in Austria for we see a stabilization in relation especially on the Corporate side across the board. There is still some movement on the Individual side especially in private banking and then we are not expecting a minimum change in the pattern during the course of Q2 to be seen the velocity of the repricing especially in the euro area when rates will start moving down in the second half of the year.",

With respect to the local exposure, our local exposure is down 67% over the last two years or so and we are continuing to compress decisively and we will continue to do that in the next few years and you should expect an accelerated decline.

We control the level of our business, we control what we do, how we protect against sanctions, compliance events, etc., etc., that we do. Obviously, if there were an opportunity to sell it or if there were an opportunity to further accelerate our disengagement, we would.

    "text": "So, cost. As I said, I think that by now the entire UniCredit is obsessively focused on efficiency. And we are guiding to cost below €9.5 billion this year, which means we will have had, effectively in the next three years, declining costs gradually, orderly, every quarter and I think we are going to try to keep it that way for as long as we can. There will be, in terms of absolute decline, a bar at some point, but we're not at that bar now and that allows us to do the following things. One, absorb inflation, salary drift and other. So, one that. Two, absorb investments that we're making in hiring new people, in training, in technology, etc., etc. And three, to obviously improve the jaws and the cost/income ratio to a greater extent than people that are maybe more focused on the top-line. We focus on both as obsessively and we will continue to do that. What happens by geography obviously is different. I mean, we have geographies that are, let's call them stable. Those geographies are rationalizing cost to a greater extent than geographies who have higher inflation and are growing much faster, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, where due to inflation and much faster growth, the ability to keep costs negative is not there. But if you look at the dynamics of growth of top line inflation versus cost, we are creating a positive gap everywhere. If I look at fees, I would just say on current account. As you know, we cut our current account fees to Italian clients in April 2023. So going forward, the comparison is for like-for-like. So in the second, third and fourth quarter and first of this year, we've always had to tell you, look, the underlying fees are these, but because we cut the current account fees to our Italian clients, they look less. From the second quarter onward, the comparison will be like-for-like. So while we're not changing our guidance for fees, and you know what it is, when you look at the growth, you should look at underlying because the current account fees are there and they're not going to move.

    "text": "Thank you, Azzurra. So Client Solutions. Let's start with where we are. I think this is one of the question you should have for Alpha Bank in Greece. I think that demonstrates that the quality, the level, the appropriateness and the way it's designed of our solution across investments, across insurance, across payments, across trade finance, and I can continue and across that integral market, of course, are done in such a way that they are particularly targeted to the clients of a commercial banks, i.e. small and medium corporates, affluent clients, private banking, that stream. And indeed we are very pleased and I think they are very pleased of what can be done with our factories in third parties, which fundamentally means that they are adding value, otherwise they wouldn't be making it. The same I would say if you look at Central and Eastern Europe and you take specific countries, I don't know, Bulgaria, Bosnia, it would be difficult for them to have the breadth and quality of, for example, investment products that they can instead get because we have centralized factories. So if you look at the rollout of onemarket, in many of these countries that rollout does not replace existing products, it just is what it is because now we can provide a product that maybe our partners would not find the rationale of a critical mass to deploy for one market alone. We are actually by leveraging group size, providing our smaller countries or countries that were mainstream asset managers, insurance companies, etc., etc., are not present. So I think it's definitely value added and I think in those countries we're definitely increasingly associated with quality fees, quality solution and other streams beyond just lending. And you can see it in the growth rates. They are growth rates from a low base but there are high growth rates. I think in the mind of clients there are a number of things. I would say that in Italy if I take P&C away from CPI, it was something we were practically absent three years ago and now I would say that most of our growth in Non-Life is that because you have noticed that the volumes in mortgages and other products are not growing. So the growth, where does it come from? Other products which were practically at zero three years ago and that is well known to our individual clients, that is also well known in the targeted offering we have for SME clients. So I would say you need to ask for what clients but I think the numbers indicate that it is working. I think in terms of Amundi and other contracts, first of all, please do not -- when you look at all of these things, so Amundi, when you look at internalization of insurance, when you look at that, there is a delta but the delta is not 100% meaning. If I am telling you that we are internalizing in excess of 73%, 74% of the value chain in asset management and we are aiming to go to 82% and we are doing that without producing but by distributing third party and packaging and improving the performance of what we distribute, we cannot go to 100% and in any case the delta is between 75% and 82%. The delta is not between 0 and 100%. If you take Life Insurance, we are already being paid for distribution. As we pull in Life Insurance, we will benefit from the underwriting of the product but the distribution is already within our fee base. So don't do 0-100% but they will contribute. So one, Asset Management, you are seeing it in let's say in-flight with onemarket and the other initiatives along this line. Two, Insurance will occur next year and you will see Life Insurance coming in-house during the course of next year. Three, on Payments, there are a number of initiatives which are completely along the same lines of what we have done in Asset Management and Insurance. So we look for the right partners, in this case for example MasterCard. We tend to create a partnership, so not multiple renegotiated every time but one contract, one partnership, mutual investment in technology, in product, in growth and usually better economic outcome because the stability of the partnership makes it clear to both sides that we don't want to put it in risk. So you're seeing some of this already progressing in payments. There will be other initiatives in payment that are not public yet, that we're going to roll out and that are going to accrete and move us into that direction. I would say that in Payment, especially transactional payment, the difference is that that is already in-house and there will be significant investment in technology to further secure not only the service and our leadership but also our ability to cross-sell a number of products that we can do when we go end-to-end between a country and another. And I can continue with all the factories but so if you take advisory and capital market, we have no ambition to become a leading global investment bank but in our client base, in our mid-cap client base and also small-cap, we want to be the dominant player. And therefore the level of service and what we do is focused on getting our advisory and capital market to work tightly together with our banks to attack those segment of clients where global investment bank don't reach because they are too small and local player reach but don't have the ability to serve because they cannot rebuild the same level of service. That is the philosophy we're going across and I do absolutely believe that it's more and more clear to clients that if they need advice on certain things we're there for them and you see it in the numbers of advisor and capital markets, for example.",

    "text": "On M&A, it's a little bit, every time I have this answer, it's broad. Okay? So I could make, I don't know if you consider that M&A, but I could make an investment in a fintech that provides us a technology platform to accelerate what we're doing in a certain segment of business. That usually is not large, but it doesn't have the same multiple and the same profile as a traditional bank M&A. But in our investment profile, when we look at return on investment and IRR, it needs to hurdle. Everything we do needs to hurdle. Hurdle means that when people tell you it's strategic, it's usually to convince you to do something that does not return above the cost of equity and therefore it’s strategic. In our case, you're never going to hear that. So we're going to tell you it's strategic because it makes sense that we develop our platform with this technology on this and it hurdles over the life of the investment and we're very thorough in looking at that. We could look at, for example, the metrics for internalizing Life Insurance are different from the one of a traditional bank. But I would say that many of you will tell me that especially because of the Danish compromise, the return on the capital employed is a no brainer and therefore you should be doing it. But if I look at straight P's, P's in insurance are higher than in banks. So but the return on investment makes all of the sense and given that it doesn't consume almost any capital, it becomes a good investment for us and so on and so forth. So if I take a traditional bank, so the same kind of overall, then it's quite easy and if I can buy an overall bank, meaning UniCredit at under seven times earnings, it's very difficult for me to justify you all and our investors that it's a good idea if post synergies it costs me 10. So we will do it only if it beats our share buybacks. But then more generally, what are we looking at? Anything that strengthens the franchise. So we could look at things, so in Insurance, as we're internalizing insurance, strengthen the franchise. We can look at things in technology to accelerate the rollout of certain ideas that we have. That is just the beginning, but we could do other things in that area. We can look at traditional banks if they fit. And the question is, we all take a step back and we say, okay, does that increase the value of our franchise, does that create over time a better return than either not doing anything or buying back our shares? If the answer is yes, we do it across the board. Because you asked me for metrics, I have to refer to traditional banks, but otherwise I would give you a long table with, if it's a fintech X, if it's an insurance Y, and that becomes a little bit ridiculous. With respect to RWAs and the excess capital, and Stefan is going to guide you in further details, the excess of over €6.5 billion already embeds the impact from Balfour and still keeps us ahead of 13%. There are debates as to whether ahead of 13% plus Balfour is the right number or not, but the €6.5 billion is above 13% fully including Balfour and all the regulatory headwinds that we know of at this time. With respect to what we're going to do on, let's say, more ordinarily RWAs, the same. Which means deploy our capital, therefore our RWAs above the cost of equity, and therefore make sure that in as much as possible our NII net of provision, which is where we deploy our capital, exceeds the cost of equity, critical in a bank, to provide profitability. Profitability, not net profit, profitability return on equity and distribution, and not destroy them. And secondly, increase the weight of fees, because obviously fees are zero RWAs. So the blended then beats in terms of return on tangible and distribution. That's looking forward. Looking backwards, which is what over time is reducing and then shall almost disappear, is the management of our backbook to make sure that the entire backbook portfolio fits the metric of exceeding the cost of equity. As we said many times, Britta, we were, let's say, 30%, 40% was at that level before. Now we are over 60%, I think it is, or 70%, sorry. We're going to go 80%, 85%, 90% but we’re never going to be 100%. Nobody has 100%. So that will over time decrease, and at that point we will be reliant on the profitability and the capital generation of our NII net of provision and the fees, plus the capital impact from ’26 onward of our DTAs, which will start contributing and adding again to our capital generation above and beyond what is ordinary and organic.",

    "text": "So some data points, securitization and active portfolio management. So we're assuming to execute a few billions of securitization, both in ’24 and ’25, so on top of what we have already executed. Active portfolio management action, the same. Do consider that the overall stock of risk-weighted assets related to EVA-negative clients on the corporate side is around €20 billion at group level. So as a matter of fact, part of that will be improved working on the revenue side, so cross-selling and so on. Part of that is likely going to be not rollover, so will contribute to the active portfolio management action in ’24 and ’25. With regards to the regulatory impact in relation to Basel IV, let's say last estimate is between 85 basis points and 290 basis points, is mainly operational risk. So it's around 70 basis point operational risk. Do take into consideration that that is mainly connected to our revenues, so the more we do revenues, the more we have a risk-weighted asset and operational risk. And the more we are reducing risk-weighted assets, the more the business point impact is higher. So all-in-all, the reason why the impact on Basel IV is slightly more is because we are betting on revenues and we are betting on risk-weighted asset management. Okay? So nothing wrong. Finally, in relation to the business dynamic, we are not expecting a meaningful contribution of business-driven risk-weighted assets during the course of 2024, for what we have commented before in relation to the lending trend. While in ’25 and ’26, considering that we are expecting a reversal of the stock of lending, meaning going back to growth, we are currently assuming also some risk-weighted asset inflation that are in from business dynamics. But as related by Andrea, all has been taken into consideration for what we have gathered for in relation to capital plan.",

Can you just remember us what you are doing on this front and how you are leveraging your pan-European footprint on the technology? Second one, I was wondering, since the business plan this year comes to a conclusion, I'm talking about UniCredit Unlocked, are you planning a new business plan presentation, I don't know, sometimes in the last quarter or maybe early next year? Thank you.",

    "text": "As most of my colleagues at UniCredit know, we are never done. So we just keep on moving the boundaries out. I would say that for UniCredit Unlocked, too early to say. I don't think that UniCredit Unlocked is over, meaning UniCredit Unlocked is an approach, it's a vision, it's a strategy and it's the constant pursuit of certain KPIs across revenue growth, sustainable and profitable across operational excellence with cost/income ratio at the best end of the industry across capital excellence, across all of these things to be able to sustainably return on tangible above -- much above and beyond our cost of equity and to create a model that is highly cash generative so that we can reward our investors more than the benchmark. So if you look at that then when we announced UniCredit Unlocked we were all about fees and then what happened, we had a war two months later and we have rates going up a year later or less. And therefore our plan was all about NII pass-through and building without forgetting that we needed to build further fees for when that passed. And I think what you're seeing going forward regardless of what we will do with a new plan or not, is a continuation of that adapted it for an environment that is changing. So it is difficult to think that we can substantially increase as we have done in the last three years, our cost to income, our cost of risk, our capital efficiency. Difficult, we can hold but difficult. If you look at emphasis, our emphasis is how the other engine and a half, which is fees and some trading, can offset as much as possible the impact from normalization of rates and cost of risk on NII. That's the challenge, if we can do that while keeping the rest going back to what Ignacio was saying at the beginning, we will be able to stabilize our net profit and most importantly, our return on tangible well ahead of 15% and then as volume come back, grow from there and maintain a more normalized orderly growth from that level. We will keep the surprise as to where we do and when we do on Investor Day. With respect to technology and then I'll pass it to Stefano, I think the direction is very clear. So direction number one is, in as much as possible and all of you probably realize how difficult that is to have -- the ambition is to have at some point in time one technology for the entire group. Why? Not because I particularly like it or not like, it is because you need to go back to that. If we were to be able to do that we would have a scale advantage in technology equivalent to a bank that is simple in onemarket. So that is worth a lot of efficiency, it's worth speed, it's worth client journey, it’s worth everything. But that is not easy. I think how many bank even have one technology in one market and we're saying we want one technology in 13. So it is a journey, it is a mindset that when we develop things, we're trying to get them to converge. But we also realize that if I wanted to do that and that was my sole objective, my 13 banks would stop because they would not be able to roll out all the things they're rolling out. And in a number of countries we are a technology leader and we have taken technology to a very high level, take Croatia, take Bulgaria and we're not going to delay them because of the group product. We are going to try to get it to converge. The second thing is, thank God, sometimes you're lucky, when you wait and you're the second mover, cloud is allowing an acceleration and it's a lot easier to do and it's a lot cheaper to do and will allow us to go in that direction. But as Ali and I discuss all the time, the way we look at technology is, okay this is better from a technology standpoint. But better needs to deliver, better revenue, better cost, better client experience, and outcome. If it doesn't, we're a private enterprise and we're going to look at it in a different way. So that is the philosophy and that is happily applied by Stefano who will give you more details about it.",

    "text": "Thank you, Andrea. So let's start from some data, some financials. So in relation to the IT investment in the Unlock plan, the environmental IT investment, I hold the amount of IT cash out was around €2.8 billion. We are in line with that, last year we've invested more than €700 million in terms of IT investment cash out and this year will be more than that. We are doing initiatives, let's say, on one end on efficiency, on the other end on change and effectiveness. On efficiency, clearly we have a renegotiation contract and we will negotiate contract with our partners and we are also in-sourcing people and skills, right? In order, let's say, with the ultimate goal to keep under our control the inflation that is absolutely there also when we are dealing with IT cost. With regards to the change, we are fundamentally investing on fundamentally four pillars. Cyber security, the amount that we are investing on cyber security is the same, slightly growing. Then we have the experience platform that are fundamentally connected with our key strategic priorities, i.e. were invested in the client experience platform, for example, consumer financing. But that Andrea highlighted before is one of them and we are doing the same also on Insurance and we will do on Payment. So this type of client experience digital investment are totally in line with our key strategic priorities towards clients. Then we have data, so we will have investment in relation especially to the improvement of data taking into consideration how much data is important, let's say also to run the business and to properly serve the clients. And then as highlighted by Andrea, we are also locating a part of the investment to cloud, meaning fundamentally to the infrastructure with the same goal. So in this case is partly efficiency because we can also harmonize and reducing the normal application that we have but on the other hand we can also speed an increase in the speed of delivery properly shifting from mainframe to cloud over the next years.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone. So just a quick one to begin with. So regarding the commitment to return the excess capital later than 2027, can I just check, does that mean distribution in relation to ’27, i.e. the dividends and buybacks conducted in 2028? Or that it's all done and dusted by the end of December ’27? And then second, on M&A, the move higher I guess in valuation multiples across the sectors has in theory made the backdrop a bit more supportive for M&A. But again, you've previously talked about the need to achieve alignment between willing buyers and willing sellers. And if we look around at recent developments in the space, it looks like that alignment can still be a stumbling block. So perhaps to what extent do you think the delivery of UniCredit Unlocked is now a key support in enabling you to achieve that alignment in the future, i.e. to convince the seller that you can deliver on integration and operational improvements ahead of what they might be able to achieve on a standalone basis?",

    "text": "Okay, so the capital return, end of ’27 done and dusted and I said, at least or later, sorry, latest. So we will gauge the speed based on everything else to be able to deliver compelling distribution in the meantime. Then M&A, I think there I mean from our point of view, we have the following factors. Point number one, well, we have and we're very confident and excited about a great runway going forward. We have moved firmly from a probably something that looked more like a restructuring story, therefore with jumps in net income doubling and doubling or whatever it is to more of a normalized high value bank that obviously by definition is closer to reaching its excellence outcome and therefore has less internal delta than what we had in 2021. Now it's a higher quality delta, you have a contribution from valuation all of these things. And we think that relative to the sector we're going to perform better in terms of that runway and that trend line significantly better but it is less than the jumps we've made every year in the last three. So that means that when we look at benchmarks and when we look at that M&A has a benchmark that is easier to match. The second thing that has happened is that I do believe that not only we are more credible in our ability to extract value from a banking franchise but beside the credibility we're confident internally and capable of replicating what we've done on our franchise on others. And we think that that is a competitive advantage and we think that those two things bring our ability to extract synergies above and beyond what is the average on a spreadsheet, quite tangible and quite [grown]. And that's the second positive. The third positive is to be seen and that is when the tide goes down and the substantial tailwind from rates and cost of risks normalizes, I think we will see a differentiated performance between the banks that have tried to crystallize 110% of that tailwind and therefore did relatively little to look at afterwards and the banks who have invested a lot, re-engineered a lot and taken some of the benefits from that tailwind to invest further in improving themselves that, that will be more capable to absorb the shock and then grow from there at a differentiated level. We believe we are in the second category. We believe that if some of the targets are in the first, it will create a better alignment in valuation to fundamentals. So if you get a better alignment evaluation to fundamental, if we can extract more value and we are at a point where our credibility and our capability of doing it has increased, M&A is more probable. With respect to targets, I think that if I asked any of you what are the targets or possible target in any market? We should -- we would all end up with the same list not only for UniCredit but more generally. So the question is, as you said, opportunity and opportunity is there a willing buyer and a willing seller and on the other hand are the economics and the ability to execute make sense. If you're getting those two but I do think we're going in a direction where probably the opportunity becomes more probable.",

    "text": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. It is with great pleasure that we announce our second quarter and first half 2024 results. This mark the historic achievement for UniCredit in its journey to set a new benchmark for banking, 14 consecutive quarters of profitable growth, delivering a record quarter and a record first half. These results are a testament to the unwavering commitment of our team with disciplined execution of our long-term vision and strategy and our dedication to creating value for all our stakeholders over time. The track record we have built in the last 3.5 years is undeniable. We are confident that our action will further propel our positive performance in the future, setting UniCredit to part as an attractive investment opportunity. We have delivered consistently outstanding results across all KPIs: growth, profitability, efficiency and distributions outpacing our peers. These achievements are down to clarity of direction, disciplined execution and the proactive steps we take to prepare for the future. UniCredit has transformed into a blue-chip bank with value still to unlock, lots of it. One defined by both resiliency and profitable growth. Resiliency through the cycle, leveraging our lines of defense and maintaining a quality-driven approach. Profitable growth through quality earnings and excellence in operational and capital efficiency all propelling our best-in-class distributions. Our past is marked by transformation. Our present by superior sustainable performance. Our future by our continuing to unlock significant potential. This performance is down to our mindset. It is the essence of how we engage with our clients and how we do business. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of quality growth, driven by our focus on profitable NII, increased fees and improved operational and capital efficiency, all leading to superior return on tangible equity and organic capital generation to support best-in-class distribution. Given the backdrop of rates and pass-through normalization, the profitable growth in gross NII of 5% in the half and 2% in the quarter is impressive. Overall, cost of risk remained well below our target at 5 basis points for the half and 1 basis points for the quarter, thanks to continued significant write-backs again, underscoring the conservativeness of our provisioning policy. As such, net NII dynamics mirrored those of gross NII. Our fee income grew 6.6% in the half and an impressive 10% in the quarter, thanks to our investments in people, fees in people and with fee-to-revenues reaching 33% and 34%, respectively. Our focus on operational efficiency, while investing, and capital efficiency, while targeting profitable growth, continue to set the standard for the industry. Absolute costs declined by 1.2% over the 6 months and 1.7% accelerating in the quarter. With our cost-to-income ratio further improving to 36.3%, 2.9 percentage points better than a year ago. Our net revenue to RWAs reached 9.1% in the quarter, up 1 percentage point from a year ago. RWAs were further reduced to €277 billion. It is the combined performance across all these levers but allowed us to reach a record return on tangible equity of 13% CET1 of circa 23.5%, 20% reported for both the half and the quarter, a record organic capital generation of €6.7 billion or 234 basis points for the half, supporting accrued distribution of €5.25 billion or 100% of net profit, while increasing our CET1 ratio to 16.2. A net profit growth of 20% for the half and 16% for the quarter. In the half, our EPS increased by 36%, our accrued EPS by 53% and our tangible book per share by 20%. These results are built on strong foundation across leading capital levels, sound asset quality and strong liquidity ratio. Let's now look at the P&L in further detail. Let's start with net revenues. Net revenues increased 7% to €12.6 billion in the half and 6% to €6.3 billion in the quarter. This is a result of a resilient, best-in-class NII, well above the cost of equity, a top-tier fee to revenue ratio with strong upside potential, a structurally lower and less volatile loan loss provision and continued solid trading. NII, net of provision play the critical role in our P&L., and we have focused on keeping it well above our cost of equity and resilient. We now have a RoAC above 20% in the quarter in NII. While this number will normalize on the back of lower rates and higher cost of risk, we have laid the foundation for value-accretive growth thereafter, always exceeding our cost of equity. Gross NII and margins are slightly down quarter-on-quarter as rates have started reducing. Pass-through has continued to increase, loan volumes have now recovered, and we focus on profitability. Strong management of the pass-through with an increase of only 1.4 percentage points to 31.5%, driven mainly by Germany with a skew to corporates and Central Europe, driven by Austria. Italy pass-through increased by less than 1 percentage point. Deposit volume stabilized Q-on-Q. We have continued to improve our lending mix as we move towards higher profitability and crossover segments. Those that bring us both corporate and retail clients with significantly diversified needs. Asset quality. Our NPE ratio has improved quarter-on-quarter, and we remain well covered. Our overlays to protect the future remain outsized and higher than the industry. The decline from 1.8% to 1.7% is a rounding equal to €25 million. Our overall cost of risk remains low, reflecting where we are in the cycle and benefiting from substantial write-backs. We witnessed continued significant write-backs across our entire franchise. Germany cost of risk run rate increased year-over-year as it may be earlier in the cost of recycle. Italy is broadly stable versus a year ago, while Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia saw significant net reversal in the half. Conservative past provisioning, leading to very significant write-backs enabled Russia to absorb half of the impact of a single name legal provision in risk and charges. As such, it may be interesting for you to consider our cost of risk together with single NIM risk and charges, which would raise the 1 basis point for the quarter to circa 19 basis points. Cost of risk, excluding Russia, was 12 basis points. For the half, broadly in line year-over-year and 11 basis points for the quarter, up 5 basis points year-over-year. We reaffirm our guidance of a cost of risk below or well below 20 basis points for the year, as we still plan for the start of the normalization of the cost of risk cycle and potential further precautionary provision in the second half. This is just a precaution at this point. Fees. Fees increased 7% in the half and 10% in the quarter as a result of our investments in product factories and renewed client appetite. These were propelled by clients rebalancing their portfolio ahead of the expected rate normalization and benefited from the renegotiation of some contracts in asset management and in payments. While we remain confident in our fee growth prospects and this strong cash should not be annualized. We have taken a measured and disciplined approach to further streamline our organization through the redesign and automation of processes and reducing bureaucracy. Our €1.1 billion of integration costs charged last year is allowing us to maintain our efficiency leadership while investing. Costs declined 1.2% in the half and 1.7%, therefore, accelerating in the quarter, with cost to income further improving to 36.3%. Our continued focus on operational efficiency has allowed us to invest in people, hiring, training, attractively rewarding and retaining our talent. And in our business, enhancing our product factories and digital capabilities. We intend to continue this investment whilst keeping the like-for-like cost base broadly flat going forward. Our best-in-class organic capital generation of €6.7 billion in the half and €3.3 billion in the quarter has allowed us to accrue 100% of net profit for distribution while increasing CET1 to 16.2% versus 15.7% like-for-like 1 year ago. Our disciplined focus on quality net revenue growth ensuring a net NII RoAC above cost of equity and an increasing ratio of fee to revenues, complemented by an obsessive focus on operational and capital efficiency of a key to maximizing profitability and organic capital generation while growing, maintaining best-in-class ordinary distribution without denting capital. This is a competitive advantage that will guide us going forward as we strive to support excellent ordinary distribution without denting CET1. Excess capital deployment will be additive to that. As we look at our regions and product factories, I would remind you of the differentiated strengths and value add that each of these bring to the overall group. UniCredit is much more than the sum of its part. Italy. Our Italian business had another excellent quarter, demonstrating its ability to deliver sustained quality profitable growth and outstanding returns well above peers. Net revenue rose 5.5% to €5.6 billion in the half and 3.7% in the quarter. NII was up 8% in the half and 3.3% in the quarter, thanks to strict management of the pass-through and continued rebalancing in our lending mix. Cost of risk remained mild at 28 basis points for the half and 23 basis points for the quarter, also benefiting from continued write-backs. Fees were up 7% in the half and 10% in the quarter, with all of our factories contributing but with particular strength in investments, in protection, in payments and in corporate finance. Italy is growing its assets under management and gaining market share in bank insurance and to a lesser extent in certificates as our advisory activity supports customer deploy additional investment in the right products. Hence, we have a greater impact from volume than from margin given certificate higher margins and upfronts. But we believe that this is the right strategy at this moment and will pay dividends in the future. Cost rose 0.6% in the half and 0.3% in the quarter, a structural savings from continued simplification and streamlining offset most of the inflation and investment in the business growth, including 550 new hires in the network and 350,000 hours of training to our people. RWAs were reduced by €12 billion or 10% half-on-half. Italy further strengthen its operating and capital efficiency with its best-ever 33.9% cost-income ratio and 10.6% net revenue to RWA. Profit before tax rose 16% to €3.4 billion in the half and 14% to €1.8 billion in the quarter. RoAC reached 32% in the half and 33% in the quarter. Italy generated €3 billion of organic capital in the half. Germany. Germany's profitability is the best in a decade, supported by excellent operational efficiency. Net revenue fell 3.6% to €2.7 billion in the half and 2.6% in the quarter. Germany quarterly NII would have been flat, adjusting for the impact of higher funding costs of our group trading portfolio, which was driven by higher volume. Overall, NII was down 10% in the half and 11% in the quarter. Being predominantly a corporate bank with a pass-through level on deposit near to 50%, Germany future sensitivity to rate normalization is fairly low. Cost of risk remained more elevated than the trend line at circa 20 basis points as our franchise is more sensitive to single name files and the country may or may not be earlier in the credit cycle. Fees were down 1% in the half, but up 3% in the quarter as performance accelerated across all categories, especially in investment, plus 18%, payment, plus 5%, nearly offsetting the lower client hedging fees compared to previous year's extremely high client demand. Germany had the most scope in rationalizing its corporate center and continues to do so. Costs were reduced 7 percentage points in the half and 6% in the quarter while continuing to fund investments. RWAs were reduced by €7 billion in Germany or 9% half-over-half. Germany continued to improve its operating and capital efficiency with a 39.2% cost-income ratio and 8% net revenue to RWA setting records. Pretax rose 18% to €1.6 billion in the half and 12% to €740 million in the quarter. RoAC remained at or above 20% for both the half and the quarter. Germany delivered €1.4 billion of organic capital generation in the half. Central Europe. Central Europe's profitability continues to be driven by strong revenue and disciplined cost control. Net revenue rose 5.5% to €2.2 billion in the half, but were down 0.8% in the quarter. NII was up 5.9% in the half and 1.4% in the quarter despite a downward trend but is expected to accelerated due to lower rates and higher pass-through. Cost of risk had net reversal of 5 basis points in the half and loan losses of 9 basis points in the quarter. Fees were up 11.5% in the half and 13% in the quarter, thanks to strong investment in Austria and a large advisory mandate in the Czech Republic. Business initiative across all segments should support this trend. Going forward, revenues will be more visibly impacted by the downward trend of interest rates, partially offset by strong contribution from fees performance. Costs grew by only 1.8% in the half due to wage drift, partially compensated by efficiency activities, enabling us to also continue investment in digitalization. RWAs were reduced to €1.2 billion -- by €1.2 billion or 2% in the half. The disciplined focus on operating and capital efficiency continued across all countries reflected in a 36.5% cost-to-income ratio and 7.4% net revenue on RWA ratio. Pretax rose 17% to €1.3 billion and 1% at €700 million in the quarter. RoAC was 24.3% in the half and accelerated to 26.2% in the quarter, and the region delivered €1.3 billion of capital organically in the half. Eastern Europe, outstanding profitability continued at pace this quarter, driven by excellent revenues and strong operational efficiency. Net revenues rose 21% to €1.5 billion in the half, increasing 26% in the quarter. NII was up 17% in the half and 12% in the quarter. Thanks to strong business growth across the region, a favorable rate environment and good pass-through control. Cost of risk, a net reversal of 59 basis points in the half due to continued write-back and a profitable NPE disposal and underscoring once more the conservativeness of our provisioning. Cost of fees were up 13% in the half, 14% in the quarter, driven by all categories. Going forward, revenue is expected to remain broadly stable despite a downward trend in interest rates, thanks to strong commercial activity, focused on profitable and capital-efficient business. Costs grew 3.4% in the half, offsetting most of the region, high inflation, whilst we continue to invest in our people and in digitalization. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 30.3% cost-to-income ratio and 10.2% net revenue on RWA ratio in the half. Pretax grew 32% to €1 billion in the half and 35% to more than €550 million in the quarter. RoAC exceeded 40% in both half and quarter with a region delivering €600 million of capital organically in the half. Client Solutions. Turning to our product factory. Strong performance across the board. Client Solutions revenue grew by 7% in the half to €5.8 billion, 2/3 of which is fees. Corporate Solutions revenues rose by 4% to €2.7 billion in the half, driven by advisory and financing up 9%. Payment Solutions rose by 6% to €1.3 billion, driven by payments, up 14%. Individual Solutions rose by 13% to €1.7 billion, driven by investment up 17%. Onemarkets grew to €8 billion in AUM, confirming our business proposition. Our transformation from laggard to leader is due to the consistent delivery across all metrics, regions and products. We have moved from a bank languishing in the bottom quadrant to one in the top quartile, defined by quality revenues, profitability, organic capital generation and distribution metrics, consistently outperforming our core peers for 9 consecutive quarters. Our disciplined focus on quality profitable growth over volumes naturally constrained our net revenue and net profit growth versus peer with a greater volume focus. Regardless, we move close to leadership position in both cases. Our strategy aims to excel in net revenue over RWA, organic capital generation, which ultimately supports distribution, cost-to-income ratio and return on tangible equity. Here, we move to and retain clear leadership outperforming all peers. We have significant further room to add value, and you will see that going forward. Moving to tomorrow. Today, we're a completely different bank, one that has demonstrated its ability to consistently deliver. Our remarkable performance has propelled our total shareholder return and market cap rose to the top of the sector, while we continue to invest in the future, and we have just begun. We will build on this momentum, continue to deliver accretive profitable high-quality growth over volume, underpinning best-in-class distribution, outperformed our benchmarks and ultimately secure a valuation that truly reflects our worth. We're not just prepared for the future, we're shaping it. We have the resilience, the flexibility and the ability to adjust to extenuating circumstances without impacting our overall performance, and this quarter is not an exception. Our people and our winning culture will unlock even greater value in the future. Our commitment to our stakeholder remains unchanged. We aim to become the bank for Europe's future, empowering communities to progress and setting a new benchmark for banking. This is the guiding star that unites and inspire us all at UniCredit. We shall continue to strive for the best outcome for our 3 stakeholders. By putting our clients and community at the very heart of everything we do, we are transforming our organization from the ground up. Our client success is our success and their satisfaction is our ultimate reward. Our people represent the true value of UniCredit. We empower them, invest in them and foster an environment where they can thrive. Their dedication and passion are the driving forces behind our achievements, and we are committed to supporting them. Our investors provide us with the financial resources to achieve our objectives, and we are committed to protect their interest and deliver the highest sustainable returns and distribution to reward them. Our profitability and distribution yields are the best in the peer group, achieved without compromising our capital, asset quality and liquidity strengths. The vision and this commitment will not change. Our strategy also remains unchanged, specifically designed to play to our strengths and address our weaknesses. It is composed of a set of levers which we can flex depending on the needs of the business, the growth opportunities and the external environment. It is the combination of those levers that allows us to evolve over time, while being consistent to our vision and objectives. We have put our clients back at the center that has shaped a new business model. We have progressively redesigned our organization turning in on inside, we have redesigned our processes, way of working, aiming to achieve excellence in efficiency, leveraging our scale in technology, in data, in operation, in procurement, in training and in product offering to deliver with speed and quality. We are uniting and empowering our people around one vision, one winning culture, one set of principle and value, and we are supporting them with the right organization and tools. We're developing best-in-class product factories, alone or with strategic partners, to deliver the best financial services, product to 15 million clients across Europe by increasingly integrated distribution channel freely selected by our clients. We're investing in best-in-class technology and data, evolving our operation to continue to secure efficiency while enhancing our clients and on people experiences. Our strategy is underpinned by clear financial targets, delivered through an optimal balance of our 3 financial levers. Given the changed environment and our ongoing transformation, we have shifted or are shifting our focus to quality top line growth while maintaining leadership in asset quality, in capital and in operational expense. To grow our top line in a quality way, once freight and cost of risk normalize, we will continue to tilt the mix of our lending towards high net NII RoAC products and segments while fulfilling our clients' broader needs. This will also drive fee growth, supported by investment in our people, in our factories, in our distribution channels and in our technology. Doing so, we will maximize our capital efficiency, enhance capital generation and profitability, powered by our improvement in operational excellence. Our dedicated approach to quality over volume and our proactive buildup of lines of defense result in a uniquely resilient bottom line and confidence in our long-term outlook. Given headwinds, this result could have been expected to go in the opposite direction, they didn't. Our cost of risk is defined by quality focus and a conservative approach, and we have still €1.7 billion overlays to further support our cost of risk. In cost, we continue our obsession with efficiency, holding €1.5 billion of buffers already sustained from nonoperating items last year. In capital, we focus on optimal capital allocation and a superior profitability portfolio mix with €6.5 billion of excess capital, protecting total distribution and/or allowing for strategic flexibility to further propel net profit through inorganic and now with Vodeno-Aion organic external growth. Our task now is to maintain our leadership across all these levers. But our new focus is to be in a unique position on NII as our approach gives us a very high quality and profitable top line whose growth is now the central focus of our strategy. Without changing strategy, we now shift our focus from the operating machine to the commercial machine. Our commitment to quality over volume and our diversified footprint have resulted in NII growth that aligns with our European peers. But with net NII RoAC, having grown by 3x and its resilience enhanced by the shift in our lending mix. Our future in fees looks bright, given the momentum and the further impact of our past and planned investment and internalization. The combination of the higher resilience of NII and above-market growth of fees gives us confidence on the future top line trajectory. The strong foundation, proven track record and diversified levers to generate fee-based growth above market rates uniquely position us for the future. Vodeno-Aion. Through our investment in Vodeno-Aion, UniCredit acquires. Firstly, Vodeno's next-generation cloud-based core banking technology, fully competitive with best-in-class providers such as [food machine] [indiscernible] Scalable and flexible offering a comprehensive suite of digital banking products across multiple channels. We are welcoming 200 technology engineers, developers and data scientists as well as a management team with a strong track record in banking and technology implementation. Through Aion, we acquired a small bank incorporated in Belgium, whose legacy technology and clients have already been successfully migrated to Vodeno, and that already operate through a branch structure in Poland, Germany and Sweden. It is the combination of Vodeno and Aion that provides them with a competitive advantage vis-a-vis pure technology providers and fintechs. This investment propels UniCredit into a new realm of technology development and digital banking, ensuring a strong differentiation from pure technology providers, neobanks and incumbents undergoing digital transformation. Going forward, UniCredit will be able to leverage Vodeno's technology and talent to further develop this now proprietary technology and use it as a sandbox for a number of technology innovations. We can use Aion to profitably and quickly enter targeted client segments for entire markets across Europe, providing additional opportunities to deploy our excess capital. This is our third route. Vodeno and Aion will continue to target embedded finance services to marketplaces, e-commerce retailers, travel, health care and education platform and banking as a service to -- for selected fintechs. We aim to start with a project on Poland, considering the significant level of synergies with our other European markets and the credibility and experience of the Vodeno and Aion management team in the area. We will come back to you with further detail once the project is fully fledged. We're investing €370 million in cash for 100% of Vodeno, Aion with an expected impact on our CET1 of circa 15 basis points. The P&L impact of the consolidation will be dependent on the level and speed of additional investment that we made to develop this technology and these franchises, and we will communicate it to you in due course. We expect to close by year-end, subject to regulatory approval. I may add, we have no intention of integrating Vodeno-Aion. They will be like our 14th bank providing us with selective technology and organic growth opportunity through start-ups in various markets and marketplaces. I will now provide you with an update on Russia. Our strategy has been clear since day 1, working towards an ordinarily solvent, wind down as quickly as possible, always without both the letter and the spirit of a complex legal, regulatory and sanction limitation. At each and every step we have held true to our values, determined to do right by our principles and reputation, even if capitulating to pressure would have been the easier pass at the time. We remained determined not to take action, but by breaching local laws and regulation provide Russia with a justified motive to intervene and take control of our local asset and the value that comes with it. Facts speak to themselves. We have significantly reduced our activity since the first quarter of '22, particularly those not related to Western companies. Cross-border exposure is down 93% from €4.5 billion to €300 million, while minimizing our loss to 11% of principal. Local loans are down 68% from €7.3 billion to €2.3 billion. Local deposits are down 69% from €8.3 billion to €2.6 billion. And cross-border payments are down 56% from €25 billion to €11.2 billion. I remind that as all of our economies continue to purchase selective materials from Russia, those materials go through the payment system of 3 banks. In doing so, we have also absorbed the drag on our growth and profitability. And more importantly, we reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 to circa 50 basis points on a 16.2% CET1, transforming it from very significant to non-substantial. Looking ahead, our ultimate goal is clear and unwavering, and we believe fully consistent with the expectation of our regulator. We will continue to drive down our exposure to Russia, and are continuing as we speak. Our existing plan foresees the following targets for 2025. Cross-border exposure, practically 0, with 100% reduction. Local loans below €1 billion with an 85% reduction. Local deposits, below €2 billion with in excess of 75% reduction. Cross-border payment to €8.5 billion, with more than a 66% reduction. Recently, we were advised by the straightforward implementation of recent instruction by the ECB may be inconsistent with our legal framework in certain area or conflicting with other duties. Given the seriousness of the potential consequences involved, we have sought legal clarity from the European Court of Justice to protect UniCredit from unnecessary risks, including potentially providing Russia with a justified motive to intervene and take control of our local asset and the value that comes with them. We welcome the ECB's recent openness to further clarify the request, have of any ruling and remain open to withdraw our request to the ECJ, should their clarification provide us with a necessary legal comfort. Should it be necessary for the proceeding to continue, we consider an institutional win any ECJ ruling regardless of the outcome as we would have confirmed the legality of the past, we have been ordered and the rule of law in all of our actions. Let's move to guidance. The strong start to the year allows us to increase our net revenue guidance to over €23 billion from circa €22.5 billion. This is thanks to the strong performance across all revenue lines and higher expectation for the full year skewed more towards net interest income. Our operational and capital efficiency results are also ahead of plan as we have front-loaded a number of initiatives. We have chosen not to upgrade our net profit and return on tangible guidance at this time as we retain flexibility to further support our future performance as we have done every year. However, I want to be clear, putting aside that flexibility, our underlying performance is sent to substantially exceed or in other words, blow out our net profit and return on tangible guidance. This is the same conservative approach we have taken so far. Our 2025 and 2026 ambition remains steady and confirm. We are well positioned to continue our trajectory of sustainable profitable growth and outsized distribution. And if this -- and it is the sustainability of high growth and high profitability and high distribution that provides the value of UniCredit. In conclusion, we have again demonstrated the effectiveness of our UniCredit unlock strategy. Our metrics of growth, efficiency, capital generation, profitability and distribution set a benchmark for our industry. We have moved from a restructuring story to a blue-chip bank with superior growth and distribution prospects. We face the future with the same strategy shifting our emphasis from our efficiency KPIs, which we shall defend, to our top line quality growth KPIs. We have leading profitability and distribution, strong line of defense and more than €6.5 billion of excess capital that protect or further propels our profitability and distribution depending on the opportunity. We have plenty of runway and are excited to show what we can do when rates and cost of risk normalize. The team has demonstrated again and again their ability to come through, and they continue to surprise even me. I would not want to bet against them. Both our price to earnings and price to distribution multiples remains at a substantial discount to not only top peers but also to the broader sector, particularly when considering our fundamentals and the comfort provided by our line of defense and excess capital. We offer a unique investment opportunity at an attractive entry point. Thank you all, and we shall open for questions.",

    "text": "I will start, and Stefano will finish. So our NII guidance has been increased to in excess of €23 billion. Our fee guidance for the moment is remaining the same. We have been proven wrong in as much as this was the same thing we told you in the first quarter when we thought that the jump in fees could not be replicated in the second quarter. It was actually not only replicated, it jumped further up with an acceleration. We are cautious. This is part of the culture of this organization in replicating that in the second year because a number of these movements are due to clients going ahead of the expected normalization of rates and rebalancing their portfolio. So when this rebalancing will finish and what comes next is now speculation. So we think it is the prudent things to do to not double the first half into a second one in terms of fee. Therefore, we keep it unchanged with, I would say, an upside risk. Which goes back to the cushion, more than the cushion, I would refer you to what we did in '21, to what we did in '22, to what we did in '23. We have a tendency to exceed our guidance, and we have a tendency to also put down the foundation to continue to grow from what becomes then a pretty high bar. And at this point in time, the right thing to do is to tell you, we are going to be above €8.5 billion. We are going to beat the 16.5% return on tangible equity. We are going to beat on cost, but how much is premature, because we would like to use some of that, as you called it, cushion, to potentially further propel the profitability that is already quite ambitious for '25, '26 and beyond. So it's not a -- there is a cushion. It's very difficult for us to tell you what is the number. What the numbers that we can give you, but maybe not number, but direction we can give you, is that if I take away what you call a cushion, the underlying is obviously marching well above €8.5 billion and well above 16.5%. With respect to Russia, we continue to compress the franchise there. And we have had a number of legal cases like everybody else. This one is, just to be clear, has -- is the last one in terms of guarantees that we provided over the last significant ones. And again, we are not sure of the outcome. The outcome could be, a, that we get hit; b, but legally, we have claim on the clients we guaranteed it is premature to tell you that. So -- but for the time being, Russia has demonstrated that it had significant buffers without touching our overall overlays to absorb the shock. So Russia is not driving what we're saying about net profit and return on tangible equity.",

In terms of trend we saw in the quarter an increase of around 1% in Italy and Eastern Europe and around 3% up in Germany and Central Europe. Now if you look all in all, the deposit cost, the deposit costs didn't move up so much. So we are dealing with a few basis points when you're looking at the absolute amount. The composition is there is very different because in Italy, we have a 95% side deposit, while take, for example, Germany or Central Europe, we have 55% and 60%, respectively. That means that the reduction of the Euribor and the connected repricing will happen especially in Germany and in Austria. How long does it take? I mean, it will be already in the second part of the year, consider that the average maturity of term deposit is a range between 3 months and 5 months. So taking that in consideration with a slight delay, we will have repricing down. So what we can expect in overall cost of deposit, absolute rate at year end, below the level of second quarter.",

So Germany and Central Europe benefit much less and are much more sensitive going up because they reprice quickly. Hence, the pass-through that is so high.

For ordinary distribution, at least 90% of net profit, and secondly, not exceeding our organic capital generation because we think that, that is the prudent things to do for ordinary. What we do with strongly, i.e., the excess capital is on top and separate. And to date, we have never used our excess capital to pay our distribution. We have actually accumulated more of it. So I would say that the distribution for the end of the year will be consistent with those metrics and therefore, depending on where we land in terms of net profit and organic capital generation, we will act accordingly on the ordinary side. On the nonordinary side, i.e., the excess capital that is a judgment call, and we have told you that between '24 and '27, we will either deploy it or return it in full. We also told you that this year, we're targeting €8.6 billion of distributions based on the metrics that I just gave you of net profit and organic capital generation and that we feel that we can repeat that or exceed it in '25, in '26 -- and in '26. And we stay firm on those numbers. As of today, we have accrued 100% of our net profit, so not 90%, 100%, €5.25 billion, but 60% of the €8.6 billion we wanted to distribute. And obviously, we've done that with an organic capital generation that exceeds that. That's why our CET1 has moved up year-on-year or has moved up since the end of the year where we were at 15.9%.

But are there things you'd be able to do to the UniCredit systems now inside the group that perhaps you were a bit -- were a bit too difficult to do previously? And then second, clearly, is running well ahead of where you target it in the medium term?

So if we think about the financial guardrails of any potential acquisition, could that greater than 15% RoTE hurdle rate be adjusted higher if your view on the medium-term returns for UniCredit turns more constructive, i.e., does better organic performance today raise the bar on what you look for in potential deals tomorrow?",

    "text": "So Chris, let me take in reverse order. I think I'm already criticized enough to be to discipline on M&A. If you want to increase my hurdle rate, you will have to deal with a lot of people. But that said, we think we can beat now seriously the 15% over a cycle. And it is clear that when we look and when we are accountable to our shareholders, we look at the returns -- the risk returns of buying back our own stock versus what we get through acquisitions, and we take a balanced view. It is also true that if you continue to buy your own stock and never grow, we are growing at the moment, but never grow through in organic growth, at one point, you stop growing. And therefore, we're not there. We are actually quite far from there, but we always balance these things. So I would say that we remain constructive on M&A, but we remain very disciplined on M&A. And more than the hurdle rates, I would say that with normalization of rates and provisions, we believe that not everyone has done the hard work in terms of taking integration costs on to improve their efficiency in terms of building overlays, in terms of investing in technology, in terms of a lot of things. And therefore, if profit -- if that comes through in the numbers, and valuation align or diverge in a positive fashion, then M&A will be more possible. With respect to more generally Vodeno and Aion, first thing, that I would say is the biggest mistake we could make is to integrate Vodeno and Aion. There would be nothing left. We are a phenomenal bank, but we are also a large monster. They are an agile speed boat and they should remain this way, and we will respect that. It will, however, give us a proprietary technology that has successfully transitioned a legacy bank, small one, to a new set of technology and to a new core. At this point in time, we do not expect to touch our core, too difficult, too complex and too many banks involved. We are only continuing internally to pursue our strategy and our plan to evolve all the aspects of our technology and our data and make it a competitive advantage, and we are confident we can do that. We expect to Vodeno, Aion, it is what I have said it is. We now have a proprietary cutting-edge technology, cloud-based for core banking. We also have a very flexible product suite with the ability to add new products on that core banking technology very cheaply. And together with Aion, that allows us to credibly and I underline profitably, enter -- so it's not a revenue gain, it's a profitability gain, to enter new market and be credible when we say this is a return on investment of more than 15% over the next 3 to 5 years. Something we would not have been able to do with the main bank. So as I said, consider it as 14 banks with a lot of greenfield startup opportunity but can further drive our growth. And combined with 200 engineers who have been extremely successful in building a cutting-edge technology that will allow us to not only trade that technology, not only to sell it as a service to fintech and other smaller banks, but also most importantly, challenge and help us drive improvement into our own bank, but not integrated in it, separate from it.",

    "text": "So -- and let me start with the second one, and then I'll pass it to Stefano. So on the cost guidance, what we have said at the end of last year is that, and I underline that, in spite of inflation, wage drift and a determination to keep our level of investments, we could commit to keep our cost flat on the perimeter that existed obviously from 2023 to 2026. Now broadly flat, flat. So that guidance has not changed. As you will notice, we're well ahead of our guidance as of today because we're not broadly flat. We're down 1.2% and accelerated to down 1.7% in the quarter. So our cost control at the moment is excellent, and I'm very satisfied with it. And we haven't touched our investments. So where we're going to go at the moment, we're still guiding for broadly flat to 2026 on the numbers we had in 2023. Whether we do better than that, it's too early to say. We are in the second quarter of the year. It is premature. And the only reason why we say experiment changes, it's obvious. Vodeno and Aion comes in, if we have significant growth opportunities, and we decided to take them we are going to adjust everything, but it will be with a return on investment overall in excess of 15%. We cannot guess all of that at the moment. With respect to the net revenue guidance, I would say the following. We are prudent. I would say that our net revenue guidance has upside risk. It has upside risk on net NII because while we haven't changed the guidance of cost of risk from below 20 basis points, below 20 basis points does not mean 19. Below 20 basis points mean below 20 basis points. 0 is below 20 basis points, 10 is below 20 basis points, 15 is below 20 basis points. We haven't updated it because, again, it is premature to give you a number that we can stand solid on it and beat, and therefore, we will probably update that by the third quarter. If you take our fees, as we said, we are well ahead of our trend line. But there are too many positive wins that are propelling that, rebalancing our portfolios, upfront fees, renegotiation of certain contracts, for us to tell you what is the underlying sustainable trend line for that. But if you take those numbers, they are significantly ahead. And thirdly, if you take NII even without the cost of risk, the reduction is significantly less than what we expected. So what we are doing at the moment is to tell you, look, it would be superficial for us to give you a new number without having more time to observe the trends and more solidity to back that number. But if you ask me what is the direction of travel today, of course, we are well ahead of what our guidance is today.",

I mean your NII has increased only 65%, as you mentioned on the slide and deposit pass-through is higher in Germany, Austria, just trying to think about how resilient that can be going forward as a result? And how quickly -- I mean what assumption can we use for '25, '26 in deposit pass-through for Germany and Austria, given it's at 46% right now? My second question is on cost. Andrea, you mentioned in the past, more cost savings potential for the headquarters. I just wanted to check whether that -- this is already covered by the restructuring charges you booked in 2023 or so far? Or should we expect more restructuring charges to be booked by the end of this year?",

    "text": "So I'll start and Stefano will give more precision. Let me start with cost. So what we're doing in cost is fully consistent to what we have been doing for the last 3 years. The fact that it came in the press was to clarify a number of perceptions, but we are executing as we had planned to execute year after year. So when we talk about, we will keep our cost broadly flat to the exit of 2023, notwithstanding which drift inflation and investment. I assure you we need to pedal very hard to do that. I don't think that there are many banks that are going to be capable to do that, especially coming from 2 years of uninterrupted decrease of cost quarter after quarter, while most of the industry has gone up. So we can do it, but it is hard. And at the moment, I would just say that we're just executing on what we're doing. If we find further opportunity to go beyond what we have promised, i.e., broadly flat to the end of '22, 2023, if we find them, and it's becoming harder because it requires much more granular organization redesign, process redesign, automation, improvement of a number of things in technology. But if we find them, and there is a justified return, but like everything else needs to exceed 15% by us taking integration cost, like we have taken them in '23 and '22 and '21 in the fourth quarter, we will consider to do that. And I think it's the right thing to do to then further propel '25 and '26 and '27. With respect to more generally on NII and everything else, I would just open with 2 things. The first thing, while we start from Italy, where a pan-European bank, why is that important? Because our NII sensitivity is way more aligned with European banks than it is with Italians. We -- Italians have been over 100% sensitivity. We've been around 50%, like Europeans. But if you are less sensitive on the way up, you're also less sensitive on the way down. And that's why I think some of the numbers that you're seeing are more resilient than we all thought they would be. The second thing is countries like Germany or Central Europe, have benefited a lot less than 50% from the rising rates. But at the same time, they will reprice and they will suffer a lot less from the decline in rates. So what you see of UniCredit is a bring to bear of all of these things together. And it is a little bit too early to say how it's going, but for the time being, our NII is being more resilient. Now let's never forget two things that where we are in the trend of -- in the level of rates. And I don't know what you forecast. But if you're looking at an exit of 2.25, 2.5 and a pass-through that will normalize, the hurdle that we all need to fight against is quite high. I would finish with one last thing because we insist on it because we think it's very important, maybe not everybody finds it important. The profitability as NII as a line item, so of lending as a line item is often overlooked. And we looked at the overall profitability. But if a bank has 60%, 70%, 80%, 75% of NII, and is actually subsidizing the rest of the business by going below the cost of equity or by not maximizing the profitability of NII by going on volume. I could get you higher NII in terms of volume, you will see declining return on tangible, reclining organic capital generation, declining distribution over time. We're not doing that. But that also means that we have drawn less than others or than what we could have done and that puts us in a more resilient position than others. The final thing is we've discussed it many times, the lending mix, which is another thing you should all consider. We started with a lending mix that was secured from a risk standpoint, but with a return on that lending that was way subpar. We have moved that mix. What have we done? For example, in Italy, we have deemphasized mortgages. We have pushed on consumer. We've pushed on SMEs. Obviously, that means that your volumes are growing less because mortgages, large corporates are large volumes. SMEs, consumer are small volume. However, you're shifting your portfolio to something a lot more resilient and where margins are much higher. We've been doing that for 2 years, and we're doing it this year. And when we exit, we hope that the renewed growth now no longer net of what we're not doing on the large volumes item and the profitability will emerge in our P&L. So all of these pieces are getting organized to try and minimize the impact of our net revenues because we recognize that while we have the other lines positive, like cost, like cost of risk, et cetera, et cetera, we cannot compensate only with those lines, what will happen when rates normalize and cost of risk normalize, which is why we all are looking forward to the challenge and the competition of how we deal with that versus the sector.",

    "text": "So adding some data points, sensitivities. Solid sensitivities in relation to interest income are confirmed. So the interest rate-related one, plus minus 25 basis points at €140 million. And you can also expect such a sensitivity to be slightly lower during the course of '25 as highlighted by Andrea. The deposit pass-through sensitivity, 1 percentage point confirmed at €130 million. With regards to Germany and Austria, I mentioned before, let's say, the deposit pass-through either ratio between the client rate and the short-term interbank rate that is around 46 basis points. Let's translate that into basis point number. So in Germany, the cost of our deposit is slightly below 200 basis points. In Italy, it's close to 60 basis points. This makes the difference. So that's why the repricing possibility that we have in Germany and also Austria are higher. Now you need to look with a pinch of salt in relation to the deposit pass-through because when the rates will go down, technically speaking, the deposit pass-through will go up, right? And then after a while, we will reprice down. This will be especially important for Germany and Austria because of the term deposit component, it will be less likely by definition to something like that in Italy because, as commented, we are already close to 60 basis points. So there is not much room to repricing down. In relation to Germany and Austria, as I told you, we are expecting to have a level of cost for the deposit lower, in the case of Germany, lower than 190, the deposit pass-through expected for '25, it will be slightly higher because there will be a part of the deposit that we cannot reprice and as a cost of that, the deposit pass-through is slightly higher. But having said that, the overall interest expenses on deposits that we will have in Germany and Austria '25 will be definitely lower.",

    "text": "So thank you, Azzurra. So as you have seen, our NII profitability all the way down, so also net of provision is about 20% at the moment or is in excess. We still have about 20% of our book that has still not migrated to above cost of equity. We started with the large majority of our book. We have about 20% of our book that has not migrated. So in the next, I would say, 18 months we will never get to 100%. It's just not feasible, but we will finish that migration, and we'll have a book that is a lot higher profitability, a lot more resilient, and we will not have the grind that we have experienced from obviously many times exiting lending position that were not meeting our hurdle. With rest to asset quality. I would just say that it's premature to say how much below 20 basis points we're going to land. You are correct. Our NPEs have improved, both gross and net our coverage has improved, and we are having a positive stage migration again and write-backs as we have kept being prudent in the way we were provisioning. So there is a point where even if you have provision for caution, if your clients repays you, you get back the provisions. So I think we are, at the moment, experiencing that positive trend. So the only thing on asset quality, in my opinion, is the issue that at some point, all of these write-backs will finish because we will continue to provision conservatively. But I think in the past, we were way more worried about the future, and we provisioned a lot, and this little by little are coming back, but we will be more orderly. At the same time, we have less necessity to be cautious because of the quality of our portfolio and because we still carry I think, well over €1.7 billion of overlays. That's what it is, therefore, to avoid us having bad surprises or to release it if bad surprises don't come. Maybe Stefano wants to add?",

    "text": "So we -- so overlays in inverted commas, \"Don't have a hard deadline. What they have is a causality.\" You take an overlay over a specific potential risk. We took quite a few on COVID. We've then took quite a few on the geopolitical situation with secondary effect from the invasion of Ukraine, et cetera, et cetera. So they have a cause. So you say, fundamentally, my models are backward looking. They are great, but there are certain aspects of forward-looking but are not fully captured by our models, let's be cautionary -- let's use caution and create some provision in case the effect. Once that item does not occur or it's clear that it's not occurring, you need to release the overlays. Obviously, the item occurs, you release the overlays. So either you release the overlays because the item occur and you're covering it, or you release the overlay because the item does not occur, and then it propels your returns. What we have been doing over the last 3 years, not because necessarily proactively, but just because of the volatility and the uncertainty of the future is every time a causality of an overlay led to release, and in most cases, it was a release without the risk occurring. There were other reasons why we should create new overlays. And therefore, we have pushed in time, the overlay. So consider it this way, we had plenty of overlays for COVID. When the impact from COVID did not occur. Well, for example, Russian invaded Ukraine and we had other risk, and we move those -- that causality into a new causality, but now it's kind of stabilizing. So in the next, I would say -- I don't think, for the time being, but hopefully, I'm not proven wrong, but I don't think for the time being that the second half of this year will lead to a significant release of overlays. That means that we have €1.7 billion that should be released between '25 and '26 in my opinion. It's quite difficult to see with a stabilizing environment that we can carry them anywhere further. So either potential worries occur, and we will have the buffer, or the potential worries do not occur, and we will have a propelling effect by abating our cost of risk, and it will go into the bottom line. That's why we call it a line of defense that can protect or propel. With respect to transformation, as we said, we are a transformed bank. We've done a lot. I think we're about -- we're more than halfway through. There we continue to challenge everything that we do, how we do it, to see if we can do it more efficiently, more effectively better. We continue to challenge what we do in terms of investing in our product factories, in our frontline, in our distribution channel, in our branches, both physical and nonphysical. We're now going to get to challenge what we can do organically to grow with Aion and Vodeno. So as we go through that process and I think what is right, what is impressive is the culture of UniCredit that keeps on challenging what we do and seeing if we can do it better. We find new things that we said, why didn't I think about this earlier. We should change it, we should improve it. And when we found those new things, we obviously need to invest into making the improvement, either it's an investment in, I don't know, writing-off some old technology and implementing new one, or it is about prevention some people and hire some more young people, or it is about preempting the investment in launching a new digital bank or whatever it is. When we have those things, we do, do the broad category of integration cost. We usually culminate in that thinking at the end of the year just because we -- it's difficult to do it while we're flying. And therefore, if you go back and you look, we have done integration cost in '21, we have done integration cost in '22. We have done integration cost in '23. As we became better and better anticipating and investing to push the bank further. We are working hard on seeing whatever levers and whatever things we can find. And if we find them, we will take some integration cost. There is one commitment that does not move. We will make more than €8.5 billion net profit. And we will make at least a 16.5% return on tangible. And we will distribute at least €8.6 billion. So we will not put these things at risk. But the magnitude of the beat because beat there will be is determined by how much we are going to be able to support and continue growing in '25, '26 and '27. And part of that is taking certain charges or making some investment or doing things that are all included in the integration cost line.",

    "text": "So I'll start with the second one. No. It is -- so the organic capital generation is not chemistry. The organic capital generation is where do you grow. How profitably do you grow? So for example, if tomorrow -- the more we increase the mix in our revenues to fees, the more organic capital generation increases because fees do not require capital. So it's net profit that goes directly to the bottom line. With fees doing that well, implicitly, our organic capital generation increases. Secondly -- the second point which I keep on hammering is the profitability of NII, not the volume of NII, the profitability of NII. If my profitability of NII increases while I am using capital, I am generating a lot more than my profitability of NII decreases. You're looking at the profitability of our NII is increasing. And therefore, the combination of an NII that maybe in volume, you see the same volume or decline in volume, and you say, well, it's the same. No, it's not the same because if for the same volume I have a more profitable NII, I'm generating a lot more capital. So more capital with profitability of NII, more capital with fees. That is improving the healthiness of our organic capital generation and profitability. At the same time, in certain cases, for example, to increase the profitability of NII, we are exiting loans that are, let's say, subpar in terms of profitability. In that case, the exit of loan releases capital because we're no longer lending. We lose the revenue, but we are disproportionately impacting positively the capital. So this trajectory continues to bring home results. What I have said before is that there is a point where the entire organic capital generation is going to be linked to the quality of a net profit and no longer to the exit of subpar loans because we will be at optimal and that will happen somewhere in the next 18 months. So organic capital generation, we have will trend line and then stop at a hopefully small discount to the net profit we do in the year. But I do think that -- so can there be more RWA reductions in the second part of the year? Yes, because we continue to grind through nonprofitable exposures. And we're doing everything we can to take this year all the things that we need to take in terms of efficiency. So when Basel IV rolls in next year, we start from a higher capital level as we possibly can. I'll leave the rest to Stefano?",

I think in your remarks this morning to the media, you've also talked about this being a long process and you've cautioned it will take time and you want to convince Commerzbank stakeholders that M&A can create value, sort of implying that not all of the stakeholders are on the same page. Now, we're talking about an intra-market deal and I think it's important not just for UniCredit and Commerzbank, but for Europe as a whole in terms of signaling.

So I think there are a number of stakeholders that are critical to the success of the transaction. First and foremost, the employee representatives in Germany, but also German institution, German clients, German public opinion. So it takes time for the facts to sink and for all of these constituencies to being able to discuss openly what a transaction would mean. And therefore, it's very premature to discuss anything about that. There isn't anything on the table at the moment. There never was. At the moment, what there is, is an investor that has bought 21% and is very keen that that investment yields positively to us. But the process of engaging with all the key stakeholders will take some time.

In relation to the commercial trend, we are expecting all-in-all a stability of volumes, both on loans and deposit side, with a slight increase in the credit spread. So we have already experienced during this quarter an increase in the credit spread. We are also expecting a slight increase in the credit spread next year. Just a reminder, one basis point increase in the credit spread for us is around EUR 40 million more net interest income.

    "text": "So Germany, first of all, important to take into consideration that German asset quality and also default rate this quarter has been impacted by a big ticket. We experienced in the nine months the impact arriving from a couple of big tickets. The overall cost of risk of Germany in the quarter was around 16 basis points. When we look to the default rate, the default rate was above one, including this effect of this ticket. So it was around 1.4. But indeed, if you are taking into consideration the default rate here to-date, adjusted for these big tickets, that's a large corporate, the default rate is below one. So it's 0.7. So in a way, is in line with the same trend of last year. So this is confirming that overall the performance of the portfolio is not deteriorating. So we're not seeing such a deterioration. Like, let's say in other countries, we do have overlays in Germany as well. The overall stock overlays is remaining flat at the end of this quarter to around EUR 1.7 billion. In relation to the impact that they are having from strategic transactions, so I will start from this quarter. So in this quarter, we had around 26 basis points in terms of impact that are coming from strategic transactions. Slightly more than 10 basis points is connected with Commerzbank. Around 15 basis points is connected to the commitment that we have to purchase Aion/Vodeno, Allianz Life in Italy, and Alpha in Romania. We will have further impacts deriving from this acquisition in Q4 and during the course of 2025. In Q4, such an impact can arrive up to 30 basis points, deriving fundamentally from the finalization of Alpha in Romania and from Aion/Vodeno. Aion/Vodeno can also cross the year, but currently we're assuming to have the impact by year end. Next year we will have the finalization of the internalization of the insurance. We will have until the full application of the Danish compromise, a further impact for around 20 basis points. That will be completely offset by the application of the Danish compromise.",

    "text": "So, I will start from the second. So in relation to the impacts from rates that are having -- the effect on profitability, for sure there will be an impact. But let's consider the impact they're having from the strategy. So, the strategy is assuming a further increase in fees for the group, but for Italy as well, coped with a lending that is a profitable lending. So, we have commented more than once the net interest income return on capital. So, we will have an impact in Italy deriving from the Euribor reduction. All in all, this will impact the net interest income. However, we're expecting to have a revenue to risk weighted asset average above 9% also from 2025 onwards. In relation to the lending trends and also the expectation of the lending trend for the future, let's start from this quarter. So this quarter, the average loan stock was down around 3 billion. More specifically, a part of that was Russia. So 700 of that was Russia. We grew more than one in Eastern Europe, and we had a reduction in Germany and in Italy. The reduction is mainly on the corporate side, and the phenomenon is also different in comparison to what we experienced in the first part of the year. The expectation is connected to the level of the rates and the GDP, in the sense that on the level of the rates, we have already commented before, that's positive for the lending. The GDP in the Western Europe countries, we believe, will be around one. So, all in all, we are expecting a stability in the stock of lending with demand growing up, especially on the short term and progressively during 2025 or some of the medium term. We will grow in Central and Eastern Europe, where we are expecting more stability in terms of dynamic of the stock in Italy and Germany. The improvement in the demand for credit, we will believe it will be progressive. So it will not be sharp immediately after the reduction of the rates, but it will be progressive during the course of 2025.",

So this is around EUR 40 million. Then there is close to EUR10 million effect deriving from some write-backs on non-performing loans that positively impacted the quarter. However, I have to say that there was also a positive trend from the commercial perspective, especially when we are looking to the pricing.

So, my view is that there are some things where we could all argue that the RWE density is excessive, etc. This is one where we have an advantage and it all balances. But if it becomes too much, I think we can see repercussions. That would be my view of it. So we are internalizing insurance, these bank insurance activities, they have a certain dynamic, and within the broader risk profile of a group, it works. I think if that starts becoming excessive, we may have regulators taking a different position on it, but this is just a perception for me. With respect to Germany, definitely within one year.",

So on the investment side, on financing and advisory side, and also the client hedging fee. All in all, in the client hedging fee, I have to say that apart from some volatility deriving from some specific moment or some quarters, all in all, we're able to generate a pretty, let's say, resilient stock of fees over time. In relation to the dynamic in future, we are expecting that apart from the volatility deriving from the market and the rebalancing of the portfolio by the clients, that will affect the investment fees. If you look at the investment fees and the gross sales, this year on average, we have done by quarter around EUR 13 billion of gross sales in every quarter, right? So quarter one, quarter two, quarter three. I don't believe that we can have a repetition of that, let's say, every year. Having said that, the stock of the asset under management will grow, and so the asset under management fee will grow up. In relation to the other component, we are expecting a contribution from advisory financing also during the course of 2025 and 2026. And the client hedging fees, as I told you, apart from general effect deriving from volatility, we believe that thanks to increasing the perimeter coverage of the clients, we can also assume a growth rate in 2025 in relation to the specific items. Having said that, we believe that there are items like non-life insurance and payments that can generate an higher growth in comparison to client hedging fee.",

    "text": "Let me take the other two. So capital, a few things. One, my conviction is that you don't make profitability and distribution by leveraging your capital. So you will always have us as on the conservative end of the capital in terms of CET1. Then two considerations, however. The first consideration is Balfour. The most of our Balfour impact is operational risk. But if you think about it, we have the same operational risk today that we will have next year and the years after that. The operational risk today is evaluated through advanced models and through a historic series that put it quite low. It is, if I may, artificial, but it gets boosted so much in a standardized way, and it doesn't differentiate between institutions. So like-for-like, my 12.5, 13 should be 60, 70 basis points lower. We're not doing that, but just for you to understand how we think about it. With respect to a larger acquisition, again, we would not leverage ourselves to do an acquisition. Over time, we need to look at what is the right capital for the business. And we note that some competitors are at 12 or just at 12. Some others are 12.5. We have not had to address that issue because we've been so much higher than where we were targeting. But, I think these are all considerations. But the pressure of, we need to get to certain profitability or we need to get to certain distribution, therefore we take capital down and we leverage is not going to be one that we do. On distributions, first of all, there is no deal on the table. Second of all, quite difficult to have a crystal ball of what the deal could be. I would go with principles which usually are more binding than the numbers. We're very committed to rewarding our shareholders. We understand that the level of distribution is a key driver. And whatever we do should be viewed in a way that within a realistic period of time, our distribution on a per share basis go up, not down. Because otherwise, as we all went through school in finance, why would we do that if the cash flows or the dividends declined? Okay, it would be a destruction of value. So, we're very committed to giving a best in class distribution to our shareholders. But best in class distribution was mostly share buyback in the first three years of activity because we viewed so much on express value in our shares that, in my opinion, it was a no brainer. As we move up and the rate of growth is less, we have gradually tilted towards cash dividends because it is probably better reflective of a sustainable growth path that we want to have going forward. And that concept will remain. Now, to answer your question more directly, we will do everything we can do to not dilute well. Firstly, we do that acquisition, our dividend payout does not move. It's 50%, it stays 50%. Secondly, we will do everything we can to maintain the dividend per share to at least equal to what we have before the acquisition. That does not mean we will succeed in year one, but we're very, very confident we can do that or better in year two and beyond. Thirdly, with respect to the share buyback, I'll give you an alternative interpretation. Until today, we've done share buybacks. Why? We've done share buybacks to reduce the share count at an attractive rate and propel furthers the EPS and the DPS going forward. Right. So we've done that to inject more growth into our EPS and our DPS. But there is an alternative view of things. I could keep the share count stable and increase further my EPS and DPS by having more earnings and more dividends. An acquisition is the use of my excess capital, and to a certain extent, it could also be the use of some of my share buyback at the initial point to buy more earnings, which generates more dividend and therefore propel my EPS and DPS. So it's just an alternative view of things. When we stabilize, let's take it like that. And I tell people that if they talk to me about five years or whatever, I'm not listening. For me, stabilize is year two onward. The first year is always a little bit like that. When we stabilize, our philosophy of distributions should not move a lot, which means we will have distribution that are a high percentage of a net income generated. In which mix? Well, we will see what is best for our shareholders. Is it 50% cash dividend and 50% share buyback? Is it 60% cash dividend and 40% share buyback? I cannot say. Today, it's too much speculation. But I think if you look at the principle I know and the management team and the board know full well that we have a distribution policy. It needs to be defended, and if we find a way to strengthen the bank, grow the bank, and improve the distribution policy a little bit later by taking maybe a little bit of uncertainty in the year one, that is something we can do. If it takes more than that, this touches on our strict criteria of investment. And we will not do that. And I hope that that answers your question.",

    "text": "So I will give you a broad picture. And I'm sure Stefano will add. So, organic capital generation, the organic capital generation comes from two sources. One is, let's call it commercial or current. And that is the earnings quality. If I go for volume in NII, I will not have a lot of capital generation. If I have more fee-to-revenue, I will have a lot of capital generation. So, what we have done in these last four years is to improve the profitability of NII to prepare for a time when, due to rates decline and cost of risk increase, NII will be contributing less to our profitability, because obviously we will be making a lower margin in general. And we have also done that by continuously increasing our fees, because fees have a one-to-one capital generation. That's the commercial one. The commercial one will slightly tilt in the future. On the one hand, you're going to have the exact mirror image of what you've had in the last four years. In these last four years, most European banks have had declining volume, increasing margin. That is paradise for capital generation. As rates go down, you're going to have increasing volume and decreasing margin. This is how it goes exactly in the opposite direction, i.e., in order to maintain, you need to do more volume, to do more volume, you're consuming more capital. Where we come from, we're declining, so we consume less capital, but the margin is carrying the revenue to RWAs. Every bank will have pressure on revenue to RWAs going forward. We think that that pressure we can minimize by the mix of client and product. So, moving the mix of product towards consumer, away from mortgages, allows us to have more insulation in the margin, which allows us to be less hit by a compression of margins that would happen later. So, we've worked on that on one side. On the fees, obviously, the more fees you have as a total of revenue, those are capital neutral, and those generate one-to-one. So, this is the commercial and how you do it. So, if you look at the commercial for the next three years, the overall revenue, making EUR 1 of revenue or EUR 1 revenue, it will generate less capital organically than what it has generated in the past three years. That's true from everybody. Our job is to minimize that less. Then there is another driver. The other driver that we had was that in 2021, we had a very inefficient portfolio of lending and usage of capital. And over the last four years, we have made it more and more and more and more efficient. So now, I would say that most of our lending book is adjusted for risk above the cost of equity. I would say probably 70%, 75% of it. Can we take it to 80%, 85%? Yes. Can we take it to 100%? No. It's never the case because you will have decision on, I'll do this loan to this client. It's below my cost of equity, but I'll give him three years to mature because I want the growth, et cetera. So, the advantage we have been crystallizing through that is going to run to zero. When will it run to zero? Well, it depends, but we think that by the end of 2025, we're probably done with that. So, that extra boost that has allowed us to do something that seems to defy gravity, i.e. generate more capital than our net income, is going to converge down from ‘26 onward. However, because there is always a however, Stefano will also give you a view on infamous DTAs, which are going to be capital positive from sometime in 26 for the next two or three years. And so, the relay from the portfolio, from the old portfolio, will be taken by the crystallization of the value on capital of the DTAs. And this is a good point to pass it to Stefano.",

    "text": "So, some data points. ‘24, the organic capital generation is around 400 basis points adjusted for extraordinary transactions. So, not taking into consideration extraordinary transactions. After this, more than 300 is the profit, and then the balance is a risk-weighted asset. When we look to 2025, as we have already highlighted, both for 2025 and 2026, we are guiding for a profit. So, our ambition is to have a profit of above nine. So, we have an organic capital generation from the profit above 300 basis points. As highlighted by Andrea, during the course of 2025, we are expecting to be able to generate further capital via the management of the risk-weighted asset of the portfolio. This should be able to compensate some model changes effect and the potential growth that are in front of the business, so from the lending. In relation to the model changes, we are expecting to have a few billions that are in front of the model changes in terms of the risk-weighted asset increase in Q4, and a few billions also during the course of 2025. Having said that, this amount, as highlighted, will be offset by the active portfolio management action that we will put in place. From 2026 onwards, we are in a way a target, i.e. something more than 300 basis points of capital generated by the profit, and active portfolio management action that should be, to a lower extent, able to fund the growth of the lending, but the difference is not meaningful in terms of basis points difference. With regards to DTAs, where the benefit to the capital from DTAs is coming from? It's coming from utilization of tax loss carry forward. Currently, we have recognized in our balance sheet around 3.4 billion of assets that are related to tax loss carry forward. When we are going to utilize these assets, we are going to have not anymore in the balance sheet an asset that is deducted from the capital. All in all, the contribution to the common equity Tier 1 starting from next year can be between 15 and 20 basis points of contribution to the common equity Tier 1 ratio, positive per year. Again, the reason is source is, utilization of the tax loss carry forward DTAs that we have is fundamental in Italy. Positive effect is between 15 and 20 basis points per year starting from 2025 onwards.",

    "text": "So let me start with Commerzbank. So I think let's not confuse two different things. The first one is we have asked the ECB for authorization to move our participation in Commerzbank from 9.5% to up to a maximum of 29.9%, which is the level before you need to launch a bid. We would not be able to move or to convert what you call financial instruments into physical shares or into having the physical shares under our control until we have ECB approval. ECB approval takes 60 days, but the 60 days gets stopped every time there is a new question or there is a new doubt or whatever, and we need to give them back. So, they're not 60 days, they're actually longer. If you tell me when the process will be finished, I will tell you when we move on the financial instrument. I don't know. I don't think at this point in time it makes much of a difference, because at some point within the time that interests us, we will have “control of the shares and everything else”. The second thing that is important is that this is a process that we started to have maximum flexibility. But if there were a process for an acquisition, that follows a completely different process. So, fundamentally, this current ECB approval is not relevant for a full bid on Commerzbank. If we were to do that, that will follow a completely different process, which may go in parallel after, before the 29.9% approval. So the two are not on the critical path of each other. Then I just said, with respect to Investor Day, that given that we believe that the two banks are the mirror image of each other, and we're pretty convinced of what can be done, we are quite interested as a shareholder that has a lot of money on the plate to see what the Investor Day will deliver on bridging some, all, or more than all of the gap that Commerzbank has with HVB in Germany. The second question, the second question, cost of risk and overlays. So, firstly, on cost of risk, we have said that we are confident we can maintain a cost of risk of 20 to 25 basis points through the cycle. Clearly, at the moment, we're running a lot lower. In keeping the cost of risk at 20 to 25 basis point through the cycle, we said that there could be two scenarios to simplify. Scenario A, we have all, particularly I, been too nervous about the credit cycle in Europe, and it's relatively benign. If it is relatively benign, we will be able to keep the cost of risk of our group to 20% to 25%, either not touching or touching the overlays to a minimum level or to a limited level. In this case, we would still need to release them because the overlays are tied, very strictly tied to specific event and to specific situations. And therefore, you would have a profitability of the bank that is actually propelled by the release of the lion's share of the overlays. In the other scenario, which is the other extreme, that the credit cycle is, as we all think, going to be a little bit more daunting. If that is the case, we will cover the 20 to 25 basis points of cost of risk for the cycle through normal LLPs through the years. And the excess, the 20% to 25%, would be insured by releasing the overlays on those situations that we have already identified. So, really, you have really two situations. Above and beyond the fact that we believe that the quality of our loan portfolio is quite good and we've really scrubbed it a and that our ordinary provisions on the conservative side, so we are confident. If the credit cycle is very negative, then we have the overlays to keep it at 20% to 25%. If it's relatively mild, then the overlays still need to be released. But instead of going to cover the excess provision, they will go directly to the bottom line to propel our net income. This is why, when we talked about idiosyncratic accelerator, we use line of defense as one of them, because the overlays will either ensure that our cost of risk is below most of our peers, other peers, or if that's not necessary, propel directly the bottom line by being released. I hope I make sense.",

If you go through the time line, that takes you through 3, 4, 5 quarters, depending what you assume.

The Basel impact on the full year, taking consideration the mitigating actions that we will perform during the course of the year, will be around €12 billion. So that's the reason why the full year impact is around 60 basis points of common equity tier 1 ratio. Then we have model changes during the course of 2025 are primarily related to multinational clients and [indiscernible] model locally from an overall amount of around €8 billion during the course of primarily first half of 2025.

In '25, we will do more than €7 billion of active portfolio management action, including also securitization.

    "text": "Okay. All right. So I like to dream, but you have a calculator, you can get to your own numbers. What I can tell you is that we have just committed to pay in excess of €9 billion per year for 3 years. And we confirm that we are returning the entire $6.5 billion of excess capital by '27. That's also within 3 years. I think it's a little bit more than a dream. Let's put it this way. The second thing is, yes, this is the base case. So as you can say, and I underscore that, because given the excitement that M&A brings everybody tends to deviate. And I remind everybody that everybody tended to deviate the first day I got here. And I think you would agree that not doing M&A got us quite far. This is the same for the next 3 years. The difference is that we now have 2 possibilities on the table, but there is no way that we will risk derailing what we feel is an exciting plan that combines profitable growth higher than most of our peers and distribution definitely higher than most of our peers to do M&A at the wrong terms or in the wrong way or at the wrong price. So this is the premise, and I want to make it clear. So that then brings you to your question, well, if you do M&A, what happens to our distribution, et cetera. At the moment, I can only give you what I have for certain. So first, 2024 distribution will be done, meaning they will be done just after the M&A complete, one way or the other, because we have committed to them. So what remains to be done in terms of dividend will be done slightly before. What remains to be done in terms of share buyback will be done later because we cannot interfere with our share price during the offer period. Secondly, if we were to do M&A, what is the impact on 2025 distributions in general, okay? So that's the second question. So if we were able to complete BPM, what would happen? My view, nothing would happen, meaning the 2020 -- we have said that we will strive to maintain the dividend per share equal for our shareholders, and that will happen. Secondly, all the planned distribution to shareholders will continue as if the acquisition has not occurred. What you will have is a dilution of your excess capital at the tail of 2027, right? Because we're using some of it, we would be using some of it to do the transaction. But by the time you get to 2027, we are -- we would have fully integrated the bank. It would be more than halfway through getting to the level of performance that we are, and it would positively contribute to our distribution on an organic, recurrent, ordinary fashion. So it's accretive, and that's exactly what we have said we would do. I am not going to speculate on Commerzbank because it's not on the table. And if you think about it, Andrea, if you believe, and I let you decide 3 quarters, 4 quarters, assuming it goes ahead, after that, you should add 9 months. It takes you very quickly into '27. So I know a lot of people are speculating about that, but most of our plan is going to be done without any impact from that. The second thing that I would say is even if we consolidated the stake in '25 because we get authorization to reach the 30% physical shares, but consolidation will only very mildly affect our CET1 ratio, given that it would remain to be hedged. And therefore, the distribution would not be affected by that in the least, okay? The other thing, Russia, let me remember what we said. So I cannot speculate on what may happen or not happen. But you do know the way we have managed the situation, finding the right balance between doing what we felt is right, morally correct and defending the interest of our shareholders and incidentally of our people. We will continue to do so. And therefore, as far as we are concerned, your selling for €1, et cetera. If it's me, unless I'm forced, I will not be selling Russia for €1 or for anything that is not a \"fair price.\" At the moment, I remind you, we have a bank that has less than €1 billion in deposits, less than €1 billion in loans. That is probably a payment reference in corporate, but all within the sanction framework and increasingly under the ECB order, and that focused on euro and U.S. dollar and which is primarily targeted to serving Western clients that still are operating in the country. The retail is being reduced to 0, and this is what we have. Where we go from there will depend on a number of other scenarios, but selling for 0 is not in the card. I also would like to highlight that Russia becomes quite marginal in our numbers. One of the reason why we grow in \"only\" to €10 billion in net profit is because we absorb the entire contribution for Russia during the period. So we are assuming that the contribution will trend to 0 by '27.",

In relation to the DTA, so we have in-balance sheet DTA in relation to Italian perimeter for €4 billion. There is nothing more that we can recognize in Italy. That means that from this moment onwards, it's not a P&L topic. It's a capital topic. So when we will utilize these DTAs, we will generate capital. By when we will do that? We will do that in the course of the next 6 years, which is the overall capital benefit from this is around 140 basis points of capital. In relation to the off-balance sheet DTAs that we can further writing up is around €400 million pertaining to the Austrian perimeter.

So I wonder if your strategy or vision about this with respect to asset management, in particular, has changed in any way? That's my first question. Maybe I can complement that or you can complement the answer by also sharing your views on insurance and why you've decided to cross the 5% stake in Generali ahead of their Board renewal in May. And you've partly answered the second question, which is around your profit aspirations. I think you have clear stand-alone targets, and people will give you credit on delivery. You talked about your vision for UniCredit to become the Bank of Europe's future, which is a project that's taking shape as we speak it's becoming more and more tangible at least versus when you first talked about it.

    "text": "I like the try on the more than €10 billion. So Antonio, let me start with the last one. If -- as I'm sure you have, if you did the numbers on the inertial impact, that we all tend to minimize of rich normalization, cost of risk increase, impact from inflation on cost on European banks, I think you would agree that the number is quite large. So for us, to add to that the additional compression to 0 of Russia and tell you that by '27 we are adding €700 million is, I would say, ambitious and realistic. That does not mean we can't do better, but it does mean that, at this point in time, based on all the uncertainty and the scenarios that we have, we put on the table what believe we can do and then we review if the scenarios improved. Not every bank scenario is as, let's say, demanding as ours in terms of the macro evolution. We believe it will have a very important impact. But what I believe we're not wrong is that whatever the scenario will be, we will do better. I am absolutely confident and determined to do that because of the strengths of the organization, of the reengineering of the organization, of lines of defense, of the clarity and granularity of each single action that every bank, every division, every person has and is executing. So I cannot control the environment. But on parity of environment, I am absolutely confident we will do better than everybody else. So for the time being, €10 billion stays because my best view of the macro environment is one that is quite conservative, and we will operate within that. With respect to -- and then, obviously, if we do M&A, the number moves. But for the time being, let's keep it there. If we do strategy since -- on the factories and savings, et cetera. Firstly, there is an important question out there that some of you or in particularly one person keeps on raising is whether the Danish compromise square is going to have a life or not. I remind everybody that for the time being, it's somewhere in purgatory, it hasn't been confirmed, okay? So as I said at the beginning of a plan, I did not believe into internalizing certain areas of insurance. But if a Danish compromise was going to be passed, we would. It was, we are. Let's see if a Danish compromise square is passed, and then let's review the position. That's number one. Number two, there is a big difference between what we're doing in insurance and what we would be doing in asset management. In insurance, we're processing unit linked and quite standardized and simple products for banks. In asset management, we do not believe we have the scale across products to compete with the leaders in the segment. I don't believe many people have. That does not mean we cannot have some, let's say, focused niches where we do internalize in full. We have that in our asset management company, primarily for Central and Eastern Europe, but now extensively more for the group in Croatia. We do have that in our project with Azimut. If you look at our capability to drive, differentiate on our brand, we've won markets, it speaks by itself. If we were to do an acquisition in Italy and that acquisition came with a factory in asset management, which is quite focused on certain standardized, simpler products that work well in Italy, that would complement that element of internalization. But by and large, if you look at the totality of our masses, the ability to have our own asset manager in-house for everything, I don't think is realistic. Honestly, I don't think it's realistic for any bank in Italy at least. So that, I think, is that. So I think it's a question of degrees. And I would also say that the control, if you want to call it this way, of savings remaining in Italy can be done if the distributor has a very strong position in all the contracts and in all the partnership and in all the way, it allocates those funds. This is what we have today, and therefore, I'm not concerned about that. Why cross 5% of Generali? I could tell you why not, but it's also -- I highlight. We do not only hold what we hold. As UniCredit, we also hold what our clients want to hold. And as a result of all the speculation, our clients are quite active. So I'm just telling you, together with our clients, we've crossed 5%. I mean, if you look at the magnitude of it, we've already spent a lot of time on it. The -- but what is important is that is not industrial. That is not aiming to buy or otherwise engage or whatever. It is a financial stake. It is in our investment portfolio. Because we bought it over several months, we have a significant capital gain. Part of it is hedged, as always. We -- they are a partner in Central and Eastern Europe and in other areas. And it is something that at this point in time makes sense. And for those of you, as I repeated that know me by now, we will not engage in adventures. We will engage in value creation, industrial projects and creating value for shareholders. And that should frame all the question on Generali.",

    "text": "So on BPM, I think we are in the middle of a transaction or of an offer. And therefore, we are limited on what we can share. The transaction has -- or the offer has a time line. We are in the phase where we need to obtain authorization from regulators, from antitrust, golden power, et cetera. And therefore, we are in a situation of hold. There is nothing out of the ordinary into that process, and we are continuing along the time line. We have already set an indication for a potential EGM. It may move forward, backwards depending on the time to obtain those authorization. At the time being, it's our best guess. I -- personally, I think that the government or the leadership of the government was quite clear that they respect market and they respect -- they let it work, and that is what is happening at the moment. With respect to discussion with any non-shareholders, I remind you that we are in an offer, so we need to observe -- we can talk to them, but we need to observe pari-passu and treat them all the same. Credit Agricole is a partner of ours in asset management. It's a partner of ours in custody. It is a partner of ours in a number of places. We have talked to them and that is the extent for the time being. So as we get closer to the offer, maybe, there will be more discussion. But at this time, that is what it is. With respect to net profit, and then I'll pass to Stefan on NII in general, but, look, I think there are a lot of moving parts. In my opinion, if you go from an average Euribor of 3.6% and you dropped to 2.3% or could even drop to 2% or could even drop to 1.8%, for people to say that it will not have an impact on -- a material impact on your NII, particularly in countries where the pass-through has been low, is not realistic. We believe we will have most of our impact in NII will be concentrated in Italy. Hence, our attention to what people say because I do think that if Italy has a very low pass-through and benefit on the way up, just mathematically, it's going to be affected on the way down, okay? Other countries, take, for example, Germany and Austria have a pass-through all already in the 50s because they're, one, is mostly a corporate bank, et cetera. Obviously, they're going to be affected by the declining rate to a much lesser extent because they will manage the margin. And Central and Eastern Europe will grow. So in our profile, if I were to tell you about NII, Italy gets hit. The rest of the group supports and offset parts of that hit. And obviously, Stefan will look at that. But there is another thing that we're doing or we have been doing. I don't think people have picked that up enough is over the last 3, 4 years, when we say that our NII RoAC is highest profitability, it also means that we have cleaned up our underperforming exposures in terms of profitability. That means we don't need to clean them up again. That means that when you look at our growth of NII in the last 3, 4 years, it is net of the cleanup we did in our tank of past exposures, but were below the cost of equity. When we say that we grow with discipline, it means we are constraining growth because we only grow when it's above the cost of equity. So going forward, we will have some tailwinds from being in the right segments, in the right products, take consumer finance over mortgages and having completed this cleanup. Even so, we think it's going to have a very meaningful impact, which we're trying to compensate through fees, through cost, through cost of risk and then the balance below the line. But I'll leave it to Stefano go in detail on NII.",

    "text": "So let's start from the assumptions. So rates, average Euribor '24 was 3.6%; '25, we're assuming 2.3%. So it's more than 100 basis point reduction. Our net interest income sensitivity is around €300 million for impact to revenues for every 50 basis points, okay? So following the simple movement of the rates, we should have that impact. Then we have Russia. So we keep on reducing the exposure to Russia. But there is also an assumption in relation to the rate reduction in Russia. So we're expecting that the net interest income contribution from Russia to the group will be few hundreds million less in terms of net interest income. Then we have spreads and volumes. On the loan spread side, we are expecting to have an higher client spread, similar to what happened during the course of '24. This will happen also during the course of '25. Every basis point better is around €40 million better from net interest income standpoint. So this will be a mitigating factor. Volume-wise, as I was commenting before, we are expecting more loans, right? So this will also be a positive impact, whose effect will be more in '26 rather than '25. On the deposit side, the deposit pass-through will remain substantially flat. Clearly, the client rate will go down but as happened during the course of Q4, you saw that deposit volume went up. So we are also expecting that deposits will grow. So all in all, this will counter mitigate the effect they are having from the reduction of the markdown on the deposit. Finally, there is the replicating portfolio, the replicating portfolio contribution, so the hedging on the deposit was more than €450 million positive in '24. We are expecting that in '25, the contribution will not be meaningful. But if you look at the period '25, '27, the contribution to the net interest income will be positive, and it will be around €300 million. Last but not least, there is the change of perimeter. Watch out, the change of the perimeter because there is Alpha Romania. So Alpha Romania contributed for only €30 million to the net interest income of Q4, while the contribution for the full year will be clearly more than €100 million to the net interest income of the group.",

    "text": "So let me start with the cost side. So obviously, the cost-income ratio has 2 elements and in my revenues are compressing. There is a limit to where we can go. So we have set a target of 40%. 40% for '25, 40% for the plan that we have in the next 3 years. I remind you, we had 50% last time around when we did the first phase of UniCredit Unlocked. So to do 40% in a, let's say, more challenging top line environment, it means we need to continue improving cost. And we need to continue improving cost in an inflationary environment. So this is what we discussed at the beginning. Now is the time that we were waiting for everybody to cross because we have revenue being compressed and cost being driven up by inflation. And the jaws are coming together. On revenue, we'll discuss separately or we have on cost, partially be taking more than €3.5 billion of extraordinary charges in the last 3 years. We have prepared ourselves to be able to absorb the inflation and maybe grind slightly lower on similar perimeter, which means the enlarged perimeter at the moment with Romania, with Vodeno, with all of these is about €9.6 billion. We are aiming to hold, and that means absorbing all the inflation, the renegotiation of contract and everything else that is within that. So not an easy one. And for us, the cost of holding has already been taken. So it's not going to be below the line in the following years or it's going to be to a much lesser degree. So on that position, we think we are in a better position than almost anyone. With respect to the revenue line, obviously, we have all the offset that we have discussed, difficult in '25 because the compression of rates have an impact on our revenue concentrated in '25, then it loosens as we go through growth in '26 and '27. And the fees continue to grow into '25, '26, '27. So the revenue line will become more of an advantage once we trough in 2025. So 2025 is the difficult time. On asset quality, what I would say is, while we're cautious because I've never seen a cycle where cost of risk does not go up. At the moment, we don't have significant indication of worsening. Yes, we have a fall here and a fall there. But when I look at the numbers, they're really quite minor. I remind you that we had the first 3 quarters with a cost of risk almost in the single digits. And we, again, were conserving by, let's pay -- let's say, being over conservative in the force by creating specific provisions, we couldn't build more our overlays to make sure that whatever happens in the next 3 years, we are prepared. And therefore, the cost of risk of the last quarter is up, but it's not up because, Oh, my God, the asset quality is degenerating. It's up because of one position, but most importantly, because we are further strengthening our provisions. And so in '25, it depends the use of overlays, it depends what you assume. If you assume that the cost of risk jumps for the industry or for us, 25, 30, 35, then you can calculate how much overlays we're going to release on top. if you don't assume that, then we're not going to use any overlays. But the overlays are there to be used. And I remind everybody in doing your numbers, if -- as we are expecting the cost of risk trends up materially, they will be used to keep it below 25 -- 20 to 25 basis points. Actually, now, we assume even lower because we've given you 15. If the cost of risk does not increase, as many people -- some people are assuming, then the overlays are going to be released over the next 3 years. And we are going to become a net propeller of our bottom line as we get released. We can't keep them there forever.",

    "text": "So I can give you some data points more, just to add. So if you look 2024, the cost of risk of the group was 15. Then if you look the different countries, we were at around 30 basis points in Italy, 20 in Germany. Austria was single digit, was 7. But Central Europe was having a negative cost of risk for -- I mean, Eastern Europe, specifically for around minus 5. Why? Because we had a lot of write-backs. The situation will change, right? Because while we will see very likely a similar cost of risk for Italy probably something less for Germany, in the case of Eastern Europe, we will go back to normal, right? So we will go back to a positive cost of risk. Commenting on the default rates. So as highlighted by Andrea, in '24, the default rate of the group portfolio was 1.3%. But then if we're adjusting for a few big tickets, the overall portfolio had a default rate of 1%. That was fundamentally the same that we experienced in '22 and in '23. So fundamentally, there is stability in relation to that. And in '24, both Germany and Austria, just for these few big tickets were below 1%. So we were respectively 0.7% and 0.9%. So what we are currently assuming for the future is, let's say, a trend of the default rate that will not be significantly different from what we had in 2024. Slightly worse, but not meaningfully worse than this.",

Clearly, this is a financial investment, but you are now one of the 4 largest shareholder of the group.

    "text": "So profitability and M&A, what we said is that, number one, M&A needs to compare favorably with buying back our own shares and which, by the way, at this point in time, we're buying back at a premium to book, not at book. And secondly, we've often mentioned a return on investment of 15%. We also said that it's rate dependent, and it's country-dependent. But on average, it is correct. What do I mean by that? I mean that if rates go to -- if rates were at 4% and now they are 2%, I need to also not be unrealistic. But as of now, I would say that our commitment that if you do your projection on, I don't know, buying back x billions of our shares at current market prices versus M&A, we should be -- the -- I should be able to argue to you that M&A is better or not do it at all. I think it's the easiest way because [Natixis] Capital and myself are going to go in 1 of 2 directions, buy back my shares or buy the shares of another bank and bring in their earnings. If that does not compare favorably, I shouldn't be doing it, okay? Then we can discuss whether it is immediately on the year 1 or within the first 1.5 to 2 years, but that is the point. So that will not change. And it is our bar, and this is what we committed to investors, and we're not changing. On Generali, I know everybody makes a big deal out of it. I am not going to comment on a deal of another company. Let's say that, at this point in time, we are -- we made an investment.

We have a stock of €176 billion of hedging to the deposit and consider that every year, we are rolling between, let's say, €18 million and €20 billion. That is that you can derive, which is the sensitivity to the long-term part of the curve because when we do the rolling, we are hitting the long-term part of the curve.

    "text": "Good morning. Before I take you through our results, strategy and prospects, I would like to take this opportunity to thank, once again, our people, the true engine of UniCredit, whose passion, dedication, hard work and excellence make this possible quarter after quarter. Q1 2025 marks the beginning of Phase 2 of UniCredit Unlocked, unlocking acceleration. While we continue to optimize our operating model, we are now focused on fully leveraging our structural commercial strengths to drive top line growth. This quarter's result, well ahead of our plan across all KPIs, confirm the resilience of our core business, the depth of our transformation and the strength of our future trajectory. Our performance is anchored on 3 pillars. First, financial strengths. Q1 marks the best quarter in our history, solidifying our record of quality delivering across all KPIs, building a significant buffer to improve our own projection for 2025 while increasing our lines of defense. This meaningfully differentiates us our present and expected future performance versus that of our peers. Second, structural strengths. We operate a unique pan-European platform, diversified across countries, client segments and business lines. This gives us reach and resilience, allowing us to reallocate capital towards the highest return opportunities while absorbing local volatility and delivering both quality growth and distributions. Third, our ever-evolving transformation. Between '21 and '24, we focused on redesigning and streamlining our operating machine, while rebuilding and reigniting our commercial one. We are now shifting to acceleration, optimizing our operating machine while accelerating our commercial machine by targeting the right geographies, the right client segments, the right channels and the right products. While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, our disciplined execution and solid foundation give us confidence. Our previous guidance included softer net operating profit through '25 due to normalizing rates and cost of risk, with improvement weighted towards Q4, also due to lesser nonoperating charges. This, along with returning excess capital, was expected to keep net income and return on tangible equity broadly in line with '24 and ensure higher distributions than '24. That trajectory for the next 3 quarters remains unchanged. However, our outperformance in Q1 across nonoperating profit, net income, return on tangible equity and organic capital generation allows us to upgrade our 2025 guidance. We now expect to exceed '24 net income and RoTE with distribution above last year by more than initially anticipated, benefited from higher net profit growth. Should this momentum continue into Q2 and early Q3, we will consider further upgrades to our guidance. Our ambitions for '26-'27 and beyond are unchanged, but we approach them with even greater confidence. This is a story of organic quality profitable growth and distribution unmatched in Europe, strengthened by selective inorganic opportunities but will only be pursued if they enhance our already best-in-class stand-alone case. Q1 '25 marked a historic milestone for UniCredit. We delivered record results across all KPIs, further improved their quality and further strengthened our capital, asset quality, liquidity and lines of defense. Net revenue increased 3.2% with excellent fee generation more than compensating net NII decline, all further boosted by trading. NII RoAC increased to 20%, best-in-class. Fees grew to 36% of total revenues, while on their way to 40%. We reduced cost by 1.3% at constant perimeter, almost compensating the impact from first-time consolidation; reducing our stated cost-to-income ratio to 35.4%, beating peers by a significant margin. We grew net revenue over RWAs to 9.2%, while absorbing the bulk impact, generating EUR 3.1 billion of capital organically and EUR 5.3 billion overall. Net profit increased 8.3% to EUR 2.8 billion at an industry record 22% return on tangible equity, unadjusted from our significant excess capital. Adjusted for that excess capital at 13% CET1, our return on tangible equity would have been 26%. Our profitable growth allowed us to offset the impact from Basel, accrue 100% of net income in distribution while increasing our CET1 ratio to 16.1%, 16.6%, excluding the accrued SBB. Our per share growth is even more impressive. EPS, up 18%. Dividend per share, up 46%, tangible book per share, up 17%, including dividends. We achieved Q1 results while maintaining our EUR 3 billion buffers intact, EUR 1.3 billion nonoperating items and EUR 1.7 billion of overlays, and increasing NPE coverage by 1 percentage point and our excess capital to EUR 8.5 billion to EUR 10 billion or circa EUR 7.5 billion, excluding the more volatile elements. So we stand prepared for the future. This is the result of a deliberate strategic transformation, which balances delivering in the short term with continued investments supporting long-term performance. This position UniCredit as a benchmark for banking. We grew our net revenues by 3.2% year-on-year and 14.6% quarter-on-quarter without compromising quality, as proven by strong fee growth more than offsetting expected NII decline. Combined net NII and fee grew 1.6% year-on-year. Trading contribution continues to be positive, as we offer essential hedging to our clients in FX, in rates and commodities, leveraging our unique pan-European network. 2/3 of our trading was client-driven in that area with the remainder resulting from strong performance of our treasury and investment portfolio. Cost of risk remained benign at 8 basis points. NII showed resilient profitability driven by positive margins and benign cost of risk. UniCredit maintained discipline even as other banks, particularly M&A targets, pushed for higher volumes and drove pricing to value-destructive levels. Our unwavering focus on EVA-positive volumes over volumes at any cost is delivering as our net NII trajectory is better than the sector, while its profitability is significantly greater, reaching a best-in-class RoAC of 20%. We continue to have excellent pass-through management with the average in the quarter down 1.3 percentage points to 32.6%. Magda Palczynska UniCredit S.p.A. – Head of Group Investor Relations We're just going to pause the call for 5 minutes while the audio is resolved. Sorry, just a moment, please. Okay.

    "text": "Apologies. We are on Slide 4 and for anything you missed in the first part of the presentation, we'll take questions later. So we start from Slide 4. We grew our net revenues by 3.2% year-on-year and 14.6% Q-on-Q without compromising quality, as proven by strong fee growth, more than offsetting expected NII decline. Combined net NII and fees grew 1.6% year-on-year. Trading contribution continues to be positive as we offer essential hedging to our clients in FX, rates and commodities, leveraging our unique pan-European network. 2/3 of our trading was client-driven with the remainder resulting from strong performance of our treasury and investment portfolio. Cost of risk remains benign at 8 basis points. NII showed resilient profitability, driven by positive margin and benign cost of risk. UniCredit maintained discipline even as other banks, particularly M&A targets, pushed for higher volumes and drove pricing to value-destructive levels. Our unwavering focus on EVA-positive volumes over volumes at any cost is delivering as our net NII trajectory is better than the sector, while its profitability is significantly greater, reaching a best-in-class return on average equity of 20%. We continue to have excellent pass-through management with the average of -- in the quarter down 1.3 percentage points to 32.6%. Asset quality remains strong and stable. Our gross and net NPE ratio remained respectively at 2.6% and 1.4% with coverage increasing 1 percentage point Q-on-Q to 47%. Cost of risk remains structurally low at 8 basis points, broadly flat versus the first quarter of '24 and down significantly on Q4 due to the prudent approach we took to further reinforce our strong coverage on a number of files. While we increased coverage, we're still benefiting from write-backs, confirming quality origination and conservative provisioning. We maintain our EUR 1.7 billion overlays impact. They will act as a buffer against any potential deterioration in asset quality. No other institution has this level of absolute and relative overlays and has delivered this benign cost of risk without ever touching them, but rather increasing them. Our default rate is down to 0.9%. Our fee income reached a new record, growing 8.2% year-on-year and remarkable 16.5% quarter-on-quarter. Of particular note is the breadth of this growth across fee category and regions. Investment-related fees rose 13% year-on-year, insurance 5%, with non-life up 14%. Payment and current account, 1%; advisory and financing 4%; client hedging fees up 25%. Fees in Italy increased 7.8%; Germany, 7%, excluding financing fees coming from very high base; Austria, 8.5%; and Central and Eastern Europe, 16.5%. The strength and diversification is by design. It reflects our strategic focus on building factories that can deliver resilient capital-light revenues across all regions, even in uncertain market conditions. Our fee to revenue ratio climbed to 36%, a top-tier level among European fee -- peers. Our cost-income ratio improved to 35.4%, the best in our peer group, driven by disciplined cost management, combined with targeted streamlining. At constant perimeter, cost decreased 1.3% year-on-year, while maintaining our level of investment in our people, in our business and in our technology. Stated costs increased 0.6% year-on-year due to our first time consolidation of Aion-Vodeno and Alpha Bank Romania, which currently have cost-income ratios far above group average. As we fully unlock their revenue-generating potential, they will meaningfully contribute to our future growth and operational efficiency. This quarter, UniCredit generated EUR 3.1 billion of capital organically and EUR 5.3 billion or 190 basis points overall. This absorbed the Basel impact of circa 60 basis points, 20 basis points less than originally anticipated. The distribution accrual of 100 basis points or 100% of the EUR 2.8 billion net profit, while further increasing our CET1 ratio 27 basis points to 16.1%. Excluding the share buyback accrual, CET1 ratio would stand at 16.6%. Our current CET1 ratio implies a buffer of EUR 8.5 billion to EUR 10 billion, so between 313 and 363 basis points above our 12.5% to 13% CET1 ratio target. This is EUR 1 billion to EUR 2.5 billion above what we prudently define as our excess capital that now stand at circa EUR 7.5 billion. The difference includes both a proven buffer for other regulatory headwinds for more volatile items such as the gain from strategic investment, net of hedging and from Russia. We have the highest level of excess capital in the peer group. This is a testament to the strength of our business model, highly profitable, highly capital efficient and able to fund growth, best-in-class distribution and regulatory requirement simultaneously. Our capital discipline gives us both certainty and strategic optionality, whether for organic investment, share buybacks or potential inorganic investment. Our liquidity position is strong and sustainable. Our LCR and SFR above 140% and 125%, respectively, are sound and well above our peer average. Our loans-to-deposit ratio stands at 87%, notwithstanding our focus on the deposit pass-through, well below 100%. In general, a higher loan-to-deposit ratio, not only requires relying on more expensive source of funding, but also correlates with increased liquidity risk, particularly during period of market stress or geopolitical uncertainty. We have reinforced our European leadership across all KPIs, widening the gap versus peers. The high-quality revenue growth, coupled with best-in-class operating and capital efficiency leads to unmatched profitability and capital generation. Our 22% return on tangible equity is 7 percentage points higher than the average of our peers. It would be even higher if we normalize for our excess capital relative to them. We generate more than twice the capital organically than the average of our peers. We're confident we can widen this gap further. Our strengths and lines of defense, including our excess capital, are unmatched and derisk or boost our profitability and distribution going forward. Our structural advantages and the way we are leveraging them are the foundational elements of our success. We operate a truly pan-European franchise that leverages scale with local depth. Our geographic footprint is balanced across 4 powerful regions: Italy, Germany, Austria and Central and Eastern Europe. This footprint allows us to deliver quality profitable growth and distribution regardless of local volatility. Our client base is well balanced between attractive SME, affluent and private clients and large corporate mass market clients that we approach differently. We leverage common platform and scale while tailoring products to each client segment. Our business mix is supported by group factories that deliver best-in-class product tailored for local clients' needs. What we are seeing now is the real power of convergence across our regions and product factories, increasingly working together to create synergies and reinforcing each other's strengths. Let me move to our regions. In Italy, our franchise continued to be market-leading by a wide margin across sustainable profitability, efficiency and capital generation. It is UniCredit quality earnings powerhouse, delivering impressive financial results as our transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable growth. Gross revenues grew 1.4% to EUR 3 billion. Net revenue, 2.9%, driven by very strong fees up 8%, 2 percentage points more than each of our 2 Italian peers, more than offsetting a net NII decline of 1.6%, well below that of our 2 Italian peers. Our continued focus on margin rather than volume led to the increase of our NII ROAC to 25%, significantly above peers. Fee growth was well diversified with standout performance of our investment and non-life insurance fees. Our fee to revenue ratio in Italy reached a top-tier 42%. We maintained a low cost of risk at 26 basis points, down 7 points year-on-year, reinforcing coverage and without touching our overlays. Our gross and net NPE ratio remained at 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively, with increasing coverage Q-on-Q. However, our net NPE ratio adjusted for exposure covered by state guarantees with a 100% enforcement success rate, unlike many other banks, would drop to 0.9% and be almost entirely covered by our Italian overlays. Effectively, we're almost a 0 net NPE bank in Italy. Operational efficiency improved further to 32%. Costs were down 2.2% in spite of the continued investment in our people, business and technology. Capital efficiency improved with net revenue to RWA of 11.3%, up almost 1 percentage point year-on-year. The gap with the first and the third Italian bank increased to 0.5 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively. Profit before tax rose 70% year-on-year to EUR 1.9 billion, RoAC reached 37%, up 6 percentage points, the best in Italy by a margin. Organic capital generation reached EUR 1.6 billion, the best in Italy by a margin. As such, UniCredit was recognized as the best bank in Italy by IFR and the Global Finance Awards in 2025. Our continued investment in and support of development of our people through UniCredit Corporate University provides them with new challenges, new opportunities and career longevity. We continue to invest in technology to further improve client experience. Our recently introduced UCX SME Lending platform provides a fully digital end-to-end lending journey for SMEs, side-by-side with UCX consumers for family. We supported a number of innovative large corporate deals providing financial backing and strategic solution, reinforcing our role in enhancing the long-term competitiveness and resilience of core Italian companies. In the quarter, we facilitated over EUR 4.4 billion in financing in support of Italian SME client alone, as we target growth in this segment. Our dedication to Italy is further underscored by the EUR 35 billion invested to date in UniCredit per Italia that remains unmatched, and our Italian government bond exposure that account for 64% of our Italian legal entity sovereign exposure above our Italian competitor. These bonds currently have a positive mark-to-market value, and we have benefited from this position throughout the cycle. Germany. Our German bank continues to be the best performing in the country, increasing the gap versus peer. It is one of the 2 key anchors for the group and continues to deliver impressive financial results as its transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable quality growth. Gross revenues grew 3.8% year-on-year to EUR 1.5 billion. Net revenue grew 6.3% without releasing any overlays, with fees and trading mostly client-driven, more than offsetting the 2.5% decline in net NII. As previously indicated, NII in Germany is affected by the client-driven increase in trading volume, as we booked trading-related funding cost in NII and increase in rates and/or volumes negatively impact NII while benefiting trading by an equal amount. When rates and volume decline, the opposite happens. As such, gross NII and net NII would have been up, respectively, 1% and 6% with trading up only 14%, assuming flat trading volume year-on-year. This performance is best-in-class in the country. Our 23% NII RoAC also remain the best-in-class in the country, increasing our lead versus our competitors as we focus on lending being significantly above our cost of equity in its own right. Fees adjusted for financing fees are up 7% driven by investment, up 7%; insurance, up 11%; and client hedging, up 11%. The decline in financing fees masked that growth as they normalize from a very strong base in Q1 2024. Cost of risk is down to 11 basis points with no usage of overlays. Our NPE ratio is stable at 2.2% with proven coverage improving. Operational efficiency improved further to 36%, widening the gap versus our closest competitor peer by 3 percentage points to 20 percentage points. Costs were down 1.9%, despite significant investment in technology and people. Capital efficiency improved further with net revenue over RWA of 8.7%, almost 1 percentage point higher year-on-year. Profit before tax rose 12% to EUR 0.9 billion compared to a decline at our closest peer. RoAC ended above 26%, up 3.7 percentage points over the year, the best in Germany, widening the gap to almost 2x our closest peers. As a result, organic capital generation reached EUR 800 million, investing in and for all our stakeholder within Germany is at the core of how we operate. We are the employer of choice with top employer certification for the 15th consecutive quarter. We achieved the highest NPS score among Mittelstand banks. A Germany's leading provider of FX hedging, together with those on recent commodities, we help protect the industry from volatility. We have been leading the defense and technology start-up sector and our German bank is well positioned to support this industry further. We hold a substantial share of our legal entity treasury portfolio in Germany, sub-sovereign bonds, a clear sign of our commitment to supporting regional resilience and public priorities. Austria. Our Austrian bank continues to be the best performing bank among our Austrian peers. It is one of the 2 key anchors for the group and continues to deliver impressive financial results, as its transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable growth. Gross revenue grew 1.9% to EUR 700 million, driven by strong fees, up 8.5%, with together with dividends more than offset the 8% NII decline. Fee growth was driven by investments, plus 19%; and insurance, plus 96%, leading to a 33% fee to revenue, the highest in the country. Cost of risk remained positive due to repayments in performing loans with gross provision beginning to normalize. Operational efficiency remained at 39% with cost up 3.3% due to wage drift and a change in operating model that benefited the group but disadvantaged Austria due to its raising VAT. We continue to significantly invest in technology and people. Our capital efficiency remained strong with net revenue over RWA at 7%, notwithstanding the 8.5% increase in RWAs, mainly due to Basel, partially offset by mitigating actions. Profit before tax declined 4.4% when adjusting for VAT accounting and higher bank levy versus 8.2% stated. RoAC remained high at 24.4%, 25.8% adjusted, the best among Austrian banks. Organic capital generation reached EUR 400 million. Investing in and for all our stakeholders within Austria is at the core of how we operate. We were recognized as a top employer '25, extending green benefit and achieving the family-friendly employer certification for the sixth consecutive year. We advanced our technology initiatives, launching new self-issued credit cards, enhancing our mobile banking app with chatbot functionality. Central and Eastern Europe. Our Central and Eastern Europe franchise continues to be the most profitable and efficient in the region. It is the growth engine of the group and continues to deliver impressive financial results as its transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable growth. Gross revenues grew 5% year-on-year to EUR 1.2 billion, driven by strong fees, up 17% and NII up 1.5%. Alpha Bank first-time consolidation, partially compensated for the significant drag of Hungary. The quality of our NII remains unmatched in the region, with NII RoAC at 25%. While competitors chase volume, we are maintaining discipline without sacrificing market share. The strong fee performance was broad-based and led to an increase of our fees to revenue ratio of 3 percentage points to 28%. Cost of risk remained positive due to repayment in performing loans with gross provision beginning to normalize. Operational efficiency remained best-in-class at 34% cost-income ratio, 32.9% excluding Alpha Romania. Costs were up 3.9%, excluding Alpha Romania, 13.8% stated, including Alpha Romania. We continue to significantly invest in technology and people. Our capital efficiency remains best-in-class with net revenue over RWA of 8.6% and stable despite an 8% increase in RWAs due to the Alpha merger and Basel impact. Profit before tax was up 1%, 4%, excluding Hungary. RoAC remained excellent at 26%, 30% excluding Hungary. Organic capital generation reached EUR 600 million. We advanced our technology initiatives with fast and easy onboarding for small corporates in Romania and faster micro business loan approvals in Serbia. Russia. We continue to work towards an accelerated ordinary wind-down of Russia, always within both the letter and the spirit of the complex legal, regulatory and sanction limitation. Our '25 targets communicated in the first half of '24 have already been reached last year. To better appreciate the impact of our action, we will comment the trends at constant foreign exchange starting Q1 2022. Local deposits declined to EUR 1.5 billion, minus 82% and further down 7% Q-on-Q. Net local loans declined to EUR 1 billion, minus 86% and further down 20% Q-on-Q. Cross-border lending declined 94% to date, and we reached practically 0 in Q3. Cross-border payments declined 70% to below EUR 8 billion per quarter and a further down 20% this quarter. We are now almost exclusively in euros and U.S. dollar. We have reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 to circa 69 basis points on a 16.1% CET1 and maintain buffer in our excess capital to cover that. The 22 basis points increase versus previous quarter is solely due to ruble appreciation. We are compliant with applicable ECB targets and aim to continue our business compression in Russia, including a full orderly exit from the retail business by first half 2026. Product factories. Our product factories continue to drive differentiated quality growth. They delivered EUR 3.1 billion in gross revenues, up 7% year-on-year, with more than 67% of that coming from fees. Individual Solutions grew 9%, driven by Investment up 13% and Nonlife Insurance up 10%. One markets, assets under management reached EUR 18 billion, well ahead of plan, with our own managed fund sales increasing by more than 50%. We are well on our way to increasing value chain retention to more than 80% by internalizing and accelerating sales of our own products. This will provide Alpha growth above and beyond the market. Corporate Solutions grew 8% with fees up 13%, driven by Advisory and Financing and Client Risk Management. Client Risk Management grew 24%, testament to the value we add in supporting clients and the overall economy in volatile and uncertain markets. Our model is scalable, capital-light, provides value and is integrated across geographies. These factories are not only revenue generator through continued innovation and margin expansion, they are also critical in supporting clients and cementing their loyalty. They will continue to be a critical part of our unlocking acceleration strategy through 2027 and beyond. Q1 2025 marks the inflection point in our UniCredit Unlocked transformation journey. Between '21 and '24, we successfully unlocked trapped value by redesigning and streamlining our operating machine while rebuilding and reigniting our commercial machine. This allowed us to grow net profit significantly more than our peers, 2x in our calculation. We have already shifted gear from unlocking trapped potential to unlocking acceleration. In Phase 2 of our strategy, we will optimize our operating machine and further accelerate our commercial one. Despite industry headwinds, we are confident to deliver on our ambition of circa EUR 10 billion net profit at over 17% return on tangible equity by '27 and to grow further from that base as macro normalizes in the outer years. The impact from investment, both past, yet to fully crystallize and future, will build on our structural advantages and ensure further value creation. In the next 3 years, we will finalize unlocking trapped potential. We will continue to simplify, delay, streamline and change the way of working. We will finalize taking back control, boost investment in targeted technology and data enhancement and move into modernization, all to better support both our people and clients' journeys. We will complete the re-internalization of our product factories, most notably insurance already in Q2 and strengthen the connectivity between them and the client through increasingly digitalized and integrated channels and motivated network. In parallel, we are accelerating our top line growth with differentiated strategies per client segments and per geography. The aim is not just growth but targeted profitable growth with products that match client needs; distribution channel that puts choice in clients' hands; and data that powers personalization at scale. Our people and culture will continue to be central with sustained investment in empowerment, supported by simplification of processes and way of working and professional development delivered through Unicredit Corporate University. We are building not just a bigger bank, but a faster, more agile, more client-centric one, fully aligned with our structural strengths and long-term ambition. These steps ensure that every euro we invest translate into structured long-term value creation for our clients, for our shareholders, for our people and for our community with no waste. Our organic accelerator are already delivering, but their contribution will meaningfully increase in the years ahead. Initiatives like the internalization of our life insurance, the Alpha Bank integration in Romania, the very successful partnership with Alpha Bank in Greece and scaling up Aion-Vodeno are expected to contribute over EUR 400 million in additional net profit by 2027. This initiative will not only more than offset the compression of lower earnings from Russia, but also substantially improve the quality of our earnings and the growth potential after that. Aion-Vodeno allows us to profitably enter new markets such as retail and SMEs in Poland, where we signed up our first corporate deal. We are also expanding in Western Europe through a mobile-first model with regulatory applications underway. Banking-as-a-serving is scaling supported by a EUR 100 million capital increase from the group. In Romania, we've doubled our retail market share and added EUR 50 million in Q1 revenues alone. In Greece, we have successfully -- partners in trade finance, international payment and investment product with distribution of our One market funds well on its way to reach EUR 1 billion. These are in projection. They are real tangible growth levers already producing results. They enhanced revenue quality, support profitability and future-proof our earnings trajectory. Today, we have also announced another important milestone in our transformation journey. We are partnering with Google to accelerate our transformation, moving our application to cloud. This is a 360-degree partnership, well in line with our approach to build up a group ecosystem of best-in-class partners. It's a deep co-invested collaboration that is set to redefine how we operate, compete and innovate. Through Google, we are migrating our core system, our data and application to cloud, a move that will improve agility, reduce legacy complexity and enhance security. The migration is fully funded, delivering financial returns from day 1, while also decommissioning costly legacy infrastructure. On that basis, we maintain all of our cost commitments. Finally, this partnership goes well beyond technology. Google Cloud is committed to supporting UniCredit's people development, embedding a new way of working and training to best adopt cutting-edge AI and analytics. Google also offers us new business opportunity, leveraging their ecosystem for several services. Guidance. Thanks to a record-breaking first quarter, the transformation levers that drove it and our increased lines of defense, we're now upgrading our guidance for the full year 2025 to over EUR 9.3 billion at a return on tangible equity above 17%. We are, for now, maintaining the same conservative outlook for the rest of the year and expect the coming quarters to moderate with a decrease in net operating profit on a year-over-year basis, driven by an NII decline for the year, but we still expect to be above mid-single digits. We, however, now expect net revenues to end up better than originally anticipated at circa EUR 23.5 billion, driven by stronger Q1 and a more benign cost of risk for the year. Our confirmed guidance on cost will lead to a lower NOP that will be compensated by the significant reduction in nonoperating charges in Q4, all leading to the net profit and return on tangible equity guidance above. Depending on the actual performance of the business in Q2 and the beginning of Q3, there may be scope for further improve of our guidance. Distribution. We'll still exceed those in '24 and should further benefit from an increased net profit and organic capital generation. We reaffirm our '27 ambition, EUR 10 billion in net profit with return on tangible equity above 17% with annual distribution in excess of '24 for each one of the next 3 years. Our confidence is based on our financial strengths, a transformation leveraging our structural advantages, protected or propelled by our lines of defense. As we close, let me reiterate what this quarter represents. This is the best quarter in UniCredit's history, and it is not a one-off. It is the culmination of 17 quarters of profitable growth and progression through disciplined transformation from streamlining our operation to reigniting our commercial engine and ensuring our bank has a sustainable growing performance in the future. Every slide we've reviewed today points to a business that is outperforming peers' and our own expectations. We grow sustainably, while improving the quality of such growth. We lead on profitability, we lead on efficiency, we lead on capital generation and we lead on distributions. Our vision is clear. Our strategy is working. Our execution is disciplined. We have more value to unlock and more lines of defense to protect or propel us than any other peer. Looking ahead, we are focused on acceleration, leveraging our platform, scaling our products and unlocking further value through organic growth and selective strategic moves. We have inorganic possibilities in each one of our markets, some are visible, some are not. All can be closed by us, but we will close only those that add value to all of our stakeholders and, in particular, to our own shareholders. We are proud of what we've achieved and even more confident about what's to come. We're excited about our unmatched stand-alone profitable growth and distribution story. The resiliency and growth of our earnings and dividend per share trajectory are evident and superior to boast the average of the sector and those of peers with the highest valuation. The combination of these and the level of our current valuation, even before considering our significant lines of defense, makes our investment case compelling. Thank you very much, and we're now open to questions.",

    "text": "Sorry, just trying to keep up, Andrea. Okay. So guidance. Let's put it this way. This quarter, you can take consensus, we can take our own expectation. We are EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million of net profit ahead of where everybody expected us to be. Those EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million of net profit are due to the following factors: a significant beat on core revenues with fees doing significantly better than we expected and NII doing exactly as we expected. Secondly, trading that was benign. And this trading benign, as we said, was linked to 2 pieces. One, the support of clients through our client risk management in FX rates and commodities, but is up 25% and is booked mostly there. And secondly, treasury and strategic portfolio performance. So finally, we had cost a little bit better than expected, cost of risk significantly better than expected and that takes you to the bottom line. So to answer your question, I would say the way we look at it is, if I take fee plus NII, the dynamic for the year will be better just because I have had a Q1 that is better and I'm maintaining my expectation for the next 3 quarters. I have also said that we may increase our guidance further. And the reason why we haven't gone further now is because we want to see in such a volatile environment what happens. But if some of the trends we're seeing are capped, the core revenue beat will be better, not necessarily for NII, but for the combination of the two. We don't know that yet, and it's not prudent to assume it yet, which is why we keep the NII projection to where it is and we keep the fee trajectory to where it is, except Q1 where we are above. The cost of risk is a significant positive. We see our portfolio performing better than expected. We have had to do nothing on overlays. We thought we would need to use them at some point for the time being, that point is far away. And so if I summarize, the significantly better first quarter in fees and cost and provision because we bundle provision with NII, looking at them separately, in our opinion, is not correct, brings us to do 2 things; one, I already made the quarter, so I'm better through the year, even if I am in the same trend line for the next 3 quarters. Two, I'm madly optimistic depending on the uncertainty of this environment. And if that optimism becomes confirmed by fact, those 3 things will continue to contribute further. If they don't, most of the beat is first quarter, partially fee, cost and provision; and the trading, I don't think there will be a repeat of a significant overperformance of trading of this quarter because a lot of things went in one direction. The volatility pushed, very hard, client-driven trading in hedges, the strategic portfolio hedged, crystallized some gain, which we may lose or not, and the treasury did well. So I would say, a long answer to say I think fee and cost plus provision are the main driver. Trading is a one-off, in my opinion, and is going to go back to the trend line. On M&A, using your word, political hostilities refocusing everywhere else. Firstly, I think I'm not saying something very new by saying that in the recent times, all governments have taken a much keener look and roll into M&A. You see that across Europe from Spain to Italy to Germany to Hungary, everywhere. So it is a fact of M&A. I think to an extent is a justified fact as government want to make sure the transaction are done in a way that support the economy and support people. And on that, I completely share the view. Maybe the implementation, we could have a different view of how we would implement to achieve that role. But that is a fact. And I would say that it is a fact in most, if not all the countries where we operate today and not only in Europe. So we have -- as we said from day 1, it is our job to identify M&A opportunity or inorganic investment opportunity in every market we operate and in the market we told you we're interested in. And we have. We have a list, they are analyzed. We know what they are. Why aren't we closing them? They're not in the best interest of our shareholders. When they become in the best interest in the shareholder, we will close them. If not, we will not. We do not have pressure to close M&A because our stand-alone trajectory is already well above the peer group and our valuation is below the peer group. So we have a lot of work to continue to demonstrate to our shareholders that we deserve to align, and we will perform better than peers. If that -- when that performance finishes, which at the moment, I do not see in the next 3 to 4 years, we may have pressure on M&A. But at the moment, we have none. So we look at M&A or an inorganic investment on a very cold basis .Do they strengthen our franchise and, and I underline the and, do they increase the value we create for our shareholders, risk adjusted? Some do, some don't, and that's where we are. And as we look at our share buyback, we will look at M&A, we will look at our inorganic option. You asked me to rank. Let me see if I can make back where you ask me to rank. I think I had local distribution, new markets and factories. Okay. So if I ranked, so this is if, we clear hurdles, if we clear hurdles, okay, so assuming they all return the same or risk-adjusted means that non-risk-adjusted any M&A or investment needs to return more than buying my own stock. I would say new market, meaning M&A -- geographic M&A, call it this way, in any market where we are or the one immediately close to us, as I have mentioned, Poland, more than once. Secondly, strengthen of our factories. Thirdly, buying back our own stock. And why is that? Because if I clear the hurdles, doing this investment and M&A will elongate the period in which we can add value. We think we have an unmatched blueprint to extract value from banks and from what we do. And if we have the opportunity to do it profitably, in the interest of our shareholders, we will. But at the same time, and I want to be very clear because I keep on saying that and maybe it's not getting through. I've done M&A for a long time, and I have seen massive destruction of value by management team and companies that put pressures by media, by short-term views, by speculation, do transaction and from the next day, they need to repair the damage for several years. I will not do that, and I'm very patient and calm and the Board is completely aligned. So we find the right transaction, we will do them faster than you can believe. We don't find them, we will execute our own plan.",

    "text": "Thank you, Marco. So let me take it first and then Stefano will complete. So we do not have a focus on FTE reduction, never did, never will. We have a focus on cost efficiencies. FTE reduction leads people to move core activities outside of the perimeter of the bank, and then say we have reduced FTEs as opposed to invest in their people and internalize activities that we push outside of the bank. So a lot of our cost reduction has been done by reinternalizing activities that were pushed before. Having said that, we have had significant number of people leaving on a net basis due to what is physiological in Central and Eastern Europe and retirements of people where we pay their old pass to pension because this bank had not touched certain categories for years and had not hired young people for years. As we hired young people, we were able to replenish our pyramidal age, and therefore, exit, let's say, more expensive people that were at the end of our career and the wish to exit, and reinvesting on younger people that were at the start of a career. So if you do that and you reinternalize, maybe your headcount does not decline as much as you would think, but the cost per head and the efficiency per head goes up materially. So we don't track FTE reduction. We track cost of HR reduction vis-a-vis what their efficiency is and we tracked non-HR cost. Another thing that you should consider is that we are not here to reduce cost 1 quarter, 2 quarters, 3 quarters, 4 quarters. We have been reducing cost for -- now I have lost count, but probably more than 10 quarters. Our objective is to have a grip on cost to keep it under control, to not let them deviate and focus on efficiency. I have no problem if I can grow twice as much if I need to let go on cost, but my cost to income ratio and our efficiency is what's driving it. It is also true that as of today, we are gradually shifting our attention on non-HR cost, which are one matter that all of us should look at because inflation is having a significant impact on those. So my general answer is, look at cost, we're going to keep them broadly in line, not one quarter but for the next 3 years. And that is a massive achievement, and we have a lot of variables that we need to look at. What is read across from Google partnership? I would say, like every other partnership like the MasterCard partnership and like many others we have done with Alpha, for example, these are not providers, distributor or client provider relationship, they are partnership. So with Google, we will together transform the bank. With MasterCard, we will together transform payment. With Alpha Bank, we will together create value from them distributing our products and we manufacturing them. So we want to do more of those. It creates an ecosystem and it creates the right motivation from our partners to see us successful and for us to see them successful. On the CET1, this -- and then I'll pass to Stefano. So we -- I would look at it that way. They're about 50 basis points that are -- I don't know if you want to call them one-off or you want to call them more volatile, which is why if you see, we have created a buffer in our excess capital. About half of those come from the ruble appreciation in Russia and the other half comes from the overall performance of our strategic portfolio including hedges, and I underline including hedges because hedges are an excellent things when things go badly, but they cost money when things go up. Now Monday morning quarterbacking, today, we would all like not to have hedges. But my job is to create consistency over time. Therefore, we are hedged versus we had a positive outcome, but not as positive as it could or would have been. As you have seen, our total capital has moved from 6.5% to 10%. But specifically because we have more volatile area in our capital generation, we have limited the one we are committing to return to you to EUR 7.5 billion keeping a buffer of EUR 2.5 billion. If we consolidate those performance and those risks go away or decline, there is EUR 2.5 billion that are sitting there to be used. And that's the total, but I will pass it with Stefano.",

    "text": "Thank you, Andrea. So adding a point on the reduction of the headcounts. Marco, you're referring to a reduction of the total headcounts in terms of FTEs of 1% year-on-year to consider the change in the perimeter. So it's important to have a look at that also when you look to the future because we had the change of Alpha Romania and Aion-Vodeno, so if you would adjust for these changes, the reduction of the FTEs would be year-on-year equal to minus 4%. Clearly, as highlighted by Andrea, we're looking to the trend of the overall cost, not just for the FTE, but you can assume that in order to be able to keep costs slightly down also in the course of the following years, excluding the effect from the perimeter, we will have to reduce also the headcount component, clearly, not at this path, we will keep on optimizing and a consequence 3 that, reducing also the headcounts component in future. With regards to the capital impact in the first quarter and more specifically in relation to the line -- to the part of the capital walk called PD Scenario and Other Items. So first of all, there is fundamentally no impact from the PD scenario, it's just, let's say, around 1 basis point. So that's not material. What is material is capital reserves, around 26 basis points out of that is the ruble appreciation, okay? Then we have around 10 basis points deriving from fair value through OCI reserves, so the reserve that we have related to the mark-to-market of bond investments and pension funds, okay? So this is positive for around 10 basis points. Then there are 2 other important elements. One is tax loss carryforward and intangibles. Deposit effect is around 15 basis points. Tax loss carryforward is related to the Italian perimeter. At the beginning of the year, we had around EUR 4 billion of recognized tax loss carryforward that are deducted from the capital. We will utilize this tax loss carryforward during the course of the next years. The total benefit of the capital for the future will be 120 basis points in the next 6 years. You can expect around something more than 25 basis points during the course of '25 from this utilization. The final point is in relation to threshold deduction, which is threshold deduction. We have some deduction connected to the investment -- to the significant investment in financial sector entities. During the quarter, the capital improvements was such that this threshold deduction went down and went down for an amount of around 15 basis points, 1-5. So wrapping up, 26 basis point is FX, ruble appreciation; 10 basis point is capital reserve, bonds, pension fund; 15 basis point, tax loss carryforward and intangible point; 15 basis point is this threshold deduction that I explained to you. In relation to 2025, you have asked if there is something more to be taken into consideration? The answer is yes, is the effect deriving from model changes. We had around 6 basis points during this quarter deriving from Basel. We will have model changes for an amount around EUR 8 billion during the course of the remaining quarters of this year. For the rest, it will be capital generation through the business and also including capital efficiency actions.",

    "text": "Okay. Thank you, Delphine. So capital, strategic portfolio. As we said, the impact, 25 basis points positive. Impact on trading, minus 40. Why minus 40? Because -- minus EUR 40 million sorry, minus EUR 40 million impact on trading, minus EUR 40 million. Why? Because part of a stake, the almost 10% we announced when we bought the stake from the government is not going for trading, is going through -- directly through equity. So we are hedged 100%, and the move of those hedge are 100%. So if everything goes up, the up from the part that is in our -- that goes to equity, you don't see it through trading, you see directly to capital, while the up of the -- all of the hedges -- well, the impact of all the hedges that in this case were negative, you see them in trading. So the hedges are only matching in the P&L, let's call it, rough-cut 3/4 of our underlying because 1 quarter -- sorry, 2/3 of our underlying because 1/3 goes directly to equity, and that's the asymmetry. And as we said, we had a good performance overall to capital. but we're not taking that as a performance that will stay there. It's more volatile. It depends on the market. So for the time being, we're happy we're hedged, we stay where we are. And then Stefano may add a few things on that, if there are. On BPM. So on BPM, let me recap, so we all see where we are. We made an offer in November. At the time of the offer, we were very clear that we felt there was uncertainty around Anima, and therefore, we were not going to pay for that uncertainty. And we would -- we were doing -- we were offering a 15% -- 20% when you include dividend, premium to shareholders and on undisturb on Anima. After that time, we obviously realize that given the timing of the offer of BPM, we would not be able to do the share buyback of EUR 3.6 billion until after closing BPM or not doing BPM. But if we do BPM, the shareholders of BPM get their share in the share buyback of UniCredit 2024. That's another 6%. Then after that, we realized that in order to align the asset quality of BPM to ours in Italy, we need to do another EUR 800 million of provisions, EUR 550 million after tax. That's another 6%. And then we got Anima, which we were very right to ignore because Anima, depending on what you want to evaluate, destroyed value between EUR 1 billion and EUR 1.7 billion in the bank. Indeed, if you look at their capital projection, now with Anima in, the share buyback is gone, and they need to climb back to a decent level of capital. Capital, excess capital that we were paying for in November and now was deployed at an 11% return, which if I did with my own share buybacks or with my own investment, I would derate. So if you put them all together and you can do the math, you find easily between a 40% to 50% premium to where they were before we made the offer. If you look at it in another way, you find that we are trading at more or less the same multiple, but if you adjust for the lower CET1 for the lower coverage of the loan book and for our excess capital, and EUR 3 billion of P&L buffer, but they do not have, you find that they're trading at more than 30% to 35% PE gap to us, which brings you back to a similar number. So we start from a situation where we have the right to evaluate the situation, to analyze what is happening because I would add another thing: when you buy a factory and that factory distributes through other banks, other banks' appetite to distribute the product of that factory usually goes down, not up. And therefore, we need to look at that. And we have time, we have a right to have time. So we were evaluating that situation until we got golden power. We got golden power, although its content are supposed to be secret. I understand they are widely public in the press. So you can make your own opinion on that. There are a number of elements in the Golden Power that are, in our opinion, not clear and not intended. We're trying to clarify them. We need to go through that before we take a definitive decision. So we will get either clarification or not. If it's not, we will need to make our own interpretation of what the golden power indicates. When we get all that, we will make a decision. But for the time being, we have no pressure. We have patience like on everything else, and we will wait.",

So the effects are some of them in P&L, top line, mainly in the trading, some of them through equity and some of them in risk-weighted assets. So the sum up of all this effect in the quarter brought to a positive capital contribution of around plus 25 basis points of Common Equity Tier 1 ratio.

    "text": "Yes. So in relation to the net interest income trends. So net interest income trend of Austria has been impacted from one, an overall trend of customer rate on the asset side and trend on the deposit rate on the deposit side. In relation to the customer rate on the deposit side, do consider that there was a reduction of the pass-through, but the reduction of the pass-through will take further because, especially in Germany and Austria, it takes time in order to reprice down because we do have also term deposits. . So all in all, the expectation is that the net interest income trend should improve during the course of 2025. The more we are able to reprice down on the deposit through the reduction of the rate on term deposit and we get more traction in terms of lending trend. Having said that, in relation to the lending trend dynamic, while we are expecting an increase of the lending trend for the group in terms of stock, something more than 1% of increase of the stock of loans during the course of this year, such an improvement will come mainly from Central Eastern Europe. We will have a slight improvement around 1% year-on-year from Italy and Austria and slightly down in Germany. So the trend of Austria in terms of net interest income will be better during the course of final part of the year and especially during the course of 2026. In relation to the replicating portfolio, the replicating portfolio has been increased during the course of this quarter. So if we look at the end of the quarter in comparison with the end of the year is up EUR 7 billion. The average is slightly below EUR 180 billion and for an average duration of around 5. The yield is around 1.2%. The contribution in the next 3 years, simply deriving from the rolling of the replicating portfolio, so between '27 if you look in comparing with net interest income from replicating of '24 is around EUR 500 million. That's backloaded, so it's not front loaded with the majority of the contribution in '26 and especially in '27. With regard to the consolidation. So in relation to the consolidation, we have mentioned the effect deriving from Alpha and Aion-Vodeno. So if you look in relation -- in terms of change of perimeter, so that is not a meaningful impact from a consolidation standpoint. The majority of the synergies in relation to Alpha Romania will come second part of this year and next year. The cost base of Alpha Romania is around EUR 100 million. So if you need to take this into consideration, do consider EUR 100 million with the synergies that will kick in second part of the year and especially last year. So the cost base that we'll have from Alpha Romania next year will be lower than a base for a year that you can consider equal to EUR 100 million. In relation to the -- I mean, you mentioned the EUR 400 million, right, so in 2027, deriving from the different perimeter, i.e., from the insurance around EUR 100 million; from Alpha Romania around EUR 100 million; and from Aion-Vodeno that is more than EUR 200 million. So in relation to this, I believe that it's important for you to take into consideration the effect that are very, very much differentiated. So if you consider the current cost base for this year, the current cost base for this year deriving from the sum up of this perimeter will be around EUR 250 million for a revenue base that will be around EUR 400 million. This will be progressively going up with synergies already in '25 and '26 from insurance and from Alpha while the progression will be more backloaded if you want from Aion-Vodeno standpoint in the sense that you can expect a contribution equal fundamentally to the bottom line of 0 this year, progressively going up, but with definitely a higher amount in 2027.",

What I said on M&A is no pressure just to compare it to the widespread belief that if one launch an offer or buys a stake, one needs to buy at any cost and at any condition of the transaction. We are not bound to do that. If we can, and I responded to, I think, Andrea Filtri's first question. If we have the conditions that are right, we will do M&A above and beyond share buybacks, just because from a return standpoint, it makes sense. But if from a return standpoint, it doesn't make sense for our shareholders, we will not. So in order to answer your question, I think the excess capital above 13% where we keep an appropriate buffer that buffer may reduce if some of the volatile elements, either eliminate or addressed and therefore, the capital may go up from that level, we will return it by '27 or profitably employed by '27, profitably employed, it means making inorganic investment or acquisition that clear the hurdle of our share buyback and all the other metrics that we have given again and again and again. So the probability that it goes in M&A as opposed to share buyback depends on the possibility to do transactions that clear our hurdles and add more value to our shareholders than buying our stock back. It's completely linked to that, and we will be either very fast in doing them or not doing them, depending if we get that or not. On the second, I'll pass to Stefano.",

So we are currently assuming 1.8%. Overall, average Euribor for the year at 2.1%, which is the net interest income sensitivity, so plus/minus 50 basis point Euribor is plus/minus EUR 300 million. The deposit pass-through sensitivity is 1 percentage point is EUR 100 million, which are our assumption in terms of the deposit pass-through. We closed the deposit pass-through for the group, excluding Russia, is around 33%, 3-3, and we were at 34% same perimeter at the end of Q4. We are currently assuming to be slightly better.

Clearly, if they pass through, reduction will be better than what we are assuming, as I told you before, a relation to Austria and Germany, we are currently assuming a reduction of the pass-through in Austria and Germany, for every percentage point net interest income can be better on an annual basis for around EUR 100 million. So in compared with our assumption, if this will happen, that can be a tailwind.",
