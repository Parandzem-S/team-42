    "transcript": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the investor and analyst conference call for HSBC Holdings plc's Q1 2023 results. For your information, this conference is being recorded.  At this time, I will hand the call over to Mr. Richard O'Connor, Group Head of Investor Relations.\nRichard O'Connor: Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Before I hand over to Noel, I want to give a quick reminder of the changes that have taken effect this quarter. Numbers in the presentation today are on IFRS 17 basis, and thank you to all those who attended the in March. Our focus is now on reported numbers but we will call out and specify notable items.  Our global businesses are still the primary basis of our reporting, but we have moved to legal entity rather than geographic regions as our secondary reporting line. Consensus hasn't yet fully caught up with all these changes, but now we've made them, we believe they will give you more clarity, transparency and ultimately benefit your modeling going forward. Noel over to you.\nNoel Quinn: Thanks, Richard, and good morning in London, good afternoon in Hong Kong, and thank you for joining our first quarter results call. Georges is going to lead the presentation, but I'd like to make some opening comments.  We've announced a strong set of Q1 results. We delivered a strong profit performance, which was spread across all our major geographies. All 3 global businesses performed well and cost discipline remained tight.  In the first quarter, excluding the gain on SVB U.K. and the part reversal of the impairments on the potential sale of our French retail bank, we delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 19.3%, so our strategy is working.  I'm also confident about the future for 2 main reasons: First, we have built a good platform for growth. We have a strong balance sheet, broad-based geographic profit generation, a good combination of net interest income and non-net interest income and a tight grip on costs. This growth potential was evidenced in the inflow of new invested assets of $22 billion in the quarter with a cumulative $93 billion over the last 12 months, which shows that our wealth strategy is continuing to gain traction. And you have my commitment that we will continue to drive strong performance for the rest of the year, while maintaining cost discipline and investing in growth.  The second reason I'm confident is the diversity and connectivity of our geographical footprint, where we have access to markets that are exhibiting good growth and return potential. I've seen firsthand the strong economic recoveries underway in Hong Kong and Mainland China. I've also visited the Middle East recently, where I saw strong economy that is well placed to continue to grow. And the U.K. economy is also showing good resilience, and our HSBC U.K. business is performing well.  Investing in growth is critical, and we saw an opportunity to do that by acquiring SVB U.K. For 158 years, HSBC has banked the entrepreneurs who have created today's industrial base. With the SVB U.K. acquisition, we have access to more of the entrepreneurs in the technology and life sciences sectors who will create the businesses of tomorrow.  We believe they are a natural fit for HSBC and that we're well and uniquely placed to take them global. You will have seen the recent hires that we've taken on in the U.S. in that regard and we continue -- and we're going to continue to invest to grow this part of the business on a global basis. We announced that the sale of our French retail bank has become less certain due to significant interest rate rises in France and the related fair value treatment impacting the capital position of the purchaser.  We still believe it's right to sell the business, but we also have to keep our shareholders' interest in mind when negotiating revised terms. We are working with the buyer to try and find a solution for the uncertainty on deal terms and timing has led us to reverse the impairment.  Finally, we made 2 important announcements today. The first was the resumption of quarterly dividends with an interim dividend of $0.10 per share, which is the same level as the last time we paid a first quarterly dividend before COVID.  The second was that good, continued capital generation enabled us to announce the share buyback of up to $2 billion.  Our AGM on Friday will be an important milestone. As you know, resolutions have been tabled by shareholders on the strategy and structure of the bank as well as to fix the dividends. The Board has recommended that shareholders vote against Resolution 17 and 18. I believe our first quarter results reinforce our recommendations and demonstrate that our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to improve returns.  I'll now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Noel, and a warm welcome to all of you. Thank you for being with us on this call today. Let me begin with the first quarter highlights. Profit before tax was $12.9 billion, up $9 billion in the first quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis. This was driven by an $8.6 billion increase in revenue, which includes $2.1 billion from the reversal of the impairment relating to the potential sale of our retail banking operations and plants and a $1.5 billion provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB U.K.  Credit performance was benign with expected credit losses of $0.4 billion. Costs were up 2% in the first quarter against our 2023 target of limiting cost growth to circa 3% on a constant currency basis, and excluding notable items and hyperinflation. Our annualized return on tangible equity was 27.4%, or 19.3%, excluding the gain on SVB U.K. and the part reversal of the impairment on the potential sale of our French retail bank. And as Noel said, we're providing strong capital returns in the form of the first quarter dividend since 2019 of $0.10 per share and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after the AGM and complete in around 3 months.  Going into more detail. Net interest income of $9 billion was up $2.9 billion or 47% on the first quarter of 2022 and was stable on the fourth quarter on an IFRS 17 basis. Non net interest income of $11.2 billion was up $5.7 billion, which includes $3.6 of notable items in the first quarter and was driven by strong performances in Markets & Security Services and in [indiscernible].  Lending balances increased by $32 billion in the quarter on a constant currency basis. This was made up of $25 billion from the reclassification of balances associated with our retail banking operations in France and $7.3 billion from SVB U.K. Deposits also increased in the quarter due to the same factors. If we excluded these items, lending and deposits were both stable. The tax charge of $1.9 billion included a credit of $0.4 billion. And the CET1 ratio was 14.7%, which was an increase of 50 basis points on the fourth quarter and included a 30 basis point gain relating to the part reversal of the France impairment and the SVB U.K. acquisition.  As Noel said, all of our global businesses performed well. This slide gives you the evidence for that. Wealth and Personal Banking had a strong quarter with revenues up 82%. Within this, Wealth was up 13%, driven by the economic resurgence in Asia and increasing traction from the investment we've made in digitization and in people.  Personal Banking also had another good quarter, up 64%, benefiting from our strong deposit franchise. Across both Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, the Global Payment Services had revenues of $4 billion, which was an increase of 176% on the first quarter of 2022.  Global Banking and Markets also performed well overall. Markets & Securities Services revenue, in particular, were up 12%, with a strong performance in foreign exchange. Reported net interest income was $9 billion, which included $1.4 billion of interest expense due to the funding costs booked in Corporate Center to fund the trading . This was offset by $1.4 billion of non-net interest income reported in Corporate Center.  On a reported basis, the net interest margin was up by 50 basis points on the first quarter of last year and up by 1 basis point on the fourth quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, our net interest income guidance is unchanged from our 2022 full year results. On an IFRS 17 basis, we expect to achieve net interest income of at least $34 billion in 2023. This is equivalent to at least $36 billion of net interest income on an IFRS 4 basis, which was what we told you in February.  Our current view is that the things we told you about net interest income at our 2022 full year results remain unchanged. Non-net interest income of $11.2 billion was up substantially by $5.7 billion, which was a combination of, one, $3.6 billion of notable items in the first quarter; two, Global Banking and Markets trading income increase of $0.4 billion; three, a $1.3 billion increase in corporate center income for funding Global Banking and Markets trading activity; and four, other income, which grew by $0.2 billion and included higher wealth revenues.  Fees were broadly stable compared to the first quarter of 2022 with a good payment fee performance, partially offset by lower wealth fees. However, net new invested assets in the quarter were $22 billion and $93 billion for the last 12 months, which bodes well for future growth.  I called out the global business revenue highlights earlier, and there is a detailed non-net interest income breakdown on Slide 17. Our credit performance in the quarter was benign with a $0.4 billion charge for expected credit losses, which was $0.2 billion lower than the first quarter last year. This reflected a favorable shift in the probability weightings of economic downside scenarios as well as low Stage 3 losses.  China CRE was also benign with the small charge relating to technical adjustments to 2 customers. We saw no China CRE default in the quarter for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021, though there were also limited repayments. We are encouraged by the first quarter, but there are still downside risks. So our 2023 guidance remains unchanged at the of around basis points of average gross customer lending, including held-for-sale balances. We will review this at our interim results.  On a constant currency basis and excluding notable items, costs were up by 2% in the first quarter once we also exclude the impact of retranslating prior year costs in hyperinflationary economies at constant currency. As you can see, most of the spend was on technology. We remain committed to limiting cost growth to approximately 3% in 2023 on that basis.  As I shared at the year-end, one of my top priorities is cost discipline. Equally, I also shared that a number of my top priorities is to support our businesses to deliver growth and returns. The acquisition of SVB U.K. was an opportunity to do that. This is expected to result in incremental cost growth of circa 1% to group operating expenses, the majority of which is the acquired cost base of SVB U.K., together with some additional investment in the U.K. and other geographies. This will be in addition to our 2023 target of limiting cost growth to circa 3%.  Finally, at year end, we also flagged $300 million of expected severance costs this year. A large portion of the severance costs are now expected to be incurred in the second quarter with the cost benefits starting to come through in the second half of this year.  Moving on, we usually include information on customer deposits in the appendix, but we have moved it up to the presentation this time because we appreciate the current interest. Overall, customer deposits are stable year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Of the $1.6 trillion of deposits we hold, half are invested in high-quality liquid assets which gives you a sense of our strong liquidity position. This is a historic feature of the way that HSBC manages its balance sheet, and it has not changed.  Around 40% of our high-quality liquid assets are held in cash or cash equivalents. And there are only around $1.4 billion of unrealized losses in our held-to-collect portfolio, which is down from around $1.9 billion at the end of 2022.  Three main points on capital. One, our CET1 ratio was 14.7%, up 50 basis points on the previous quarter, 25 basis points of which was from the reclassification of our French retail business from [indiscernible]. Pending the outcome of negotiations for our French retail bank, there would be a commensurate reduction to CET1 in the event that the deal closes.  Number two, as you know, our business in Canada remains classified as hold for sale and we now expect the transaction to complete in the first quarter of 2024 as we work with the purchaser to ensure a smooth transition. We continue to expect to pay the potential special dividend of $0.21 per share in the first half of 2024. And as previously indicated, we expect almost all excess capital from the Canada transaction accruing into CET1 to be returned to shareholders, primarily through a rolling series of share buybacks in '24 and '25 that would be incremental to any existing buyback program at that time.  Number three, share buybacks remain an active part of our capital management plans. We will update you on our assumptions for share buybacks in 2023 and beyond at our interim results.  So in summary, this was a strong quarter. There was a strong profit performance. Net interest income was stable. Strict cost discipline was maintained, which I told you would remain a key focus area for myself and the management team. Our credit performance was benign amid a more positive economic outlook. We are starting to see the impact of strong economic rebound in Hong Kong and Mainland China, and our wealth strategy is gaining traction. And I am pleased there were strong capital returns a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after the AGM and complete in around 3 months.  As Noel said, we are clearly on track to meet our returns target for 2023 onwards. And this upward trajectory would give us substantial distribution capacity including, of course, the potential proceeds from the Canada transaction.  With that, operator, can we please open it up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Joseph Dickerson with Jefferies.\nJoseph Dickerson: Congrats on a good set of numbers in what wasn't the easiest environment in Q1. Just a quick question on the buyback. You've been very precise in discussing that you would expect to complete the buyback over 3 months. Is this something now we can expect to be a regular quarterly event given the strong capital generation not to mention Canada completing early next year? Or is it going to be slightly more erratic?\nNoel Quinn: Thank you for your question. I'll ask Georges to answer that. Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Joe. Yes, indeed, so first, we are hoping to achieve $2 billion in the next 3 months. In the past, we've managed to achieve between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in the quarter. Obviously, we have 5 months to complete this program. We are hoping to complete it in 3 months.  Going forward, we're certainly considering a rolling series of buybacks in '23, '24, '25. Those will be supported by organic capital generation as well as the Canada sale proceeds in '24. And Joe, it remains our intention to return excess capital, including the Canada proceeds if the conditions justify.\nRichard O'Connor: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Raul Sinha with JPMorgan.\nRaul Sinha: Maybe just to follow up on that capital return question firstly and then I put another one on asset equality. When we look at your headline capital ratio, obviously, it is very strong and quite a significant pickup over the last couple of quarters in particular. I guess there are a few adjusting items in there, should we kind of exclude the French disposal, let's say, reversal from the headline ratio? And I guess if you exclude the share buyback, we kind of get back in your range towards the lower end. So I guess the question is how much RWA growth you anticipate the business to require over the next sort of 12 months and linking to the -- to your loan growth outlook, I was just wondering if you could give us some color on RWA growth expectations there. And that hopefully gives us a good idea of how much buybacks we can expect.  The second one, again, related to how much capital you might be able to generate in the remaining part of the year. your guidance on asset quality still implies quite a significant tick up in provisions given your very strong performance in Q1. So I guess the question really is, are you guiding us to something specific in terms of the 40 basis point provision charge? Or is that just an element of conservatism built in to your guidance there?\nNoel Quinn: Georges, do you want to take both of those? I can always add something to the asset quality later, but you take both first.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure, Noel. Thank you, Raul. So on your first question, Raul, I think it is prudent to adjust for the French part reversal of the impairment. And so far that capital is concerned. As indicated, if we do reach a transaction, there is a likelihood of a commensurate kind of capital reduction taking place. Now just to remind you, our capital target operating range is 14% to 14.5%, and we expect this to be reviewed slightly lower in the medium to long term. And as we do our capital return projections or our share buyback projections, we look at our medium-term capital outlook and compare it to that range. And this is -- obviously cautiously compared to that range. And this is what's giving us now the flexibility to announce the share buyback and to consider additional buybacks going forward.  As regards RWA growth in line with loan growth, it has been subdued in the first quarter. It may remain subdued for another quarter. We may see some pickup, particularly with the Hong Kong and China bounce back. But again, for this year, we have not given guidance on loan growth, recognizing some of the economic conditions. We do remain committed for medium term or mid-single-digit growth in loans for the medium term, which is what you can factor in for RWA growth commensurately and equally for our share buyback.  If I move on to your next question with regards to asset quality. I would lean towards your latter comment, Joe sorry, Raul, that we are baking in some conservatism or we think at this stage, the full year guidance, which we have retained unchanged from February is now leaning towards conservative. Just want to highlight some tailwinds, the -- certainly, the situation in the U.K., the possibility that we make recession is a tailwind. Equally, the recovery in Hong Kong and Mainland China following the opening up of the borders and resumption of activities and trade is a tailwind. But at the same time -- and obviously, the China real estate has shown some positive signs, both from the economic standpoint as well as from the policy measures, but at the same time, we wanted to remain cautious. There are a number of refinancing taking place in Q3 and the China real estate -- commercial real estate portfolio, which we would like to stay cautious on and we continue to watch some of the U.K. SME space, in particular, those heavily reliant on discretionary consumer spend before we revisit the guidance. We intend to revisit this guidance at the H1.\nNoel Quinn: Just one additional comment from me, please, if I can. You'll notice on the capital schedule, I can't remember what slide it was, but there's a capital walk on CET1. And in there, you'll see that we've accrued dividends at 50% of the profit generation in Q1. And if you do the math on that, the accrual on dividend is higher than the $0.10 that you've got in the Q1 declared interim dividend. So we're accruing capital distribution at a higher rate -- dividend distribution on a higher rate than the payment of the $0.10. So that's just factored into our CET1 ratio as well.\nRichard O'Connor: Next question please.\nOperator: And the next question today comes from Manus Costello with Autonomous.\nManus Costello: A couple, please. On that slide, you were talking about all about the RWA walk. I noticed that the risk-weighted assets from Silicon Valley just short of $10 million, which seems quite high relative to the loans that you've taken on. I wondered if you could share with us what the nature of those assets is and give us some indication about asset quality within the Silicon Valley Bank acquisition from what you've seen so far?  And then secondly, with the thought to the structure of the group, you've obviously showed some willingness to make some acquisitions recently and indeed do some disposals where possible. I just wondered if there will be any interest in further moves. In particular, I'm wondering if there would be anything around some of your businesses, such as insurance manufacturing, which you might think about being going forward?\nNoel Quinn: Thank you. Thanks, Manus. Just on the asset quality of the -- everything that we've seen since we bought the business, I don't know, lost track of time must be about 6, 7 weeks ago now. It's been a busy quarter. Everything we've seen reinforces the view that we had on that weekend when we did due diligence. The book was a good quality book. We've seen no nasty surprises. We did do a bit of mark-to-market on acquisition [indiscernible] but that was -- we were -- that was evident to us when we did due diligence that weekend. Georges can give you a little bit more detail on that. But fundamentally, the asset quality of the SVB book is as we expected it. The team have done a good job in building that business over the past 14 years. They've got good client relations, good quality book and good business development potential.  And on the back of that, we decided to invest in putting more people on the ground in some of the key markets around the world that have strong technology and life science centers to take that business model not just to the U.K., but take it globally. So we're investing in that as well. So [indiscernible] surprises on that and then in terms of other acquisitions that we may consider or M&A activity, I mean, I think the insurance business is a key component of the wealth proposition that we have. We have a very profitable insurance business in Hong Kong. It's a combination of manufacturing and distribution. The team has done a good job in building out the product lineup in Hong Kong over the past few years to put us back into a market-leading position in Hong Kong, and we get access to the full value chain.  One of the challenges we've often faced in the past is getting full recognition of that value as a bank shareholder in an asset -- in an insurance manufacturing business. But you can rest assured the economics of that business are very strong and we've got a market-leading position. So we obviously, like all businesses, keep the strategy under review. And if we think there's a better position to take, we'll take it. But at the moment, we're pleased with the way the insurance business is performing. Georges, was there anything else you wanted to add.\nGeorges Elhedery: Maybe just getting some of the math. So we acquired a loan book that is just shy of GBP 6 billion. That's about $8 billion. We've acquired $10 billion of RWA. So if you consider those loans and some of the additional RWAs on treasury books, operation risk, et cetera. You kind of land on these numbers, and Manus, we also acquired $1.5 billion of capital after the fair value adjustment. So you're talking about effectively a 15% CET1 ratio business that we acquired. So we think it is where it should be.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Omar Keenan with Credit Suisse.\nOmar Keenan: I just had a quick question on rate sensitivity. And if I look at your rate sensitivity, at the end of '22, it looks like you've been quite purposefully bringing down your rate sensitivity on the year 1 view. And I was hoping you could perhaps give us a little bit of color of the direction that sensitivity over 1 year has changed in the first couple of months of the year. Can we assume that some of the structural hedges have been further increased and when we see the sensitivity of the , it might have reduced further. Any kind of color with that respect would be really helpful.\nNoel Quinn: Georges, do you want to answer that?\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Thank you, Omar. So we -- at the end of 2022, the rate sensitivity on the downside 100 basis point scenario was reduced from around $6 billion at the half year to around $4 billion. The -- that $2 billion reduction for the NII sensitivity reduction for 100 basis points is for about 1/3 of it justified by the structural hedges that we started putting in place or that we continue putting in place as of last year and 2/3 of it is due to the fact that we are at just higher level of rates and therefore, we have less convexity -- negative complexity on the downside.  If you look into Q1, we have not published a revised rate sensitivity but we continued the trajectory of our structural hedges. Now just as a reminder, structural hedges will reduce somewhat our rate sensitivity. And our target is to take that $4 billion in the medium term to circa $3 billion. Well -- and we are on that journey. We certainly have not arrived there. We'll be giving you an update at H1. Omar, I think I've addressed your points.\nRichard O'Connor: Next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Perlie Mong with KBW.\nPerlie Mong: I've got two questions. The first one is, obviously, the [indiscernible] was very strong and a lot of it comes from noninterest income. And it appears that a lot of this is from commercial banking and maybe some from global banking and markets. How much of that do you think is sustainable? Presumably, you wouldn't encourage us to analyze the whole lot. So how much of that do you think is sustainable? And secondly is, I guess, on the AGM on Friday, so I guess a lot of the attention on Friday will be around the debate you are having with and they obviously recently published an announcement that made some , especially around your cost income ratio and ROTE. Well, you've obviously pointed very strong numbers today. But in some ways, we have guided to a lot of it already, especially around cost. And I'm sure you've also been communicating with them anyway. So why do you think those critics were still made?\nNoel Quinn: Okay. I'll deal with the second one later. I'll ask Georges to deal with the non-NII first, if that's okay.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. So we expecting many of you will adjust your full year numbers to reflect our Q1 outperformance and that's a fair assessment Perlie. But I would caution you not to annualize Q1, so if I just unpack it, the non-NII relating to the funding of our trading activities, $1.4 billion is fairly reasonable to assume this number will annualize. The went business, obviously, with the outlook improving in wealth fairly reasonable to assume we will see regain traction and bounce back, in particular, in Hong Kong, whereas some of the other activities such as the foreign exchange trading outperformance. I would caution you not to annualize this number and just to bake it in as a Q1 outcome and then Q2, Q3, we'll see how they .\nNoel Quinn: So just on the -- and on the wealth performance, you said most of the non-NII was CMB and GB&M. I think it's also fair to say that in WPB, the wealth business performed well in Q1. Average revenue was up 13% in Q1 relative to Q1 last year. So I think what Georges is saying is, I think we've seen a recovery taking place in that wealth revenue. We're not expecting that to just be a Q1 phenomenon. That is something that will continue in Q2 and Q3 and Q4, but it's still early days to predict whether the 13% is an annual number or it's higher than that or lower than that. So -- but we don't expect it to disappear in Q2, Q3 or Q4. So there should be a level of annualization on that as well in the WPB-non-NII line.  With respect to the AGM comment, look, I think we've said for a while that we believe the safest and fastest way to achieve higher returns, better performance, better dividends and capital generation was the existing strategy. I think the Q1 results provides a lot of evidence that, that is the fact that, that is the best way. We guided the market over the last 12 months to a 12%-plus ROTE. I did emphasize at the year-end that we should focus on the plus, not the 12. And I think you see even excluding the notable items, we've done a ROTE of 19.3%. I would just draw attention to the fact that in that ROTE of $19.3 million, there is a tax credit, and Georges can probably cover that as well. That tax credit is not something that will repeat every quarter. But even if you adjust for that, it's still a very healthy return on tangible equity.  So I think it's in the -- what we're focused on is driving performance on behalf of all our shareholders, and we believe doing what we've done is the best way to get improved returns, improve performance rather than some more radical corporate restructuring action. So we believe Q1 is strong evidence of that. But Georges, you just want to clarify the tax situation.\nGeorges Elhedery: So then we've basically shown $1.9 billion as a tax charge, which is an effective tax rate of 14%, but I just want to caution you that 3.3% relate to the provisional gain on SVB, which is a nontaxable item. and another 3.3% related to the release of provisions for uncertain tax provisions, which is also a one-off item; so therefore, if you adjusted for those 2, we still expect a 20% ETR guidance for the rest of the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Coombs with Citi.\nAndrew Coombs: One strategic question and then 1 question. On the strategic question, if the proposed French retail sale no longer goes ahead, what would be the plan? Would you put it back on the block again? Or would there be a plan to reabsorb it into the broader HSBC Group [indiscernible] you can sell on planned for France, given that sale process and where it's got to.  Secondly, on cost, you've acted a very good cost print this quarter, you're down 2% year-on-year on a constant currency basis, and yet you're still guiding to 3% cost growth or 4% with SVB U.K. So is this a timing issue? Is it a case of the wage inflation come through from Q2? Anything you can elaborate there?\nNoel Quinn: Two good questions, and Georges will cover the second one. I'll cover the first one. I think, listen, we still believe that a sale of the French retail business is the right strategic outcome that business probably has a stronger future in another hands. However, we have been in discussions for a few weeks now with the current buyer to try and overcome the challenge they have on their acquisition accounting impact on their capital base. We'll continue that dialogue. We're hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable settlement with them on that, but we can't be guaranteed of that outcome. We have to consider what is financially the right decision for all shareholders, and it's hopeful that we can reach an agreement, but it's not guaranteed.  In the event we can't, then I still think we'll continue to run the business, but I still think over time, we wouldn't see that as a long-term strategic hold, but we'll have to wait and see what happens thereafter. We're very much focused on trying to reach an agreement with the current buyer to bring that transaction to a close. So that's the update I have for you. On costs, I'll hand over to Georges.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Thank you, Noel, and thank you, Andrew, for the question. So our reported costs on a constant currency basis is down 2% Q1 last year to Q1 this year. If you adjust for notables, and remember, last year Q1, we had $450 million of additional cost due to the CTA program. So if you extract that notable item from last year's base, our reported cost adjusted for notable will show us up 2% Q1 to Q1. This is the basis on which we're measuring ourselves for this year. And it's on that basis where we would -- we are targeting to achieve a 3% annualized number, where we -- our quarter 1 basically is coming in at 2%. Now why from 2 to 3, I just want to highlight a few things. The first one is we still haven't incurred by and large, the severance costs, which we announced at the year-end and now we expect to incur the majority of it in Q2 this year. And the second element, just to highlight is that some of the pay increases have only been factored partially in Q1, starting March and we'll start kind of being fully factored in from Q2 onwards. And this is why our 3% target for the full year is where it is. And as you said, Andrew, and just for avoidance of any doubt here, the acquired cost of SVB and some of the additional investments we need to do there will add another 1% to that 3% target.\nNoel Quinn: So just a couple of additional comments for me. We -- on the -- that reconciliation between the headline reporting number and the cost target, what we're trying to do is be very straightforward and not try and bake in what as a CTA last year to this year. So we're adjusting down the prior year reported number for the notable CTA last year. So that the cost target of 3% is on an apples-and-apples basis with the cost base of this year. So we're not looking to take an easy option on that. We think it's the right thing to do, but as we say, we're 2% against the 3% target in Q1.  And then on SVB, I just want to clarify as well, the SVB business we bought, we acquired a cost base with that, and we acquired a revenue stream and that revenue stream was in excess of the cost base. So we've acquired a positive P&L that was contributing, if I remember correctly, around about $80 million to $90 million of , so although we've acquired 300 -- sorry, we acquired the majority of the $300 million is the acquired cost base of SVB. It is a profitable cost base.\nGeorges Elhedery: Andy, just to finish off, we provided the reconciliation on Slide 30 to show you the walk from reported cost to our cost target, and we will be showing this slide every quarter.\nOperator: Next question comes from Guy Stebbings with BNP Paribas Exane.\nGuy Stebbings: One on interest margin and one back on SVB. So on NIM, I guess the U.K. bank did quite a lot of heavy lift in this quarter, allowing for 1 basis point of sequential growth. As we look ahead, perhaps that tailwind , at least in quantum. So is that going to make it tricky from here to deliver NIM sustainability? Or is the drop in HBAP and the headwind from deposit mix, in particular, likely to fade in your view to allow for some sort of stable NIM backdrop?  And then the second question on SVB. In addition to the acquired cost base, you flagged incremental investment spend and plans to build the business outside the U.K. So could you talk about sort of associated revenue ambitions and what sort of time frame you expect to see notable uplift there. I mean sort of how big a shift in that $80 million to $90 million PBT reference, could we see of SVBs and HSBC with that incremental investment?\nNoel Quinn: Okay. I'll take the second in a moment. I'll ask Georges to go on the NIM, please, and U.K. ring-fenced bank.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Thanks, No. Thanks, Guy. So indeed, you did call out the headwinds -- the possibility of headwinds in the U.K. Obviously, there may be still 1 or 2 rate hikes for which we will be passing most of that to customers through [indiscernible] rate. And we do see continued headwinds in Hong Kong with around 1% per month migration into term deposit with the mix now at 25% term deposits across both our entities in Hong Kong. This being said, we also have tailwinds. The first one is we still have a strong momentum from Q1, which we're carrying over. The second tailwind is HIBOR normalization. I mean, just for reference, in Hong Kong, HIBOR and exchange fund bill rates in Q1 were 65 and 35 basis points lower on average than where they were in Q4, and that was a major headwind for us in Q1.  We are seeing now over the last few weeks, we have been seeing normalization in those rates. If we continue to see normalization and just for a reminder, we have about 200 basis points of their equivalent rates in dollars. If we continue to see normalization, this will provide us material tailwinds in the Hong Kong base. And the other tailwind is our resilient deposit and loan base, we continue having stable deposits and loans despite the -- some of the competitive pressures, and we continue to aim for mid-single-digit growth in both in the medium term, which should give us some supportive tailwinds.\nNoel Quinn: So just to reinforce what we said at the full year results in February, we said to -- we noted the guidance that was in existence when we reported in February, and we said we were more uncomfortable -- sorry, with the consensus that we noted the consensus that was in existence in February. And we said we were not uncomfortable with where consensus was. We still have that view. The only adjustment you need to make to NII is for the IFRS 17 adjustment. Everything else remains as we said in February, the guidance that existed at that point in time, we were not uncomfortable with it. The same is true today, just adjust for IFRS 17, which is around about a $2 billion adjustment from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17. That's the only change that needs to be made based on what we've given you as an update today.  And then on SVB, we acquired -- sorry, we recruited 40 people -- over 40 people in the U.S. to build out our SVB capability in the U.S. It will -- we did not bring a book with them, purchaser book. So they will be in build-out mode, so there will be a payback period on that investment. We think it's a relatively short payback period based on the quality of people we've hired. We're looking at other geographies around the world. We think it's a sensible and modest investment to do that organically. And we're pretty confident on the payback. We'll be relatively sure. We'll provide more details once we complete that buildout. Hopefully, by the half year, we'll be able to give you more information.  So there will be a profit drag to a degree, probably in the first year or 18 months, but then I think it will be back into profit territory even on those organic build-out strategies. But we'll give more of an update at the half year. I think strategically, it's absolutely the right thing to do for the medium term. This is a sector of the economy that is critical for all geographies and has huge growth potential on revenue.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Noble with Deutsche Bank.\nRobert Noble: Most of the questions have been answered. If you could just talk about the LCR, it's relatively low in a European context, mostly your deposit base is a different kind of structure. You have been running with that level in the medium term with the uncertainty in the market? And how do you expect the regulation or approach or liquidity to change given what's happened in the U.S.\nNoel Quinn: Georges, do you want to handle that?\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Thank you, Rob. So we don't target LCR. We are continuing to target medium-term single to mid-digit loan growth in our portfolio. And we obviously continue to cherish deposits and attract and continue wanting to attract deposits. The LCR would be an outcome I think that we look at our liquidity management, it's the high-quality liquid assets ratio that we look at is the cash and cash equivalent within it that we look at. And in terms of loans, again, if the short term is somewhat subdued in particular in Hong Kong, in the medium term, some of the bounce back and some of the trade bounce back that we're seeing as well may support that loan growth ambition in the medium term.\nNoel Quinn: And I think on the regulation impact, I think we have to wait and see what the various regulators around the world do regulation, but I think the way I look at it, the primary responsibility for running a prudent balance sheet is on the management and the board of financial institution. That's a responsibility we've taken seriously throughout our history. Our high-quality liquid asset has been a feature of our heritage, our high-quality cash and cash equivalents has been a feature of our heritage for many decades. So we put the primary responsibility on liquidity management on ourselves, and then we'll see what the regulatory environment does as a consequence of some of the recent changes.\nOperator: Next question is from Aman Rakkar with Barclays.\nAmandeep Rakkar: I just need to come back to revenues. Both your net interest income and your noninterest income are performing really well in Q1 and they are annualizing at levels that would suggest pretty material upside to market expectations for both of those lines. Your net interest income is annualizing north of $36 billion on the Q1 number. Your guide is obviously greater than $34 billion. I appreciate there's lots of moving parts here, but I guess, to be more specific, in terms of your commentary around consensus at full year and now, there's a kind of $1.7 billion gap between where the Street is and what you're guiding for, the Street is $35.7 billion. It doesn't actually sound like you see much downside to that consensus number at $35.7 billion unless there's something here around term deposit mix or -- it feels like there's a lot of conservatism in the NII guidance or there's something I'm missing. So can you help us with that?  And then secondly, on the noninterest income, I totally appreciate your markets business might have overrun in Q1, but you are also pointing towards a wealth management business that's trending higher and underlying momentum in our your fee businesses, you talked about strategic initiatives at full year sit behind that. So to what extent is that revenue number and overearn? Or is this the kind of of level that we can expect you to crank out in the year because this is well ahead of where the Street is? Any color you can give us there would be really helpful.\nNoel Quinn: Two good questions. And let me just clarify what I said about what we said in February. I think you're right on your math. I think if you go back to what we said in February, there was -- we talked about $36 billion plus. And when people were talking about our NII, there was sort of annualizing it to about $38 billion and the consensus was around $37 billion to $37.5 billion. And I think we said we were comfortable with that. So I think if you go back to then, we sort of said, yes, we're sort of comfortable that consensus had a calculation on the plus bid of the $36 billion. They'll put it sort of north of $37 billion. That was around about consensus back then. And all I'm saying to you now is the only thing you need to adjust for is IFRS 17, which takes about $2 billion off of that. So we're talking about $34 billion plus and that, therefore, would put you north of $35 billion. So I think what we're saying is there should -- we're sort of saying the Street has probably got NII around about the right place back in February of last year. And we're saying there's no need to change what the Street is. You only got to do the mechanical adjustment for IFRS 17. Hopefully, that helps.  And then, Georges, I think do you want to just come back on the non-NII, because I think -- you're right, there's elements of our non-NII performance in Q1. So Georges is saying annualized. There are just some elements that are saying it may be unwise to annualize them fully for some of the trading income. Georges, do you just want to reclarify what you said.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure, Noel. So Aman if I kind of unpack the non-NII, some of the outperformance that we've seen with regards to funding of the trading book, where we've seen $1.4 billion this quarter against $0.1 billion quarter 1 last year because rates were at 0, but against $1.3 billion quarter 4, so somewhat flat to just slightly up from quarter 4. That number is -- it is fair to annualize it given current rate forecast consensus.  Equally, as Noel mentioned earlier, the discussion on wealth, the growth in in wealth, the resumption of activity in Hong Kong, in particular, bodes well for the future. And I think it is fair to assume that we will see continued performance in wealth.  On the other hand, some of the outperformance in some of the market activities such as foreign exchange trading, which had a record quarter, it may not be repeated. And obviously, we will have to look at it quarter-by-quarter in terms of what the business opportunities are there. And while you can bake in and factor in the results, the Q1 outperformance, I would caution you not to annualize that outperformance, but in general, if I take a step back, it is a good set of results and we are confident about the future. And in light of the strong Q1 performance, we will have to review and we will review the guidance in H1.\nOperator: That comes from Martin Leitgeb with Goldman Sachs.\nMartin Leitgeb: First of all, congratulations with this good set of results. I just have one broader question on growth and one follow-up on deposits, please. Just looking at a much improved profitability levels of the group, with an being around $2 billion to $3 billion of the quarter, this great capacity to scale up growth. And I was just wondering if we look into the medium term or starting '24. Do you see the goal for the group to lean more into growth so that mid-single-digit loan growth could potentially be higher? Or should we just think that any increasing profitability could be essentially a return to shareholders just in terms of the trade-off between opportunity for growing more versus shareholder return.  And secondly, with regards to the deposit trends. I was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of [indiscernible] deposit franchise during the quarter. Have you seen, in particular, inflows in certain parts of your footprint helping delivering that stable deposit [indiscernible] in the quarter. And it was also wondering with regards to deposit migration into time, whether you have seen any change in trend. If this we towards the end of that cycle in terms of deposit migration? Or could this still go on for a number of quarters?\nNoel Quinn: Okay. Just a couple of comments. One comment from me on growth. Listen, I think, clearly, we want to pursue growth, but I think we have the capacity in our dividend payout ratio of 50% to pursue growth and with the option of doing buybacks as well. Now at the moment, I think we've seen a relatively subdued lending market in corporate banking. I think the demand for term loans around the world is not particularly high at the moment and probably isn't going to be particularly high in the very near term.  As Georges said earlier, I mean, once we get to 2024, one would expect there to be an increase in demand starting to emerge. But for the near term, for the next few months in '23, given the economic uncertainty, we're seeing subdued loan demand. So I think the message I'd give you, in a 50% payout ratio world, we believe the second 50% after we pay the dividend, there is potential to fund both growth and buybacks. And that's our plans going forward. Georges, do you want to just cover the deposit trend, the inflows, the outflows and deposit migration.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure, Martin. So yes, if I start with some of the outflows that we're seeing and then I go into the tailwind. So some of the outflows we're seeing particularly in the U.K., so obviously, U.K. retail, Q1 is a tax payment period. So there is seasonality here. We are still seeing high cost of living resilient inflation in the U.K., which is obviously draining some of the U.K. consumers savings, to a lesser extent, competitive pressure as well in the U.K. Likewise, for corporates in the U.K., Q4 was at year-end where people showed up their liquidity, whereas Q1, most of the companies pay dividend. And then you can see some of the draining liquidity, we're also seeing deleveraging of loans using some of the deposits to deleverage on the loan side, especially for those with a strong rate differential between what they're paying on their loans.  This being said, we continue to see growth and strength in the deposit proposition. So if I take Hong Kong and all of Asia, actually, we've seen definite deposit growth in the retail and the personnel banking space. We have seen 5% growth of our deposit base in Commercial Banking in the U.S. So we were one of the beneficiary banks of the deposit migration from medium-sized banks into large banks. And we obviously continue to cherish our propositions and deposits to continue attracting deposits at the right price.\nOperator: We will take our last question today from Tom Rayner with Numis.\nTom Rayner: Two, please. First one, just on the loan growth. I mean, you flagged the corporate demand and maybe that is the answer. I was just going to ask, could you quite upbeat on the economic recovery you're seeing now in Hong Kong and China and the U.K., I think you said it was quite resilient. So is there any other reason why you're so sort of cautious in the short term on loan growth? Or is it purely a lack of demand from corporate? And a second question on costs, please.\nNoel Quinn: Okay. What's your question on costs? Do you want.\nTom Rayner: Yes. I mean really, it's sort of looking at 3% target for this year and thinking forward to next year because I guess you're still enjoying some of the flow-through this year from cost savings from the previous cost program, which has now ended. So I just wondered if you or Georges, would comment on your sort of approach towards costs in 2024, whether you'll be thinking in terms of an absolute growth may be similar to this year or whether a jaws approach might be more appropriate. I don't know if there's anything -- any color you could add for the next year.\nNoel Quinn: Just on loan growth, listen, I think your point is a fair one. I think if there is a place where I think loan growth could pick up more in the near term, I think it would be Asia. I think Middle East is another option. So I think I am being a bit cautious on the near-term loan growth. I think probably it will start to emerge more in the working capital side of the balance sheet, trade finance, before people start investing in fixed capital. But I think there is a level of nervousness out there in the corporate world about taking long-term investment decisions in fixed capital, that is aside from sustainability. I think there's a lot of infrastructure spend taking place, and I could see some loan growth coming in and around that sustainable infrastructure investment. So maybe I am being a bit cautious on loan growth at the moment. I think I'd rather be that way in the near term. But I don't think -- I do believe there's going to be medium-term loan growth. But I think it is fair to say that Asia has the potential to pick up faster than elsewhere in the world. So yes, I think it may be fair that I'm being a bit cautious.\nGeorges Elhedery: If I kind of just adding to Noel's comments, Tom, if you look at Hong Kong, in the retail space, both cards and mortgages have been growing in the first quarter. Even in the U.K., we are seeing green shoots in the mortgage sector. I mean, our market share in the mortgage sector in the U.K. for the first 2 months of the year is that 15%, that's for new business. That's against the book market share of about 7.5% and the Q4 new business market share of 9%. So we're certainly there in the retail space where we're seeing growth.  On the wholesale side, I just want to add 1 comment to description, which is also bear in mind the rate differential between China and Hong Kong. So all those Chinese companies who used to use Hong Kong as a base for raising funding internationally will be less doing so as long as the rate differential between dollar rates and China rate are that wide. It is cheaper for these corporates to raise funding in Mainland China as opposed to Hong Kong, and that will remain the case up until the time we see a reversal in that rate trend.  If I move to your second question, Tom, we have not shared targets for 2024 as yet, but the few guiding principles I can share with you, the first guiding principle, paramount guiding principal is that you should expect our focus on cost discipline to continue. The second guiding principle is that we will continue doing transformation and restructuring as part of our BAU cost base and expect some of those sales to flow through also into 2024 and beyond. And case in point is the spend on severance, which we're planning now to do in Q2 this year for which the benefit will flow through mostly in 2024.  And thirdly, at this stage, we're still looking to guide towards a dollar cost number as opposed to and the way we will be looking at 2024 as we come to be able to give you additional guidance later in the year.\nNoel Quinn: So thank you all for your questions. Really appreciate you taking the time to close our first quarter results, I just want to say that the first quarter results provide further evidence that our strategy is working. We had a strong first quarter profit performance. Cost discipline remains tight, and we're clearly on track to deliver our target. We've resumed quarterly dividends and announced a share buyback of up to $2 billion, but I'm also confident about the rest of 2023. We built a strong platform for future growth and our geographical footprint puts us in areas of high growth. I look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a good morning or afternoon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the call for HSBC Holdings plc Q1 2023 results. You may now disconnect.",

        "text": "Thanks, Richard, and good morning in London, good afternoon in Hong Kong, and thank you for joining our first quarter results call. Georges is going to lead the presentation, but I'd like to make some opening comments.  We've announced a strong set of Q1 results. We delivered a strong profit performance, which was spread across all our major geographies. All 3 global businesses performed well and cost discipline remained tight.  In the first quarter, excluding the gain on SVB U.K. and the part reversal of the impairments on the potential sale of our French retail bank, we delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 19.3%, so our strategy is working.  I'm also confident about the future for 2 main reasons: First, we have built a good platform for growth. We have a strong balance sheet, broad-based geographic profit generation, a good combination of net interest income and non-net interest income and a tight grip on costs. This growth potential was evidenced in the inflow of new invested assets of $22 billion in the quarter with a cumulative $93 billion over the last 12 months, which shows that our wealth strategy is continuing to gain traction. And you have my commitment that we will continue to drive strong performance for the rest of the year, while maintaining cost discipline and investing in growth.  The second reason I'm confident is the diversity and connectivity of our geographical footprint, where we have access to markets that are exhibiting good growth and return potential. I've seen firsthand the strong economic recoveries underway in Hong Kong and Mainland China. I've also visited the Middle East recently, where I saw strong economy that is well placed to continue to grow. And the U.K. economy is also showing good resilience, and our HSBC U.K. business is performing well.  Investing in growth is critical, and we saw an opportunity to do that by acquiring SVB U.K. For 158 years, HSBC has banked the entrepreneurs who have created today's industrial base. With the SVB U.K. acquisition, we have access to more of the entrepreneurs in the technology and life sciences sectors who will create the businesses of tomorrow.  We believe they are a natural fit for HSBC and that we're well and uniquely placed to take them global. You will have seen the recent hires that we've taken on in the U.S. in that regard and we continue -- and we're going to continue to invest to grow this part of the business on a global basis. We announced that the sale of our French retail bank has become less certain due to significant interest rate rises in France and the related fair value treatment impacting the capital position of the purchaser.  We still believe it's right to sell the business, but we also have to keep our shareholders' interest in mind when negotiating revised terms. We are working with the buyer to try and find a solution for the uncertainty on deal terms and timing has led us to reverse the impairment.  Finally, we made 2 important announcements today. The first was the resumption of quarterly dividends with an interim dividend of $0.10 per share, which is the same level as the last time we paid a first quarterly dividend before COVID.  The second was that good, continued capital generation enabled us to announce the share buyback of up to $2 billion.  Our AGM on Friday will be an important milestone. As you know, resolutions have been tabled by shareholders on the strategy and structure of the bank as well as to fix the dividends. The Board has recommended that shareholders vote against Resolution 17 and 18. I believe our first quarter results reinforce our recommendations and demonstrate that our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to improve returns.  I'll now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Noel, and a warm welcome to all of you. Thank you for being with us on this call today. Let me begin with the first quarter highlights. Profit before tax was $12.9 billion, up $9 billion in the first quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis. This was driven by an $8.6 billion increase in revenue, which includes $2.1 billion from the reversal of the impairment relating to the potential sale of our retail banking operations and plants and a $1.5 billion provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB U.K.  Credit performance was benign with expected credit losses of $0.4 billion. Costs were up 2% in the first quarter against our 2023 target of limiting cost growth to circa 3% on a constant currency basis, and excluding notable items and hyperinflation. Our annualized return on tangible equity was 27.4%, or 19.3%, excluding the gain on SVB U.K. and the part reversal of the impairment on the potential sale of our French retail bank. And as Noel said, we're providing strong capital returns in the form of the first quarter dividend since 2019 of $0.10 per share and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after the AGM and complete in around 3 months.  Going into more detail. Net interest income of $9 billion was up $2.9 billion or 47% on the first quarter of 2022 and was stable on the fourth quarter on an IFRS 17 basis. Non net interest income of $11.2 billion was up $5.7 billion, which includes $3.6 of notable items in the first quarter and was driven by strong performances in Markets & Security Services and in [indiscernible].  Lending balances increased by $32 billion in the quarter on a constant currency basis. This was made up of $25 billion from the reclassification of balances associated with our retail banking operations in France and $7.3 billion from SVB U.K. Deposits also increased in the quarter due to the same factors. If we excluded these items, lending and deposits were both stable. The tax charge of $1.9 billion included a credit of $0.4 billion. And the CET1 ratio was 14.7%, which was an increase of 50 basis points on the fourth quarter and included a 30 basis point gain relating to the part reversal of the France impairment and the SVB U.K. acquisition.  As Noel said, all of our global businesses performed well. This slide gives you the evidence for that. Wealth and Personal Banking had a strong quarter with revenues up 82%. Within this, Wealth was up 13%, driven by the economic resurgence in Asia and increasing traction from the investment we've made in digitization and in people.  Personal Banking also had another good quarter, up 64%, benefiting from our strong deposit franchise. Across both Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, the Global Payment Services had revenues of $4 billion, which was an increase of 176% on the first quarter of 2022.  Global Banking and Markets also performed well overall. Markets & Securities Services revenue, in particular, were up 12%, with a strong performance in foreign exchange. Reported net interest income was $9 billion, which included $1.4 billion of interest expense due to the funding costs booked in Corporate Center to fund the trading . This was offset by $1.4 billion of non-net interest income reported in Corporate Center.  On a reported basis, the net interest margin was up by 50 basis points on the first quarter of last year and up by 1 basis point on the fourth quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, our net interest income guidance is unchanged from our 2022 full year results. On an IFRS 17 basis, we expect to achieve net interest income of at least $34 billion in 2023. This is equivalent to at least $36 billion of net interest income on an IFRS 4 basis, which was what we told you in February.  Our current view is that the things we told you about net interest income at our 2022 full year results remain unchanged. Non-net interest income of $11.2 billion was up substantially by $5.7 billion, which was a combination of, one, $3.6 billion of notable items in the first quarter; two, Global Banking and Markets trading income increase of $0.4 billion; three, a $1.3 billion increase in corporate center income for funding Global Banking and Markets trading activity; and four, other income, which grew by $0.2 billion and included higher wealth revenues.  Fees were broadly stable compared to the first quarter of 2022 with a good payment fee performance, partially offset by lower wealth fees. However, net new invested assets in the quarter were $22 billion and $93 billion for the last 12 months, which bodes well for future growth.  I called out the global business revenue highlights earlier, and there is a detailed non-net interest income breakdown on Slide 17. Our credit performance in the quarter was benign with a $0.4 billion charge for expected credit losses, which was $0.2 billion lower than the first quarter last year. This reflected a favorable shift in the probability weightings of economic downside scenarios as well as low Stage 3 losses.  China CRE was also benign with the small charge relating to technical adjustments to 2 customers. We saw no China CRE default in the quarter for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021, though there were also limited repayments. We are encouraged by the first quarter, but there are still downside risks. So our 2023 guidance remains unchanged at the of around basis points of average gross customer lending, including held-for-sale balances. We will review this at our interim results.  On a constant currency basis and excluding notable items, costs were up by 2% in the first quarter once we also exclude the impact of retranslating prior year costs in hyperinflationary economies at constant currency. As you can see, most of the spend was on technology. We remain committed to limiting cost growth to approximately 3% in 2023 on that basis.  As I shared at the year-end, one of my top priorities is cost discipline. Equally, I also shared that a number of my top priorities is to support our businesses to deliver growth and returns. The acquisition of SVB U.K. was an opportunity to do that. This is expected to result in incremental cost growth of circa 1% to group operating expenses, the majority of which is the acquired cost base of SVB U.K., together with some additional investment in the U.K. and other geographies. This will be in addition to our 2023 target of limiting cost growth to circa 3%.  Finally, at year end, we also flagged $300 million of expected severance costs this year. A large portion of the severance costs are now expected to be incurred in the second quarter with the cost benefits starting to come through in the second half of this year.  Moving on, we usually include information on customer deposits in the appendix, but we have moved it up to the presentation this time because we appreciate the current interest. Overall, customer deposits are stable year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Of the $1.6 trillion of deposits we hold, half are invested in high-quality liquid assets which gives you a sense of our strong liquidity position. This is a historic feature of the way that HSBC manages its balance sheet, and it has not changed.  Around 40% of our high-quality liquid assets are held in cash or cash equivalents. And there are only around $1.4 billion of unrealized losses in our held-to-collect portfolio, which is down from around $1.9 billion at the end of 2022.  Three main points on capital. One, our CET1 ratio was 14.7%, up 50 basis points on the previous quarter, 25 basis points of which was from the reclassification of our French retail business from [indiscernible]. Pending the outcome of negotiations for our French retail bank, there would be a commensurate reduction to CET1 in the event that the deal closes.  Number two, as you know, our business in Canada remains classified as hold for sale and we now expect the transaction to complete in the first quarter of 2024 as we work with the purchaser to ensure a smooth transition. We continue to expect to pay the potential special dividend of $0.21 per share in the first half of 2024. And as previously indicated, we expect almost all excess capital from the Canada transaction accruing into CET1 to be returned to shareholders, primarily through a rolling series of share buybacks in '24 and '25 that would be incremental to any existing buyback program at that time.  Number three, share buybacks remain an active part of our capital management plans. We will update you on our assumptions for share buybacks in 2023 and beyond at our interim results.  So in summary, this was a strong quarter. There was a strong profit performance. Net interest income was stable. Strict cost discipline was maintained, which I told you would remain a key focus area for myself and the management team. Our credit performance was benign amid a more positive economic outlook. We are starting to see the impact of strong economic rebound in Hong Kong and Mainland China, and our wealth strategy is gaining traction. And I am pleased there were strong capital returns a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after the AGM and complete in around 3 months.  As Noel said, we are clearly on track to meet our returns target for 2023 onwards. And this upward trajectory would give us substantial distribution capacity including, of course, the potential proceeds from the Canada transaction.  With that, operator, can we please open it up for questions. Thank you."

Going forward, we're certainly considering a rolling series of buybacks in '23, '24, '25. Those will be supported by organic capital generation as well as the Canada sale proceeds in '24. And Joe, it remains our intention to return excess capital, including the Canada proceeds if the conditions justify."

        "text": "Maybe just to follow up on that capital return question firstly and then I put another one on asset equality. When we look at your headline capital ratio, obviously, it is very strong and quite a significant pickup over the last couple of quarters in particular. I guess there are a few adjusting items in there, should we kind of exclude the French disposal, let's say, reversal from the headline ratio? And I guess if you exclude the share buyback, we kind of get back in your range towards the lower end. So I guess the question is how much RWA growth you anticipate the business to require over the next sort of 12 months and linking to the -- to your loan growth outlook, I was just wondering if you could give us some color on RWA growth expectations there. And that hopefully gives us a good idea of how much buybacks we can expect.  The second one, again, related to how much capital you might be able to generate in the remaining part of the year. your guidance on asset quality still implies quite a significant tick up in provisions given your very strong performance in Q1. So I guess the question really is, are you guiding us to something specific in terms of the 40 basis point provision charge? Or is that just an element of conservatism built in to your guidance there?"

        "text": "Sure, Noel. Thank you, Raul. So on your first question, Raul, I think it is prudent to adjust for the French part reversal of the impairment. And so far that capital is concerned. As indicated, if we do reach a transaction, there is a likelihood of a commensurate kind of capital reduction taking place. Now just to remind you, our capital target operating range is 14% to 14.5%, and we expect this to be reviewed slightly lower in the medium to long term. And as we do our capital return projections or our share buyback projections, we look at our medium-term capital outlook and compare it to that range. And this is -- obviously cautiously compared to that range. And this is what's giving us now the flexibility to announce the share buyback and to consider additional buybacks going forward.  As regards RWA growth in line with loan growth, it has been subdued in the first quarter. It may remain subdued for another quarter. We may see some pickup, particularly with the Hong Kong and China bounce back. But again, for this year, we have not given guidance on loan growth, recognizing some of the economic conditions. We do remain committed for medium term or mid-single-digit growth in loans for the medium term, which is what you can factor in for RWA growth commensurately and equally for our share buyback.  If I move on to your next question with regards to asset quality. I would lean towards your latter comment, Joe sorry, Raul, that we are baking in some conservatism or we think at this stage, the full year guidance, which we have retained unchanged from February is now leaning towards conservative. Just want to highlight some tailwinds, the -- certainly, the situation in the U.K., the possibility that we make recession is a tailwind. Equally, the recovery in Hong Kong and Mainland China following the opening up of the borders and resumption of activities and trade is a tailwind. But at the same time -- and obviously, the China real estate has shown some positive signs, both from the economic standpoint as well as from the policy measures, but at the same time, we wanted to remain cautious. There are a number of refinancing taking place in Q3 and the China real estate -- commercial real estate portfolio, which we would like to stay cautious on and we continue to watch some of the U.K. SME space, in particular, those heavily reliant on discretionary consumer spend before we revisit the guidance. We intend to revisit this guidance at the H1."

And in there, you'll see that we've accrued dividends at 50% of the profit generation in Q1. And if you do the math on that, the accrual on dividend is higher than the $0.10 that you've got in the Q1 declared interim dividend. So we're accruing capital distribution at a higher rate -- dividend distribution on a higher rate than the payment of the $0.10. So that's just factored into our CET1 ratio as well."

And then secondly, with the thought to the structure of the group, you've obviously showed some willingness to make some acquisitions recently and indeed do some disposals where possible. I just wondered if there will be any interest in further moves.

Just on the asset quality of the -- everything that we've seen since we bought the business, I don't know, lost track of time must be about 6, 7 weeks ago now. It's been a busy quarter. Everything we've seen reinforces the view that we had on that weekend when we did due diligence. The book was a good quality book. We've seen no nasty surprises. We did do a bit of mark-to-market on acquisition [indiscernible] but that was -- we were -- that was evident to us when we did due diligence that weekend. Georges can give you a little bit more detail on that. But fundamentally, the asset quality of the SVB book is as we expected it. The team have done a good job in building that business over the past 14 years. They've got good client relations, good quality book and good business development potential.  And on the back of that, we decided to invest in putting more people on the ground in some of the key markets around the world that have strong technology and life science centers to take that business model not just to the U.K., but take it globally. So we're investing in that as well. So [indiscernible] surprises on that and then in terms of other acquisitions that we may consider or M&A activity, I mean, I think the insurance business is a key component of the wealth proposition that we have. We have a very profitable insurance business in Hong Kong. It's a combination of manufacturing and distribution. The team has done a good job in building out the product lineup in Hong Kong over the past few years to put us back into a market-leading position in Hong Kong, and we get access to the full value chain.  One of the challenges we've often faced in the past is getting full recognition of that value as a bank shareholder in an asset -- in an insurance manufacturing business. But you can rest assured the economics of that business are very strong and we've got a market-leading position. So we obviously, like all businesses, keep the strategy under review. And if we think there's a better position to take, we'll take it. But at the moment, we're pleased with the way the insurance business is performing.

You kind of land on these numbers, and Manus, we also acquired $1.5 billion of capital after the fair value adjustment. So you're talking about effectively a 15% CET1 ratio business that we acquired.

The -- that $2 billion reduction for the NII sensitivity reduction for 100 basis points is for about 1/3 of it justified by the structural hedges that we started putting in place or that we continue putting in place as of last year and 2/3 of it is due to the fact that we are at just higher level of rates and therefore, we have less convexity -- negative complexity on the downside.  If you look into Q1, we have not published a revised rate sensitivity but we continued the trajectory of our structural hedges. Now just as a reminder, structural hedges will reduce somewhat our rate sensitivity. And our target is to take that $4 billion in the medium term to circa $3 billion. Well -- and we are on that journey. We certainly have not arrived there. We'll be giving you an update at H1. Omar, I think I've addressed your points."

Presumably, you wouldn't encourage us to analyze the whole lot. So how much of that do you think is sustainable?

Well, you've obviously pointed very strong numbers today. But in some ways, we have guided to a lot of it already, especially around cost.

The went business, obviously, with the outlook improving in wealth fairly reasonable to assume we will see regain traction and bounce back, in particular, in Hong Kong, whereas some of the other activities such as the foreign exchange trading outperformance. I would caution you not to annualize this number and just to bake it in as a Q1 outcome and then Q2, Q3, we'll see how they ."

        "text": "So just on the -- and on the wealth performance, you said most of the non-NII was CMB and GB&M. I think it's also fair to say that in WPB, the wealth business performed well in Q1. Average revenue was up 13% in Q1 relative to Q1 last year. So I think what Georges is saying is, I think we've seen a recovery taking place in that wealth revenue. We're not expecting that to just be a Q1 phenomenon. That is something that will continue in Q2 and Q3 and Q4, but it's still early days to predict whether the 13% is an annual number or it's higher than that or lower than that. So -- but we don't expect it to disappear in Q2, Q3 or Q4. So there should be a level of annualization on that as well in the WPB-non-NII line.  With respect to the AGM comment, look, I think we've said for a while that we believe the safest and fastest way to achieve higher returns, better performance, better dividends and capital generation was the existing strategy. I think the Q1 results provides a lot of evidence that, that is the fact that, that is the best way. We guided the market over the last 12 months to a 12%-plus ROTE. I did emphasize at the year-end that we should focus on the plus, not the 12. And I think you see even excluding the notable items, we've done a ROTE of 19.3%. I would just draw attention to the fact that in that ROTE of $19.3 million, there is a tax credit, and Georges can probably cover that as well. That tax credit is not something that will repeat every quarter. But even if you adjust for that, it's still a very healthy return on tangible equity.  So I think it's in the -- what we're focused on is driving performance on behalf of all our shareholders, and we believe doing what we've done is the best way to get improved returns, improve performance rather than some more radical corporate restructuring action. So we believe Q1 is strong evidence of that. But Georges, you just want to clarify the tax situation."

I think, listen, we still believe that a sale of the French retail business is the right strategic outcome that business probably has a stronger future in another hands. However, we have been in discussions for a few weeks now with the current buyer to try and overcome the challenge they have on their acquisition accounting impact on their capital base. We'll continue that dialogue. We're hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable settlement with them on that, but we can't be guaranteed of that outcome. We have to consider what is financially the right decision for all shareholders, and it's hopeful that we can reach an agreement, but it's not guaranteed.  In the event we can't, then I still think we'll continue to run the business, but I still think over time, we wouldn't see that as a long-term strategic hold, but we'll have to wait and see what happens thereafter. We're very much focused on trying to reach an agreement with the current buyer to bring that transaction to a close. So that's the update I have for you. On costs, I'll hand over to Georges."

If you adjust for notables, and remember, last year Q1, we had $450 million of additional cost due to the CTA program. So if you extract that notable item from last year's base, our reported cost adjusted for notable will show us up 2% Q1 to Q1. This is the basis on which we're measuring ourselves for this year. And it's on that basis where we would -- we are targeting to achieve a 3% annualized number, where we -- our quarter 1 basically is coming in at 2%. Now why from 2 to 3, I just want to highlight a few things. The first one is we still haven't incurred by and large, the severance costs, which we announced at the year-end and now we expect to incur the majority of it in Q2 this year. And the second element, just to highlight is that some of the pay increases have only been factored partially in Q1, starting March and we'll start kind of being fully factored in from Q2 onwards. And this is why our 3% target for the full year is where it is. And as you said, Andrew, and just for avoidance of any doubt here, the acquired cost of SVB and some of the additional investments we need to do there will add another 1% to that 3% target."

We -- on the -- that reconciliation between the headline reporting number and the cost target, what we're trying to do is be very straightforward and not try and bake in what as a CTA last year to this year. So we're adjusting down the prior year reported number for the notable CTA last year. So that the cost target of 3% is on an apples-and-apples basis with the cost base of this year. So we're not looking to take an easy option on that. We think it's the right thing to do, but as we say, we're 2% against the 3% target in Q1.  And then on SVB, I just want to clarify as well, the SVB business we bought, we acquired a cost base with that, and we acquired a revenue stream and that revenue stream was in excess of the cost base. So we've acquired a positive P&L that was contributing, if I remember correctly, around about $80 million to $90 million of , so although we've acquired 300 -- sorry, we acquired the majority of the $300 million is the acquired cost base of SVB.

And we do see continued headwinds in Hong Kong with around 1% per month migration into term deposit with the mix now at 25% term deposits across both our entities in Hong Kong. This being said, we also have tailwinds. The first one is we still have a strong momentum from Q1, which we're carrying over. The second tailwind is HIBOR normalization. I mean, just for reference, in Hong Kong, HIBOR and exchange fund bill rates in Q1 were 65 and 35 basis points lower on average than where they were in Q4, and that was a major headwind for us in Q1.  We are seeing now over the last few weeks, we have been seeing normalization in those rates. If we continue to see normalization and just for a reminder, we have about 200 basis points of their equivalent rates in dollars. If we continue to see normalization, this will provide us material tailwinds in the Hong Kong base. And the other tailwind is our resilient deposit and loan base, we continue having stable deposits and loans despite the -- some of the competitive pressures, and we continue to aim for mid-single-digit growth in both in the medium term, which should give us some supportive tailwinds."

And we said we were not uncomfortable with where consensus was. We still have that view. The only adjustment you need to make to NII is for the IFRS 17 adjustment. Everything else remains as we said in February, the guidance that existed at that point in time, we were not uncomfortable with it. The same is true today, just adjust for IFRS 17, which is around about a $2 billion adjustment from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17. That's the only change that needs to be made based on what we've given you as an update today.  And then on SVB, we acquired -- sorry, we recruited 40 people -- over 40 people in the U.S. to build out our SVB capability in the U.S. It will -- we did not bring a book with them, purchaser book. So they will be in build-out mode, so there will be a payback period on that investment. We think it's a relatively short payback period based on the quality of people we've hired. We're looking at other geographies around the world. We think it's a sensible and modest investment to do that organically. And we're pretty confident on the payback. We'll be relatively sure. We'll provide more details once we complete that buildout. Hopefully, by the half year, we'll be able to give you more information.  So there will be a profit drag to a degree, probably in the first year or 18 months, but then I think it will be back into profit territory even on those organic build-out strategies.

And we obviously continue to cherish deposits and attract and continue wanting to attract deposits. The LCR would be an outcome I think that we look at our liquidity management, it's the high-quality liquid assets ratio that we look at is the cash and cash equivalent within it that we look at. And in terms of loans, again, if the short term is somewhat subdued in particular in Hong Kong, in the medium term, some of the bounce back and some of the trade bounce back that we're seeing as well may support that loan growth ambition in the medium term."

That's a responsibility we've taken seriously throughout our history. Our high-quality liquid asset has been a feature of our heritage, our high-quality cash and cash equivalents has been a feature of our heritage for many decades. So we put the primary responsibility on liquidity management on ourselves, and then we'll see what the regulatory environment does as a consequence of some of the recent changes."

        "text": "I just need to come back to revenues. Both your net interest income and your noninterest income are performing really well in Q1 and they are annualizing at levels that would suggest pretty material upside to market expectations for both of those lines. Your net interest income is annualizing north of $36 billion on the Q1 number. Your guide is obviously greater than $34 billion. I appreciate there's lots of moving parts here, but I guess, to be more specific, in terms of your commentary around consensus at full year and now, there's a kind of $1.7 billion gap between where the Street is and what you're guiding for, the Street is $35.7 billion. It doesn't actually sound like you see much downside to that consensus number at $35.7 billion unless there's something here around term deposit mix or -- it feels like there's a lot of conservatism in the NII guidance or there's something I'm missing. So can you help us with that?  And then secondly, on the noninterest income, I totally appreciate your markets business might have overrun in Q1, but you are also pointing towards a wealth management business that's trending higher and underlying momentum in our your fee businesses, you talked about strategic initiatives at full year sit behind that. So to what extent is that revenue number and overearn? Or is this the kind of of level that we can expect you to crank out in the year because this is well ahead of where the Street is? Any color you can give us there would be really helpful."

        "text": "Two good questions. And let me just clarify what I said about what we said in February. I think you're right on your math. I think if you go back to what we said in February, there was -- we talked about $36 billion plus. And when people were talking about our NII, there was sort of annualizing it to about $38 billion and the consensus was around $37 billion to $37.5 billion. And I think we said we were comfortable with that. So I think if you go back to then, we sort of said, yes, we're sort of comfortable that consensus had a calculation on the plus bid of the $36 billion. They'll put it sort of north of $37 billion. That was around about consensus back then. And all I'm saying to you now is the only thing you need to adjust for is IFRS 17, which takes about $2 billion off of that. So we're talking about $34 billion plus and that, therefore, would put you north of $35 billion. So I think what we're saying is there should -- we're sort of saying the Street has probably got NII around about the right place back in February of last year. And we're saying there's no need to change what the Street is. You only got to do the mechanical adjustment for IFRS 17. Hopefully, that helps.  And then, Georges, I think do you want to just come back on the non-NII, because I think -- you're right, there's elements of our non-NII performance in Q1. So Georges is saying annualized. There are just some elements that are saying it may be unwise to annualize them fully for some of the trading income. Georges, do you just want to reclarify what you said."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure, Noel. So Aman if I kind of unpack the non-NII, some of the outperformance that we've seen with regards to funding of the trading book, where we've seen $1.4 billion this quarter against $0.1 billion quarter 1 last year because rates were at 0, but against $1.3 billion quarter 4, so somewhat flat to just slightly up from quarter 4. That number is -- it is fair to annualize it given current rate forecast consensus.  Equally, as Noel mentioned earlier, the discussion on wealth, the growth in in wealth, the resumption of activity in Hong Kong, in particular, bodes well for the future. And I think it is fair to assume that we will see continued performance in wealth.  On the other hand, some of the outperformance in some of the market activities such as foreign exchange trading, which had a record quarter, it may not be repeated. And obviously, we will have to look at it quarter-by-quarter in terms of what the business opportunities are there. And while you can bake in and factor in the results, the Q1 outperformance, I would caution you not to annualize that outperformance, but in general, if I take a step back, it is a good set of results and we are confident about the future. And in light of the strong Q1 performance, we will have to review and we will review the guidance in H1."

Just looking at a much improved profitability levels of the group, with an being around $2 billion to $3 billion of the quarter, this great capacity to scale up growth. And I was just wondering if we look into the medium term or starting '24. Do you see the goal for the group to lean more into growth so that mid-single-digit loan growth could potentially be higher? Or should we just think that any increasing profitability could be essentially a return to shareholders just in terms of the trade-off between opportunity for growing more versus shareholder return.  And secondly, with regards to the deposit trends. I was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of [indiscernible] deposit franchise during the quarter. Have you seen, in particular, inflows in certain parts of your footprint helping delivering that stable deposit [indiscernible] in the quarter. And it was also wondering with regards to deposit migration into time, whether you have seen any change in trend. If this we towards the end of that cycle in terms of deposit migration?

        "text": "Okay. Just a couple of comments. One comment from me on growth. Listen, I think, clearly, we want to pursue growth, but I think we have the capacity in our dividend payout ratio of 50% to pursue growth and with the option of doing buybacks as well. Now at the moment, I think we've seen a relatively subdued lending market in corporate banking. I think the demand for term loans around the world is not particularly high at the moment and probably isn't going to be particularly high in the very near term.  As Georges said earlier, I mean, once we get to 2024, one would expect there to be an increase in demand starting to emerge. But for the near term, for the next few months in '23, given the economic uncertainty, we're seeing subdued loan demand. So I think the message I'd give you, in a 50% payout ratio world, we believe the second 50% after we pay the dividend, there is potential to fund both growth and buybacks. And that's our plans going forward. Georges, do you want to just cover the deposit trend, the inflows, the outflows and deposit migration."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure, Martin. So yes, if I start with some of the outflows that we're seeing and then I go into the tailwind. So some of the outflows we're seeing particularly in the U.K., so obviously, U.K. retail, Q1 is a tax payment period. So there is seasonality here. We are still seeing high cost of living resilient inflation in the U.K., which is obviously draining some of the U.K. consumers savings, to a lesser extent, competitive pressure as well in the U.K. Likewise, for corporates in the U.K., Q4 was at year-end where people showed up their liquidity, whereas Q1, most of the companies pay dividend. And then you can see some of the draining liquidity, we're also seeing deleveraging of loans using some of the deposits to deleverage on the loan side, especially for those with a strong rate differential between what they're paying on their loans.  This being said, we continue to see growth and strength in the deposit proposition. So if I take Hong Kong and all of Asia, actually, we've seen definite deposit growth in the retail and the personnel banking space. We have seen 5% growth of our deposit base in Commercial Banking in the U.S. So we were one of the beneficiary banks of the deposit migration from medium-sized banks into large banks. And we obviously continue to cherish our propositions and deposits to continue attracting deposits at the right price."

I think Middle East is another option. So I think I am being a bit cautious on the near-term loan growth. I think probably it will start to emerge more in the working capital side of the balance sheet, trade finance, before people start investing in fixed capital. But I think there is a level of nervousness out there in the corporate world about taking long-term investment decisions in fixed capital, that is aside from sustainability. I think there's a lot of infrastructure spend taking place, and I could see some loan growth coming in and around that sustainable infrastructure investment. So maybe I am being a bit cautious on loan growth at the moment. I think I'd rather be that way in the near term. But I don't think -- I do believe there's going to be medium-term loan growth. But I think it is fair to say that Asia has the potential to pick up faster than elsewhere in the world. So yes, I think it may be fair that I'm being a bit cautious."

        "text": "If I kind of just adding to Noel's comments, Tom, if you look at Hong Kong, in the retail space, both cards and mortgages have been growing in the first quarter. Even in the U.K., we are seeing green shoots in the mortgage sector. I mean, our market share in the mortgage sector in the U.K. for the first 2 months of the year is that 15%, that's for new business. That's against the book market share of about 7.5% and the Q4 new business market share of 9%. So we're certainly there in the retail space where we're seeing growth.  On the wholesale side, I just want to add 1 comment to description, which is also bear in mind the rate differential between China and Hong Kong. So all those Chinese companies who used to use Hong Kong as a base for raising funding internationally will be less doing so as long as the rate differential between dollar rates and China rate are that wide. It is cheaper for these corporates to raise funding in Mainland China as opposed to Hong Kong, and that will remain the case up until the time we see a reversal in that rate trend.  If I move to your second question, Tom, we have not shared targets for 2024 as yet, but the few guiding principles I can share with you, the first guiding principle, paramount guiding principal is that you should expect our focus on cost discipline to continue. The second guiding principle is that we will continue doing transformation and restructuring as part of our BAU cost base and expect some of those sales to flow through also into 2024 and beyond. And case in point is the spend on severance, which we're planning now to do in Q2 this year for which the benefit will flow through mostly in 2024.  And thirdly, at this stage, we're still looking to guide towards a dollar cost number as opposed to and the way we will be looking at 2024 as we come to be able to give you additional guidance later in the year."

For your information, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive.\nRichard O'Connor: Good afternoon to those joining us here in Hong Kong, and good morning to those in London elsewhere. Noel and Georges will present the strategy and the results, and we will allow plenty of time for questions from the telephone lines and the live audience here in Hong Kong. With that, over to Noel, who will host the conference.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon to everyone in the room here in Hong Kong. Thank you for joining us, and great to see you again. And good morning to everyone watching from London and elsewhere. Before Georges takes you through the second quarter numbers, I'll start with a summary of the first half performance and progress.  First, I show this slide every quarter. It's critical in that it summarizes our strategy, and our strategy remains unchanged. It is summarized by the 4 pillars at the bottom of the slide. Let me take you through the latest outcomes of that strategy. We had a good first 6 months. I'm pleased with the broad-based profit and revenue generated by our global businesses and geographies. I'm also pleased with our strong capital generation and returns. We delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 22.4%, including the 2 material notable items reported in the first quarter or 18.5% if you exclude those notable items. And we've announced a second interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a second share buyback of up to $2 billion.  Today, we're also upgrading our guidance. Now we expect to achieve a return on tangible equity in the mid-teens for 2023 and 2024. Prior to 2023, we were very focused on transforming the business. Now while still continuing to improve operational efficiency, we are very focused on driving growth, diversifying revenue and creating incremental value.  We have a plan built around 6 areas. I will take you through some of these over the next few slides. Starting with our international connectivity. We grew wholesale cross-border client business in the first half by around 50%, with growth across all regions, driven by higher rates. Our international proposition in Wealth and Personal Banking continues to gain traction. We now have 6.3 million international WPB customers, and that is up 500,000 or 8% over the last 12 months. That's significant because these international customers generate around 2.5x the average customer revenue.  Finally, we drove strong revenue growth in Transaction Banking, which was up 63%. there were good performances in foreign exchange and in global payment solutions. Trade was slightly down year-on-year, in line with global trade volumes, but trade balances stabilized in the second quarter, particularly in Asia. And HSBC was named Best Bank for Trade Finance by Euromoney for the second year in a row as well as Best Bank in Asia.  The next slide sets out our latest progress on another area of focus, the redeployment of capital from less strategic or low connectivity businesses into higher-growth international opportunities. I'm pleased that we agreed new terms for the sale of our French retail banking operations in the quarter. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, and we now have a lot of work to do to complete migration in early 2024. The sale of our banking operations in Canada remains on track to complete in early 2024, with a special dividend of $0.21 per share planned thereafter. We completed the disposal of our Greek business last weekend, and we've announced the disposal of our Russian operations. We are changing the nature of our business in Oman, and we will wind down our WPB operations in New Zealand. Crucially, this is allowing us to target growth opportunities, some of which are set out on the right-hand side.  The first is the continued development of our wealth business across the whole of Asia. Our digitally enabled wealth and insurance business in Mainland China now has 1,400 wealth planners and is driving good new business growth. We launched Global Private Banking in India last month. In June, we launched HSBC Innovation Banking, a strengthened globally connected proposition on the back of our purchase of SVB U.K. We will nurture the specialism that we acquired, back it with HSBC's balance sheet strength and global network and build further Innovation Banking businesses in the U.S., here in Hong Kong and Israel. The process is already well underway and will enable us to support our clients in the technology and life sciences sectors to achieve their global ambitions.  Finally, we've announced today that we are also increasing our shareholding in trade shifts and have agreed to launch a jointly owned business in early 2024 to provide embedded financing solutions within their trade ecosystem. We believe this will help us to grow our client base in commercial banking, giving us a new avenue for growth outside of traditional relationship banking.  The next slide looks at how we are diversifying revenue by growing fee income and collaboration. As I've said, our wealth strategy continues to gather momentum, especially in Asia. Net new invested assets were down in the rest of the world due to lower third-party asset management liquidity products, mainly in the U.S., but they were up in Asia by 21% to $27 billion. Over the last 12 months, we took in a total of $75 billion of net new invested assets and grew our invested assets by 8% globally. This all underlines the growth potential of our Wealth business. Fee income in Commercial Banking was up 6% in the first half and collaboration revenues between our Global businesses were up 5%. Collaboration revenue is particularly important in a relatively low growth economic environment because we can drive growth from within the organization.  The next slide focuses on the tight cost discipline we've maintained and how it enables us to invest in the bank of the future. We remain committed to disciplined cost management and have continued to use cost savings to increase investment in digitization. We increased spending on technology by 12.8% in the first half and this spending now accounts for 23% of our target base operating expenses. This investment has translated into faster services, reduced friction and more competitive products, all of which will improve the customer experience and our operational efficiency. We made good progress in increasing digital penetration amongst personal and business customers while increasing our product release frequency.  Investing in technology is also enhancing our capabilities. We now have a range of test and learn use cases for generative AI across HSBC and are in the process of scaling up a small number of those. Last month, we became the first bank to join BT and Toshiba's quantum-secured Metro network. This uses quantum technology for secure transmission of data, which should mitigate the risk of future cyber threats. And we are pleased to be working with the Hong Kong military authority on 2 pilots to test the Hong Kong dollar in a new payments ecosystem and to trial tokenized deposits.  My last slide shows how we've continued to build on our position as an enabler of the net zero transition. In the first half, we provided and facilitated $45 billion of sustainable finance and investments as we continue to work closely with our clients on their transition plans. This consisted of capital markets financing and on balance sheet lending to clients and included a number of key deals in Asia and the Middle East. We were recently named Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Asia by Euromoney for the 6 consecutive year.  I'll now hand over to Georges to take you through the Q2 numbers.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Noel. And a warm welcome to everyone in the room with us today. It is great to be back here in Hong Kong to deliver our interim results. And for those of you watching today from London and across the globe, a very good morning, and thank you for joining us. We've announced a good set of second quarter results. Reported profits before tax were at $8.8 billion, up 89% on last year's second quarter. Revenue was up 38% at $16.7 billion. This was driven by first, NII of $9.3 billion, which was up $2.5 billion or 38% year-on-year. And second, non-NII of $7.4 billion, which was up $2.1 billion or 39% year-on-year.  We booked expected credit losses of $0.9 billion in the quarter. Despite the inflationary environment, cost growth in the quarter was restricted to 1% compared to last year's second quarter, including $0.2 billion of severance costs. These severance costs were expected, and we are on track to meet our 2023 cost target to limit cost growth to around 3% on our target cost basis.  Compared to the first quarter, lending and deposits were both down 1% due to subdued loan demand, deposit outflows in global banking and markets in Europe and the reclassification of our portfolio in Oman to held for sale. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 14.7%. As Noel said, we announced a second interim dividend of $0.10 per share and the second share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we intend to complete in around 3 months. TNAV per share was down $0.24 due primarily to the final interim dividend for 2022 and the first interim dividend for 2023.  The next slide shows another strong quarterly revenue performance, with overall growth of 38% compared to the second quarter of '22. Three further points on this. As Noel mentioned, revenue was up in all 3 global businesses. Wealth was up 19% due to higher rates and a strong insurance performance mainly here in Hong Kong. And three, across Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, Global Payment Services reported revenues of around $4.2 billion, an increase of 115% on the second quarter of '22.  On the next slide, reported net interest income was $9.3 billion, up $0.3 billion or 4% on the first quarter. We've introduced banking NII as a new disclosure this quarter. It is derived by adjusting reported NII for the centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities and the NII generated by the Insurance business. At $11.6 billion, banking NII was up $1.3 billion on the first quarter and up $4.5 billion on last year's second quarter. The $2.4 billion centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities within Global Banking and Markets and the second quarter included a $0.4 billion year-to-date impact of methodology changes. As a reminder, the related income associated with these funding costs is reported with non-NII.  The net interest margin was 172 basis points, up 3 basis points on the first quarter of '23 and up 43 basis points on the second quarter of '22. We continue our structural hedging activity. Our NII sensitivity is $2.6 billion for a 100 basis point drop in rates against the previous year-end sensitivity of $4 billion. At this point, we are adjusting our NII guidance. We now expect NII of at least $35 billion in '23. Within this, we expect the centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities within Global Banking and Markets to be in excess of $7 billion with associated income reported in non-NII. We continue to reiterate that we expect to see higher pass-through rates and continued migration to time deposits. And we remain cautious on loan growth over the next 6 to 12 months, but we do expect it to start picking up some time in 2024. I know that many of you will have questions about banking NII, in particular, which I'll be very happy to address as we move into Q&A later on.  Moving on. Non-NII of $7.4 billion was down on the first quarter, which benefited from $3.7 billion of notable items and FX translation. However, it was up $2.1 billion or 39% in the second quarter of '22. A couple of things to mention here. One, there was a strong wealth performance, up $0.3 billion or 19% on the second quarter of last year, $0.2 billion of which came from increased life insurance income, primarily in Hong Kong. And two, Markets & Security Services was down due to lower client activity and the methodology change that I just mentioned earlier. Fees were up $0.1 billion in the second quarter of '22 due to higher personal banking and commercial banking fees.  Turning now to credit. Our second quarter ECL charge was $0.9 billion, which was $0.5 billion up on the second quarter last year. It includes $0.3 billion for our mainland China commercial real estate exposure booked in Hong Kong and a $0.3 billion charge for the U.K. To remind you, this is a more normalized level of charge that we expect for this year and is a sign that our main credit indicators are holding up. On the basis of what we have seen so far in 2023 and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to expect a 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending, including held-for-sale balances.  The next slide is our 6-month update on our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. And before, our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. At the full year, our exposure was $9.4 billion. It now stands at $8.1 billion, due primarily to repayments. The proportion of substandard and credit impaired exposures is around 65% of the portfolio marginally up from the full year. Of these $5.2 billion of exposures that we rate as substandard or credit impaired, $1.1 billion is secured with minimal ECL due to the security held. Against the remaining $4.1 billion, we have increased our provisions from $1.7 billion at the full year to $1.9 billion today. Within this, our coverage ratio against the unsecured credit impaired exposures has increased from around 55% to nearly 70%. At the end of 2022, we calculated a plausible downside scenario of $1 billion on this portfolio. As you can see, we have now crystallized some of that downside into the P&L. We remain comfortable with our coverage level.  On Slide 17, despite the inflationary environment, cost growth was restricted to 1% on a constant currency basis, versus the second quarter last year. As you can see, a large share of this growth was technology related. There was also a higher performance-related pay accrual and the expected severance costs, which were offset by a write-back of software and lease impairments. We remain committed to limiting cost growth to around 3% in 2023 on our cost target basis. On this target basis, second quarter costs were up 6% year-on-year, of which around half was the $0.2 billion of expected severance costs.  As a reminder, our cost target basis exclude notable items from constant currency operating expenses. It also excludes the impact of retranslating hyperinflationary economies at constant currency. And finally, it excludes the acquired cost base and additional investments in HSBC Innovation Banking, which are expected to result in incremental growth of around 1% above our targeted basis. The full cost target basis reconciliation will be on Slide 26 of this deck. Our CET1 ratio was 14.7%, which was stable on the previous quarter. Profit generation was offset by the dividend accrual of $6.9 billion during the first half and the share buyback of $2 billion that has now completed.  So in summary, this was another good quarter. There were good profit and net interest income performances. Credit remains resilient. We are on track to limit cost growth in '23 to 3% on our cost target basis. We now expect NII of at least $35 billion in '23. And as Noel said, we now expect a mid-teens return on tangible equity in '23 and '24 excluding the upcoming sale of Canada. Finally, we are returning capital to shareholders by way of increased dividends and share buybacks.  And with that, I'll ask Richard we can open it up for questions. Richard, please. Thank you.\nA - Richard O'Connor: Operator, can you open up for questions, please. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, operator, can we take our first question from Manus Costello, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question from today is from Manus Costello from Autonomous.\nManus Costello: I wanted to ask about NII, please. A couple of questions. Firstly, I noted that the NIM was flat in Asia in quarter-on-quarter. Could you give us a bit more color on that about what you would expect in Q2? I appreciate the change in the costs have been somewhat allocated but [indiscernible] some benefits compare overall in [indiscernible] [indiscernible]a little bit more.  And then secondly, we've also talked about increasing hedging and the structural hedge in order to reduce the downtime risk from NII. [indiscernible] Can you [indiscernible] what we've done and how to think about that in terms of potential benefits going forward into '24 and beyond.\nNoel Quinn: Thanks, Manus. Georges, do you want to pick up both of those points?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Manus. So on NIM NII, NIM in Asia was flat because most of the uplift from rates has translated into an uplift in the non-NII component of the trading book funding, about $0.3 billion uplift in that space. We've introduced banking NII. In due course, we will enhance our disclosure in the space to introduce banking NII sensitivity and banking NIM, which would be reflecting such an uplift.  The -- with regard to your second question, Manus, the hedging activity, so if you look at our NII sensitivity, downwards 100 basis points have reduced from $4 billion to $2.6 billion. About 1/3 of that reduction is due to our hedging structural hedging activity and another 1/3 of that reduction would be effect of the change of the composition of our balance sheet. And then the last 1/3 is numerous other factors, including modeling enhancements. If you now look at our structural hedging activity, which we've conducted over the last 12 months, the overall impact on the reduction of banking NII sensitivity is to the tune of $1 billion.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you, Georges. Georges, you just want to explain why there's been more of a move into the sort of the non-NII trading book, what the underlying cause of that is?\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. So what -- due to the somewhat subdued loan growth in Asia, we have the management of Asia taken the decision to allocate more funding towards supporting some of the trading activities. So the overall funding of our trading books globally, which heavily used also in Asia, moved from about $108 billion or circa 6% of our deposit base to around $130 billion or about 9% -- 8%, 9% for deposit base. That additional lending or that additional transition from funds have moved NII into non-NII income. It is still a rate sensitive, and it does benefit from improved level of rates, particularly in dollars where it's coming from.\nOperator: Our next question is from Aman Rakkar from Barclays.\nAman Rakkar: I have three questions, please. So again, on net interest income, at face value you are greater than $35 billion, NII guide does imply a step-up in the run rate of net interest income in Q3 and Q4. I suspect you would point us to the greater than $35 billion, suggesting that there's some conservatism . But can you talk to what the pressures are or indeed actually even the sources of support on the net interest income run rate from here through to year-end?  I think one thing the market would love is some sense of whether this level of net interest income is sustainable beyond this year? So anything you can give us there, I guess, related to -- I know that the U.K. has been very strong as well. So any kind of color you could give us on the moving parts there and the sustainability of net interest income in the U.K. would be great.  The second question was around distributions. Specifically around your dividend, you're reiterating your 50% payout ratio guidance this year. This year, and potentially next year, it does look like it's going to be quite strong earnings. I guess if you take consensus looking for an underlying EPS of around $1.20, which involves an ordinary dividend of $0.60. I mean that number feels big versus $0.51 you used to state versus what you did last year. And I guess the question is how comfortable are you with paying a big ordinary dividend now, which might then become quite difficult to sustain in the future if rates come off and earnings kind of taper, are you bothered that you do $0.60 this year and you do some number that's lower than that next year or thereafter?\nNoel Quinn: Georges, do you want to certainly take the NII one first and just clarify our position on that, and then we'll come to distributions.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Thank you, Amandeep. So kind of in turn, addressing your points. First, as you did say, we're emphasizing that this is a floor. We're emphasizing this is a guidance of greater than $35 billion. We're revising this floor because we're gaining more comfort first half way into the year and with the outcomes of H1. We want to remain cautious, and you may find our guidance to be cautious given the difficulty to forecast some of the challenges I'll talk about in a second. And then in terms of outlook for the rest of the year, look, we are not looking to change the consensus for H2 NII. We're comfortable with H2 NII consensus stands at this stage.  Now in terms of the pressure and the support we're seeing, well, we're seeing certainly tailwinds that we've seen already in Q2, one in terms of additional rate hikes to be expected very much in the major currencies, such as dollar, pound and euro. We've seen also tailwinds in the HIBOR normalization. We've seen about 1% quarter-on-quarter normalization of HIBOR. And if you look at July, we continue seeing further normalization. HIBOR is now around 5%. So probably at the end of July, we'll have fully normalized. And those will provide us some -- certainly some tailwinds as we look into H2.  This being said, we continue to see the same headwinds we've been calling out from the year-end, and they will continue manifesting in H2. The first headwind, which we forecast to remain is the subdued balance sheet growth, certainly subdued loan growth due to the activity. We have indicated we may see some resumption in '24, but for the -- for this half -- for the next half year, would probably remain as a headwind.  And naturally, the other headwind that is very difficult to forecast is the deposit costs, the behavior, what pass-through rates we will be feeding in, what is the impact of lagged migration to time deposits. Hong Kong, we're still assuming a 1% migration per month and whether this manifests as it is, it is very difficult to forecast, hence, our cautiousness.  Now if I look forward, look, we're not guiding for NII in '24. But there are a few things I can just give you to kind of bake in your analysis. The first one is you have to exclude Canada and France upon completion of these France retail upon completion of these transactions, which now we expect for Canada in Q1 '24. And in France, as we initially ambitioned we're aiming 1st of June '24.  The second one, you have to expect that the balance sheet growth will resume at some stage in '24, and that will give us support for NII. The third one is obviously the structured hedging, which I mentioned a bit earlier, and the impact they will have on more stabilization of outlook for NII. And obviously, the fourth one is what interest rate assumptions you are going to use and what pass-through rates you're going to use. And then last but not least, we are investing a lot in our non-NII or fee income earning businesses and do expect fee income earning businesses to continue driving some of that growth. That's it for the NII component.\nNoel Quinn: Carry on with dividends as well, please.\nGeorges Elhedery: So dividend -- so what we shared is that we're going to pay a 50% dividend payout ratio excluding notable items. I think in your math, based on consensus, you have taken out notable items. I'm not going to comment on the size of the dividend. But what I'm going to say is in order for us to sustain dividend, there are a few things we're working on and you can as well do the math, Amandeep. The first one is share buybacks. As you know, share buybacks is reducing our share count. And to the extent we ambition to continue on the journey of share buybacks as long as we remain capital generative, which is what we forecast, you have to adjust your denominator by the share count.  The second thing is the NII stabilization actions we're taking, which should give us some protection from a reversal of the rate cycle. And the third and fourth -- third one is obviously our cost discipline will be maintained. Even though we haven't yet we're not ready to share numbers, we will maintain the discipline. And lastly, as I again indicated, fee income growth and the investments we're putting in fee-generating areas such as investment and wealth are also initiatives to support, mitigate a turn in our earnings and therefore a turn in possibly our dividends beyond '24.\nNoel Quinn: Georges, Excellent. A very comprehensive answer to both questions. So thank you. Thanks Aman. Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Raul Sinha from JPMorgan.\nRaul Sinha: Maybe can I ask 2 things. The first one, just being on distribution perhaps driven by Georges' thoughts on potential for buybacks in the second half of the year and looking at your capital ratio, obviously, we will probably have to make a couple of adjustments [indiscernible] that's about 25 basis points, and we've got the buyback that we've announced today, that's 50 basis points on the level. Just thinking about [indiscernible] Guidance, [indiscernible] perhaps slightly less capital generative in the second half. So just wondering if you can scope for us Georges on what is [Technical Difficulty] from here?  And then the second one, just for Noel on the management [indiscernible]. If I look at the [indiscernible] management revenue this quarter, [indiscernible] just sort of stable on Q1. I am wondering if that understates some of the momentum that you are building within the business. So if you could help us understand how you expect that margin [indiscernible].\nNoel Quinn: Yes, happy to do that. I'll let Georges take the buyback question first.\nGeorges Elhedery: So in terms of the buyback, obviously, the fact that today we announced a $2 billion buyback will today have an impact on our Q3 CET1 ratio of 25 basis points. But you do expect us to continue generating profitability, which will build capital, 50% of which will be provisioned for dividend based on the 50% dividend payout ratio anticipation. And therefore, that buyback will take into the additional capital generation. So I wouldn't look at Q3 25 basis points as a -- due to the buyback we just announced as a challenge. This is obviously -- this is just upfronting if you want the profit generation that we would be doing in the quarter.  Beyond that, again, at this stage, what I can say is we believe we remain capital generative for the foreseeable future. And as long as we're capital generative, we remain -- we continue to ambition a rolling series of share buybacks. But obviously, we would review this on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on a number of factors, including our capital adequacy ratio. I just want to also highlight and probably answering your question, Raul, and complementing the question of Amandeep earlier, that the Canada sale expected in Q1 '24 will provide us additional capital. The priority use of the first part of it is for a $0.21 dividend, which we will be in a position to distribute expected in H1 '24. And then the residual part of it, we will utilize to supplement or complement or top up any capital buyback and we're planning to do.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you. And I think it's a fair comment on your second question that what we're talking about here is very much growth in lead indicators. The $27 billion of net new invested assets here in Asia in the first half, up 21%. Globally, net new invested assets growth of $75 billion over the past 12 months. A growth in our aggregate invested assets of 7% globally. They're strong lead indicators, an additional 0.5 million international customers in the past 12 months. For me, they are the lead indicators. I think you're absolutely right, there will be a lag effect as you turn the customer acquisition and asset acquisition into revenue. But that's why we're talking about building businesses and new growth opportunities that can supplement our revenue going forward and give us some cushion on offset to any downside rate effect that may emerge post '23 and post '24. So we think it's the right thing to do.  And you're right, the revenue will be a lag indicator on those early success criteria that we're sharing with you. If you remember, our growth in our Wealth business in Mainland China, we started with 0 wealth managers just over 2 years ago. We've now about 1,400. Our ambition is to get to 3,000 over the relatively near term over the next couple of years or so. Again, that will be revenue generative as an offset because most of that is fee-based as an offset to any downside pressure that may be on interest rates. So I think your second comment is a fair comment, but I turn that into the positive rather than the negative.\nRichard O'Connor: And Raul just add, as you're aware, Q2 -- Q1 will be seasonally a bit stronger and IFRS 17 means you build revenue from a pretty low base, but up rapidly. We'll take one more from the lines and return and then we'll turn to the live audience in Hong Kong, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Coombs from Citi.\nAndrew Coombs: Two questions, please. Just firstly on Chinese commercial real estate, there have been the charges in Q1 and more additional charges in Q2. those additional charges. And then when you talk about this downside scenario on Slide 16, I think previously [indiscernible] and you are now saying lower, should we just take off the $0.3 billion or or can you provide some framework around what would be the downside scenario nowadays?  And then my second question, perhaps I could just invite you to make some comments on the FCA's 14-point plan on cash savings that was released yesterday. And any implications you think that might have to the U.K. business.\nNoel Quinn: Okay. I'll take the second. But Georges, do you want to take the first?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andrew. So we have put in more charges in Q2. The total charges was $0.3 billion or some of Q1 and Q2, Q1 being very benign is $0.3 billion. Most of these charges are on stage 3. These are more technical adjustments of the names that have defaulted. So where we stand now in terms of charges is we are comfortable with the charges we have against this portfolio in China CRE. Now with regards to the plausible downside scenario, we indicated $1 billion at the year-end as a plausible downside. We have indeed crystallized $0.3 billion of it. So without being precise on the math here, it is indeed a residual circa $0.7 billion that remains a plausible downside which may or may not materialize over the coming few quarters.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you. And with regard to the FCA and the work they're doing on savings accounts, I think, was your second question. Listen, we believe in both the mortgage book and the savings of the deposit book, we've tried to make sure that we are offering a good range of products to our clients, whereby they have choices, so on savings. We've got a good competitive range of fixed rate deposit accounts in the market. We also believe we've got good pricing in place for more instant access type savings accounts or deposit accounts. We will participate with the FCA and on any review they do.  We believe if you take our 2-year fixed rate savings account in the U.K. based on the yield curve in the U.K., we're offering savers the opportunity to get 5.1% on that fixed term -- 2-year fixed-term savings account. If you compare that to our 2-year fixed mortgage product that we're offering to our customers with a 60% loan-to-value ratio, we're in the market at around about 5.53% and for new-to-bank customers, we'd be in the market at about 6.1%. So we believe we have the structure of the deposit book and the structure of the mortgage book in the right level. And as ever, there is a price difference between term products and instant access products because of the maturity and the liquidity risk.  So we have tried to price our products fairly and appropriately. We're very cognizant of the pressures that U.K. customers face at this point in time. We certainly try to remain competitive and to help them navigate what is going to be a challenging year or so with high interest rates in the yield curve and higher rates of inflation, but we will fully participate with any review that the FCA take. We're also trying to encourage through marketing prompts customers to take advantage of those products if they want them and they meet their circumstances. We can't and should not force them into term savings, but we need to make sure they're aware of our term savings products should they want to take advantage of it. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nRichard O'Connor: Questions from the floor In Hong Kong. We'll take 2, Katherine and Nick, and then I'll come back to you some a bit later. Okay.\nKatherine Lei: My name is Katherine Lei from JPMorgan. And I have two questions. One is in a more long term and one is more near term. For the long-term questions, I will ask management if you have -- if you can give us any color on potential impact of Basel III reform. Because I think one of the key support on share prices is buyback and shareholder return, right? And then I think the impact on capital because of this potential regulatory changes will have an impact on how we model in future capital return. But this is more in the long term, I understand that, I just want to get some color? Any color, particularly after the U.S. regulatory release that Basel III End Game, like how would that change our present forecast on that, so this is for the long-term question.  And then on the near term, just now, I think management gave us a number. Potential additional ECL charges on China's CRE is $0.7 billion. And then I also noticed that for our guidance for full year credit cost is 40 basis points. But if I look at the first half, it's a bit less than 30 basis points on an annualized basis, right? So that additional upside on credit costs, like have we included that $0.7 billion or that $0.7 billion is outside of the 40 basis points guidance?\nNoel Quinn: I think I'll take the second one first, and then ask Georges to cover the more technical, difficult bolstering question. So on the ECL, look, we decided to maintain guidance of 40 basis points on ECL because there's still a lot of economic uncertainty out there. There's economic uncertainty around China's commercial real estate. There's economic uncertainty generally in the world.  We've had a good first half performance on ECL, I should say, $1.3 billion is below the run rate of 40 basis points. So we think we do have some capacity to absorb some of that risk that's inherent in the commercial real estate book in China. But I think I'd be misleading you if everything could be so scientifically proven because you've got to -- it all depends on what happens elsewhere in the world.  So yes, I could easily say, yes, we've got capacity to absorb that, but it depends what happens elsewhere in the world. So -- but we do believe we have -- it's right to maintain a conservative guidance at the moment on ECL is at 40 basis points. And we have capacity in the second half relative to the first half performance to absorb some additional shocks should they come through from near-term economic issues.  Georges, do you want to handle Basel III?\nGeorges Elhedery: Yes. I mean, just -- maybe just finishing on the ECL point, good question, you have to analyze H1. If you look at Q2 at $0.9 billion as a more normalized level. So that is more the level that you can look at, whereas Q1 was unusually quite low, so this is why H1 will look low to your taste. So on Basel III, look, so the first thing to share about Basel III is we need to know the final rules. At this stage, most of these rules are still in draft form, and they will remain subject to change as we know the final rule.  The second thing I will share is that based on the current draft rules in -- as per our PRA standards for the group holdings, there will be a minor improvement initially in our RWAs. But as the output floor starts kicking in 5 years into the journey, so from 25 plus 5 years, there is a likelihood that the output floor will catch us and net-net, the impact may be in a material up or down, but immaterial up as we look at it at this way.  This being said, I just want to caution one thing. The U.S. obviously issued their draft rules last week. They came out more severe than we initially expected. They will have an impact on our U.S. operations. It remains a marginal impact. We're likely talking single-digit RWA uplift against a possible downward move before that. But those rules will impact our local reporting for our U.S. entity will not change the way we report at the group level. So we will need to navigate both if you want, in parallel.\nRichard O'Connor: Thank you. Over to Nick.\nNicholas Lord: It's Nick Lord from Morgan Stanley. Again, a couple of questions, if I may, please. I think Georges has given a very thorough description of how you might sustain earnings sort of post return in rates. But obviously, a lot of our fee generation is going to come at a cost. So I just wonder if I could invite you to talk about how you think of balancing that fee generation of costs over the next sort of 2 to 3 years?  And then secondly, a little bit more specific, but you're now sort of 3 or 4 months into having bought SVB. You've spoken a little bit about it here. I just wonder if you could give us a little bit more detail on how your plans be evolved in that business.\nNoel Quinn: Yes. Thanks, Nick. And by cost, I'm assuming you mean investment costs to get to it?\nNicholas Lord: How you manage investment costs to get to operate.\nNoel Quinn: Listen, you're absolutely right. We -- we're keeping a strong and tight cost discipline in the bank. But what we're doing is we're reallocating cost from . And what we're typically reallocating is from what I call bad cost, costs that are associated with low return in portfolios, low return in business activities in certain markets or costs that are associated with manual processes that should be digitized.  So if you look at our cost performance, I think we increased our investment in IT costs by 12% so far this year, first half to first half. We increased some of our investment costs in our global businesses, and we reduced costs elsewhere, and that's what's getting us back to the 3%. So we're investing and saving at the same time.  And that is a phenomenon that probably historically HSBC has not been . It's typically been cost management or cost investment. And it's been a cycle, you manage costs tight and then you invest. We're definitely trying to do both at the same time, and there's a lot of self-funding going on to try and mitigate the overall cost base. And that's how we're building out the 1,400 people in Mainland China because we're saving costs through other country exits or the market exits, reducing our support costs in some of the manual processes in our global processing centers, that's allowing that investment to take place. And that's been the journey for the past 3 years.  On the SVB, the integration is going well. The business, we've had no nasty surprises since the day we bought the business. It was profitable the day we bought it. It is still profitable. We're going through systems migration at the moment. One statistic, which is probably an important guide for the future; in the 3 months post acquisition, we talk to bank customers at a higher rate than the 3 months prior to acquisition.  So in the transition of ownership from the previous owners to us, we've seen an uptick in the momentum of customers wanting to bank with SVB in that first 3 months period. That acquisition has also given us the knowledge, the platform, the connections and frankly, the positive brand and reputation globally that has allowed us to go and recruit a team in the U.S. We've recruited a team here in Hong Kong, and we've recruited a team in Israel.  So my view is that there is strong growth prospects in that business, not just for the next 2 or 3 years. I'm doing this because I think this will be an important business for us in the 5- to 10- to 15-year time frame. This is an important sector of the economy, and we're willing to invest in it. So I'm very pleased with how it's going.  We probably do owe you, as an investment community, more detail on so how material, what are the numbers. And I think we'll come back to you at the end of the year with if you add this all together, the investment and the current bought business, what could that potentially look like going forward and how material is that. But that is something, if it's okay, we'll give you more towards the end of this year with the full year results.\nRichard O'Connor: Back to lines and Tom Rayner and Sam will come back in about 5 minutes to you live, okay?\nOperator: We have a question from Guy Stebbings from BNP Paribas.\nGuy Stebbings: I have one back on costs and then one on the specifically in the U.K. So I mean on costs, in the context of a very strong top line and [indiscernible] guidance this year, I'm interested how you're thinking about investment spend in that context of what is a better revenue backdrop than you previously anticipated. Guidance is very clear for this year. So the change you actually the next year and [indiscernible] mindful consensus, fairly modest growth next year from where you are going to market this year and adjusting for things like kind of just how [indiscernible] appropriately [indiscernible] in the context of what is a better top line and given the opportunity to be able to -- and the third question was on the U.K.  You saw a very strong growth in the second quarter in [indiscernible] bank in stark contrast to some U.K. peers. Could you talk about some of the dynamics, how you see deposit [indiscernible] mix evolving in U.K. I appreciate it's very difficult to be too specific, but any sort of perspectives there and whether ultimately [indiscernible]this level.\nNoel Quinn: Well, certainly, on costs, it's a very simple answer. We're not giving any guidance at this stage on 2024. We will give an update on '24 guidance at the end of the year. But on 2023, we've given, I think, a strong commitment on cost discipline. I also will maintain strong cost discipline in '24, but I'm not going to quantify what that means in terms of percentage growth at this stage.  On the U.K., Georges, it would be good if you could just share some of the information that we've got in the U.K., particularly the progress we're still making in the U.K. mortgage market despite the pressures in the U.K. mortgage market, it would be good to put some color on that, please.\nGeorges Elhedery: Yes. So Guy, maybe I'll start by talking the dynamic, and I'll dive into NIM specifically. But first, in terms of pass-through rates on the deposits, for the last 50 basis points of rate hikes from the Bank of England, we've passed through to our savings rate, retail savings rate, around 70%. So we believe from a consumer point of view, we are competitive, having passed through. And obviously, this is a higher than 50% pass-through. The overall book pass-through within the around 40 -- between 40% and 50%. But clearly, the marginal pass-throughs are higher at this high level of rates.  Equally, on the mortgages, we continue aiming for market share. So we've grown the stock market share from 7.7% to 7.8%. And our new business market share is now just shy of 10%, so we maintain a leading proposition in mortgages. Now if I go specifically on the NIM. Look, without talking to our peers' NIM some parameters that you can use when you're doing your assessment and your analysis. The first one is we have a very strong liquidity position with a very strong deposit franchise and a low loan-to-deposit ratio.  The second one to take into account is we are relatively small in consumer finance. So that component of our portfolio is single-digit percentage of our retail finance. The third one to take into account is that our structural hedging is relatively young, i.e., we started the structural hedging essentially when rates started to be at higher levels. So we have little \"baggage\" from structural hedging positions from prior, i.e., when rates were very low, and this is obviously helping us in adjusting our NIM upwards and we're not bogged by, if you want, low interest-earning assets from older structural hedges. And in terms of expectations, I think it's fair to expect that the increase we've seen in Q1 is unlikely to be repeated as we look into the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Rayner from Numis.\nTom Rayner: [Indiscernible] just on your revised ROTE guidance in 2023 and 2024. . I understand [indiscernible] your company could [indiscernible] you have got material notable items in there. I think, [indiscernible] sale of Canada [indiscernible] consensus return. So my point -- I guess, my question is I think that, that potentially obscures the size of the sort of underlying upgrade that you're guiding to sort of return on [indiscernible] in 2024. My concern is whether the way you now present [indiscernible] because the notables now are part of your numbers and therefore I think it makes sense the consensus that way. [indiscernible] presentation it may be more difficult for investors to understand the underlying drivers of the business and whether that may be impacting your rating at some level. I just wonder if you could comment on that, please.\nNoel Quinn: Georges, do you want to pick that up, please?\nGeorges Elhedery: Our ROTE guidance of mid-teens initially has been excluding notable items. So for this year -- well, for this year, obviously, we had 2 notable items in Q1. The provisional gain of SVB, $1.5 billion, but also the reversal of the impairment of the French retail business, $2.1 billion. As we look to year-end, we do anticipate that we would reinstate this impairment sometime in H2 for a possible obviously, closure of the transaction on the 1st of Jan. So that notable item, if you want, washes itself out from our full year expectations.  As regards to 2024, I think the Canada impact is a couple of percentage points on our ROTE. So whether you stretch the mid-teens a little bit on either side, and you may still be right. But we would like to take it out because obviously, it remains, while we are very confident in the resolution, it remains an element that is subject to additional -- to continued regulatory approvals. So you can do your math with or without.\nNoel Quinn: So I suppose the way we're looking at mid-teens, if you look at the first half, we printed a headline rate of 22.4% ROTE. If you take out the 2 notable items, you get to an 18.5% ROTE. We're guiding mid-teens to be equivalent, you could say, with the '18 number, not the '22 number. And if you think about 2024, there will be a profit on sale of Canada, assuming that transaction completes, there'll be a capital policy rider in the form of dividend and in the form of buybacks. But we're not including that profit on sale within our guidance. We're not including that in our definition of mid-teens. That's sort of over and above because -- so what we're trying to say is we've given you a mid-teens ROTE guidance for the core business, not with the big swings in M&A activity, achieving it. That's the way I'd look at it.  So we just want to try and make sure everyone understands what we mean by mid-teens, and it doesn't include the big one-offs, either the one-off positive or the one-off negatives. We're looking at the fundamental business in guiding to that.\nGeorges Elhedery: And just I think complementing that, we're not trying to change consensus at this stage where...\nTom Rayner: I mean, I guess my real question is, is this mid-teens? I mean it is now what you view as the through-the-cycle type of level of profitability that you've got if you look consensus 2025 at the moment and that's dropping away again because I guess people, the ones also dropped out. But I mean it sounds to me as if you think now maybe interest rates have normalized to a level where they're probably more realistic than they have been in the last decade or so. And may be your profitability meeting is now what you're comfortable with? Is that what you're seeing on more of a sort of basis?\nNoel Quinn: I think you've overread it because what we said is the guidance is for '23 and '24. We're not giving you guidance for '25 and beyond. We will do that at some stage. So I wouldn't overread the -- now clearly, in '25 and beyond, you've got interest rates that will start to come off, but I'm also talking about building alternative revenue streams, building balance sheet growth because as interest rates come off, economic recovery improves and the balance sheet will start to grow again. So our job as a management team, and our philosophy is we want to try and make sure we can mitigate some of that downside risk either through hedging or alternative growth strategies to stabilize the ROTE over time. But for the avoidance of doubt, we are not guiding at the moment on 2025 ROTE. We're only guiding on '23 and '24, and we'll have to see how the economics of the world develop. And I think Georges should probably reiterate what he said at the end of that because the line went a bit hazy.\nGeorges Elhedery: We're not trying to change consensus where we see consensus for our ROTE for '23 and '24.\nOperator: Our next question is from Perlie Mong from KBW.\nPerlie Mong: I just got two questions. The first one is on parts of net interest income and especially in [indiscernible] Asia. So if I look at your Asian entity for it look like revenues is truly is high quarter-on-quarter, but NII gone up a little bit. So that suggests me that [indiscernible] fractionally down a little. Just wondering what you're seeing in front line, especially at [indiscernible]. And obviously, Hong Kong's GDP 20 yesterday was quite a bit weaker than expected. So just what you have seen in contract and note of some expectation about the China business and to what extent you think that might help you. That's my first question.  And then the second question is on the deposit migration in Hong Kong, as I just noted in Slide 41, it looks like the [indiscernible] , which is obviously traditionally a very strong retail franchise, it looks like it was [indiscernible] away. So does that suggest that the migration is maybe there in Hong Kong and may be [indiscernible] out.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure, Yes. So on the non-NII wealth in Asia, you will observe actually the biggest pickup is in insurance -- sorry, first, taking the impact of funding the trading book, which is showing under non-NII and this material is $1.2 billion. If you take this one out, the growth is essentially from insurance and insurance in Hong Kong, it does appear on the non-NII but not fee income. That growth is kind of a reflection of the growth we've seen in Q1. It's in the 40% to 50% growth year-on-year. It is reflective of the opening of the border between China and Hong Kong and the additional inflow of Mainland Chinese policy, new policies. Now Hong Kong business, about 30% of new policies are from Mainland Chinese.  As you would expect, insurance is a core component of our wealth in particular here in Hong Kong, and that's the main driver of the growth. We still see some softness in Wealth with regards equities trading, and that's more reflective of the equity markets in general. And I want to say the -- while the Hong Kong GDP is a main driver of our loan portfolios in terms of growth in our balance sheet, Wealth activity is not necessarily directly linked to the GDP. It is linked to investor behaviors and it is linked to sentiment in the market.  With regard to your second question on migration. So in HSBC, we continue to see a migration of around 1% per month, although it did slow a little bit in April, but that kind of continued a trend that we have been forecasting whereas in Hang Seng where the term deposit share is in the mid-30s percent, our colleagues in Hang Seng have taken a proactive approach to manage some of the highly rate-sensitive deposits and allow them if you want to accept some attrition against these highly rate-sensitive or rate-chasing deposit and this is what allowed them to maintain or slightly reduce their term deposit mix. They are benefiting from a very strong liquidity position and a strong deposit franchise and they do not need necessarily highly rate-sensitive deposits at that margin.\nRichard O'Connor: Thank you. We've got a question from Sam. And then we've got one last question from the line. Sam, over to you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Congrats on the strong results. Sam Alt from Jefferies. Just a very quick question on Hong Kong mortgage. Mortgage rate in Hong Kong right now is well below HIBOR. Many smaller banks are actually backing off from the mortgage market. So do you see mortgage pricing in Hong Kong going up and what would be the implications for that? So that's the first question.  The second question is on China, there are a lot of macro concerns going on right now. So how would you navigate through the macro uncertainties as a bank?\nNoel Quinn: Okay. Thanks, Sam. Do you want to handle the mortgage and take the first part? Yes.\nGeorges Elhedery: So Sam, the -- first, our mortgage, we continue mortgages. Yes, indeed, the rates are quite attractive for borrowers. And we increased our mortgage book, not a smaller -- not a very large amount, but we increased our mortgage book. So we continue -- and this is despite a subdued property sales in Hong Kong. We continue increasing our book. The pricing, as you know, the mortgages are capped and the pricing is highly correlated to the savings rate. So for instance, last week, we increased the saving rate by about 12.5 basis points on Hong Kong dollar and automatically increases the cap and therefore, the mortgage pricing today by 12.5 basis points. But I see this as a natural evolution with rates, not a specific pricing for the mortgages or specific dynamic for the mortgage pricing, if you want.\nNoel Quinn: And in terms of China macro, so we had a brief conversation before. It's -- if you take all of the international banks share of the corporate debt market in Mainland China, I think all of us together are about 2% market share. So actually, growing your Corporate Banking business as an international bank, particularly if your strategy is connecting Mainland China to the rest of the world in both directions, GDP is not the prime driver of growth in the sense of what you can do because you're still relatively niche in the market and what is a huge market, so you can get growth despite the fact that GDP and by the way, GDP is still 5% plus. So it's not bad, but you can still get growth.  Similarly, in our Wealth business that we're pursuing in Mainland China, we're pursuing an area which is around about helping internationally orientated personal customers and particularly the domestic customers in the Greater Bay; Area get access to wealth products, insurance products to help them with their protection needs and their savings needs. And that is primarily targeted at the affluence or the emerging affluent sector rather than particularly at the high net worth or ultra-high net worth. Now that is the core business we have here in Hong Kong.  Now the way I look at it, is that proposition here in Hong Kong has been a very strong driver of growth and profitability for HSBC in Hong Kong, while we see that same opportunity in the Greater Bay Area, the engagement between Greater Bay Area or the Guangdong Province and Hong Kong represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for us. And what we're trying to do, which was different to 3, 4 years ago, we're targeting international wealth and insurance as our primary proposition as opposed to just becoming another mortgage provider or another card provider in Guangdong province. So I think we see opportunity for growth. Yes, you can't ignore the macro environment, but we do see conditions for good growth for our business in Mainland China.\nRichard O'Connor: Last question from Joe Dickson from the lines, please.\nOperator: We will take the last question from the phone from Joseph Dickerson, Jefferies.\nJoseph Dickerson: This is a double header from Jefferies on Q&A. Just a quick question. Most have been answered. Just on the dividend question that Aman asked. The answer was slightly longwinded. If I interpret what you're saying, it sounds like you would like the dividend, the ordinary, to be progressive?  And then secondly, can you just discuss in the Hong Kong business of the business, the NIM trend that was flat quarter-on-quarter. How much was the U.S. dollar-denominated business at play there? Because if I look at your rate sensitivity disclosures, the USD bucket is now looks liability [indiscernible]. So what -- how much of the NIM movement there, say, an adverse expense was attributed to the U.S. dollar business? Or was it something else?\nNoel Quinn: Okay. Let me deal with the dividend one first. The guidance we've given is for 2023 and 2024, we'll have a 50% payout ratio. In addition, we've guided to the first use of proceeds of Canada's sale proceeds will be a $0.21 special dividend. So we're not giving any guidance on whether the dividend is progressive or not progressive. We're only giving the guidance that we've just said, which is 50% of profits. Clearly, as a management team, our ambition is to make our profits progressive. So that's -- but we're not guiding on dividends as a progressive dividend policy. Our policy is 50% payout ratio. And that will be a function of earnings.  And Georges, do you want to cover Hong Kong NIM?\nGeorges Elhedery: So on the Hong Kong NIM, so the first, the NII increased by $0.1 billion, but the banking NIM increased by $0.4 billion because the non-NII component of the trading funding increased by $0.3 billion. Now the way the NIM -- the bank -- sorry, the way the statute in this [indiscernible] computed is only looking at the NII component and therefore, it's showing flat. But as I mentioned, we will be upgrading our disclosures and enhancing our disclosure with regards banking NIM, and that will give you more visibility on the overall margin when you take into account the funding of the trading book.  Now in terms of sensitivity to the USD, you're actually also driving towards the same kind of dynamic in the funding of the trading book. So dollars has been a currency that we fund a number of our activities with. So when you look at the NII sensitivity, dollars comes opposite to all the other currencies, because that's a funding currency. But essentially, dollars is funding -- our funding of the trading book. And therefore, when you look at the funding book sensitivity, we've put in a few kind of a few explanations on the slides where we estimated this to be -- to the tune of $1.3 billion, it is fair to assume most of it is dollars and therefore, reverses it and kind of renormalizes our dollar sensitivity overall on the balance sheet to be that of kind of a negative sensitivity for minus 100 basis points.\nNoel Quinn: Well, I just want to say thank you very much for all of your questions and your time today. I really appreciate you spending some time with us. Just to close with a couple of comments. We've had a good first 6 months. I'm pleased with how the business is performing. We delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 22.4% or 18.5%, excluding those notable items. And we've increased dividends and buybacks. I'm also confident about the future. We still have opportunities to drive growth and to diversify revenue while retaining tight cost control, and we have upgraded our returns guidance for 2023 and 2024.  Richard and the team are available to you if you have any further questions. But in the meantime, have a good rest of the day. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon to everyone in the room here in Hong Kong. Thank you for joining us, and great to see you again. And good morning to everyone watching from London and elsewhere. Before Georges takes you through the second quarter numbers, I'll start with a summary of the first half performance and progress.  First, I show this slide every quarter. It's critical in that it summarizes our strategy, and our strategy remains unchanged. It is summarized by the 4 pillars at the bottom of the slide. Let me take you through the latest outcomes of that strategy. We had a good first 6 months. I'm pleased with the broad-based profit and revenue generated by our global businesses and geographies. I'm also pleased with our strong capital generation and returns. We delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 22.4%, including the 2 material notable items reported in the first quarter or 18.5% if you exclude those notable items. And we've announced a second interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a second share buyback of up to $2 billion.  Today, we're also upgrading our guidance. Now we expect to achieve a return on tangible equity in the mid-teens for 2023 and 2024. Prior to 2023, we were very focused on transforming the business. Now while still continuing to improve operational efficiency, we are very focused on driving growth, diversifying revenue and creating incremental value.  We have a plan built around 6 areas. I will take you through some of these over the next few slides. Starting with our international connectivity. We grew wholesale cross-border client business in the first half by around 50%, with growth across all regions, driven by higher rates. Our international proposition in Wealth and Personal Banking continues to gain traction. We now have 6.3 million international WPB customers, and that is up 500,000 or 8% over the last 12 months. That's significant because these international customers generate around 2.5x the average customer revenue.  Finally, we drove strong revenue growth in Transaction Banking, which was up 63%. there were good performances in foreign exchange and in global payment solutions. Trade was slightly down year-on-year, in line with global trade volumes, but trade balances stabilized in the second quarter, particularly in Asia. And HSBC was named Best Bank for Trade Finance by Euromoney for the second year in a row as well as Best Bank in Asia.  The next slide sets out our latest progress on another area of focus, the redeployment of capital from less strategic or low connectivity businesses into higher-growth international opportunities. I'm pleased that we agreed new terms for the sale of our French retail banking operations in the quarter. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, and we now have a lot of work to do to complete migration in early 2024. The sale of our banking operations in Canada remains on track to complete in early 2024, with a special dividend of $0.21 per share planned thereafter. We completed the disposal of our Greek business last weekend, and we've announced the disposal of our Russian operations. We are changing the nature of our business in Oman, and we will wind down our WPB operations in New Zealand. Crucially, this is allowing us to target growth opportunities, some of which are set out on the right-hand side.  The first is the continued development of our wealth business across the whole of Asia. Our digitally enabled wealth and insurance business in Mainland China now has 1,400 wealth planners and is driving good new business growth. We launched Global Private Banking in India last month. In June, we launched HSBC Innovation Banking, a strengthened globally connected proposition on the back of our purchase of SVB U.K. We will nurture the specialism that we acquired, back it with HSBC's balance sheet strength and global network and build further Innovation Banking businesses in the U.S., here in Hong Kong and Israel. The process is already well underway and will enable us to support our clients in the technology and life sciences sectors to achieve their global ambitions.  Finally, we've announced today that we are also increasing our shareholding in trade shifts and have agreed to launch a jointly owned business in early 2024 to provide embedded financing solutions within their trade ecosystem. We believe this will help us to grow our client base in commercial banking, giving us a new avenue for growth outside of traditional relationship banking.  The next slide looks at how we are diversifying revenue by growing fee income and collaboration. As I've said, our wealth strategy continues to gather momentum, especially in Asia. Net new invested assets were down in the rest of the world due to lower third-party asset management liquidity products, mainly in the U.S., but they were up in Asia by 21% to $27 billion. Over the last 12 months, we took in a total of $75 billion of net new invested assets and grew our invested assets by 8% globally. This all underlines the growth potential of our Wealth business. Fee income in Commercial Banking was up 6% in the first half and collaboration revenues between our Global businesses were up 5%. Collaboration revenue is particularly important in a relatively low growth economic environment because we can drive growth from within the organization.  The next slide focuses on the tight cost discipline we've maintained and how it enables us to invest in the bank of the future. We remain committed to disciplined cost management and have continued to use cost savings to increase investment in digitization. We increased spending on technology by 12.8% in the first half and this spending now accounts for 23% of our target base operating expenses. This investment has translated into faster services, reduced friction and more competitive products, all of which will improve the customer experience and our operational efficiency. We made good progress in increasing digital penetration amongst personal and business customers while increasing our product release frequency.  Investing in technology is also enhancing our capabilities. We now have a range of test and learn use cases for generative AI across HSBC and are in the process of scaling up a small number of those. Last month, we became the first bank to join BT and Toshiba's quantum-secured Metro network. This uses quantum technology for secure transmission of data, which should mitigate the risk of future cyber threats. And we are pleased to be working with the Hong Kong military authority on 2 pilots to test the Hong Kong dollar in a new payments ecosystem and to trial tokenized deposits.  My last slide shows how we've continued to build on our position as an enabler of the net zero transition. In the first half, we provided and facilitated $45 billion of sustainable finance and investments as we continue to work closely with our clients on their transition plans. This consisted of capital markets financing and on balance sheet lending to clients and included a number of key deals in Asia and the Middle East. We were recently named Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Asia by Euromoney for the 6 consecutive year.  I'll now hand over to Georges to take you through the Q2 numbers."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Noel. And a warm welcome to everyone in the room with us today. It is great to be back here in Hong Kong to deliver our interim results. And for those of you watching today from London and across the globe, a very good morning, and thank you for joining us. We've announced a good set of second quarter results. Reported profits before tax were at $8.8 billion, up 89% on last year's second quarter. Revenue was up 38% at $16.7 billion. This was driven by first, NII of $9.3 billion, which was up $2.5 billion or 38% year-on-year. And second, non-NII of $7.4 billion, which was up $2.1 billion or 39% year-on-year.  We booked expected credit losses of $0.9 billion in the quarter. Despite the inflationary environment, cost growth in the quarter was restricted to 1% compared to last year's second quarter, including $0.2 billion of severance costs. These severance costs were expected, and we are on track to meet our 2023 cost target to limit cost growth to around 3% on our target cost basis.  Compared to the first quarter, lending and deposits were both down 1% due to subdued loan demand, deposit outflows in global banking and markets in Europe and the reclassification of our portfolio in Oman to held for sale. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 14.7%. As Noel said, we announced a second interim dividend of $0.10 per share and the second share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we intend to complete in around 3 months. TNAV per share was down $0.24 due primarily to the final interim dividend for 2022 and the first interim dividend for 2023.  The next slide shows another strong quarterly revenue performance, with overall growth of 38% compared to the second quarter of '22. Three further points on this. As Noel mentioned, revenue was up in all 3 global businesses. Wealth was up 19% due to higher rates and a strong insurance performance mainly here in Hong Kong. And three, across Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, Global Payment Services reported revenues of around $4.2 billion, an increase of 115% on the second quarter of '22.  On the next slide, reported net interest income was $9.3 billion, up $0.3 billion or 4% on the first quarter. We've introduced banking NII as a new disclosure this quarter. It is derived by adjusting reported NII for the centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities and the NII generated by the Insurance business. At $11.6 billion, banking NII was up $1.3 billion on the first quarter and up $4.5 billion on last year's second quarter. The $2.4 billion centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities within Global Banking and Markets and the second quarter included a $0.4 billion year-to-date impact of methodology changes. As a reminder, the related income associated with these funding costs is reported with non-NII.  The net interest margin was 172 basis points, up 3 basis points on the first quarter of '23 and up 43 basis points on the second quarter of '22. We continue our structural hedging activity. Our NII sensitivity is $2.6 billion for a 100 basis point drop in rates against the previous year-end sensitivity of $4 billion. At this point, we are adjusting our NII guidance. We now expect NII of at least $35 billion in '23. Within this, we expect the centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities within Global Banking and Markets to be in excess of $7 billion with associated income reported in non-NII. We continue to reiterate that we expect to see higher pass-through rates and continued migration to time deposits. And we remain cautious on loan growth over the next 6 to 12 months, but we do expect it to start picking up some time in 2024. I know that many of you will have questions about banking NII, in particular, which I'll be very happy to address as we move into Q&A later on.  Moving on. Non-NII of $7.4 billion was down on the first quarter, which benefited from $3.7 billion of notable items and FX translation. However, it was up $2.1 billion or 39% in the second quarter of '22. A couple of things to mention here. One, there was a strong wealth performance, up $0.3 billion or 19% on the second quarter of last year, $0.2 billion of which came from increased life insurance income, primarily in Hong Kong. And two, Markets & Security Services was down due to lower client activity and the methodology change that I just mentioned earlier. Fees were up $0.1 billion in the second quarter of '22 due to higher personal banking and commercial banking fees.  Turning now to credit. Our second quarter ECL charge was $0.9 billion, which was $0.5 billion up on the second quarter last year. It includes $0.3 billion for our mainland China commercial real estate exposure booked in Hong Kong and a $0.3 billion charge for the U.K. To remind you, this is a more normalized level of charge that we expect for this year and is a sign that our main credit indicators are holding up. On the basis of what we have seen so far in 2023 and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to expect a 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending, including held-for-sale balances.  The next slide is our 6-month update on our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. And before, our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. At the full year, our exposure was $9.4 billion. It now stands at $8.1 billion, due primarily to repayments. The proportion of substandard and credit impaired exposures is around 65% of the portfolio marginally up from the full year. Of these $5.2 billion of exposures that we rate as substandard or credit impaired, $1.1 billion is secured with minimal ECL due to the security held. Against the remaining $4.1 billion, we have increased our provisions from $1.7 billion at the full year to $1.9 billion today. Within this, our coverage ratio against the unsecured credit impaired exposures has increased from around 55% to nearly 70%. At the end of 2022, we calculated a plausible downside scenario of $1 billion on this portfolio. As you can see, we have now crystallized some of that downside into the P&L. We remain comfortable with our coverage level.  On Slide 17, despite the inflationary environment, cost growth was restricted to 1% on a constant currency basis, versus the second quarter last year. As you can see, a large share of this growth was technology related. There was also a higher performance-related pay accrual and the expected severance costs, which were offset by a write-back of software and lease impairments. We remain committed to limiting cost growth to around 3% in 2023 on our cost target basis. On this target basis, second quarter costs were up 6% year-on-year, of which around half was the $0.2 billion of expected severance costs.  As a reminder, our cost target basis exclude notable items from constant currency operating expenses. It also excludes the impact of retranslating hyperinflationary economies at constant currency. And finally, it excludes the acquired cost base and additional investments in HSBC Innovation Banking, which are expected to result in incremental growth of around 1% above our targeted basis. The full cost target basis reconciliation will be on Slide 26 of this deck. Our CET1 ratio was 14.7%, which was stable on the previous quarter. Profit generation was offset by the dividend accrual of $6.9 billion during the first half and the share buyback of $2 billion that has now completed.  So in summary, this was another good quarter. There were good profit and net interest income performances. Credit remains resilient. We are on track to limit cost growth in '23 to 3% on our cost target basis. We now expect NII of at least $35 billion in '23. And as Noel said, we now expect a mid-teens return on tangible equity in '23 and '24 excluding the upcoming sale of Canada. Finally, we are returning capital to shareholders by way of increased dividends and share buybacks.  And with that, I'll ask Richard we can open it up for questions. Richard, please. Thank you."

Could you give us a bit more color on that about what you would expect in Q2? I appreciate the change in the costs have been somewhat allocated but [indiscernible] some benefits compare overall in [indiscernible] [indiscernible]a little bit more.  And then secondly, we've also talked about increasing hedging and the structural hedge in order to reduce the downtime risk from NII. [indiscernible] Can you [indiscernible] what we've done and how to think about that in terms of potential benefits going forward into '24 and beyond."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Manus. So on NIM NII, NIM in Asia was flat because most of the uplift from rates has translated into an uplift in the non-NII component of the trading book funding, about $0.3 billion uplift in that space. We've introduced banking NII. In due course, we will enhance our disclosure in the space to introduce banking NII sensitivity and banking NIM, which would be reflecting such an uplift.  The -- with regard to your second question, Manus, the hedging activity, so if you look at our NII sensitivity, downwards 100 basis points have reduced from $4 billion to $2.6 billion. About 1/3 of that reduction is due to our hedging structural hedging activity and another 1/3 of that reduction would be effect of the change of the composition of our balance sheet. And then the last 1/3 is numerous other factors, including modeling enhancements. If you now look at our structural hedging activity, which we've conducted over the last 12 months, the overall impact on the reduction of banking NII sensitivity is to the tune of $1 billion."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure. So what -- due to the somewhat subdued loan growth in Asia, we have the management of Asia taken the decision to allocate more funding towards supporting some of the trading activities. So the overall funding of our trading books globally, which heavily used also in Asia, moved from about $108 billion or circa 6% of our deposit base to around $130 billion or about 9% -- 8%, 9% for deposit base. That additional lending or that additional transition from funds have moved NII into non-NII income. It is still a rate sensitive, and it does benefit from improved level of rates, particularly in dollars where it's coming from."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Aman Rakkar",
        "text": "I have three questions, please. So again, on net interest income, at face value you are greater than $35 billion, NII guide does imply a step-up in the run rate of net interest income in Q3 and Q4. I suspect you would point us to the greater than $35 billion, suggesting that there's some conservatism . But can you talk to what the pressures are or indeed actually even the sources of support on the net interest income run rate from here through to year-end?  I think one thing the market would love is some sense of whether this level of net interest income is sustainable beyond this year? So anything you can give us there, I guess, related to -- I know that the U.K. has been very strong as well. So any kind of color you could give us on the moving parts there and the sustainability of net interest income in the U.K. would be great.  The second question was around distributions. Specifically around your dividend, you're reiterating your 50% payout ratio guidance this year. This year, and potentially next year, it does look like it's going to be quite strong earnings. I guess if you take consensus looking for an underlying EPS of around $1.20, which involves an ordinary dividend of $0.60. I mean that number feels big versus $0.51 you used to state versus what you did last year. And I guess the question is how comfortable are you with paying a big ordinary dividend now, which might then become quite difficult to sustain in the future if rates come off and earnings kind of taper, are you bothered that you do $0.60 this year and you do some number that's lower than that next year or thereafter?"

        "text": "Sure. Thank you, Amandeep. So kind of in turn, addressing your points. First, as you did say, we're emphasizing that this is a floor. We're emphasizing this is a guidance of greater than $35 billion. We're revising this floor because we're gaining more comfort first half way into the year and with the outcomes of H1. We want to remain cautious, and you may find our guidance to be cautious given the difficulty to forecast some of the challenges I'll talk about in a second. And then in terms of outlook for the rest of the year, look, we are not looking to change the consensus for H2 NII. We're comfortable with H2 NII consensus stands at this stage.  Now in terms of the pressure and the support we're seeing, well, we're seeing certainly tailwinds that we've seen already in Q2, one in terms of additional rate hikes to be expected very much in the major currencies, such as dollar, pound and euro. We've seen also tailwinds in the HIBOR normalization. We've seen about 1% quarter-on-quarter normalization of HIBOR. And if you look at July, we continue seeing further normalization. HIBOR is now around 5%. So probably at the end of July, we'll have fully normalized. And those will provide us some -- certainly some tailwinds as we look into H2.  This being said, we continue to see the same headwinds we've been calling out from the year-end, and they will continue manifesting in H2. The first headwind, which we forecast to remain is the subdued balance sheet growth, certainly subdued loan growth due to the activity. We have indicated we may see some resumption in '24, but for the -- for this half -- for the next half year, would probably remain as a headwind.  And naturally, the other headwind that is very difficult to forecast is the deposit costs, the behavior, what pass-through rates we will be feeding in, what is the impact of lagged migration to time deposits. Hong Kong, we're still assuming a 1% migration per month and whether this manifests as it is, it is very difficult to forecast, hence, our cautiousness.  Now if I look forward, look, we're not guiding for NII in '24. But there are a few things I can just give you to kind of bake in your analysis. The first one is you have to exclude Canada and France upon completion of these France retail upon completion of these transactions, which now we expect for Canada in Q1 '24. And in France, as we initially ambitioned we're aiming 1st of June '24.  The second one, you have to expect that the balance sheet growth will resume at some stage in '24, and that will give us support for NII. The third one is obviously the structured hedging, which I mentioned a bit earlier, and the impact they will have on more stabilization of outlook for NII. And obviously, the fourth one is what interest rate assumptions you are going to use and what pass-through rates you're going to use. And then last but not least, we are investing a lot in our non-NII or fee income earning businesses and do expect fee income earning businesses to continue driving some of that growth. That's it for the NII component."

I think in your math, based on consensus, you have taken out notable items. I'm not going to comment on the size of the dividend. But what I'm going to say is in order for us to sustain dividend, there are a few things we're working on and you can as well do the math, Amandeep. The first one is share buybacks. As you know, share buybacks is reducing our share count. And to the extent we ambition to continue on the journey of share buybacks as long as we remain capital generative, which is what we forecast, you have to adjust your denominator by the share count.  The second thing is the NII stabilization actions we're taking, which should give us some protection from a reversal of the rate cycle. And the third and fourth -- third one is obviously our cost discipline will be maintained. Even though we haven't yet we're not ready to share numbers, we will maintain the discipline. And lastly, as I again indicated, fee income growth and the investments we're putting in fee-generating areas such as investment and wealth are also initiatives to support, mitigate a turn in our earnings and therefore a turn in possibly our dividends beyond '24."

The first one, just being on distribution perhaps driven by Georges' thoughts on potential for buybacks in the second half of the year and looking at your capital ratio, obviously, we will probably have to make a couple of adjustments [indiscernible] that's about 25 basis points, and we've got the buyback that we've announced today, that's 50 basis points on the level. Just thinking about [indiscernible] Guidance, [indiscernible] perhaps slightly less capital generative in the second half. So just wondering if you can scope for us Georges on what is [Technical Difficulty] from here?  And then the second one, just for Noel on the management [indiscernible]. If I look at the [indiscernible] management revenue this quarter, [indiscernible] just sort of stable on Q1. I am wondering if that understates some of the momentum that you are building within the business. So if you could help us understand how you expect that margin [indiscernible]."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "So in terms of the buyback, obviously, the fact that today we announced a $2 billion buyback will today have an impact on our Q3 CET1 ratio of 25 basis points. But you do expect us to continue generating profitability, which will build capital, 50% of which will be provisioned for dividend based on the 50% dividend payout ratio anticipation. And therefore, that buyback will take into the additional capital generation. So I wouldn't look at Q3 25 basis points as a -- due to the buyback we just announced as a challenge. This is obviously -- this is just upfronting if you want the profit generation that we would be doing in the quarter.  Beyond that, again, at this stage, what I can say is we believe we remain capital generative for the foreseeable future. And as long as we're capital generative, we remain -- we continue to ambition a rolling series of share buybacks. But obviously, we would review this on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on a number of factors, including our capital adequacy ratio. I just want to also highlight and probably answering your question, Raul, and complementing the question of Amandeep earlier, that the Canada sale expected in Q1 '24 will provide us additional capital. The priority use of the first part of it is for a $0.21 dividend, which we will be in a position to distribute expected in H1 '24. And then the residual part of it, we will utilize to supplement or complement or top up any capital buyback and we're planning to do."

        "text": "Thank you. And I think it's a fair comment on your second question that what we're talking about here is very much growth in lead indicators. The $27 billion of net new invested assets here in Asia in the first half, up 21%. Globally, net new invested assets growth of $75 billion over the past 12 months. A growth in our aggregate invested assets of 7% globally. They're strong lead indicators, an additional 0.5 million international customers in the past 12 months. For me, they are the lead indicators. I think you're absolutely right, there will be a lag effect as you turn the customer acquisition and asset acquisition into revenue. But that's why we're talking about building businesses and new growth opportunities that can supplement our revenue going forward and give us some cushion on offset to any downside rate effect that may emerge post '23 and post '24. So we think it's the right thing to do.  And you're right, the revenue will be a lag indicator on those early success criteria that we're sharing with you. If you remember, our growth in our Wealth business in Mainland China, we started with 0 wealth managers just over 2 years ago. We've now about 1,400. Our ambition is to get to 3,000 over the relatively near term over the next couple of years or so. Again, that will be revenue generative as an offset because most of that is fee-based as an offset to any downside pressure that may be on interest rates. So I think your second comment is a fair comment, but I turn that into the positive rather than the negative."

Most of these charges are on stage 3. These are more technical adjustments of the names that have defaulted. So where we stand now in terms of charges is we are comfortable with the charges we have against this portfolio in China CRE. Now with regards to the plausible downside scenario, we indicated $1 billion at the year-end as a plausible downside. We have indeed crystallized $0.3 billion of it. So without being precise on the math here, it is indeed a residual circa $0.7 billion that remains a plausible downside which may or may not materialize over the coming few quarters."

Listen, we believe in both the mortgage book and the savings of the deposit book, we've tried to make sure that we are offering a good range of products to our clients, whereby they have choices, so on savings. We've got a good competitive range of fixed rate deposit accounts in the market. We also believe we've got good pricing in place for more instant access type savings accounts or deposit accounts. We will participate with the FCA and on any review they do.  We believe if you take our 2-year fixed rate savings account in the U.K. based on the yield curve in the U.K., we're offering savers the opportunity to get 5.1% on that fixed term -- 2-year fixed-term savings account. If you compare that to our 2-year fixed mortgage product that we're offering to our customers with a 60% loan-to-value ratio, we're in the market at around about 5.53% and for new-to-bank customers, we'd be in the market at about 6.1%. So we believe we have the structure of the deposit book and the structure of the mortgage book in the right level. And as ever, there is a price difference between term products and instant access products because of the maturity and the liquidity risk.  So we have tried to price our products fairly and appropriately. We're very cognizant of the pressures that U.K. customers face at this point in time. We certainly try to remain competitive and to help them navigate what is going to be a challenging year or so with high interest rates in the yield curve and higher rates of inflation, but we will fully participate with any review that the FCA take. We're also trying to encourage through marketing prompts customers to take advantage of those products if they want them and they meet their circumstances. We can't and should not force them into term savings, but we need to make sure they're aware of our term savings products should they want to take advantage of it. So hopefully, that answers your question."

For the long-term questions, I will ask management if you have -- if you can give us any color on potential impact of Basel III reform. Because I think one of the key support on share prices is buyback and shareholder return, right? And then I think the impact on capital because of this potential regulatory changes will have an impact on how we model in future capital return. But this is more in the long term, I understand that, I just want to get some color? Any color, particularly after the U.S. regulatory release that Basel III End Game, like how would that change our present forecast on that, so this is for the long-term question.  And then on the near term, just now, I think management gave us a number. Potential additional ECL charges on China's CRE is $0.7 billion. And then I also noticed that for our guidance for full year credit cost is 40 basis points. But if I look at the first half, it's a bit less than 30 basis points on an annualized basis, right? So that additional upside on credit costs, like have we included that $0.7 billion or that $0.7 billion is outside of the 40 basis points guidance?"

        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "I think I'll take the second one first, and then ask Georges to cover the more technical, difficult bolstering question. So on the ECL, look, we decided to maintain guidance of 40 basis points on ECL because there's still a lot of economic uncertainty out there. There's economic uncertainty around China's commercial real estate. There's economic uncertainty generally in the world.  We've had a good first half performance on ECL, I should say, $1.3 billion is below the run rate of 40 basis points. So we think we do have some capacity to absorb some of that risk that's inherent in the commercial real estate book in China. But I think I'd be misleading you if everything could be so scientifically proven because you've got to -- it all depends on what happens elsewhere in the world.  So yes, I could easily say, yes, we've got capacity to absorb that, but it depends what happens elsewhere in the world. So -- but we do believe we have -- it's right to maintain a conservative guidance at the moment on ECL is at 40 basis points. And we have capacity in the second half relative to the first half performance to absorb some additional shocks should they come through from near-term economic issues.  Georges, do you want to handle Basel III?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Yes. I mean, just -- maybe just finishing on the ECL point, good question, you have to analyze H1. If you look at Q2 at $0.9 billion as a more normalized level. So that is more the level that you can look at, whereas Q1 was unusually quite low, so this is why H1 will look low to your taste. So on Basel III, look, so the first thing to share about Basel III is we need to know the final rules. At this stage, most of these rules are still in draft form, and they will remain subject to change as we know the final rule.  The second thing I will share is that based on the current draft rules in -- as per our PRA standards for the group holdings, there will be a minor improvement initially in our RWAs. But as the output floor starts kicking in 5 years into the journey, so from 25 plus 5 years, there is a likelihood that the output floor will catch us and net-net, the impact may be in a material up or down, but immaterial up as we look at it at this way.  This being said, I just want to caution one thing. The U.S. obviously issued their draft rules last week. They came out more severe than we initially expected. They will have an impact on our U.S. operations. It remains a marginal impact. We're likely talking single-digit RWA uplift against a possible downward move before that. But those rules will impact our local reporting for our U.S. entity will not change the way we report at the group level. So we will need to navigate both if you want, in parallel."

And what we're typically reallocating is from what I call bad cost, costs that are associated with low return in portfolios, low return in business activities in certain markets or costs that are associated with manual processes that should be digitized.  So if you look at our cost performance, I think we increased our investment in IT costs by 12% so far this year, first half to first half. We increased some of our investment costs in our global businesses, and we reduced costs elsewhere, and that's what's getting us back to the 3%. So we're investing and saving at the same time.  And that is a phenomenon that probably historically HSBC has not been . It's typically been cost management or cost investment. And it's been a cycle, you manage costs tight and then you invest. We're definitely trying to do both at the same time, and there's a lot of self-funding going on to try and mitigate the overall cost base. And that's how we're building out the 1,400 people in Mainland China because we're saving costs through other country exits or the market exits, reducing our support costs in some of the manual processes in our global processing centers, that's allowing that investment to take place. And that's been the journey for the past 3 years.  On the SVB, the integration is going well. The business, we've had no nasty surprises since the day we bought the business. It was profitable the day we bought it. It is still profitable. We're going through systems migration at the moment. One statistic, which is probably an important guide for the future; in the 3 months post acquisition, we talk to bank customers at a higher rate than the 3 months prior to acquisition.  So in the transition of ownership from the previous owners to us, we've seen an uptick in the momentum of customers wanting to bank with SVB in that first 3 months period. That acquisition has also given us the knowledge, the platform, the connections and frankly, the positive brand and reputation globally that has allowed us to go and recruit a team in the U.S. We've recruited a team here in Hong Kong, and we've recruited a team in Israel.  So my view is that there is strong growth prospects in that business, not just for the next 2 or 3 years. I'm doing this because I think this will be an important business for us in the 5- to 10- to 15-year time frame. This is an important sector of the economy, and we're willing to invest in it. So I'm very pleased with how it's going.  We probably do owe you, as an investment community, more detail on so how material, what are the numbers. And I think we'll come back to you at the end of the year with if you add this all together, the investment and the current bought business, what could that potentially look like going forward and how material is that. But that is something, if it's okay, we'll give you more towards the end of this year with the full year results."

But first, in terms of pass-through rates on the deposits, for the last 50 basis points of rate hikes from the Bank of England, we've passed through to our savings rate, retail savings rate, around 70%. So we believe from a consumer point of view, we are competitive, having passed through. And obviously, this is a higher than 50% pass-through. The overall book pass-through within the around 40 -- between 40% and 50%. But clearly, the marginal pass-throughs are higher at this high level of rates.  Equally, on the mortgages, we continue aiming for market share. So we've grown the stock market share from 7.7% to 7.8%. And our new business market share is now just shy of 10%, so we maintain a leading proposition in mortgages. Now if I go specifically on the NIM. Look, without talking to our peers' NIM some parameters that you can use when you're doing your assessment and your analysis. The first one is we have a very strong liquidity position with a very strong deposit franchise and a low loan-to-deposit ratio.  The second one to take into account is we are relatively small in consumer finance. So that component of our portfolio is single-digit percentage of our retail finance. The third one to take into account is that our structural hedging is relatively young, i.e., we started the structural hedging essentially when rates started to be at higher levels. So we have little \"baggage\" from structural hedging positions from prior, i.e., when rates were very low, and this is obviously helping us in adjusting our NIM upwards and we're not bogged by, if you want, low interest-earning assets from older structural hedges. And in terms of expectations, I think it's fair to expect that the increase we've seen in Q1 is unlikely to be repeated as we look into the rest of the year."

That's sort of over and above because -- so what we're trying to say is we've given you a mid-teens ROTE guidance for the core business, not with the big swings in M&A activity, achieving it. That's the way I'd look at it.  So we just want to try and make sure everyone understands what we mean by mid-teens, and it doesn't include the big one-offs, either the one-off positive or the one-off negatives. We're looking at the fundamental business in guiding to that."

I mean it is now what you view as the through-the-cycle type of level of profitability that you've got if you look consensus 2025 at the moment and that's dropping away again because I guess people, the ones also dropped out. But I mean it sounds to me as if you think now maybe interest rates have normalized to a level where they're probably more realistic than they have been in the last decade or so. And may be your profitability meeting is now what you're comfortable with? Is that what you're seeing on more of a sort of basis?"

So I wouldn't overread the -- now clearly, in '25 and beyond, you've got interest rates that will start to come off, but I'm also talking about building alternative revenue streams, building balance sheet growth because as interest rates come off, economic recovery improves and the balance sheet will start to grow again. So our job as a management team, and our philosophy is we want to try and make sure we can mitigate some of that downside risk either through hedging or alternative growth strategies to stabilize the ROTE over time. But for the avoidance of doubt, we are not guiding at the moment on 2025 ROTE. We're only guiding on '23 and '24, and we'll have to see how the economics of the world develop. And I think Georges should probably reiterate what he said at the end of that because the line went a bit hazy."

So if I look at your Asian entity for it look like revenues is truly is high quarter-on-quarter, but NII gone up a little bit. So that suggests me that [indiscernible] fractionally down a little. Just wondering what you're seeing in front line, especially at [indiscernible]. And obviously, Hong Kong's GDP 20 yesterday was quite a bit weaker than expected. So just what you have seen in contract and note of some expectation about the China business and to what extent you think that might help you. That's my first question.  And then the second question is on the deposit migration in Hong Kong, as I just noted in Slide 41, it looks like the [indiscernible] , which is obviously traditionally a very strong retail franchise, it looks like it was [indiscernible] away. So does that suggest that the migration is maybe there in Hong Kong and may be [indiscernible] out."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure, Yes. So on the non-NII wealth in Asia, you will observe actually the biggest pickup is in insurance -- sorry, first, taking the impact of funding the trading book, which is showing under non-NII and this material is $1.2 billion. If you take this one out, the growth is essentially from insurance and insurance in Hong Kong, it does appear on the non-NII but not fee income. That growth is kind of a reflection of the growth we've seen in Q1. It's in the 40% to 50% growth year-on-year. It is reflective of the opening of the border between China and Hong Kong and the additional inflow of Mainland Chinese policy, new policies. Now Hong Kong business, about 30% of new policies are from Mainland Chinese.  As you would expect, insurance is a core component of our wealth in particular here in Hong Kong, and that's the main driver of the growth. We still see some softness in Wealth with regards equities trading, and that's more reflective of the equity markets in general. And I want to say the -- while the Hong Kong GDP is a main driver of our loan portfolios in terms of growth in our balance sheet, Wealth activity is not necessarily directly linked to the GDP. It is linked to investor behaviors and it is linked to sentiment in the market.  With regard to your second question on migration. So in HSBC, we continue to see a migration of around 1% per month, although it did slow a little bit in April, but that kind of continued a trend that we have been forecasting whereas in Hang Seng where the term deposit share is in the mid-30s percent, our colleagues in Hang Seng have taken a proactive approach to manage some of the highly rate-sensitive deposits and allow them if you want to accept some attrition against these highly rate-sensitive or rate-chasing deposit and this is what allowed them to maintain or slightly reduce their term deposit mix. They are benefiting from a very strong liquidity position and a strong deposit franchise and they do not need necessarily highly rate-sensitive deposits at that margin."

Many smaller banks are actually backing off from the mortgage market. So do you see mortgage pricing in Hong Kong going up and what would be the implications for that? So that's the first question.  The second question is on China, there are a lot of macro concerns going on right now. So how would you navigate through the macro uncertainties as a bank?"

And we increased our mortgage book, not a smaller -- not a very large amount, but we increased our mortgage book. So we continue -- and this is despite a subdued property sales in Hong Kong. We continue increasing our book. The pricing, as you know, the mortgages are capped and the pricing is highly correlated to the savings rate. So for instance, last week, we increased the saving rate by about 12.5 basis points on Hong Kong dollar and automatically increases the cap and therefore, the mortgage pricing today by 12.5 basis points. But I see this as a natural evolution with rates, not a specific pricing for the mortgages or specific dynamic for the mortgage pricing, if you want."

        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "And in terms of China macro, so we had a brief conversation before. It's -- if you take all of the international banks share of the corporate debt market in Mainland China, I think all of us together are about 2% market share. So actually, growing your Corporate Banking business as an international bank, particularly if your strategy is connecting Mainland China to the rest of the world in both directions, GDP is not the prime driver of growth in the sense of what you can do because you're still relatively niche in the market and what is a huge market, so you can get growth despite the fact that GDP and by the way, GDP is still 5% plus. So it's not bad, but you can still get growth.  Similarly, in our Wealth business that we're pursuing in Mainland China, we're pursuing an area which is around about helping internationally orientated personal customers and particularly the domestic customers in the Greater Bay; Area get access to wealth products, insurance products to help them with their protection needs and their savings needs. And that is primarily targeted at the affluence or the emerging affluent sector rather than particularly at the high net worth or ultra-high net worth. Now that is the core business we have here in Hong Kong.  Now the way I look at it, is that proposition here in Hong Kong has been a very strong driver of growth and profitability for HSBC in Hong Kong, while we see that same opportunity in the Greater Bay Area, the engagement between Greater Bay Area or the Guangdong Province and Hong Kong represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for us. And what we're trying to do, which was different to 3, 4 years ago, we're targeting international wealth and insurance as our primary proposition as opposed to just becoming another mortgage provider or another card provider in Guangdong province. So I think we see opportunity for growth. Yes, you can't ignore the macro environment, but we do see conditions for good growth for our business in Mainland China."

If I interpret what you're saying, it sounds like you would like the dividend, the ordinary, to be progressive?  And then secondly, can you just discuss in the Hong Kong business of the business, the NIM trend that was flat quarter-on-quarter. How much was the U.S. dollar-denominated business at play there? Because if I look at your rate sensitivity disclosures, the USD bucket is now looks liability [indiscernible]. So what -- how much of the NIM movement there, say, an adverse expense was attributed to the U.S. dollar business? Or was it something else?"

In addition, we've guided to the first use of proceeds of Canada's sale proceeds will be a $0.21 special dividend. So we're not giving any guidance on whether the dividend is progressive or not progressive. We're only giving the guidance that we've just said, which is 50% of profits. Clearly, as a management team, our ambition is to make our profits progressive. So that's -- but we're not guiding on dividends as a progressive dividend policy. Our policy is 50% payout ratio. And that will be a function of earnings.  And Georges, do you want to cover Hong Kong NIM?"

      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "So on the Hong Kong NIM, so the first, the NII increased by $0.1 billion, but the banking NIM increased by $0.4 billion because the non-NII component of the trading funding increased by $0.3 billion. Now the way the NIM -- the bank -- sorry, the way the statute in this [indiscernible] computed is only looking at the NII component and therefore, it's showing flat. But as I mentioned, we will be upgrading our disclosures and enhancing our disclosure with regards banking NIM, and that will give you more visibility on the overall margin when you take into account the funding of the trading book.  Now in terms of sensitivity to the USD, you're actually also driving towards the same kind of dynamic in the funding of the trading book. So dollars has been a currency that we fund a number of our activities with. So when you look at the NII sensitivity, dollars comes opposite to all the other currencies, because that's a funding currency. But essentially, dollars is funding -- our funding of the trading book. And therefore, when you look at the funding book sensitivity, we've put in a few kind of a few explanations on the slides where we estimated this to be -- to the tune of $1.3 billion, it is fair to assume most of it is dollars and therefore, reverses it and kind of renormalizes our dollar sensitivity overall on the balance sheet to be that of kind of a negative sensitivity for minus 100 basis points."

    "transcript": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Investor and Analyst Conference Call for HSBC Holdings plc's Q3 2023 Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded.  At this time, I'll hand the call over to Georges Elhedery, Group Chief Financial Officer.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, operator, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter results call today. I will lead today's presentation and Noel will join me for the Q&A session. Allow me first to begin by saying a few words on recent events in the Middle East. We have all been shocked by the devastating terrorist attack on Israel on 7th of October and saddened by the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The loss of innocent life and suffering is heartbreaking. We continue to offer assistance to our impacted colleagues and clients. Just to be clear, we're not changing our strategy in Israel or the Middle East.  Turning to our results now. As always, our purpose ambition, values and strategy have been helping us drive the results that I am going to talk about today. Some highlights to begin with. First of all, the year-to-date performance clearly demonstrates that we have had three consecutive strong quarters reflecting the successful execution of our strategy.  Year-to-date reported profit before tax was $29.4 billion, which is an increase of $17.4 billion on the same period last year, supported by higher interest rates and enabled by our strong balance sheet and the non-recurrence of notable items. We have delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 17.1%, excluding strategic transactions.  For the avoidance of doubt, these transactions are the reversal earlier this year of the impairment relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in France and the gain on acquisition from SVB UK. We've announced another share buyback of up to $3 billion, bringing total buybacks announced this year up to $7 billion. And we've announced three quarterly dividends which totaled $0.30 per share.  We have also exhibited good growth across our businesses. Wholesale transaction banking revenue was up 50% year-to-date, primarily due to higher rates and reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise. Wealth had another good quarter. Wealth balances were up by 12% compared to the same quarter of last year. And we're also very pleased that we attracted $34 billion of net new invested assets in the quarter, bringing the rolling 12-month total of $277 billion, which is a strong performance and testament to our strategy.  The planned acquisition of Citi\u2019s wealth business in mainland China will also help accelerate our growth plans for this business. In our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK, we are also seeing good growth areas. In Hong Kong, insurance new business CSN was up 40% year-on-year. And our mortgage books in Asia and the UK grew by a total of $11 billion compared to the third quarter of last year.  Let me now move on to the third quarter numbers. Revenue was $16.2 billion, which was up $4.6 billion or 40% on last year's third quarter on a constant currency basis. This was driven firstly by group net interest income of $9.2 billion, which was up by $1.3 billion on the same period last year.  And secondly, non-NII was $6.9 billion up by $3.3 billion, primarily due to first the non-recurrence of a $2.5 billion impairment in last year's third quarter relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in France. Second, $1.6 billion higher revenue offset into non-NII from the central costs of funding GBM trading activity; and three, offset by $0.6 billion of treasury disposal losses taken for structural hedging and risk management purposes for our balance sheet.  Banking NII of $11.5 billion was up $2.8 billion on last year's third quarter, and broadly stable on the second quarter. Expected credit losses of $1.1 billion were broadly stable on the same period last year, and included a $0.5 billion charge in relation to our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio booked in Hong Kong.  Costs were up 1% in the quarter as lower restructuring costs were offset by higher technology spend, a higher performance-related pay accrual and costs from HSBC innovation banking. Lending balances and deposits were both broadly stable. And our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, an increase of 20 basis points on the second quarter.  Finally, we announced a third consecutive quarter of strong capital returns with a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share and a further share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we expect to complete before the full year results in February.  The next slide shows that our global businesses all performed well. Wealth and Personal Banking had a strong quarter with revenues up by 71% or by 7%, excluding the impairment taken in last year's third quarter relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France. Within this, Wealth was up by 6% as our ongoing investment in that business continued to gain traction, and Personal Banking also had another good quarter up by 21% due mainly to higher rates.  Across Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, global payment services had revenues of more than $4.3 billion, which was an increase of 56% on the third quarter of 2022. And in our trade business, lending balances were up 3% in the quarter, mainly in Asia, reversing the declining trend from previous quarters. Global Banking and Markets also performed well, up by 2%. This included a resilient performance in foreign exchange compared to a strong third quarter last year and the good performance in securities financing and debt markets.  On this next slide, reported net interest income was $9.2 billion, which was broadly stable on the second quarter. Banking NII was $11.5 billion, up $2.8 billion on last year's third quarter and stable on the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, banking NII in the second quarter was favorably impacted by a $0.4 billion year-to-date catch up due to methodology changes, approximately half of which was attributable to the first quarter.  Adjusting for this, banking NII was slightly up in this third quarter on the like-for-like basis. The net interest margin remained broadly stable at 170 basis points. We are not updating our 2023 NII guidance and are also not expecting consensus to change.  Next, constant currency non-NII of $6.9 billion was up $3.3 billion on last year's third quarter, primarily due to, number one, a $2.3 billion favorable movement in notable items and foreign exchange as last year's third quarter included the $2.5 billion impairment relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in France. And this year's third quarter included a $0.6 billion of treasury disposal losses.  Number two, a $1.6 billion increase in the revenue offset into non-NII from the central costs of funding GBM trading activity. And number three, a $0.3 billion decrease in other which includes lower market treasury income. We continue to reposition our treasury portfolio as part of our balance sheet structural hedging and risk management initiatives.  In the third quarter, this resulted in $0.6 billion of treasury disposal losses. These losses do not have a material impact on CET1 capital or TNAV as they have already been taken through reserves last year, although they will have a modest benefit to our CET1 ratio this year. The disposal proceeds are reinvested into higher yielding or higher duration assets.  Disposal losses are forecast to be more than recovered through NII with the majority over the next five years. Further restructuring of the treasury portfolio leading to a loss of around $0.4 billion is expected in the fourth quarter, which will also be reported as a notable item and have modest CET1 upside.  Turning now to credit. Our third quarter ECL charge was $1.1 billion, which was stable on the same period last year. It includes a $0.5 billion charge related to our mainland China commercial real estate exposure booked in Hong Kong, following a $0.4 billion charge in the same quarter last year. The remaining wholesale charge was $0.3 billion.  The $0.2 billion personal lending charge included modest UK releases, although we retain overlays to address the current risks in the economic outlook. Stage 3 balances of $19 billion were down $1 billion on the second quarter and account for 2% of total loans. We continue to expect the 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending, including held for sale balances.  Focusing now on our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio, our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. As you can see, our total exposure stands at $7.5 billion, which is down by $0.5 billion from the half here, primarily due to write offs. In February this year, we communicated the management assessed plausible downside scenario of around $1 billion.  The deterioration in the third quarter means that we crystallized around $500 million of provisions into the P&L that were part of this plausible downside. We're encouraged by recent policy measures, which will help the sector but need time to take effect. So the plausible downside scenario does now look more realistic for full year 2023.  Our exposures rated strong, good and satisfactory were broadly stable on the third quarter last year. Around half of these exposures is lending to state owned enterprises. The other half is primarily lending to privately owned enterprises that are not residential property developers. This is reflected in the minimal ECL allowance in this part of the portfolio.  And if I now turn to the table at the bottom of the slide against unsecured credit impaired exposures, we already have now 73% coverage ratio. And against unsecured substandard exposures, we have a coverage ratio of just under 10%. This is clearly an area that we will continue to monitor closely. But to reiterate, we continue to expect the 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average plus customer lending, including held for sale balances.  Next on costs, reported costs for the first nine months of 2023 were down 2% on last year, primarily due to lower restructuring costs. Our cost efficiency ratio for the same period was 44%, improved from 66% last year. On a constant currency basis, costs went up by 1% on last year's third quarter as the lower restructuring costs were offset by increased technology and operations spend, a higher performance related pay accrual and the acquisition and investment costs from HSBC Innovation Banking, which were not included in our original plans.  On our cost target basis, we now expect our 2023 costs to be around 4% higher than 2022. This is around 1% or $300 million more than previously guided due to higher technology and operation spending, which we believe is appropriate given the importance of digitization to the group and the strong financial performance of the business.  In addition to this, we are contemplating an increase in performance-related pay in the fourth quarter depending on the outturn of our performance and ongoing execution of our strategy in the fourth quarter. This would represent a further increase of around 1%. We have provided the full reconciliation from reported cost to our target basis cost on Slide 15 of the deck. And to reiterate, tight cost discipline remains my priority and a priority across the whole group.  The next slide shows our strong capital position. Our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, which was up 20 basis points on the second quarter. A few things to draw your attention to. Number one, the dividend accrued year-to-date is $9.6 billion or $0.49 per share while we have announced dividends of $5.9 billion or $0.30 per share.  Number two, we have announced a further share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have a circa 40 basis point impact on our CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter. We are aiming to complete it before the full year results in February. Number three, we also expect to reclassify our retail banking operations in France as held for sale in the fourth quarter ahead of completion of the planned sale on January 1, 2024, which would have a further impact on the CET1 ratio of around 30 basis points.  Finally, the planned sale of our Canada banking business also remains on track to complete in the first quarter of 2024. And as a reminder, profits from our Canada banking business accrued to the buyer and are not included in our dividend calculations for the year. We estimate the gain on sale will be around $5.5 billion, which we will recognize through a combination of earnings from Canada and the remaining gain on sale at completion. Upon completion of the transaction, it remains our intention to consider a special dividend of $0.21 per share as a priority use of the proceeds and as previously announced.  So in summary, this was another strong quarter. We delivered a good profit performance and an annualized return on tangible equity of 17.1%, excluding strategic transactions, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy. Transaction banking and wealth both performed well and continued investment will help accelerate the growth of our wealth business. We continue to expect the 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending. We remain committed to tight cost discipline. And we have a strong capital position and have increased return to shareholders by way of dividends and share buybacks.  And with that, operator, can we please open it up for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Georges. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Aman Rakkar from Barclays. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nAman Rakkar: Good morning, Georges. I hope you can hear me okay?\nGeorges Elhedery: We can hear you.\nAman Rakkar: Thank you so much. Two questions, please. Firstly on costs, can I just probably be a little bit more on exactly what's changed around costs? Because I think as recently as mid September, HSBC were reiterating their expectations for cost very much in line with the existing guide and the commitment to the cost base. So particularly the point around compensating the staff -- potentially compensating staff for performance, I understand that it's been a strong year for profit, but it doesn't look like the view of profitability changed materially since you last spoke to us. So that component there would be interesting. And the related point then is to what extent should we expect that element of cost growth to roll over into next year? I guess, at its heart, I'm trying to get a sense of what the underlying cost growth is that you're currently seeing through the business. And then the second question was around margins. I was wondering if you could just help us with a bit on your experience on deposit beta and term deposit mix, particularly in Hong Kong, but also a comment on the UK would be helpful. And as part of that, what your expectations are for NIM in both of those markets please? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Thank you, Aman. So first on costs, I think with regards this 1% cost we contemplate for Q4, we have to put this in the perspective of the financial performance. Obviously, at the start of the year, we weren't necessarily realizing the performance of the group. We obviously need to wait for Q4 both to assess the financial performance but equally to assess how we continue to deliver on our strategy. It ultimately will be a matter for the Board and the remuneration committee to decide but we felt it appropriate and fair to recognize that our colleagues have contributed, participated for the last many years through the whole strategic reshaping of the firm through ensuring we have a great deposit franchise and a strong balance sheet and obviously delivering the growth we've seen in wealth and transaction banking that we can channel 1% or the equivalent $300 million towards performance related pay. Again, all this is at the stage of contemplation, the matter we will reaffirm at the year end and again subject to our remuneration committee's opinion. In terms of next year, now we're not giving guidance for next year. But I think we are reflecting in this performance related pay a year-on-year material change in our performance, as you've seen from our returns and our PBT which obviously with that quantum we will probably not expect for next year, right? In terms of margins, Aman, so as we indicated at these levels of rates mostly in the UK and certainly in a number of Western markets and for our wholesale businesses, at these levels of rates, we were expecting to have a materially higher betas than 50%. We've expected that additional rate hikes from here would be mostly for the benefit of our customers. If you look at the overall betas in the UK, overall betas around 50, just north of 50%. So while the margin of betas have exceeded 80%, the overall is in the range of 50%. Term deposit mix Hong Kong kind of same trend as we've seen through the nine month coming to this quarter, about 1% migration per month. So we have seen 4% over the quarter after 2% previous quarter and 3% in the quarter one. That took the total term deposit mix to 31% in Hong Kong. We have not seen a deterioration of the trend. We expect the trend to remain the same as we look into potential headwinds in the future. But equally, we continue to see some of the tailwinds we were calling out before to continue. Just to put in perspective, the UK term deposit mix is just single digit percentage point. So we know it's a modest increase in Q3, but it's not a main contributor to the dynamic of our NII.\nNoel Quinn: Georges, if I could just add a couple of comments on the VP [ph]. There are two factors that really come into play on Q3. The half year when we talked about our cost position, we had a lighter VP and we had a very strong first six months of the year. There was a lot of economic uncertainty around that time; inflation, interest rates, ACLs, China commercial real estate. So we didn't want to anticipate exactly what the financial performance would be in the final six months of the year. We were confident of mid teen returns, but we needed to make sure that the final six months traded well. I think as we've gone through Q3, we've continued to trade well. So I think our expectations now on a full year rate are probably higher than they would have been when we started this year and started to build a financial plan for this year. So in the context of things, we've given an indication that given the strong profit performance and if it continues into Q4, it will be right and proper to share some of that upside in profit compared to original expectations with our colleagues the way that we've intend to share the upside in expectations with our shareholders on both dividends and buybacks and a 1%, 300 million top up to VP for the level of performance that could well outturn this year is a reasonable amount of additional VP to put in. I will remind you that VP is not a continuum and a baseline. It is assessed each year on the profit of the bank against targets, and can go up and can go down, but that\u2019s a final determination we'll make at the end of the year. And we're just trying to be fair to our colleagues on what they've done. But it's a factor of uncertainty in the half year over trading performance has become less uncertain as we've gone into Q3, and you've seen the numbers, and we hope we will continue in Q4 in a strong manner. And if that's the case, we feel we should reward our colleagues for a very strong performance this year. But that's the background to it. We remain -- both myself and Georges remain absolutely committed to strong cost discipline.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Aman. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Joseph Dickerson from Jefferies. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question.\nJoseph Dickerson: Hi. Can you hear me?\nGeorges Elhedery: Yes, Joseph.\nJoseph Dickerson: Thank you very much for taking my question. Just following up on cost, I suppose how much of the tech and op cost spend was, if you will, necessary versus discretionary in terms of needing to keep up with competitors and so forth? And then the other aspect would be on the trading book funding cost, you've guided to greater than 7 billion for the full year. On my numbers, you're already at 6.2 billion. So that implies the material stepped down in that cost, unless we should be emphasizing in excess of 7 element there. Any color on that front would also be helpful. Many thanks.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Joseph. So maybe I'll answer your second question. It's fairly easy. You should definitely, as you mentioned, emphasize that in excess of 7 billion, we actually haven't revised our guidance. We felt by and large that the consensus is in the right place and didn't need to influence it. We expect the --\nJoseph Dickerson: Similar quarterly run rate we should be thinking about?\nGeorges Elhedery: So purely for the funding cost of the trading books, you should expect that the trading balances will remain broadly stable at around $130 billion for the quarter, then kind of the math are simple. It's just that times the short rate levels, essentially in USD. As you look at the overall banking NII, I think the indication is that we've grown $0.1 billion Q2 to Q3. We haven't given indication for Q4. Again, feel comfortable with where the consensus is for Q4. And just reiterate that banking NII is probably a better measure because it kind of gets you immunized for some of these choices we make in how much we fund the trading book with. With regards to your first question about tech and ops, so it's a mix of necessary and discretionary. We made the decision on the basis that well, first, when we put our cost base at the start of the year, we had materially higher inflation in some areas and some geographies and some pockets than we anticipated for the year. And we felt that it would be adverse for certain customer outcomes if we needed to take more restrictive action on it. And this is putting it in the context that our nine-month year-to-date reported cost is down 2% year-on-year -- is down 2% year-on-year. So this is why we were willing to tolerate the continued investment in tech and ops. I just want to reaffirm what Noel said. We're absolutely committed to our cost discipline and we will be giving you visibility about how we spend money now in the future. Thank you, Joseph. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jason Napier from UBS. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question.\nGeorges Elhedery: Hello, Jason.\nJason Napier: Good morning. Can you hear me?\nGeorges Elhedery: We can hear you, Jason.\nJason Napier: Thank you. The first one please on the 600 million of losses on the hedge reset [ph] expenditure this quarter and the extra sort of 400 that's penciled in for Q4, I wonder whether you wouldn't mind adding a bit of color in terms of exactly what it is you're doing there to pay that period. You said sort of longer than five years. It feels like a downside risk hedge that's being put in place. If you could just talk about how much you might get the sensitivity down once all is said and done? I'm just concerned whether it really pays [indiscernible] rather than support [indiscernible] in the near term. And then secondly, we've had a busy week of mainland Chinese bank reporting. All of the majors have missed our own forecasts and one of your peers wrote down their mainland Chinese [indiscernible] results. Could you update us please on where [indiscernible] versus book value on BoCom and how that process runs towards year end? Thanks.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Thank you, Jason. So first on the treasury losses, so a few things to share here. First is, we see this as one of the multiple tools we have to manage our structural hedge and obviously to manage the risk in our balance sheet. Second, importantly, the losses themselves have been taken already into CET1 mostly last year. So these are already factored in our CET1 and this is why effectively they have a mild CET1 ratio benefit where we sit today. And then third, as you indicated, Jason, we are looking to retrieve these losses in the NII line essentially over the next five years. So this is a reinvestment into either longer dated or higher yielding instruments by disposing -- faster disposing of lower yielding instruments to allow us to kind of move faster than our structural hedging of the balance sheet. If you wanted some sense of kind of math, you could argue if we've taken 600 million losses, it's about 100 million loss additional NII every year for the next six years or so, which kind of gives you a sense of how we're looking at it. And it's indeed as part of our restructure hedging, which means part of how we're protecting the balance sheet, mitigating risks of a rate downfall in the future. On your second question, Jason, about the mainland China. So first, I can comment on BoCom Q2 performance, because as you know in our numbers, we have one quarter delay. So the exercise relates to Q2. Our value in use as of Q3 has room of about $0.4 billion compared to our carrying value. So as you -- look, impairment is not a management discretionary decision, right? There's a rigorous accounting process and we just follow the process. And based on their Q3 results, we will evaluate those as we go into Q4and that will be part of our end of year assessment. I think the important thing I want to share about BoCom is because it sits in significant investments and because we hold capital deductions -- regulatory capital deductions against it, as you can see from this slide on $16 billion capital deduction, it effectively means that any impairment on our holding of BoCom should it happen will have virtually nil CET1 ratio impact and that's because any impairment will be compensated like-for-like by a release of the deductions of a similar amount. So therefore no implication on CET1. We will also -- it will have an implication reported profits, accounting reported profits, but we'll treat it as a material notable item and it will have no implications either on the way we calculate our dividend or our dividend payout ratio. So this is why at this stage, this is not a concern. We'll just follow the accounting rules as we do [indiscernible] assessment.\nNoel Quinn: Jason, just for clarity, based on the impairment test we did at Q3, we have headroom against our carrying value. There is no impairment to our Q3 and we'll reassess it at Q4. Based on the Q3 results that BoCom issued a couple of days ago, those results at a headline level first side did not cause us any concern on our impairment test at Q3, but we'll reassess that at Q4.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thanks, Noel. You will have the details in the AR&A [ph] in how we do the impairment testing for the value and use with BoCom, Jason, in case you need it. Thank you, Jason. Can we move to the next question?\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Gurpreet Singh Sahi from Goldman Sachs. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question.\nGurpreet Singh Sahi: Thank you very much for letting me ask the question. Good morning, Georges. So first one on loan growth. How do we see the areas of loan growth going into next year? We've done a good growth around mortgages, but they have been offset by shrinkage in the commercial book. So that's the first one. So in terms of medium term, of course, we are highlighting mid single digit, but specifically as interest rates remain high, how is the borrowing appetite into next year? And then the second one with respect to the special dividend timing, the $0.21, will it be paid by June or will it be announced towards the second quarter and paid later on? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Gurpreet. So in terms of loan growth, look, what we've observed so far is strong growth and continued growth in mortgages. We said 11 billion year-to-date, essentially in Hong Kong and the UK, that continued even this quarter despite softness in the housing market, but we remain competitive and we continue to support this business for our customers. So that is definitely there. We're also seeing some loan growth in the unsecured space in our retail business. It will be smaller proportions. In terms of commercial, the reality is the main softness in loan growth in commercial is in Hong Kong and this is what's driving the commercial overall number. The softness is Hong Kong has two parameters; one, the rate differential with mainland China and as long as we have saturated differential, it is expected to have mainland Chinese borrowers continue borrowing onshore mainland China rather than borrowing offshore because of the rate differential, and that probably will not reverse in the next couple of years. But also two is some of the softness we've seen in the economic conditions in Hong Kong, which we start to see reversing. And we've been encouraged by the policy measures that have been taken by way of supporting the economy. And if those materialize, we will start seeing some pickup in the segment. Now outside this softness area, we do still have strong loan growth potential in growing areas in our geographies such as Southeast Asia, such as India, such as the Middle East. We even had growth in some of the Western economies. So that is happening. Quite importantly also, I want to call out growth in trade. I called it out in the earlier kind of speech if you want, but trade is bucking the trend for the first quarter where we see 3% growth in our loan book after several quarters of decline. And that's encouraging. We'll obviously need to see how it evolves. But that's definitely encouraging. And if you look at it, most of that growth is in Asia, which means it's bucking the trend in Asia, and that's probably on the -- certainly on the backdrop. Now the trade between China and ASEAN has exceeded trade between China and Europe or China and U.S. and that obviously will benefit given our footprint in China and ASEAN. On the special dividend, Gurpreet, at this stage we're aiming for completion of Canada sometime in Q1. We will then have to go through due governance and do approvals before we do it. I think H1 '24 is reasonable to expect, but it's obviously at this stage just a matter of a process we need to go through. I think that's what I can say at this stage. We'll pay it as soon as we can, Gurpreet. That's what we can say at this stage. Thank you, Gurpreet. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Manus Costello from Autonomous. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question.\nManus Costello: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can I probe you a bit more on the hedging that you've got in place? You've talked about increased hedging for the last couple of quarters and you have this quarter as you discussed previously taken some losses [indiscernible] portfolio to improve NII next year, but we lack a kind of an overall understanding of what you've got in terms of the hedge. And so my question specifically is, how big is your hedge? And what's the duration of your hedge so that we can do some modeling to understand how much protection you've got into '24 and beyond? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Manus, a very insightful question. We are intending to have much more disclosure around our structural hedge at the full year. We're planning to give you additional disclosures from the one we already give today, which is the usual NII table with multiple rate shifts over the five years that includes duration, that includes yields on the structural hedge, et cetera, which hopefully can allow you to model all of this. We're not ready to do it at Q3. It will be more appropriate to do it at the full year. I think what you should take into account is some of the information we shared at the half year, which is the hedge itself has allowed us to reduce our NII sensitivity at the back end of last year from $6 billion for 100 basis points down to now $2.6 billion, over which you should add the funding of the trading book sensitivity of 1.3. So that's giving you an idea of how much the overall hedge among other contributors have supported the reduction of NII volatility and our NII sensitivity to the downward pressure on weights [ph]. And I think you should definitely assume that it remains our intention at this phase of the cycle in rates to continue doing hedges as appropriate across all our balance sheets where we can find them. So more on that at the full year, Manus. Thank you for the question.\nManus Costello: A solid quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question.\nRaul Sinha: Hi. Good morning. A couple of follow ups for me, please, if I can. I guess the first one is just around Slide 17 looking at the split of NIM across your main subsidiaries, and just trying to understand the underlying NIM trajectory for the bank in the absence of any rate changes from here on. If we look at the UK bank [indiscernible], obviously, that margin has been under pressure this quarter and a number of peers are obviously flagging the lag effect on deposit cost as well as the migration is going to have an impact in Q4. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit color on what you think is the outlook for your business in terms of margin in the UK? And then I guess just linking it back to group margin, which is as you said broadly stable but starting to come in a little bit pressure. The HIBOR/LIBOR gap is obviously very narrow. Seasonally I guess HIBOR tends to go up in Q4. But when we take a step back and think about the overall margin trajectory, would you say that in the absence of rate changes, the margin is stable or do you think there is a little bit more pressure sort of creeping in because of what is going on in the UK? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Okay. Thank you, Raul. So let me unpack. There are quite a number of considerations here. So the first one is, I would kind of as always will encourage you to look at banking NII, because that will -- first, it's a better reflection of our rate sensitive earnings. And second, it will immunize you from some of the kind of business choices we make by putting more money into the trading to support -- more funding to support the trading activities whatnot and that can create noise in NII versus funding of the trading book which is emulated when you look at it from a banking NII perspective. Now talking a little bit on Q3 before I talk about the outlook. On the Q3 numbers, if you look at banking NII in Hong Kong, it was up 10%. Now this is not reflected in NIM. NIM is up 2 basis points, essentially because a lot of that upside went into the funding of the trading book. But the full rate sensitive earnings in Asia or Asian entity has grown 10% by about $0.3 billion. So that's the first thing to observe. If you look at HIBOR rates, Q2 to Q3 obviously were up 75 basis points. When we look at Q4 to date, there\u2019s another something like 50 basis points baked in the average. So there is additional tailwind into Q4 from HIBOR which we will obviously need to see how the next two months fare before we evaluate. If you look at the UK, so the UK NIM was up 16 basis points Q1 to Q2, down 8 basis points Q2 to Q3. The first thing I want to say is this is definitely not the trend here to be read. I think NIM is broadly stable from here for the next few quarters. Some of these moves are kind of idiosyncrasies in our market treasury management not necessarily drivers of trends. So we are looking at it in the role as broadly stable. Obviously, it continued facing pressure on deposit cost. But as I just said earlier, at these rates, any additional rate hikes are expected to be passed through to customers and this is what's been happening. So we've benefited from 75 basis point rate hike in pounds between Q2 and Q3, most of which has gone either to customers in the form of pass throughs, some time deposits, migration in the UK minimal, but some and then obviously asset margin compression in the UK. So as you look forward, how can I kind of invite you to evaluate? First, I'm not giving guidance for 2024. The only guidance within '24 is the mid teens ROTE. We will be giving more details at the year end. But if you want some indicators of how to think about it, first think about it as we will continue facing the usual headwinds of margin compression, but that probably is easing now, having seen most of that compression in Q2 and Q3. We will continue to see pressure on deposits, migration may continue. We've seen the pace of 1% per month in Hong Kong, kind of steady for the last nine months that is likely to continue. And then as you -- so these would be the main headwinds. So the tailwinds would be one, the additional rate upside in Hong Kong from HIBOR, probably no further rate upside in the major other currencies. The tailwinds will be reinvestments of maturing structural hedges that have been put at lower rates and as they mature, we invest in higher rates and that will give us additional tailwinds. And then the main tailwind, which we anticipate at some stage in '24 but not yet, at least not for the next couple of quarters but at some stage in '24 is volume growth. When we start seeing volume growth, we will see the support for the NII in the medium term as we've always indicated mid single digit percentage point growth for balance sheet is our midterm aspiration. And as and when this starts after the next couple of quarters of transition, this will give us the additional tailwinds. I suppose that's probably as much as we can say at this stage, Raul. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Perlie Mong from KBW. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question.\nPerlie Mong: Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess just a couple of follow ups. The first one is on your hedge strategy, because I guess you have basically in the disposal losses, you've essentially I guess brought forward some of the rolling of the hedge, which I guess we haven't really seen so much especially in UK banks. They tend to sort of use it as a sort of pure smoothing mechanism as it were to just let the lower rates run off and then reinvest in, but you seem to have brought forward that. So I guess the question is, does that suggest that you're not just using the hedge as smoothing mechanism, but is to sort of more actively sort of trade it as it were. Is that fair? I guess it's the first question. And the second question I guess it's for Noel. I just saw on Bloomberg that you made a comment that we feel like the China CRE situation has bottomed out. Acknowledging that the Chinese government has taken steps to support the sector, but the news flow still seems to be pretty negative. And to the extent that there have been actions taken, they're probably not as large as maybe some of the market would have expected or hopeful a few months ago. So it's probably around tailoring and the positive [ph] requirement in some of the Tier 1 cities. So I guess just what gives you the confidence that we have bottomed out?\nGeorges Elhedery: Perfect. Thank you, Perlie. I'll take the first question and I'll invite Noel, obviously, to comment on your second one. So the hedge strategy, first, we have a number of tools at our disposal. We will use them as effectively and as opportunistically [ph] as we can to achieve what we want to achieve, which is, number one, reducing the downside sensitivity of our balance sheet to a reduction in rates. And number two, extending that reduction of downside as far out in time as possible. This strategy that we've used, which is disposing of existing low earning positions is one of these measures. So number one, to remind you, it does not have a CET1 impact, at least the loss does not have a CET1 impact because the loss has been taken capital mostly in 2022 already. So that gives us this flexibility on our capital. The second one is, yes, a part of the hedge considerations is indeed allowing us to extend higher yields for longer rather than kind of retain some of the lower yielding assets for longer than we wish for and give us additional protection. And the third is also risk management considerations. We will also look at how we use our RWAs and treasury portfolio and how we can optimize the utilization there often, how we use combination of bonds and swap hedges and in fair value accounting relationships, et cetera. So there are all sorts of number of other considerations which we'll look at. But the outcome of which for the purposes of our bottom line is indeed giving us this runway. Now I need to point out. We\u2019ve done an exercise in Q3. We indicate that we intend to do another exercise to the tune of about $0.4 billion in Q4. But we do not look at this as a recurring activity, right? This is kind of by exception occasional when risk management and performance justify it, we will do it. This is not meant to be a recurrent \u201cactivity.\u201d I just want to be clear about that. We've done it last quarter. We'll do it next quarter. Anything beyond that, we will give you an indication, but it will be on a case by case and occasional basis. Noel, for the second question.\nNoel Quinn: Yes, on China CRE, my comments this morning were really about the massive policy correction that has taken place over the last 18 months in commercial real estate in China. It has really impacted very heavily the real estate market. Do I think that big negative correction in the market has been delivered and do I expect further negative correction? No. I think what we're now into is the workout phase of that policy correction. Equally, I think I said this morning, I don't see a big swing back into positive policy territory for commercial real estate. I see it as fine tuning from this low base. So what I'm talking about is the market as a whole, the commercial real estate market in China, a massive correction down. I think we're at the bottom of that correction phase. And we know in a gradual replying back out with possible policy tweaks taking place. But as you quite rightly say, they're not going to be big swings back up in policy correction. They're going to be smaller policy correction taking place as we've seen in recent weeks. Now what does that mean for ECLs, for banks both domestically and internationally? Well, those ECLs have and could still emerge over time. But I think the market itself has bottomed and now we're in a period of sort of readjustment for the new norm. And I don't see a big readjustment back up. From our point of view on ECLs, I think we feel as Georges has said, we've got good coverage ratios on the unsecured book. 50% of our offshore book that is SOE related or POE related. We do not see that same policy correction effect in the SOEs the way it's affected the POEs. So we don't see necessarily a downside on that at this stage. And then those POEs in 50% I talked about, those POEs are largely either secured or they\u2019re not in the residential sector. They're in CRE and other forms of the sector. So I think from our point of view, we feel well provisioned at this stage. It's not to say that there aren't potential problems on the horizon from an ECL point of view for the industry. But we feel as though we're well positioned. I suppose my bottoming comment was on the market as a whole in that there's been such a massive correction. I think we're now in a gradual rebuild, but that gradual rebuild will take time and there will be the potential for the industry to bear some further losses. And we are keeping a close eye on that and what it means for us. But we think we're well provisioned at the Q3 level. We're probably going to take some more of our plausible downside scenario in Q4. But as Georges said earlier, we think that we've got the capacity within our overall guidance on ECL of 40 basis points to absorb any further charges we may or may not take in Q4.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Noel. Thank you, Perlie. Let's move to next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Rob Noble from Deutsche. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question.\nRobert Noble: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just on the treasury sales, you've announced another potential 400 million in Q4. Why not do them all in Q3? What's the advantage of waiting if you're just going to realize a loss and do another? Why not just do them all now? Secondly, just a little bit more on China. What's the sensitivity of the balance sheet to rates in China? How concerned are you about the rate differential between China and Hong Kong? What are the moving parts of that differential on all of the businesses not just the commercial side? Thanks.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Rob. On your first point, look, this is a matter of phasing it in time so that we're doing it thoughtfully, carefully. We're evaluating the impact every time we do an activity. So I don't think there's a -- we didn't put a cut off per se for Q3 and Q4. As you can see, the numbers aren't mathematically or aren't kind of -- they don't follow a given symmetry. It's just a matter of where we are on the journey when we kind of cut off the books on the 30th September, but we carry this activity throughout and we look for the right market opportunities to do it. I think this is this way we look at it. With regards to your second point, a couple of things I can share here, Rob. The first one is the rate sensitivity of China. So just to give you an indication, the impact of the China NIM on our hedge or our Asia NIM is about 3 basis points. So the fact that we have some rate compression in China simply because of the policy rates compression, this has affected our overall Asia NIM by a couple of basis points. So that's the quantum or the magnitude given, obviously, the size and scale we have in Hong Kong versus the size and scale we have in mainland China and other geographies. The second one to call out is that the rate differential. We expect it to remain for a matter of many quarters, probably a couple of years, which does mean that offshore -- that mainland Chinese customers borrowing offshore in Hong Kong will probably remain subdued for the next couple of years, because it's much cheaper for them to borrow at lower rates in RMB. And this headwind is likely to continue for the next couple of years. Now on the flipside, again, because of the rate differential, the growth in wealth that we observe in Hong Kong is obviously a positive and a beneficiary of a differential. So the fact that we're seeing more wealth build up in Hong Kong, the fact that we're seeing more demand for our insurance products and capabilities in Hong Kong also reflects the fact that for mainland Chinese, for some of them and subject to their quotas, they're allowed to do, et cetera, it is interesting. It's an attractive proposition to invest offshore because they're getting the right pickup. So we're seeing the benefits of that when we talk about our insurance business in Hong Kong and our new business CSM, while we're seeing the challenge on the other side. Look, all this at the end to say is we remain very optimistic in the medium to long term on both Hong Kong and mainland China. And we just need to see some of the short-term difficulties play out specifically in mainland China specifically in the real estate sector until we recover and are able to see some of the momentum back on positive growth there. Thank you, Rob. I suggest we move to the next question.\nOperator: We have time for one last question today from Andrew Coombs from Citigroup. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question.\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. I'll ask a couple if that's okay and just a quick one firstly. You reiterated the great consensus 5 billion NII guidance in the past, you've talked about being comfortable with consensus, which is obviously above that 36.5. So if I could just push you as to whether you are still comfortable with consensus. And then second question, buybacks and how you're thinking about those. Obviously, a step change today going from two to three for the next quarter, a full month [ph] for the buybacks and the France retail, you're looking at a 14.2 call it one ratio, still within your target range. You've said 2024 ROTE similar to 2023, payout ratio for the dividend similar to 2023. So the only delta seems to be loan growth where you're still talking cautious short term there aiming for mid single digits in medium term. So when we're thinking about the buying back going forward, is it a trade off with that loan growth? So is it the case if the loan growth goes to mid single digits, you go back to 2 billion, whereas if it stays low single digit, you stay at 3 billion? Conceptually, how are you thinking about the buyback? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andrew. Okay, on your first question, NII guidance, I can reaffirm. We're still comfortable with the 2023 consensus. As you look into 2024, we haven't given guidance yet apart from the mid teens ROTE. But I'd like to kind of just point out two things just to keep in mind. The first one is, again, banking NII would be a better guide of how our earnings will behave with rates. So look at NII in combination with the funding cost of the trading book and immunized therefore your analysis from how much we end up channeling or not in terms of funding to the trading book activities. And then the second one just to keep in mind is the disposal of Canada and France, which will both contribute to an annualized $1.5 billion of NII, which obviously not be there as and when they go away, as and when the sale is complete. And then finally, balance sheet growth at some stage in '24 where we kind of start resuming the expectation of our balance sheet to grow. That's I think in the broad sense how we should look at for 2024. Again, we're not guiding but we're giving you some tools that you can do your analysis. In terms of buyback, so a couple of things. First, the reason we announced a 3 billion buyback, certainly because we have the capital to support it, but equally because we have an extended period to do it. We mentioned that this is an intent to do it up to February results. That gives us four months. So I'll definitely encourage you not to look at 3 billion as the new 2 billion. It is not. It is a reflection of the fact that we're aiming for a -- we have a longer period ahead of us, four months instead of three. And we're aiming to see if we can get up to 3 billion during that period. It's there for kind of a specific consequence of this length of the period that is ahead of us for that buyback. We -- look, I continue saying it remains our intention to perform a rolling series of share buybacks as long as the capital support it. We look at our forecast and our capital does -- capital buildup does seem to be reasonably realistic in our forecast. And therefore, it remains our intention to do the series of buybacks. About the question of trade off between buybacks and loan growth, a couple of things. First, as you know, the proceeds of the sale of Canada will give us a buyback runway regardless of loan growth, because the gain -- the proceeds less the priority use for special dividend will still allow for a few billion dollars of additional buyback and irrespective of our loans, so that'll give us runway for loan growth. Second, I just need to also highlight when we talk about mid single digit loan growth, we're not saying mid single digit RWA growth. Some of our loans specifically in the mortgage space, which is the component for our loan growth, have lower RWA density and therefore benefit from lower RWAs and therefore our RWA growth is expected to trail loan growth absent credit reviews. And therefore we don't see that there is a competition between loan growth and buybacks. I think this is a fine balance between the two and the appropriate trade-off between the two. This is, Andrew, probably how much I can say at this stage to your question. Thank you very much. I'll move straight to the closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your questions. I want to end by reiterating that we've had a good nine months. All of our businesses have been performing well. We have delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 17.1% when you exclude strategic transactions, and we remain committed to tight cost discipline. We're investing in growth while we're also supporting dividends and buybacks. And I will be looking forward to speaking with you all again soon. So have a good morning, afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much. \nNoel Quinn: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.",

        "text": "Thank you, operator, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter results call today. I will lead today's presentation and Noel will join me for the Q&A session. Allow me first to begin by saying a few words on recent events in the Middle East. We have all been shocked by the devastating terrorist attack on Israel on 7th of October and saddened by the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The loss of innocent life and suffering is heartbreaking. We continue to offer assistance to our impacted colleagues and clients. Just to be clear, we're not changing our strategy in Israel or the Middle East.  Turning to our results now. As always, our purpose ambition, values and strategy have been helping us drive the results that I am going to talk about today. Some highlights to begin with. First of all, the year-to-date performance clearly demonstrates that we have had three consecutive strong quarters reflecting the successful execution of our strategy.  Year-to-date reported profit before tax was $29.4 billion, which is an increase of $17.4 billion on the same period last year, supported by higher interest rates and enabled by our strong balance sheet and the non-recurrence of notable items. We have delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 17.1%, excluding strategic transactions.  For the avoidance of doubt, these transactions are the reversal earlier this year of the impairment relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in France and the gain on acquisition from SVB UK. We've announced another share buyback of up to $3 billion, bringing total buybacks announced this year up to $7 billion. And we've announced three quarterly dividends which totaled $0.30 per share.  We have also exhibited good growth across our businesses. Wholesale transaction banking revenue was up 50% year-to-date, primarily due to higher rates and reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise. Wealth had another good quarter. Wealth balances were up by 12% compared to the same quarter of last year. And we're also very pleased that we attracted $34 billion of net new invested assets in the quarter, bringing the rolling 12-month total of $277 billion, which is a strong performance and testament to our strategy.  The planned acquisition of Citi\u2019s wealth business in mainland China will also help accelerate our growth plans for this business. In our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK, we are also seeing good growth areas. In Hong Kong, insurance new business CSN was up 40% year-on-year. And our mortgage books in Asia and the UK grew by a total of $11 billion compared to the third quarter of last year.  Let me now move on to the third quarter numbers. Revenue was $16.2 billion, which was up $4.6 billion or 40% on last year's third quarter on a constant currency basis. This was driven firstly by group net interest income of $9.2 billion, which was up by $1.3 billion on the same period last year.  And secondly, non-NII was $6.9 billion up by $3.3 billion, primarily due to first the non-recurrence of a $2.5 billion impairment in last year's third quarter relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in France. Second, $1.6 billion higher revenue offset into non-NII from the central costs of funding GBM trading activity; and three, offset by $0.6 billion of treasury disposal losses taken for structural hedging and risk management purposes for our balance sheet.  Banking NII of $11.5 billion was up $2.8 billion on last year's third quarter, and broadly stable on the second quarter. Expected credit losses of $1.1 billion were broadly stable on the same period last year, and included a $0.5 billion charge in relation to our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio booked in Hong Kong.  Costs were up 1% in the quarter as lower restructuring costs were offset by higher technology spend, a higher performance-related pay accrual and costs from HSBC innovation banking. Lending balances and deposits were both broadly stable. And our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, an increase of 20 basis points on the second quarter.  Finally, we announced a third consecutive quarter of strong capital returns with a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share and a further share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we expect to complete before the full year results in February.  The next slide shows that our global businesses all performed well. Wealth and Personal Banking had a strong quarter with revenues up by 71% or by 7%, excluding the impairment taken in last year's third quarter relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France. Within this, Wealth was up by 6% as our ongoing investment in that business continued to gain traction, and Personal Banking also had another good quarter up by 21% due mainly to higher rates.  Across Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, global payment services had revenues of more than $4.3 billion, which was an increase of 56% on the third quarter of 2022. And in our trade business, lending balances were up 3% in the quarter, mainly in Asia, reversing the declining trend from previous quarters. Global Banking and Markets also performed well, up by 2%. This included a resilient performance in foreign exchange compared to a strong third quarter last year and the good performance in securities financing and debt markets.  On this next slide, reported net interest income was $9.2 billion, which was broadly stable on the second quarter. Banking NII was $11.5 billion, up $2.8 billion on last year's third quarter and stable on the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, banking NII in the second quarter was favorably impacted by a $0.4 billion year-to-date catch up due to methodology changes, approximately half of which was attributable to the first quarter.  Adjusting for this, banking NII was slightly up in this third quarter on the like-for-like basis. The net interest margin remained broadly stable at 170 basis points. We are not updating our 2023 NII guidance and are also not expecting consensus to change.  Next, constant currency non-NII of $6.9 billion was up $3.3 billion on last year's third quarter, primarily due to, number one, a $2.3 billion favorable movement in notable items and foreign exchange as last year's third quarter included the $2.5 billion impairment relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in France. And this year's third quarter included a $0.6 billion of treasury disposal losses.  Number two, a $1.6 billion increase in the revenue offset into non-NII from the central costs of funding GBM trading activity. And number three, a $0.3 billion decrease in other which includes lower market treasury income. We continue to reposition our treasury portfolio as part of our balance sheet structural hedging and risk management initiatives.  In the third quarter, this resulted in $0.6 billion of treasury disposal losses. These losses do not have a material impact on CET1 capital or TNAV as they have already been taken through reserves last year, although they will have a modest benefit to our CET1 ratio this year. The disposal proceeds are reinvested into higher yielding or higher duration assets.  Disposal losses are forecast to be more than recovered through NII with the majority over the next five years. Further restructuring of the treasury portfolio leading to a loss of around $0.4 billion is expected in the fourth quarter, which will also be reported as a notable item and have modest CET1 upside.  Turning now to credit. Our third quarter ECL charge was $1.1 billion, which was stable on the same period last year. It includes a $0.5 billion charge related to our mainland China commercial real estate exposure booked in Hong Kong, following a $0.4 billion charge in the same quarter last year. The remaining wholesale charge was $0.3 billion.  The $0.2 billion personal lending charge included modest UK releases, although we retain overlays to address the current risks in the economic outlook. Stage 3 balances of $19 billion were down $1 billion on the second quarter and account for 2% of total loans. We continue to expect the 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending, including held for sale balances.  Focusing now on our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio, our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. As you can see, our total exposure stands at $7.5 billion, which is down by $0.5 billion from the half here, primarily due to write offs. In February this year, we communicated the management assessed plausible downside scenario of around $1 billion.  The deterioration in the third quarter means that we crystallized around $500 million of provisions into the P&L that were part of this plausible downside. We're encouraged by recent policy measures, which will help the sector but need time to take effect. So the plausible downside scenario does now look more realistic for full year 2023.  Our exposures rated strong, good and satisfactory were broadly stable on the third quarter last year. Around half of these exposures is lending to state owned enterprises. The other half is primarily lending to privately owned enterprises that are not residential property developers. This is reflected in the minimal ECL allowance in this part of the portfolio.  And if I now turn to the table at the bottom of the slide against unsecured credit impaired exposures, we already have now 73% coverage ratio. And against unsecured substandard exposures, we have a coverage ratio of just under 10%. This is clearly an area that we will continue to monitor closely. But to reiterate, we continue to expect the 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average plus customer lending, including held for sale balances.  Next on costs, reported costs for the first nine months of 2023 were down 2% on last year, primarily due to lower restructuring costs. Our cost efficiency ratio for the same period was 44%, improved from 66% last year. On a constant currency basis, costs went up by 1% on last year's third quarter as the lower restructuring costs were offset by increased technology and operations spend, a higher performance related pay accrual and the acquisition and investment costs from HSBC Innovation Banking, which were not included in our original plans.  On our cost target basis, we now expect our 2023 costs to be around 4% higher than 2022. This is around 1% or $300 million more than previously guided due to higher technology and operation spending, which we believe is appropriate given the importance of digitization to the group and the strong financial performance of the business.  In addition to this, we are contemplating an increase in performance-related pay in the fourth quarter depending on the outturn of our performance and ongoing execution of our strategy in the fourth quarter. This would represent a further increase of around 1%. We have provided the full reconciliation from reported cost to our target basis cost on Slide 15 of the deck. And to reiterate, tight cost discipline remains my priority and a priority across the whole group.  The next slide shows our strong capital position. Our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, which was up 20 basis points on the second quarter. A few things to draw your attention to. Number one, the dividend accrued year-to-date is $9.6 billion or $0.49 per share while we have announced dividends of $5.9 billion or $0.30 per share.  Number two, we have announced a further share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have a circa 40 basis point impact on our CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter. We are aiming to complete it before the full year results in February. Number three, we also expect to reclassify our retail banking operations in France as held for sale in the fourth quarter ahead of completion of the planned sale on January 1, 2024, which would have a further impact on the CET1 ratio of around 30 basis points.  Finally, the planned sale of our Canada banking business also remains on track to complete in the first quarter of 2024. And as a reminder, profits from our Canada banking business accrued to the buyer and are not included in our dividend calculations for the year. We estimate the gain on sale will be around $5.5 billion, which we will recognize through a combination of earnings from Canada and the remaining gain on sale at completion. Upon completion of the transaction, it remains our intention to consider a special dividend of $0.21 per share as a priority use of the proceeds and as previously announced.  So in summary, this was another strong quarter. We delivered a good profit performance and an annualized return on tangible equity of 17.1%, excluding strategic transactions, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy. Transaction banking and wealth both performed well and continued investment will help accelerate the growth of our wealth business. We continue to expect the 2023 ECL charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending. We remain committed to tight cost discipline. And we have a strong capital position and have increased return to shareholders by way of dividends and share buybacks.  And with that, operator, can we please open it up for questions? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Aman Rakkar",
        "text": "Thank you so much. Two questions, please. Firstly on costs, can I just probably be a little bit more on exactly what's changed around costs? Because I think as recently as mid September, HSBC were reiterating their expectations for cost very much in line with the existing guide and the commitment to the cost base. So particularly the point around compensating the staff -- potentially compensating staff for performance, I understand that it's been a strong year for profit, but it doesn't look like the view of profitability changed materially since you last spoke to us. So that component there would be interesting. And the related point then is to what extent should we expect that element of cost growth to roll over into next year? I guess, at its heart, I'm trying to get a sense of what the underlying cost growth is that you're currently seeing through the business. And then the second question was around margins. I was wondering if you could just help us with a bit on your experience on deposit beta and term deposit mix, particularly in Hong Kong, but also a comment on the UK would be helpful. And as part of that, what your expectations are for NIM in both of those markets please? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure. Thank you, Aman. So first on costs, I think with regards this 1% cost we contemplate for Q4, we have to put this in the perspective of the financial performance. Obviously, at the start of the year, we weren't necessarily realizing the performance of the group. We obviously need to wait for Q4 both to assess the financial performance but equally to assess how we continue to deliver on our strategy. It ultimately will be a matter for the Board and the remuneration committee to decide but we felt it appropriate and fair to recognize that our colleagues have contributed, participated for the last many years through the whole strategic reshaping of the firm through ensuring we have a great deposit franchise and a strong balance sheet and obviously delivering the growth we've seen in wealth and transaction banking that we can channel 1% or the equivalent $300 million towards performance related pay. Again, all this is at the stage of contemplation, the matter we will reaffirm at the year end and again subject to our remuneration committee's opinion. In terms of next year, now we're not giving guidance for next year. But I think we are reflecting in this performance related pay a year-on-year material change in our performance, as you've seen from our returns and our PBT which obviously with that quantum we will probably not expect for next year, right? In terms of margins, Aman, so as we indicated at these levels of rates mostly in the UK and certainly in a number of Western markets and for our wholesale businesses, at these levels of rates, we were expecting to have a materially higher betas than 50%. We've expected that additional rate hikes from here would be mostly for the benefit of our customers. If you look at the overall betas in the UK, overall betas around 50, just north of 50%. So while the margin of betas have exceeded 80%, the overall is in the range of 50%. Term deposit mix Hong Kong kind of same trend as we've seen through the nine month coming to this quarter, about 1% migration per month. So we have seen 4% over the quarter after 2% previous quarter and 3% in the quarter one. That took the total term deposit mix to 31% in Hong Kong. We have not seen a deterioration of the trend. We expect the trend to remain the same as we look into potential headwinds in the future. But equally, we continue to see some of the tailwinds we were calling out before to continue. Just to put in perspective, the UK term deposit mix is just single digit percentage point. So we know it's a modest increase in Q3, but it's not a main contributor to the dynamic of our NII."

        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "Georges, if I could just add a couple of comments on the VP [ph]. There are two factors that really come into play on Q3. The half year when we talked about our cost position, we had a lighter VP and we had a very strong first six months of the year. There was a lot of economic uncertainty around that time; inflation, interest rates, ACLs, China commercial real estate. So we didn't want to anticipate exactly what the financial performance would be in the final six months of the year. We were confident of mid teen returns, but we needed to make sure that the final six months traded well. I think as we've gone through Q3, we've continued to trade well. So I think our expectations now on a full year rate are probably higher than they would have been when we started this year and started to build a financial plan for this year. So in the context of things, we've given an indication that given the strong profit performance and if it continues into Q4, it will be right and proper to share some of that upside in profit compared to original expectations with our colleagues the way that we've intend to share the upside in expectations with our shareholders on both dividends and buybacks and a 1%, 300 million top up to VP for the level of performance that could well outturn this year is a reasonable amount of additional VP to put in. I will remind you that VP is not a continuum and a baseline. It is assessed each year on the profit of the bank against targets, and can go up and can go down, but that\u2019s a final determination we'll make at the end of the year. And we're just trying to be fair to our colleagues on what they've done. But it's a factor of uncertainty in the half year over trading performance has become less uncertain as we've gone into Q3, and you've seen the numbers, and we hope we will continue in Q4 in a strong manner. And if that's the case, we feel we should reward our colleagues for a very strong performance this year. But that's the background to it. We remain -- both myself and Georges remain absolutely committed to strong cost discipline."

And then the other aspect would be on the trading book funding cost, you've guided to greater than 7 billion for the full year. On my numbers, you're already at 6.2 billion. So that implies the material stepped down in that cost, unless we should be emphasizing in excess of 7 element there. Any color on that front would also be helpful. Many thanks."

        "text": "So purely for the funding cost of the trading books, you should expect that the trading balances will remain broadly stable at around $130 billion for the quarter, then kind of the math are simple. It's just that times the short rate levels, essentially in USD. As you look at the overall banking NII, I think the indication is that we've grown $0.1 billion Q2 to Q3. We haven't given indication for Q4. Again, feel comfortable with where the consensus is for Q4. And just reiterate that banking NII is probably a better measure because it kind of gets you immunized for some of these choices we make in how much we fund the trading book with. With regards to your first question about tech and ops, so it's a mix of necessary and discretionary. We made the decision on the basis that well, first, when we put our cost base at the start of the year, we had materially higher inflation in some areas and some geographies and some pockets than we anticipated for the year. And we felt that it would be adverse for certain customer outcomes if we needed to take more restrictive action on it. And this is putting it in the context that our nine-month year-to-date reported cost is down 2% year-on-year -- is down 2% year-on-year. So this is why we were willing to tolerate the continued investment in tech and ops. I just want to reaffirm what Noel said. We're absolutely committed to our cost discipline and we will be giving you visibility about how we spend money now in the future. Thank you, Joseph. Next question, please."

The first one please on the 600 million of losses on the hedge reset [ph] expenditure this quarter and the extra sort of 400 that's penciled in for Q4, I wonder whether you wouldn't mind adding a bit of color in terms of exactly what it is you're doing there to pay that period. You said sort of longer than five years. It feels like a downside risk hedge that's being put in place. If you could just talk about how much you might get the sensitivity down once all is said and done? I'm just concerned whether it really pays [indiscernible] rather than support [indiscernible] in the near term. And then secondly, we've had a busy week of mainland Chinese bank reporting. All of the majors have missed our own forecasts and one of your peers wrote down their mainland Chinese [indiscernible] results. Could you update us please on where [indiscernible] versus book value on BoCom and how that process runs towards year end? Thanks."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure. Thank you, Jason. So first on the treasury losses, so a few things to share here. First is, we see this as one of the multiple tools we have to manage our structural hedge and obviously to manage the risk in our balance sheet. Second, importantly, the losses themselves have been taken already into CET1 mostly last year. So these are already factored in our CET1 and this is why effectively they have a mild CET1 ratio benefit where we sit today. And then third, as you indicated, Jason, we are looking to retrieve these losses in the NII line essentially over the next five years. So this is a reinvestment into either longer dated or higher yielding instruments by disposing -- faster disposing of lower yielding instruments to allow us to kind of move faster than our structural hedging of the balance sheet. If you wanted some sense of kind of math, you could argue if we've taken 600 million losses, it's about 100 million loss additional NII every year for the next six years or so, which kind of gives you a sense of how we're looking at it. And it's indeed as part of our restructure hedging, which means part of how we're protecting the balance sheet, mitigating risks of a rate downfall in the future. On your second question, Jason, about the mainland China. So first, I can comment on BoCom Q2 performance, because as you know in our numbers, we have one quarter delay. So the exercise relates to Q2. Our value in use as of Q3 has room of about $0.4 billion compared to our carrying value. So as you -- look, impairment is not a management discretionary decision, right? There's a rigorous accounting process and we just follow the process. And based on their Q3 results, we will evaluate those as we go into Q4and that will be part of our end of year assessment. I think the important thing I want to share about BoCom is because it sits in significant investments and because we hold capital deductions -- regulatory capital deductions against it, as you can see from this slide on $16 billion capital deduction, it effectively means that any impairment on our holding of BoCom should it happen will have virtually nil CET1 ratio impact and that's because any impairment will be compensated like-for-like by a release of the deductions of a similar amount. So therefore no implication on CET1. We will also -- it will have an implication reported profits, accounting reported profits, but we'll treat it as a material notable item and it will have no implications either on the way we calculate our dividend or our dividend payout ratio. So this is why at this stage, this is not a concern. We'll just follow the accounting rules as we do [indiscernible] assessment."

We've done a good growth around mortgages, but they have been offset by shrinkage in the commercial book. So that's the first one. So in terms of medium term, of course, we are highlighting mid single digit, but specifically as interest rates remain high, how is the borrowing appetite into next year? And then the second one with respect to the special dividend timing, the $0.21, will it be paid by June or will it be announced towards the second quarter and paid later on? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Gurpreet. So in terms of loan growth, look, what we've observed so far is strong growth and continued growth in mortgages. We said 11 billion year-to-date, essentially in Hong Kong and the UK, that continued even this quarter despite softness in the housing market, but we remain competitive and we continue to support this business for our customers. So that is definitely there. We're also seeing some loan growth in the unsecured space in our retail business. It will be smaller proportions. In terms of commercial, the reality is the main softness in loan growth in commercial is in Hong Kong and this is what's driving the commercial overall number. The softness is Hong Kong has two parameters; one, the rate differential with mainland China and as long as we have saturated differential, it is expected to have mainland Chinese borrowers continue borrowing onshore mainland China rather than borrowing offshore because of the rate differential, and that probably will not reverse in the next couple of years. But also two is some of the softness we've seen in the economic conditions in Hong Kong, which we start to see reversing. And we've been encouraged by the policy measures that have been taken by way of supporting the economy. And if those materialize, we will start seeing some pickup in the segment. Now outside this softness area, we do still have strong loan growth potential in growing areas in our geographies such as Southeast Asia, such as India, such as the Middle East. We even had growth in some of the Western economies. So that is happening. Quite importantly also, I want to call out growth in trade. I called it out in the earlier kind of speech if you want, but trade is bucking the trend for the first quarter where we see 3% growth in our loan book after several quarters of decline. And that's encouraging. We'll obviously need to see how it evolves. But that's definitely encouraging. And if you look at it, most of that growth is in Asia, which means it's bucking the trend in Asia, and that's probably on the -- certainly on the backdrop. Now the trade between China and ASEAN has exceeded trade between China and Europe or China and U.S. and that obviously will benefit given our footprint in China and ASEAN. On the special dividend, Gurpreet, at this stage we're aiming for completion of Canada sometime in Q1. We will then have to go through due governance and do approvals before we do it. I think H1 '24 is reasonable to expect, but it's obviously at this stage just a matter of a process we need to go through. I think that's what I can say at this stage. We'll pay it as soon as we can, Gurpreet. That's what we can say at this stage. Thank you, Gurpreet. Next question, please."

        "text": "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can I probe you a bit more on the hedging that you've got in place? You've talked about increased hedging for the last couple of quarters and you have this quarter as you discussed previously taken some losses [indiscernible] portfolio to improve NII next year, but we lack a kind of an overall understanding of what you've got in terms of the hedge. And so my question specifically is, how big is your hedge? And what's the duration of your hedge so that we can do some modeling to understand how much protection you've got into '24 and beyond? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Manus, a very insightful question. We are intending to have much more disclosure around our structural hedge at the full year. We're planning to give you additional disclosures from the one we already give today, which is the usual NII table with multiple rate shifts over the five years that includes duration, that includes yields on the structural hedge, et cetera, which hopefully can allow you to model all of this. We're not ready to do it at Q3. It will be more appropriate to do it at the full year. I think what you should take into account is some of the information we shared at the half year, which is the hedge itself has allowed us to reduce our NII sensitivity at the back end of last year from $6 billion for 100 basis points down to now $2.6 billion, over which you should add the funding of the trading book sensitivity of 1.3. So that's giving you an idea of how much the overall hedge among other contributors have supported the reduction of NII volatility and our NII sensitivity to the downward pressure on weights [ph]. And I think you should definitely assume that it remains our intention at this phase of the cycle in rates to continue doing hedges as appropriate across all our balance sheets where we can find them. So more on that at the full year, Manus. Thank you for the question."

        "text": "Hi. Good morning. A couple of follow ups for me, please, if I can. I guess the first one is just around Slide 17 looking at the split of NIM across your main subsidiaries, and just trying to understand the underlying NIM trajectory for the bank in the absence of any rate changes from here on. If we look at the UK bank [indiscernible], obviously, that margin has been under pressure this quarter and a number of peers are obviously flagging the lag effect on deposit cost as well as the migration is going to have an impact in Q4. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit color on what you think is the outlook for your business in terms of margin in the UK? And then I guess just linking it back to group margin, which is as you said broadly stable but starting to come in a little bit pressure. The HIBOR/LIBOR gap is obviously very narrow. Seasonally I guess HIBOR tends to go up in Q4. But when we take a step back and think about the overall margin trajectory, would you say that in the absence of rate changes, the margin is stable or do you think there is a little bit more pressure sort of creeping in because of what is going on in the UK? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure. Okay. Thank you, Raul. So let me unpack. There are quite a number of considerations here. So the first one is, I would kind of as always will encourage you to look at banking NII, because that will -- first, it's a better reflection of our rate sensitive earnings. And second, it will immunize you from some of the kind of business choices we make by putting more money into the trading to support -- more funding to support the trading activities whatnot and that can create noise in NII versus funding of the trading book which is emulated when you look at it from a banking NII perspective. Now talking a little bit on Q3 before I talk about the outlook. On the Q3 numbers, if you look at banking NII in Hong Kong, it was up 10%. Now this is not reflected in NIM. NIM is up 2 basis points, essentially because a lot of that upside went into the funding of the trading book. But the full rate sensitive earnings in Asia or Asian entity has grown 10% by about $0.3 billion. So that's the first thing to observe. If you look at HIBOR rates, Q2 to Q3 obviously were up 75 basis points. When we look at Q4 to date, there\u2019s another something like 50 basis points baked in the average. So there is additional tailwind into Q4 from HIBOR which we will obviously need to see how the next two months fare before we evaluate. If you look at the UK, so the UK NIM was up 16 basis points Q1 to Q2, down 8 basis points Q2 to Q3. The first thing I want to say is this is definitely not the trend here to be read. I think NIM is broadly stable from here for the next few quarters. Some of these moves are kind of idiosyncrasies in our market treasury management not necessarily drivers of trends. So we are looking at it in the role as broadly stable. Obviously, it continued facing pressure on deposit cost. But as I just said earlier, at these rates, any additional rate hikes are expected to be passed through to customers and this is what's been happening. So we've benefited from 75 basis point rate hike in pounds between Q2 and Q3, most of which has gone either to customers in the form of pass throughs, some time deposits, migration in the UK minimal, but some and then obviously asset margin compression in the UK. So as you look forward, how can I kind of invite you to evaluate? First, I'm not giving guidance for 2024. The only guidance within '24 is the mid teens ROTE. We will be giving more details at the year end. But if you want some indicators of how to think about it, first think about it as we will continue facing the usual headwinds of margin compression, but that probably is easing now, having seen most of that compression in Q2 and Q3. We will continue to see pressure on deposits, migration may continue. We've seen the pace of 1% per month in Hong Kong, kind of steady for the last nine months that is likely to continue. And then as you -- so these would be the main headwinds. So the tailwinds would be one, the additional rate upside in Hong Kong from HIBOR, probably no further rate upside in the major other currencies. The tailwinds will be reinvestments of maturing structural hedges that have been put at lower rates and as they mature, we invest in higher rates and that will give us additional tailwinds. And then the main tailwind, which we anticipate at some stage in '24 but not yet, at least not for the next couple of quarters but at some stage in '24 is volume growth. When we start seeing volume growth, we will see the support for the NII in the medium term as we've always indicated mid single digit percentage point growth for balance sheet is our midterm aspiration. And as and when this starts after the next couple of quarters of transition, this will give us the additional tailwinds. I suppose that's probably as much as we can say at this stage, Raul. Thank you for your question."

        "text": "Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess just a couple of follow ups. The first one is on your hedge strategy, because I guess you have basically in the disposal losses, you've essentially I guess brought forward some of the rolling of the hedge, which I guess we haven't really seen so much especially in UK banks. They tend to sort of use it as a sort of pure smoothing mechanism as it were to just let the lower rates run off and then reinvest in, but you seem to have brought forward that. So I guess the question is, does that suggest that you're not just using the hedge as smoothing mechanism, but is to sort of more actively sort of trade it as it were. Is that fair? I guess it's the first question. And the second question I guess it's for Noel. I just saw on Bloomberg that you made a comment that we feel like the China CRE situation has bottomed out. Acknowledging that the Chinese government has taken steps to support the sector, but the news flow still seems to be pretty negative. And to the extent that there have been actions taken, they're probably not as large as maybe some of the market would have expected or hopeful a few months ago. So it's probably around tailoring and the positive [ph] requirement in some of the Tier 1 cities. So I guess just what gives you the confidence that we have bottomed out?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Perfect. Thank you, Perlie. I'll take the first question and I'll invite Noel, obviously, to comment on your second one. So the hedge strategy, first, we have a number of tools at our disposal. We will use them as effectively and as opportunistically [ph] as we can to achieve what we want to achieve, which is, number one, reducing the downside sensitivity of our balance sheet to a reduction in rates. And number two, extending that reduction of downside as far out in time as possible. This strategy that we've used, which is disposing of existing low earning positions is one of these measures. So number one, to remind you, it does not have a CET1 impact, at least the loss does not have a CET1 impact because the loss has been taken capital mostly in 2022 already. So that gives us this flexibility on our capital. The second one is, yes, a part of the hedge considerations is indeed allowing us to extend higher yields for longer rather than kind of retain some of the lower yielding assets for longer than we wish for and give us additional protection. And the third is also risk management considerations. We will also look at how we use our RWAs and treasury portfolio and how we can optimize the utilization there often, how we use combination of bonds and swap hedges and in fair value accounting relationships, et cetera. So there are all sorts of number of other considerations which we'll look at. But the outcome of which for the purposes of our bottom line is indeed giving us this runway. Now I need to point out. We\u2019ve done an exercise in Q3. We indicate that we intend to do another exercise to the tune of about $0.4 billion in Q4. But we do not look at this as a recurring activity, right? This is kind of by exception occasional when risk management and performance justify it, we will do it. This is not meant to be a recurrent \u201cactivity.\u201d I just want to be clear about that. We've done it last quarter. We'll do it next quarter. Anything beyond that, we will give you an indication, but it will be on a case by case and occasional basis. Noel, for the second question."

        "text": "Yes, on China CRE, my comments this morning were really about the massive policy correction that has taken place over the last 18 months in commercial real estate in China. It has really impacted very heavily the real estate market. Do I think that big negative correction in the market has been delivered and do I expect further negative correction? No. I think what we're now into is the workout phase of that policy correction. Equally, I think I said this morning, I don't see a big swing back into positive policy territory for commercial real estate. I see it as fine tuning from this low base. So what I'm talking about is the market as a whole, the commercial real estate market in China, a massive correction down. I think we're at the bottom of that correction phase. And we know in a gradual replying back out with possible policy tweaks taking place. But as you quite rightly say, they're not going to be big swings back up in policy correction. They're going to be smaller policy correction taking place as we've seen in recent weeks. Now what does that mean for ECLs, for banks both domestically and internationally? Well, those ECLs have and could still emerge over time. But I think the market itself has bottomed and now we're in a period of sort of readjustment for the new norm. And I don't see a big readjustment back up. From our point of view on ECLs, I think we feel as Georges has said, we've got good coverage ratios on the unsecured book. 50% of our offshore book that is SOE related or POE related. We do not see that same policy correction effect in the SOEs the way it's affected the POEs. So we don't see necessarily a downside on that at this stage. And then those POEs in 50% I talked about, those POEs are largely either secured or they\u2019re not in the residential sector. They're in CRE and other forms of the sector. So I think from our point of view, we feel well provisioned at this stage. It's not to say that there aren't potential problems on the horizon from an ECL point of view for the industry. But we feel as though we're well positioned. I suppose my bottoming comment was on the market as a whole in that there's been such a massive correction. I think we're now in a gradual rebuild, but that gradual rebuild will take time and there will be the potential for the industry to bear some further losses. And we are keeping a close eye on that and what it means for us. But we think we're well provisioned at the Q3 level. We're probably going to take some more of our plausible downside scenario in Q4. But as Georges said earlier, we think that we've got the capacity within our overall guidance on ECL of 40 basis points to absorb any further charges we may or may not take in Q4."

What's the sensitivity of the balance sheet to rates in China? How concerned are you about the rate differential between China and Hong Kong? What are the moving parts of that differential on all of the businesses not just the commercial side? Thanks."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Rob. On your first point, look, this is a matter of phasing it in time so that we're doing it thoughtfully, carefully. We're evaluating the impact every time we do an activity. So I don't think there's a -- we didn't put a cut off per se for Q3 and Q4. As you can see, the numbers aren't mathematically or aren't kind of -- they don't follow a given symmetry. It's just a matter of where we are on the journey when we kind of cut off the books on the 30th September, but we carry this activity throughout and we look for the right market opportunities to do it. I think this is this way we look at it. With regards to your second point, a couple of things I can share here, Rob. The first one is the rate sensitivity of China. So just to give you an indication, the impact of the China NIM on our hedge or our Asia NIM is about 3 basis points. So the fact that we have some rate compression in China simply because of the policy rates compression, this has affected our overall Asia NIM by a couple of basis points. So that's the quantum or the magnitude given, obviously, the size and scale we have in Hong Kong versus the size and scale we have in mainland China and other geographies. The second one to call out is that the rate differential. We expect it to remain for a matter of many quarters, probably a couple of years, which does mean that offshore -- that mainland Chinese customers borrowing offshore in Hong Kong will probably remain subdued for the next couple of years, because it's much cheaper for them to borrow at lower rates in RMB. And this headwind is likely to continue for the next couple of years. Now on the flipside, again, because of the rate differential, the growth in wealth that we observe in Hong Kong is obviously a positive and a beneficiary of a differential. So the fact that we're seeing more wealth build up in Hong Kong, the fact that we're seeing more demand for our insurance products and capabilities in Hong Kong also reflects the fact that for mainland Chinese, for some of them and subject to their quotas, they're allowed to do, et cetera, it is interesting. It's an attractive proposition to invest offshore because they're getting the right pickup. So we're seeing the benefits of that when we talk about our insurance business in Hong Kong and our new business CSM, while we're seeing the challenge on the other side. Look, all this at the end to say is we remain very optimistic in the medium to long term on both Hong Kong and mainland China. And we just need to see some of the short-term difficulties play out specifically in mainland China specifically in the real estate sector until we recover and are able to see some of the momentum back on positive growth there. Thank you, Rob. I suggest we move to the next question."

        "text": "Good morning. I'll ask a couple if that's okay and just a quick one firstly. You reiterated the great consensus 5 billion NII guidance in the past, you've talked about being comfortable with consensus, which is obviously above that 36.5. So if I could just push you as to whether you are still comfortable with consensus. And then second question, buybacks and how you're thinking about those. Obviously, a step change today going from two to three for the next quarter, a full month [ph] for the buybacks and the France retail, you're looking at a 14.2 call it one ratio, still within your target range. You've said 2024 ROTE similar to 2023, payout ratio for the dividend similar to 2023. So the only delta seems to be loan growth where you're still talking cautious short term there aiming for mid single digits in medium term. So when we're thinking about the buying back going forward, is it a trade off with that loan growth? So is it the case if the loan growth goes to mid single digits, you go back to 2 billion, whereas if it stays low single digit, you stay at 3 billion? Conceptually, how are you thinking about the buyback? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Andrew. Okay, on your first question, NII guidance, I can reaffirm. We're still comfortable with the 2023 consensus. As you look into 2024, we haven't given guidance yet apart from the mid teens ROTE. But I'd like to kind of just point out two things just to keep in mind. The first one is, again, banking NII would be a better guide of how our earnings will behave with rates. So look at NII in combination with the funding cost of the trading book and immunized therefore your analysis from how much we end up channeling or not in terms of funding to the trading book activities. And then the second one just to keep in mind is the disposal of Canada and France, which will both contribute to an annualized $1.5 billion of NII, which obviously not be there as and when they go away, as and when the sale is complete. And then finally, balance sheet growth at some stage in '24 where we kind of start resuming the expectation of our balance sheet to grow. That's I think in the broad sense how we should look at for 2024. Again, we're not guiding but we're giving you some tools that you can do your analysis. In terms of buyback, so a couple of things. First, the reason we announced a 3 billion buyback, certainly because we have the capital to support it, but equally because we have an extended period to do it. We mentioned that this is an intent to do it up to February results. That gives us four months. So I'll definitely encourage you not to look at 3 billion as the new 2 billion. It is not. It is a reflection of the fact that we're aiming for a -- we have a longer period ahead of us, four months instead of three. And we're aiming to see if we can get up to 3 billion during that period. It's there for kind of a specific consequence of this length of the period that is ahead of us for that buyback. We -- look, I continue saying it remains our intention to perform a rolling series of share buybacks as long as the capital support it. We look at our forecast and our capital does -- capital buildup does seem to be reasonably realistic in our forecast. And therefore, it remains our intention to do the series of buybacks. About the question of trade off between buybacks and loan growth, a couple of things. First, as you know, the proceeds of the sale of Canada will give us a buyback runway regardless of loan growth, because the gain -- the proceeds less the priority use for special dividend will still allow for a few billion dollars of additional buyback and irrespective of our loans, so that'll give us runway for loan growth. Second, I just need to also highlight when we talk about mid single digit loan growth, we're not saying mid single digit RWA growth. Some of our loans specifically in the mortgage space, which is the component for our loan growth, have lower RWA density and therefore benefit from lower RWAs and therefore our RWA growth is expected to trail loan growth absent credit reviews. And therefore we don't see that there is a competition between loan growth and buybacks. I think this is a fine balance between the two and the appropriate trade-off between the two. This is, Andrew, probably how much I can say at this stage to your question. Thank you very much. I'll move straight to the closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your questions. I want to end by reiterating that we've had a good nine months. All of our businesses have been performing well. We have delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 17.1% when you exclude strategic transactions, and we remain committed to tight cost discipline. We're investing in growth while we're also supporting dividends and buybacks. And I will be looking forward to speaking with you all again soon. So have a good morning, afternoon, everyone.

    "transcript": "Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Investor and Analyst Webinar for HSBC Holdings plc\u2019s 2023 Annual Results. For your information, this webinar is being recorded. At this time, I will hand over to Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive\nNoel Quinn: Good afternoon for those in Hong Kong and great to see you all. Good morning to those watching in London and around the world. Before Georges takes you through the Q4 numbers, I'll make some opening comments. First, I'm really pleased with the performance that the team delivered in 2023. We reported $30 billion of PBT for the first time ever and we delivered a return on tangible equity of 14.6% or 15.6% excluding material notable items. Second, there were some items in the fourth quarter, which make it harder to understand the underlying performance. Georges will take you through them in detail. But I want to stress there was still good underlying growth in the fourth quarter excluding the impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation our profit before tax was $7.3 billion. Third, we distributed $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of 2023. This included a full-year dividend of $0.61 per share which is the highest since 2008 and $7 billion of share buybacks which have reduced the share count by over 4% at completion of the current buyback. Fourth, we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. We've announced a further share buyback of up to $2 billion. We're committed to considering a special dividend of $0.21 per share as a priority use of the Canada proceeds subject to the completion of the transaction, and we finished the year with a strong CET 1 ratio of 14.8% which will be further boosted by the Canada deal. Fifth, we remain committed to cost discipline. We have flow through impact of 2023 inflation on our costs this year but expect a downward trend in inflationary pressures in 2025 and beyond. We continue to invest in growth opportunities and the digitization of our business to drive incremental efficiencies. We remain very focused on funding much of that investment through cost saving initiatives. Finally, we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue even in a lower rate environment. Georges will take you through how we're reducing our sensitivity to rate movements and we do acknowledge the downside risks to NII, but we're confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver mid-team returns in 2024. I'll take you through some of these levers later but let me now hand over to Georges.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Noel. Warm welcome to everyone here in Hong Kong. For those of you watching in London, good morning, and thank you for joining our full year 2023 results call. We delivered a good underlying business performance in the fourth quarter, but let me first start by clarifying that our reported profit before tax was impacted by $5.8 billion of notable items and the further $0.5 billion from Argentina hyperinflation including the more than 50% devaluation of the peso in December. Let me unpack three of those notable items. First, we reinstated the impairment on the sale of our France retail business as signaled at the third quarter. Second, we booked a $0.4 billion of Treasury disposal losses in the quarter again in line with the guidance at the third quarter to extend the duration of hedges in anticipation of rate decreases. And finally, as you know each quarter we conduct a value and use test on the carrying value of our investment in BoCom, described in detail in our annual report and accounts. Following the outcomes of that test in Q4, we took a charge of $3 billion in the quarter against our carrying value. The charge had an insignificant impact on CT1 capital and our CT1 ratio, and no impact on our dividends or share buyback. And just to be clear, this has no impact on our strategy in mainland China, has no impact on our strategic relationship with BoCom, and it has no impact on HSBC's or BoCom's operation, strategy, or outlook. So on a reported basis, our profit before tax was $1 billion in the fourth quarter, down $4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the $6.3 billion impact of notable items in Argentina hyperinflation, our profit before tax was $7.3 billion, up $0.7 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to growth in banking NII. On the next slide, so on a reported basis, fourth quarter revenue was down $1.6 billion compared to the same period last year, due to the impact of notable items in Argentina hyperinflation. Excluding these, our revenue was up $1.5 billion, primarily banking NII. The strength of our deposit franchise, our access to 2D pools of liquidity in the U.K. and Hong Kong, and our enviable balance sheet made it possible for us to benefit from the more favorable rate environment. On the next slide, fourth quarter NII and banking NII were again impacted by Argentina hyperinflation and a reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue between NII and non-NII. Excluding these, both NII and banking NII were broadly stable on the third quarter, and NIM was down three basis points, primarily due to higher time deposit costs and deposit migration in Hong Kong. Turning to the outlook, taking our fourth quarter banking NII and adjusting for Argentina hyperinflation and the reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue, and the disposal of our France retail and Canada businesses, gives you an annualized run rate of just above $43 billion. That should be your starting point for modelling our 2024 banking NII. We expect four key variables to drive our banking NII from that starting point in 2024. Changes in interest rates, the reinvestment of maturing structural hedge assets at higher yield, deposit migration, particularly here in Hong Kong, and balance sheet movements. There is a degree of uncertainty inherent in all of these. We're guiding towards a banking NII of at least $41 billion in 2024. This is our current estimate of the bottom end of the range of reasonable outcomes, and is intended to help you with your modelling. We will continue updating further as the year unfolds. And before turning to non-NII, I'd like to direct your attention to the chart on the bottom right of this slide. Over the last 18 months, our banking NII sensitivity has reduced by around $3.5 billion. More than one third of this reduction is due to increased structural interest rate hedging. Subject to market conditions, we expect to increase both the notional and the duration of our structural hedge in the coming quarters, in order to reduce our banking NII sensitivity still further. Non-NII was down $0.9 billion compared to the same quarter last year, due to notable items in Argentina hyperinflation. And again, excluding these, non-NII was up $1.7 billion versus the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to the revenue offset into non-NII from the central cost of funding global banking and markets trading activity, which is included in banking NII, and from the cash flow hedge income reclassification between NII and non-NII, I referred to previously. Other non-NII was up modestly versus the same quarter last year, including an increase of $0.1 billion in net fee income, primarily in commercial banking and wealth and personal banking. Looking at non-NII from our two strategic activities of wholesale transaction banking and wealth. In wholesale transaction banking, non-NII was up 2% on the fourth quarter of 2022. There was good growth in global payment solution, in trade and in foreign exchange, reflecting the strength of our international network and transaction banking capabilities, as well as increased client activity and repricing initiatives. This was partly offset by a relatively small decrease in security services. In wealth, non-NII in both asset management and private banking grow by double digits versus the fourth quarter of last year, due to an increase in assets under management, partly driven by net new invested assets. However, total wealth non-NII was down $0.1 billion as a result of a $0.2 billion correction to historical valuation estimates in our insurance business. For the full year, non-NII in wholesale transaction banking was $10.6 billion, up 5% on 2022, and $6 billion in wealth, up 7%. Turning now to credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1 billion, primarily in wholesale. This brought our full year ECL charge to $3.4 billion, which was 33 basis points of average customer loans, including those held for sale, or 36 basis points excluding those, and within our full year 2023 guidance. Due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we're guiding towards ECLs of around 40 basis points for 2024. We took an ECL charge of $0.2 billion for mainland China commercial real estate in the fourth quarter, as part of the $1 billion charge for the quarter referenced in the last slide. This brought the full year charge on this portfolio to $1 billion, crystallizing the plausible downside scenario that we set out last February. Our main area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. That exposure is now $6.3 billion, down $1.2 billion in the quarter, and down $3.1 billion compared to full year 2022. We continue to monitor the sector closely, and we are comfortable with our current level of provisions. Turning to costs, full year 2023 costs on a constant currency basis were down 1%. On a target basis, full year 2023 costs came in 1% higher than our Q3 guidance, driven by three items that unexpectedly landed in the fourth quarter. First, the FDIC special assessment, which we expected to be incurred over 2024 and 2025. Second, the U.K. bank levy was higher than forecast, primarily due to adjustments relating to prior years. And third, there was an offsetting benefit from Argentina hyperinflation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we are aiming to limit cost growth to around 5% in 2024, on a target basis, which excludes the reduction in 2024 costs from the France, retail, and Canada disposals. This will be driven by the flow through impact of 2023 inflation to 2024 costs, investment and volume growth, and partly offset by cost-saving initiatives. On the next slide, customer lending and deposits were broadly stable versus the third quarter, once you exclude the sale of our France retail business. Without that, there was $35 billion of deposit growth, of which $27 billion was in Asia, with around half of this in Hong Kong. Deposit growth in Asia benefited from seasonality, and we would expect at least some of that growth to reverse in the course of Q1. Turning now to capital, our CT1 ratio at the end of 2023 was 14.8%, which was down 0.1 percentage points on the third quarter. There are three things I'd like to draw your attention to. First, as I said earlier, the BoCom charge had an insignificant impact on CT1 capital and our CT1 ratio due to the compensating reduction in regulatory capital threshold deductions, and it had no impact on dividends or share buybacks. Second, we expect the share buyback announced today to have an impact of around 25 basis points on our CT1 ratio in the first quarter of 2024. And finally, we expect the Canada sale to generate around 1.2 percentage points of CT1 in the first quarter of 2024. We remain committed to consider a $0.21 per share special dividend in the first half of 2024 as a priority use of the sale proceeds, which equates to around 0.5 percentage points of CT1. Before I hand back to Noel, I am pleased to share some enhancements that we have made with regard to our international disclosures. There are two sets of data, and Noel will also comment further on them. Starting with our wholesale business, let me walk you through the data on this slide. In 2023, we generated $33.5 billion of client revenue across commercial banking and global banking markets. Of this, $20.4 billion was generated from multi-jurisdictional clients. By this, we mean clients that bank with us in more than one market. The charts on the right show that two thirds of the client revenue we generate from those clients comes from providing them with services and markets outside their home market where they also bank with us. It is also worth pointing out that two thirds of multi-jurisdictional client revenue, or $13.4 billion, was generated from clients whose home market is in the West, with the remaining $7 billion from clients whose home market is in the East. Turning now to WPB international revenue, more than $10 billion, or 40% of our WPB revenue, comes from international customers, around two thirds of which is generated in Asia. So to summarize, both the wholesale and WPB client revenue data clearly demonstrates the strength of our international network and our unique capability to serve international clients. Our network and further investments into our international proposition position us to capture an even greater share of this vital, fast-growing sector. Let me now hand back to Noel.\nNoel Quinn: Thanks, Georges. Thank you, Georges. You've just heard about good underlying performance in the fourth quarter, and Georges has introduced more detailed information about our international revenue. Our wholesale international business model is a mature and differentiated business model with substantial scale. And in recent years, we have started to develop and invest in our WPB international business model. What Georges slide showed is that already 40% of WPB revenue comes from international customers, and we believe we can take it much further. So let me now turn to how we will drive revenue growth, not just this year and next, but over the next three to four years. As always, I'll begin with our purpose, ambition, strategy and values. These have helped to drive the good underlying business growth, which alongside supportive interest rates, have given us strong momentum. In the short term, we're conscious of the potential downside risk to NII. The structural hedging we have put in place will help to protect that income. But we do have some clear focus areas under our four strategic pillars, which I will cover on the following slides. Starting with focus, and our international wholesale business, which remains our biggest competitive advantage, and because of its scale, our biggest growth opportunity. In the past, our businesses in the West were primarily focused on domestic clients. Over the last four years, we have repositioned those businesses to align them with our international strategy, exiting low return and low growth domestic RWAs. The result is the differentiated model you see today. In commercial banking, we are unique in our ability to serve clients across multiple geographies, which is what HSBC was founded to do. The result was the $13.3 billion of profit before tax that commercial banking generated last year. In global banking and markets, I believe we are uniquely positioned to connect clients between West and East, which was evident in our market-leading performances in markets like the Middle East and businesses like Global Foreign Exchange. We have clearly got a strong international franchise. As you can see, we facilitated more than $850 billion of trade last year, with the diversification of supply chains leading to revenue growth opportunities for HSBC. We are ranked second globally by revenue in our payments business, and processed around $500 trillion of electronic payments. And we have been number three globally by revenue in FX since 2021. But I believe there is significant amount of untapped opportunity still to go for, which can drive revenue growth in the face of declining interest rates. Importantly, this potential revenue growth is not necessarily dependent on GDP, as that growth opportunity already exists within our client base, and it is often fee-based and strongly influenced by opportunities that are inherent to our international nature of our client base. To provide some evidence of this growth potential, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 29% in 2023, and the revenue multiplier for multi-jurisdictional corporate clients in commercial banking was five times that of an average domestic-only customer. I am pleased that international isn't just a wholesale story. We are doing more with our WPB customers as well. Building our wealth business to meet the rising demand for wealth management services, especially here in Asia, has been a strategic priority in recent years. So I am pleased that we attracted net new invested assets of $84 billion last year, compared to $80 billion in 2022 and $64 billion in 2021. This is a good indicator of future revenue opportunities, which again is often fee-income and should benefit in a lower interest rate environment as investors shift from cash reserves into invested asset classes. Another trend is the growing demand for seamless cross-border banking services. Innovation is key here, and we hadn't innovated enough in this space in the past, which meant we weren't offering our customers what they wanted. But we are now. Global Money has more than 1.3 million customers, up from 550,000 a year ago. We also launched a new, strengthened international banking proposition. Overall, we grew revenue from WPB international customers by 41% last year, from $7.2 billion to $10.2 billion. And while you might assume this was driven solely by higher rates, I am pleased to say there was a 43% jump in new-to-bank international WPB customers last year. Again, these are higher revenue generating customers, bringing in three times as much revenue as an average domestic-only customer. Next is the continued growth in our two home markets. Our leading propositions in Hong Kong and the U.K. provide us with deep liquidity and a differentiated proposition. These two pools of liquidity underpin our exceptionally strong balance sheet, which gives us the safety and security that our clients trust us to provide. Hong Kong and the U.K. are both highly connected global financial centers. We have increased our market leading share of trade finance in Hong Kong by 6.6 percentage points over the last three years. This included a 2.4 percentage point increase last year alone. We are also ideally positioned to capitalize as the mass affluent population in Hong Kong and mainland China continues to grow. Driven by rapid urbanization across mainland China and the increased use of the connect schemes between mainland China and Hong Kong. We grew new to bank retail customers in Hong Kong by 36% over the last three years, including by capitalizing on the significant increase of visitors from mainland China post reopening. In the U.K., we also have good traction in commercial banking. In 2023, we were the number one bank for U.K. large corporates, as well as the best bank in the U.K. for SMEs, according to Euro Money. And we are continuing to grow in wealth and personal banking. We attracted over 1 million new to bank customers in the U.K. last year. And we've had steady mortgage growth, increasing our market share of U.K. stock to 8%. As economic conditions improve and we continue to invest, we're confident in our ability to grow our business further in these critical areas. Next, I showed a slide like this last year to demonstrate how we've gone from a business that depended on our home markets for the vast majority of our profits, while the rest of the franchise underperformed, to one with broad based profitability across markets. This slide shows the increasing profitability of these diversified growth opportunities. The number one rankings speak for themselves. And I especially want to call out the great work that the global banking and markets team are doing in the Middle East. They now topped these rankings three years in a row in a region that presents significant growth opportunities going forward. India, mainland China, excluding associates and Singapore all contributed more than $1 billion of profits in 2023. With Singapore doing so for the first time. This underlines why HSBC was named best bank in Asia by Euromoney. But there was strong growth across all these markets. The next slide underlines that we have reshaped our portfolio to reinforce strengths while exiting areas of underperformance and/or lower strategic priority. Over the last 12 months, we've announced exits in a number of our smaller markets. This is one way that we expect to take out further costs alongside our continued focus on improving the internal efficiency of the bank. And by making savings, we can invest in the areas on the left that help us to drive growth. Before I move on, I want to mention SVB UK. Everyone knows that HSBC is an international bank. But we also have a long history of supporting innovative entrepreneurs. And the acquisition of SVB UK enabled us to build a bigger proposition that can help us to become known as the go to bank for innovation companies. It's encouraging that innovation banking had its best ever quarter for customer onboarding in the fourth quarter of 2023. I'm also encouraged by how many of those innovative companies want to take their capabilities cross border. The next slide sets out how we're investing in technology to make customer experiences better, sell process is more efficient and our cost of execution lower. I'm pleased to see more of our personal and corporate customers are mobile and digitally active. HSBC has traditionally grown by cross-selling products to our existing banking clients, but innovation also enables us to open up growth avenues that are beyond our traditional customer footprint. Zing is one such growth avenue because it offers cross-border payment capabilities, but critically it is targeted at non-HSBC customers. Our embedded finance joint venture announced with Tradeshift last year is another such growth avenue. It's still early days for both, but they will allow us to break outside of the existing business model. I will also briefly cover our final two pillars. There isn't a conversation I have with a client where the net zero transition doesn't come up. Our first net zero transition plan shows how we intend to finance and support the transition to net zero and collaborate globally to help enable change at scale. It will be a complex journey, but we have exactly the right geographic footprint where the need and opportunity are greatest. Finally, energize. Over the last four years, we've increased the pace of execution across the organization. The management team is confident about the business, but it's even more important that our colleagues are confident, because when they are, we stand a much greater chance of succeeding. So I'm pleased that our 2023 staff survey showed the number of colleagues seeing the positive impact of our strategy was up 11 percentage points from 2020 to 73%. And I'm also very excited by the number of quality new hires we've been able to bring into the organization over the last 12 months. It's also a vote of confidence in our strategy and the momentum we have built over the last four years. In summary, I will go back to what I said at the start. I'm really pleased with how we performed in 2023 and the contribution that our people made. We reported $30 billion of PBT for the first time and a mid-teens RoTE. There was good underlying growth in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation. Our profit before tax was $7.3 billion. We distributed $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of 2023. This included the best full-year dividend since 2008 and three share buybacks. And we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. We remain committed to cost discipline and we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue even in a lower rates environment. We're confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver mid-teens returns in 2024. With that, let me hand over to Noel for Q&A.\nUnidentified Company Representative: [Operator Instructions] Okay, Gurpreet.\nGurpreet Sahi: Thank you. Gurpreet Sahi from Goldman. Two questions, if I may please. The first one is on FY 2025 and beyond. We note that the RoTE guidance for this year, but if there can be any comments regarding the RoTE for 2025 and beyond. In particular, if the banking NII sensitivity for the next 100 basis points of trade cuts can be guided to us. The second one is around the gain, the implied improvement in the capital from the gain in Canadian operations. And that remains at around $10 billion of which $4 billion can be special dividend. So the $6 billion, have we decided on how much between capital distribution to shareholders and then business growth? Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you very much for your questions. I\u2019ll ask Georges to cover both of those please.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you Noel. Thanks Gurpreet. So we have not at this stage given guidance for full year 2025. I point you to the guidance we've given for full year 2024 of at least $41 billion in banking NII and mid-teens return on tangible equity. In terms of banking NII sensitivity, we do have a slide at the back end of the deck, which I can point you to, which shows for the further 100 basis point and for future years what's the impact. What I can point you to is number one, we continue to intend to increase subject to market conditions, but as of today to increase the structural hedge. Second the volume of the structural hedge. Second, we continue to intend to increase the weighted average life of the structural hedge, having now reached 2.8 years and with the intent to take it to about three years, both of which should give you a sense of how we're mitigating rate impacts into 2024 and 2025 from the structural hedging activity. With regards again on Canada, so $10 billion proceeds, $4 billion will be considered, well we committed to consider as a priority use for a special dividend. The residual $6 billion will constitute about 0.8%, 0.9% additional CET1, which may, which very likely will be at the Q1 outcome. We will continue looking at opportunities, but it remains our intent, subject to market conditions, our capital position, regulatory position, it remains our intent to continue a rolling series of share buybacks beyond this one.\nGurpreet Sahi: Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Any others in the room? Okay, so we'll take our first question from the line, will be from Andrew Coombs from Citi.\nAndrew Coombs: Hi. Good morning from London, good afternoon to yourselves. Two questions please. Firstly, I just want to clarify the messaging on the banking NII outlook. If I rewind 12 months ago, I think you gave guidance for greater than $36 billion of reported NII, but then this time a year ago you said you weren't seeking to move consensus, which at the time was actually higher, it was at $37. If I fast forward to today, you're guiding to greater than $41. If I look at consensus NII, I adjust the trading book funding costs, it looks like consensus banking NII is around $44. So are you seeking to rebase consensus banking NII or should we put greater emphasis on your greater than within that $41 target? So that's my first question. I just want to clarify that messaging. My second question is around the hedge. Thank you for the extra disclosure on the $478 billion nominal and the 2.8 years average life. Can you give us an idea of both the average yield on that book and also where it's currently rolling off that and what you're aiming to roll it back on at if you are extending the duration now? Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: I think Georges will answer both of those.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andrew. So obviously today we cannot see consensus banking NII and basically I'll use this opportunity to ask you collectively if you can start giving us your banking NII. So we can see the NII forecasts and then the funding costs of the Trading Book gets lumped together with the non-NII and it's to be fair difficult for us to unpack it. Although $44 billion does sound high if we try to do the math ourselves. But let me take a step back and just walk you through how we're thinking about NII and just bear with me for two minutes. But I think that explanation will probably help guide you. So we start from a Q4 10.7 billion banking NII. We would adjust then Q4 for the parts related to Argentina hyperinflation as well as the reclassification of the cash flow hedges between NII and non-NII. We'll adjust for the part that does not pertain to Q4. So that's a full year correction. And that's about an additional $0.5 billion you could use on the Q4 10.7 number. So that takes you to 11.2 adjusted quarterly run rates. Annualized taking into account day counts you get to 44.4. From that 44.4 remember you have to deduct the full year French NII, France retail NII, as well as three quarters from the Canada NII, which together combined come to about $1.3 billion. So $44.4 minus $1.3 takes you to just above $43 billion. That would be our starting position if you want, in terms of an annualization of a run rate, factoring in structural hedges, etcetera. Now from that $43 billion, there are various tailwinds and headwinds. We have the tailwind of reinvestment of all the structural hedges from lower rates into the current rate environment. We do have some tailwinds, probably cautious on H1, but tailwinds beyond H1 in terms of volume growth and loan growth. And we do have headwinds, including the rate cycle, if indeed we start seeing the decreases in the second half of the year. And we obviously have the headwinds, which we've observed specifically in Hong Kong around deposit migration to term deposits. Kind of baking all of that into account, we're getting to the guidance of at least $41 billion that we're comfortable sharing today. With regards to the structural hedge, we have shared with you volume. We have shared with you the weighted average life. And we have shared with you now banking NII sensitivity. We have not yet shared and we have not yet found the level of standard we would need to be able to share the yield. But what I can tell you about the yield is that both the yield of the maturing hedges being replaced at current rates, as well as the additional hedges we're doing with inverted curves are all baked into our at least $41 billion banking NII guidance.\nNoel Quinn: So if I could just add a couple of comments. One reason we're not giving a statement regarding consensus is, as Georges says, we think consensus is a mixture of updated thinking that has adjusted for some of these annualization effects of disposals and other things. And some consensus hasn't adjusted for that at the moment. So I think there's a little bit of apples and pears in today's consensus position. So what Georges is clearly trying to articulate for you is, take the Q4, adjust it for the known items, get to a new starting position of $43 billion, and he's underpinned that starting position of $43 billion with at least $41. Therefore, the range of modeling is going to be somewhere between $41 and $43, depending on the assumptions you might make on the headwinds and the tailwinds. And we think that given that lack of consistency on consensus, the uncertainty in the market, that's probably the best way to guide you on banking NII. There's a very clear repositioning of the starting position to get us back on an apples and apples basis. And then the other thing, no, that was it. That's what I wanted to say. Those two comments. Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you. Next question. We'll take one from the room.\nKatherine Lei: Katherine Lee from JPMorgan. So I have two questions here. The first question I want to clarify, the mid-teen RoTE guidance is on normalized lot. That means that the RoTE, excluding Canada disposal game. So I want to clarify that because if that is the case in mid-teen RoTE, then if you look at the company compiler consensus, I think the RoTE is 17.4%. Then I just calculated on a very like top-down basis, excluding the disposal gain and consensus RoTE is roughly about mid-teens as well. But the thing is that I think that means that the HSBC guidance and consensus is quite in line in terms of normalized RoTE. But I think on NII, on cost, I think in the previous questions, I think there may be a bit of reset in expectation. And then I think cost, the 5% cost is a bit higher than where consensus was indicating. Then that means -- does it mean that you are quite optimistic on non-NII growth, i.e., fee growth or maybe you have a different view on asset quality and, hence, the ECL charges. I think this is the first part of the big question. The second part is on BoCom. May I know like what trigger the $3 billion impairment charges? And as China's yield is declining like they just announced a 25 basis point on 5-year LPL cuts in all those. Should we be expecting more impairments on the BoCom investment? So basically, I want to see if there is any onetime of events that trigger this impairment or if it is going to be a normalized part of the business. So I think in the statement, you clearly stated that they will have no impact on dividends and shareholders' return. I believe this is related to the $14 billion capital deduction, which you have already made on associate. I think that is primarily BoCom. But can you explain a bit of that mechanism? Because I think today's share price reaction is partly factoring in the kind of concern that if there is an ongoing impairment on BoCom, that will affect the company's ability to deliver shareholders' return. Yes.\nNoel Quinn: Two excellent questions, and you're going to get two excellent answers from Georges.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Katherine. So Katherine, taking them in the order you said the first mid-teens RoTE is excluding notable items. Therefore, it is excluding the gain on Canada. So your calculation is correct. In terms of NII and cost, there's a couple of things to share. We recognize the cost assessment. In terms of banking NII, we have given the guidance here. Just point to -- I mentioned it in my earlier speech, but I just point you that our banking NII sensitivity has reduced more than -- by more than half from the full year 2022 due to, among other parameters, our structured lending activity. So therefore, the rate impact on our banking NII is reduced commensurately. Equally, we do have some anticipation of volume growth if and when rates start increasing, which is now planned for H2, and this is why we have some positive outlook for H2. If rate decrease volume could pick up, subject to economic conditions, etcetera. But that's the assessment we have made today. And then thirdly, on the non-rate sensitive earnings. I've called out transaction banking and went earlier. Between them, they constitute about 80% of our non-rate sensitive earnings. One has grown 5%, 23 to 22, and the other one has grown 7%. And therefore, we do feel there is momentum in both these areas for continued growth. And I didn't talk about the residual 20%, but in the residue 20% capital market activities, for instance, is included. And again, in a different rate environment, we have grounds to believe this can also pick up. So yes, we are comfortable with the momentum we have in the revenue. Can I point you on one thing about cost? We called it out 5% for the 2024 has a flow-through impact from inflation in 2023. 2023 experienced high inflation. There is some flow-through, some adjustments, including wage inflation, which we anticipate to do in 2024. Based on current outlook of inflation, that parameter is easing as we look forward beyond 2024 without giving you any guidance for 2025. The inflationary component flow through into 2025 does look like easing from where we stand today, looking at 2024 outlook for inflation. If I move on to your second question about BoCom. So this is a -- we do talk about the value-in-use model. It's following the Hong Kong accounting standards, international accounting standards. Without boring you with the accounting details, the ARNA has many pages, which we can point you to that explain it. It feeds into parameters all in the -- essentially, in the public domain including macro data, other factors, including analyst comments, feeds into the model. But the model is not highly intuitive, but the outcome is the outcome, and we've been consistently applying it for umpteenth quarters now and therefore, we'll apply for Q4. It is very difficult to predict what the model will give us in Q1. We will take into account the information we receive over the course of Q1, and we will run the model as we do every quarter and consistently apply the outcome. Finally, captive deduction. I think this is a very important point. Your math, Katherine is correct. There is about $14 billion sitting today in our regulatory capital deductions because they sit above our threshold. Therefore, you could legitimately assume that there is that much of buffer against any impairments we face in our financial holdings, BoCom being one of them. The other one is insurance. That's the two essentially. And therefore, you can legitimately assume that the compensation we would get from any hypothetical future impairment will be commensurate given the size of our threshold deductions at this stage. Yes.\nNoel Quinn: So he did give you two excellent answers. Thank you. Thanks, Georges. Next question, please?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Our next question comes from Joseph Dickerson at Jefferies. Joe, we cannot hear you.\nJoseph Dickerson: Can you hear me now? Sorry about that. Just adding to the chase on the\u2026 So just cutting to the chase on some of the questions that have come through on the NII guide. I think you can probably get a sense that there's some reasonable confusion about what the message is for the 2024 baseline. If we work back from your kind of clean mid-teens ROE, you've given us some guidance on cost. You've given us some guidance on credit. It's kind of getting into a baseline revenue number of about $64 billion in consensus is $63.5 billion or thereabouts. Are you comfortable with that consensus number? Are you seeking to change that with this guide? So that is question number one. And question number 2 is, why the focus on banking NII versus total NII because it's going to be as rates come down a lot of moving parts on the trading book funding cost dynamic because, indeed, if I look at your annual report, you've actually got a benefit coming through in the USD bucket from rates falling in terms of the aggregate NII. So I guess why are you trying to distinguish between those two conceptually for us? Because again, it's creating a fair amount of confusion with investors.\nNoel Quinn: Georges?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you Joe, yes, so I recognize your arithmetics. And yes, I agree with your arithmetics. This being said, I cannot give you guidance on total revenue. Otherwise, I'll be giving you guidance on our full profitability. But we recognize your arithmetics. A couple of things just to highlight if you want to for your consideration. The first one is our guidance for banking NII is not $41 billion. It's at least $41 billion, factoring in elements of uncertainty that I called out earlier, that's for full year 2024. You do have the building blocks for cost and for ECL. And then the residual part, if you want, of our earnings story is the non-NII component, excluding the gains from Canada. And as I said earlier, about 80% of it is generated from transaction banking and wealth, both of which do have momentum, both of which are areas where we continue investing both in terms of digital capabilities and client servicing and in terms of net new invested assets. And we are excited about the potential of these two businesses, and we believe our meetings RoTE is not based on unreasonable growth in these areas. It's based on momentum growth in these areas. Maybe I can point you to our net new invested assets, $84 billion for the year, up from $80 billion last year, up from $64 billion the year before. So clearly, we're acquiring new assets. But equally, as you've seen, Asset Management, Private Banking grew double-digit percentage points. That's also partly due to the valuation because our AUM is also increasing because the underlying valuation is improving, which is, therefore, a generator of fees commensurately, subject to market conditions as we go forward.\nNoel Quinn: I think if there's any more questions, maybe we get the IR team to just work with you after the call.\nGeorges Elhedery: Just on your second point, so we're guiding -- we would like to move to banking NII guidance. We recognized last year, we have moved from NII into a dual guidance of NII and funding cost of the trading book. We think it is much simpler to look at our overall rate sensitive earnings through banking NII lens. They kind of shift from one to the other, which is zero-sum game. So it moves from one to the other is reflective of business decisions as regards how much of our funding we would want to give to the trading book based on various parameters, including opportunities in the trading book as well as opportunities for loan growth. And we would think that it would be too noisy if we have to really manage both on a separate basis.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you. Next question, please.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Our next question comes from Benjamin Toms at RBC.\nNoel Quinn: Benjamin, hi.\nBenjamin Toms: Good morning, both. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, on cost of risk. In relation to your guidance of 40 basis points, is there still a plausible downside to this guidance? Or does the 40 basis points encapsulate that plausible downside? And then secondly, on loan growth, I know you're cautious on loan growth in the first half of 2024. Do you expect growth to pick up in Half 2, but 2024 as a whole, can you just confirm that you expect net growth in the balance sheet? It sounds like you do because you earlier described volumes and a potential tailwind to NII. And could you narrow down how much lending we should expect for growth for this year? Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you. Georges, do you want to take both of those?\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Thank you, Benjamin. So our cost of risk of 40 basis points encapsulates everything we currently foresee in our balance sheet. We have not communicated a further plausible downside on the China commercial real estate portfolio booked in Hong Kong because we believe at this stage that, number one, we're well provisioned for this portfolio afterwards -- after the provisioning that's taken place last year. And number two, we also have less concerns going forwards on our residual exposure in that portfolio. I can point you to our exposure is now at $6.2 billion, that's down $3.1 billion from full year 2022. So therefore, we do not -- we have reduced level of concern. I can walk you through, if needed, the -- how well ECL positioning is in this portfolio but we're comfortable. No additional concerns than we caught out last year. On the loan growth, yes, our expectations is that as economic conditions continue improving and the interest rate environment becomes more supportive, we would expect to see loan growth. We continue to guide on a medium-term basis to mid-single-digit percentage points loan growth and balance sheet growth. It's very difficult to forecast what H2 will look like, but that is part of our projections.\nNoel Quinn: So I think our view is given the shift in the interest rate cycle and the shift in inflation, we'll start to see more economic confidence or business confidence, consumer confidence in the second half. We're not expecting significant growth in the balance sheet in the first half. If you start to see that kick in the second half, you're unlikely to see full year mid-single-digit growth in 2024. You're going to see a proportion of that start to kick in, in the second half of the year. And then you'll see it kicking in more strongly in 2025 and beyond. So I think in your modeling, you're probably looking at limited growth in the first half, growth starting to come back in the second half.\nBenjamin Toms: Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Our next question comes from Robert Noble at Deutsche.\nNoel Quinn: Robert, hi.\nRobert Noble: Can you hear me?\nNoel Quinn: Yes.\nRobert Noble: Thanks for taking my questions. What was the size of the hedge last year? So how much is it that ramped up this year? And can you give us an idea of what the currency mix of the hedges and whether there's any duration differences between those currencies as well? Secondly, what exactly is in the quarter, the cash flow hedge reclassification, the impact it had from transferring from NII to non-NII. What exactly was that? And then lastly, the timing of the special dividend of the Canada sale, will it come with Q1 results if the deal is announced prior to release? Or is it not linked to the results down? That's all. Thanks.\nNoel Quinn: Okay. Georges?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thanks, Noel. So Robert, we've added about 80 -- or north of $80 billion to our hedge this year in terms of bond notional a little bit more in terms of other derivative notional. And that's on top of $80 billion we've added over Q4 and starting in Q3 in 2022. So that should give you an idea of also what is the quantum we could reasonably do in 2024 if the market conditions remain supportive for the hedge. In terms of duration, I mean, the kind of -- the obvious one to call out is we can certainly hedge on our weighted average life for slightly longer currencies such as the pound, the U.S. dollar and some extent, the euro. We have an inability to hedge in any reasonable size or shape and this is due to structural market, our Hong Kong dollar exposure. So our Hong Kong dollar exposure hedge would remain much lower. And therefore, our exposure in Hong Kong dollar would remain more sensitive to the rate outlook compared to the other currencies. In terms of Canada sale, you could expect in Q1, subject to completion, which is now I believe -- which is now planned to be -- on track to be by the end of Q1. We would expect to see a jump of 1.2%, 1.3% in our CET1 ratio. The special dividend, which we're committed to consider would happen afterwards. Our best estimate is H1, but frankly, afterwards as soon as we can subject to all necessary approvals. And that will drop the CET1 by about 0.5, with a result in net of around 0.8 in our CET1 after the dividend. We will update you at the Q1 results about the special dividend considerations.\nNoel Quinn: Yes. It's probably not possible to close at the end of March and declare in the same quarter just for accounting reasons. So it's likely to be closed at the end of Q1 and probably declare Q2 and then pay following that. That's likely to be the accounting requirement just to get the books closed for Q1 and then declaring Q2 is the most likely outcome.\nRobert Noble: Sorry, declare in Q2, not with Q2 results?\nNoel Quinn: Probably with Q2 results.\nRobert Noble: Right. So pay in Q3?\nGeorges Elhedery: It's our intent to do it as soon as we can. I can take you through the process, but there is a process we have to go through and the time lines will need to just flow through. But we'll confirm the timing at the 1Q results.\nRobert Noble: All right. That was just that one little question of what the cash flow had customers in the quarter.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sorry, yes, that reclassification is an area in reporting. It's related to one geography where some of our cash flow hedges were booked wrongly between NII and non-NII and we've done this correction. It is -- it has affected one jurisdiction. The amount is a full year amount. So I wouldn't -- the $0.3 billion charge we've taken reflects a full year correction of which around 1/4 relate to -- actually the fourth quarter, the rest is a catch-up for the first three quarters of the year.\nRobert Noble: Alright, thanks very much.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sorry, just to be clear, Robert, the total income is not affected. This is just a reclassification of income from one line item to another line item.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you. Next question, please.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Alastair?\nAlastair Warr: Alastair Warr from Autonomous. Just a quick question on the ECL charges and things are subsided a bit on the China property side. Obviously, nice for you guys to see, but some a few cracks popping up in Mexico, is that something you characterize the cycle stuff that might be going somewhere from here, we need to keep an eye on or something a little more one-off?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Alastair. So the one-off -- the -- sorry, the Mexico ECL related to an increase in our activity, specifically in unsecured lending. It's a feature of that jurisdiction where margins are very healthy, but the ECL coverage or the ECL charge tend to be a bit higher. It will depend on our activity, but we expect to run at a slightly higher activity in unsecured lending among other in Mexico than we were before. So I wouldn't look at it as a one-off, but obviously, it will depend on the cycle.\nNoel Quinn: But it's a function of doing business and growing the business as opposed to a function of a historic problem materialize. Next question, please.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Our next question comes from Perlie Mong at KBW.\nPerlie Mong: Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple. I guess the first one is as -- just what can you do with cost in the falling rate environment because you've talked about management actions. I guess the reason I'm asking is because this year, I believe all in is about 7% year-on-year. And of course, it includes a lot of one-offs like levies in this quarter and SVB earlier in the year. But on the basis that it crept up from plus 2% year-on-year, which is, I think, the first we talked about the 2023 guidance to the end result being something like 6%, 7%. And just wondering what levers do you have in your sort of cost management action pocket to combat costs if revenue were to disappoint. So that's number one. And the second question is, I think we will talk a lot about what might happen to revenues in various rate environments. But -- and also just thank you for the disclosures on the structural hedge. But I guess stepping back a little bit from that. Just a couple of clarifications. So in a falling rate environment, how would you expect things like customer behavior to respond? So things like deposit mix shift like in Hong Kong. So I guess the mix shift towards term happened quite a lot faster in Hong Kong versus the U.K. on the way up and it's still ongoing from the disclosures today. So if rates were to turn, would you expect that flip back to be pretty quick? Or on a pretty high rate environment? Or do you still expect to make sure to continue? So I think you talked about things like capital markets might outperform in a falling rate environment. So I guess, on an underlying basis, just how do you see that because capital markets and loan growth, etcetera, I guess a lot of it is also to do with the underlying GDP as well. And there's still a lot of uncertainty sort of on the horizon. So even if rates were to come down, just how quickly do you think these benefits can come through?\nNoel Quinn: Okay. We'll tackle the cost first and then maybe we come to the revenue second, and I'll do a few introductory comments on how I see revenues. On costs, Georges, do you want to just do a quick analysis of reported costs 2023 versus 2022 target basis and then reported 2023 to 2024 target basis. And I might just add a few comments at the end of that on cost levers the way I look at it. But Georges?\nGeorges Elhedery: Good. Yes. Thanks. So on a reported basis, 2023 to 2022, we were down 1%. And so the growth against our target of 6% also is reflective of the fact that a lot of the restructuring costs we've taken in 2022 did not repeat. We've guided how the costs have increased from our initial 3% where we included severance into the 6%. Obviously, the last percent this quarter was unexpected. The rules for the FDIC special assessment came in November. The earlier draft rules we've seen in September indicated we would be incurring that cost in 2024 and 2025, but the rules that came in November had us to have to -- have a different accounting treatment and accelerate all that as did all other banks who were subject to the FDIC special assessment. So I just want to call it out that this one a particular event we called out. We -- as we look at going forward for 2024, we're looking at a 5% on a target basis growth. This is excluding the cost reduction we would get from exiting the French retail business and the Canada business. Between the two of them, we will be exiting on an annual basis and equivalent to $1 billion, just shy of that, which is around 3%. That would be a reduction in cost of 3%, but that is excluded from the way we're managing our target basis. Just explaining how we're coming up with this cost, and then Noel can talk you through the levers to manage our cost. So first, there is this flow-through inflation from 2023. There is some wage adjustments we need to take into account for 2024 based on the flow-through inflation from 2023. That component, we feel is easing and hopefully, and the outlook of inflation will ease as we go out of 2024 into the future. There is continued spend in technology and continued investment in some of the growth areas -- organic growth areas. That's particularly true in wealth. And those spending are partly offset by a number of cost management actions, some of which we have taken already such as the severance program, which will have a flow-through benefit into 2024, and other actions we're planning to take. Just before Noel talks to levers, we're looking at cost as in growth on a target basis in dollar numbers. We're not looking at our cost efficiency ratio basis. There may be fluctuation to our revenue, but frankly, in a year like 2023, our CER has dropped from 65% in 2022 to 48%. So we will tolerate some volatility on the CER as long as we're managing our cost in spend dollar basis. But...\nNoel Quinn: Thank you. Thanks Georges. And I know this is an important topic, and let me reiterate upfront, we remain committed to cost discipline. The question is how are we achieving cost discipline? We obviously look for efficiencies in the existing organization. We invest in tech to drive efficiencies in our processing costs, and we're continuing to do that. We invest in simplification of the portfolio, closing down businesses organically, exiting costs organically. But we're also exiting costs through M&A. And in our target basis, we adjust for that. But I don't want you to lose sight. We have exited -- we'll be exiting $1 billion of cost in 2024 as a function of M&A decisions. Portfolio choices made for good strategic reasons. $300 million of that was the exit of our French retail business. It's a business that was losing money. So we've exited $300 million of costs by selling and it's going to be profit accretive because that business was a loss-making business. We've exited $800 million of costs in Canada through selling. We hope to by the end of Q1, not tempting fate. Why are we doing it? Because that business in our hands was probably valued at around 1 times book, and we were able to generate 2.5 times book as over 2.5 times book. We sold it because it was worth more to somebody else than to us. And we're redistributing the proceeds of that to our shareholders because we thought it was the right answer for our shareholders. So we do internally generated cost efficiency and externally generated cost efficiency for good strategic reasons, and we'll continue to pull those levers. Now the other thing is we are -- we do believe an organization like us with the growth opportunities we have, we should invest. And we made a decision last year on our original cost target of 3% to actually move it up to 4% because we were continuing to invest in tech. And in tech today as part of our overall cost base is now around 22%. When I took over four years ago, tech as a percent of our cost base was 16%. So we're trying to remain disciplined on cost and change the nature of the costs to be a much more strategic cost component in driving future enhancements for customer propositions and efficiencies. So that's sort of the thinking we have. You have our absolute commitment, both myself and Georges and the management teams. We will keep cost discipline. We'll invest and save at the same time. We have to acknowledge the flow-through of inflation. But the other component we made a decision on in 2023, given the very, very strong performance the business had, we thought it was right to go from 4% to 5% by topping up the variable pay pool by an extra percent. We thought that was the right decision for our people. So we think it's the right cost decision, but it has inflated our cost compared to our original target of 3%. But I think we had to do the right thing by our people on that. And then the final 1% taking us to the 6% number you talked about was unexpected. When we talked to you in Q3, we didn't expect that final 1% to come through for FDIC and bank levies. The FDIC is probably a timing issue. It was going to come through in 2024 or 2025, but it actually surprisingly came through in the final quarter of the year. So you've got our commitment will remain tight with high cost. There is now turn to revenues. And let me maybe again, decompose how we think about revenue growth outside of NII or interest income. Clearly, the great work that Georges and the team have done on hedging and further structural hedges we put in place and the extra duration is a mitigant to the downside. I look at the opportunity on the upside in two components. One, is our core USP of International Banking. We have within our franchise, clients who operate in more countries than we currently bank them, be they personal clients or corporate clients. We still have huge amounts of untapped opportunity to further penetrate our client base. And every time you saw in the revenue multipliers, we take a client to multiple jurisdictions, a revenue multiplier of 5 times domestic revenue in Wholesale Banking, 3 times domestic revenue in retail banking. That's an internal generated revenue opportunity, not dependent on GDP. That's in our hands. The second revenue opportunity you talked about in your analysis is countercyclical. And I do believe -- I've been around 37 years, so I've seen some cycles. And I do believe lower inflation, leads to lower interest rates, lower interest rates lead to a pickup in economic activity normally for the lag effect. And I do believe that pickup will have a positive impact on capital market activity in our Global Banking and Markets business. I think it will have a big and positive impact on demand for corporate lending and personal lending in our wholesale and retail business, lag effect, as I've talked about. And thirdly, I think consumers will start to shift out of cash into invested assets, and that's a huge opportunity for our wealth business. And you've seen our track record on our ability to attract net new invested assets over the last three years, $84 billion, $80 billion, $64 billion. That's where we're very focused and a lot of our investment is going. Now it's for us, the management team to deliver on that. So we know we got to deliver on tight costs and cost discipline, and we've got to deliver on revenue diversification. My final comment on this is I'm grateful that we've had four years of transformation because we now are through the majority of that transformation focus, majority, and we're now focused on that growth opportunity. And we're in a fortunate position that all of the hard work over the last four years has given us that platform for growth. Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: So we have time for one last question, then I'll hand it back to you, Noel, if you want to make any concluding remarks. So our final question comes from Aman Rakkar at Barclays.\nAman Rakkar: Thank you very much. Hi, Noel, hi Georges. I have two broad questions. The first one is kind of split into two. I've got a second question around GB&M, sorry, capital return. First broad question, it's around fee income. The first part of it is, I'm a bit confused by your banking NII sensitivity. You can see on Slide 34, $3.4 billion on 100 basis points rate cap. But the majority of that comes from nonbanking -- sorry, non-NII. So can you help me there because I just don't understand that? I thought banking NII kind of stripped out the trading funding cost. So whatever color you can give us there? And the related question is that your outlook for fee income, more broadly, I get your messaging around wealth. Transaction banking is kind of demonstrating positive momentum. But can I ask you about the other big chunk of fee income, which is GB&M. And there's various moving parts there. I suspect that you think cyclically, it's not earning its full amount. But I also do note that Global FX has kind of been decent for a while. So can you give us your view on to what extent that business is operating at, below or ahead of kind of capacity? That was a kind of broad two-pronged question on fee income, believe it or not. The second question was around your distribution, your approach to distribution that you're potentially phasing down the barrel of slower volume growth in 2024. And I'm interested in you're arguably then going to be more capital generative this year on still decent profits, and not a lot of balance sheet growth. How do you approach that? Do you kind of give us additional buybacks through the course of this year? Or do you kind of hold that powder dry for a bigger rebound in 2025, say? Thank you very much.\nNoel Quinn: Okay. I think, Georges, do you want to pick off those three points?\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Aman, so what historically we've been giving you is NII sensitivity. But there is a big component that is rate sensitive in our earnings, which doesn't sit in NII. It sits in non-NII under funding cost of the trading book. And what we've been doing, and hopefully, that slide was meant to clarify it, but I'm assuming now we have to take probably more offline with you to go through it. What we've been doing is showing the sensitivity of both the NII to rates as well as the sensitivity of the funding cost of trading book to rate. And then giving you the full sensitivity of banking NII to rate because that would be a better representation of how sensitive our earnings are to rate, and it will take away the noise that is created by ongoing commercial decisions on how much we've -- how much funds we provide the trading activity or take away from the trading activity in year. It kind of cleanses that information out because it's just giving you the total that is relevant for our overall earnings. That sensitivity has reduced by more than half over the year in part at least for 30%, 40% of it due to our structural hedging activity. With regards the fee income, you mentioned FX having a good and decent income. A couple of things about GB&M to call out. First, the PBT of GB&M was more than 20% or 25% higher year-on-year. So clearly, a business that increases PBT. Its return on tangible equity has exceeded our cost of capital. It's something that has been not achieved for many years. It's above 12%. And to be also fair to GB&M, it's return tangible equity only increased by about 10% because there are some corporate center related adjustments, which is affected them. Otherwise, the return on tangible equity could have followed the trend of PBT growth because their RWAs were down, and they could have seen close to 20%. And therefore, well above their cost of equity. So we're comfortable with how the business is continue to transform itself, focusing on their strength and adjusting their footprint, and that momentum continues. In terms of distribution, well, first, it remains our ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks as long as our capital supports it and the outlook for capital does support it, but this remains subject to ongoing macroeconomic developments and regulatory approvals, etcetera. And one thing to call out with regards our bolt-on acquisitions is when we look at an acquisition, obviously, the first parameter is making sure it's a strategic and accelerating growth area that we strategically want to grow. But the second parameter that we also use equally is that it is accretive compared to a share buyback. So we're making sure that when we go for a bolt-on acquisition, the investments is more accretive than the investment in buying our own shares. And this is -- this would be a disciplined measure to make sure we're doing M&A that is both strategic and accretive. And finally, in terms of other parts of the distribution, 50% dividend payout ratio for 2024, which we reaffirmed. And then if you want to give a -- if you want to have a benchmark on where we would operate on a target basis, our CET1 ratio, it will be in the 14 to 14.5 range, which we reiterate, but we recognize we may not meet that target because we may be well above it for a few quarters in particular, thanks to Canada, but also to our own capital generation.\nNoel Quinn: And the pace at which we can get back down to that target is going to be dictated by two things: the capacity of the market to take buybacks; and second, are there alternative uses of that capital to support growth. But I think it's fair to say there's going to be excess of our CET1 over our target range more in the near term because probably the capacity of the market to take the volume of buybacks that could be done.\nAman Rakkar: Thank you so much. Can I just clarify? So is it reasonable then to expect that -- is it reasonable to target year-on-year growth in GB&M, the fee income businesses in GB&M? Is it in those various moving parts should we think about growth?\nGeorges Elhedery: Yes, in the strategic area, certainly, I mean, the areas we called out such as foreign exchange such as payments, such as supporting trade. We do expect also growth. And as Noel mentioned earlier, in capital market activity, if and when rates come down, we see progress in this area of the fee income space. Clearly, GB&M has focused itself and the kind of the message is that in the areas where they're focusing strategically, yes. In the areas where they have exited or are downsizing, then this would be nonstrategic areas that they will continue doing downsizing.\nAman Rakkar: Okay, thanks so much.\nNoel Quinn: Listen, I just wanted to say thank you all for joining. I also want to just say, look, I'm -- clearly, I'm really pleased that we've had a record profit year in 2023, and the best returns that we've had for a decade. Really pleased we were able to reward our loyal shareholders with $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect to 2023. This included the best full year dividend since 2008 and three share buybacks. We still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. And we are committed to cost discipline. I want you in no doubt on that. We expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue, and we're very focused on it because we've come out of that 4-year transformation phase with a very strong focus on growth. We continue to target a mid-teens RoTE in 2024. And I just want to say thank you for joining us. And Neil, the team are available should you need them. I hope to see many of you here in Hong Kong in April when we hold our inaugural Global Investment Summit. Looking forward to being back here at the end of March and for the Investment Summit in early April. Thank you all very much.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you for coming.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect the call.",

        "text": "Good afternoon for those in Hong Kong and great to see you all. Good morning to those watching in London and around the world. Before Georges takes you through the Q4 numbers, I'll make some opening comments. First, I'm really pleased with the performance that the team delivered in 2023. We reported $30 billion of PBT for the first time ever and we delivered a return on tangible equity of 14.6% or 15.6% excluding material notable items. Second, there were some items in the fourth quarter, which make it harder to understand the underlying performance. Georges will take you through them in detail. But I want to stress there was still good underlying growth in the fourth quarter excluding the impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation our profit before tax was $7.3 billion. Third, we distributed $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of 2023. This included a full-year dividend of $0.61 per share which is the highest since 2008 and $7 billion of share buybacks which have reduced the share count by over 4% at completion of the current buyback. Fourth, we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. We've announced a further share buyback of up to $2 billion. We're committed to considering a special dividend of $0.21 per share as a priority use of the Canada proceeds subject to the completion of the transaction, and we finished the year with a strong CET 1 ratio of 14.8% which will be further boosted by the Canada deal. Fifth, we remain committed to cost discipline. We have flow through impact of 2023 inflation on our costs this year but expect a downward trend in inflationary pressures in 2025 and beyond. We continue to invest in growth opportunities and the digitization of our business to drive incremental efficiencies. We remain very focused on funding much of that investment through cost saving initiatives. Finally, we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue even in a lower rate environment. Georges will take you through how we're reducing our sensitivity to rate movements and we do acknowledge the downside risks to NII, but we're confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver mid-team returns in 2024. I'll take you through some of these levers later but let me now hand over to Georges."

        "text": "Thank you, Noel. Warm welcome to everyone here in Hong Kong. For those of you watching in London, good morning, and thank you for joining our full year 2023 results call. We delivered a good underlying business performance in the fourth quarter, but let me first start by clarifying that our reported profit before tax was impacted by $5.8 billion of notable items and the further $0.5 billion from Argentina hyperinflation including the more than 50% devaluation of the peso in December. Let me unpack three of those notable items. First, we reinstated the impairment on the sale of our France retail business as signaled at the third quarter. Second, we booked a $0.4 billion of Treasury disposal losses in the quarter again in line with the guidance at the third quarter to extend the duration of hedges in anticipation of rate decreases. And finally, as you know each quarter we conduct a value and use test on the carrying value of our investment in BoCom, described in detail in our annual report and accounts. Following the outcomes of that test in Q4, we took a charge of $3 billion in the quarter against our carrying value. The charge had an insignificant impact on CT1 capital and our CT1 ratio, and no impact on our dividends or share buyback. And just to be clear, this has no impact on our strategy in mainland China, has no impact on our strategic relationship with BoCom, and it has no impact on HSBC's or BoCom's operation, strategy, or outlook. So on a reported basis, our profit before tax was $1 billion in the fourth quarter, down $4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the $6.3 billion impact of notable items in Argentina hyperinflation, our profit before tax was $7.3 billion, up $0.7 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to growth in banking NII. On the next slide, so on a reported basis, fourth quarter revenue was down $1.6 billion compared to the same period last year, due to the impact of notable items in Argentina hyperinflation. Excluding these, our revenue was up $1.5 billion, primarily banking NII. The strength of our deposit franchise, our access to 2D pools of liquidity in the U.K. and Hong Kong, and our enviable balance sheet made it possible for us to benefit from the more favorable rate environment. On the next slide, fourth quarter NII and banking NII were again impacted by Argentina hyperinflation and a reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue between NII and non-NII. Excluding these, both NII and banking NII were broadly stable on the third quarter, and NIM was down three basis points, primarily due to higher time deposit costs and deposit migration in Hong Kong. Turning to the outlook, taking our fourth quarter banking NII and adjusting for Argentina hyperinflation and the reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue, and the disposal of our France retail and Canada businesses, gives you an annualized run rate of just above $43 billion. That should be your starting point for modelling our 2024 banking NII. We expect four key variables to drive our banking NII from that starting point in 2024. Changes in interest rates, the reinvestment of maturing structural hedge assets at higher yield, deposit migration, particularly here in Hong Kong, and balance sheet movements. There is a degree of uncertainty inherent in all of these. We're guiding towards a banking NII of at least $41 billion in 2024. This is our current estimate of the bottom end of the range of reasonable outcomes, and is intended to help you with your modelling. We will continue updating further as the year unfolds. And before turning to non-NII, I'd like to direct your attention to the chart on the bottom right of this slide. Over the last 18 months, our banking NII sensitivity has reduced by around $3.5 billion. More than one third of this reduction is due to increased structural interest rate hedging. Subject to market conditions, we expect to increase both the notional and the duration of our structural hedge in the coming quarters, in order to reduce our banking NII sensitivity still further. Non-NII was down $0.9 billion compared to the same quarter last year, due to notable items in Argentina hyperinflation. And again, excluding these, non-NII was up $1.7 billion versus the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to the revenue offset into non-NII from the central cost of funding global banking and markets trading activity, which is included in banking NII, and from the cash flow hedge income reclassification between NII and non-NII, I referred to previously. Other non-NII was up modestly versus the same quarter last year, including an increase of $0.1 billion in net fee income, primarily in commercial banking and wealth and personal banking. Looking at non-NII from our two strategic activities of wholesale transaction banking and wealth. In wholesale transaction banking, non-NII was up 2% on the fourth quarter of 2022. There was good growth in global payment solution, in trade and in foreign exchange, reflecting the strength of our international network and transaction banking capabilities, as well as increased client activity and repricing initiatives. This was partly offset by a relatively small decrease in security services. In wealth, non-NII in both asset management and private banking grow by double digits versus the fourth quarter of last year, due to an increase in assets under management, partly driven by net new invested assets. However, total wealth non-NII was down $0.1 billion as a result of a $0.2 billion correction to historical valuation estimates in our insurance business. For the full year, non-NII in wholesale transaction banking was $10.6 billion, up 5% on 2022, and $6 billion in wealth, up 7%. Turning now to credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1 billion, primarily in wholesale. This brought our full year ECL charge to $3.4 billion, which was 33 basis points of average customer loans, including those held for sale, or 36 basis points excluding those, and within our full year 2023 guidance. Due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we're guiding towards ECLs of around 40 basis points for 2024. We took an ECL charge of $0.2 billion for mainland China commercial real estate in the fourth quarter, as part of the $1 billion charge for the quarter referenced in the last slide. This brought the full year charge on this portfolio to $1 billion, crystallizing the plausible downside scenario that we set out last February. Our main area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. That exposure is now $6.3 billion, down $1.2 billion in the quarter, and down $3.1 billion compared to full year 2022. We continue to monitor the sector closely, and we are comfortable with our current level of provisions. Turning to costs, full year 2023 costs on a constant currency basis were down 1%. On a target basis, full year 2023 costs came in 1% higher than our Q3 guidance, driven by three items that unexpectedly landed in the fourth quarter. First, the FDIC special assessment, which we expected to be incurred over 2024 and 2025. Second, the U.K. bank levy was higher than forecast, primarily due to adjustments relating to prior years. And third, there was an offsetting benefit from Argentina hyperinflation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we are aiming to limit cost growth to around 5% in 2024, on a target basis, which excludes the reduction in 2024 costs from the France, retail, and Canada disposals. This will be driven by the flow through impact of 2023 inflation to 2024 costs, investment and volume growth, and partly offset by cost-saving initiatives. On the next slide, customer lending and deposits were broadly stable versus the third quarter, once you exclude the sale of our France retail business. Without that, there was $35 billion of deposit growth, of which $27 billion was in Asia, with around half of this in Hong Kong. Deposit growth in Asia benefited from seasonality, and we would expect at least some of that growth to reverse in the course of Q1. Turning now to capital, our CT1 ratio at the end of 2023 was 14.8%, which was down 0.1 percentage points on the third quarter. There are three things I'd like to draw your attention to. First, as I said earlier, the BoCom charge had an insignificant impact on CT1 capital and our CT1 ratio due to the compensating reduction in regulatory capital threshold deductions, and it had no impact on dividends or share buybacks. Second, we expect the share buyback announced today to have an impact of around 25 basis points on our CT1 ratio in the first quarter of 2024. And finally, we expect the Canada sale to generate around 1.2 percentage points of CT1 in the first quarter of 2024. We remain committed to consider a $0.21 per share special dividend in the first half of 2024 as a priority use of the sale proceeds, which equates to around 0.5 percentage points of CT1. Before I hand back to Noel, I am pleased to share some enhancements that we have made with regard to our international disclosures. There are two sets of data, and Noel will also comment further on them. Starting with our wholesale business, let me walk you through the data on this slide. In 2023, we generated $33.5 billion of client revenue across commercial banking and global banking markets. Of this, $20.4 billion was generated from multi-jurisdictional clients. By this, we mean clients that bank with us in more than one market. The charts on the right show that two thirds of the client revenue we generate from those clients comes from providing them with services and markets outside their home market where they also bank with us. It is also worth pointing out that two thirds of multi-jurisdictional client revenue, or $13.4 billion, was generated from clients whose home market is in the West, with the remaining $7 billion from clients whose home market is in the East. Turning now to WPB international revenue, more than $10 billion, or 40% of our WPB revenue, comes from international customers, around two thirds of which is generated in Asia. So to summarize, both the wholesale and WPB client revenue data clearly demonstrates the strength of our international network and our unique capability to serve international clients. Our network and further investments into our international proposition position us to capture an even greater share of this vital, fast-growing sector. Let me now hand back to Noel."

        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "Thanks, Georges. Thank you, Georges. You've just heard about good underlying performance in the fourth quarter, and Georges has introduced more detailed information about our international revenue. Our wholesale international business model is a mature and differentiated business model with substantial scale. And in recent years, we have started to develop and invest in our WPB international business model. What Georges slide showed is that already 40% of WPB revenue comes from international customers, and we believe we can take it much further. So let me now turn to how we will drive revenue growth, not just this year and next, but over the next three to four years. As always, I'll begin with our purpose, ambition, strategy and values. These have helped to drive the good underlying business growth, which alongside supportive interest rates, have given us strong momentum. In the short term, we're conscious of the potential downside risk to NII. The structural hedging we have put in place will help to protect that income. But we do have some clear focus areas under our four strategic pillars, which I will cover on the following slides. Starting with focus, and our international wholesale business, which remains our biggest competitive advantage, and because of its scale, our biggest growth opportunity. In the past, our businesses in the West were primarily focused on domestic clients. Over the last four years, we have repositioned those businesses to align them with our international strategy, exiting low return and low growth domestic RWAs. The result is the differentiated model you see today. In commercial banking, we are unique in our ability to serve clients across multiple geographies, which is what HSBC was founded to do. The result was the $13.3 billion of profit before tax that commercial banking generated last year. In global banking and markets, I believe we are uniquely positioned to connect clients between West and East, which was evident in our market-leading performances in markets like the Middle East and businesses like Global Foreign Exchange. We have clearly got a strong international franchise. As you can see, we facilitated more than $850 billion of trade last year, with the diversification of supply chains leading to revenue growth opportunities for HSBC. We are ranked second globally by revenue in our payments business, and processed around $500 trillion of electronic payments. And we have been number three globally by revenue in FX since 2021. But I believe there is significant amount of untapped opportunity still to go for, which can drive revenue growth in the face of declining interest rates. Importantly, this potential revenue growth is not necessarily dependent on GDP, as that growth opportunity already exists within our client base, and it is often fee-based and strongly influenced by opportunities that are inherent to our international nature of our client base. To provide some evidence of this growth potential, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 29% in 2023, and the revenue multiplier for multi-jurisdictional corporate clients in commercial banking was five times that of an average domestic-only customer. I am pleased that international isn't just a wholesale story. We are doing more with our WPB customers as well. Building our wealth business to meet the rising demand for wealth management services, especially here in Asia, has been a strategic priority in recent years. So I am pleased that we attracted net new invested assets of $84 billion last year, compared to $80 billion in 2022 and $64 billion in 2021. This is a good indicator of future revenue opportunities, which again is often fee-income and should benefit in a lower interest rate environment as investors shift from cash reserves into invested asset classes. Another trend is the growing demand for seamless cross-border banking services. Innovation is key here, and we hadn't innovated enough in this space in the past, which meant we weren't offering our customers what they wanted. But we are now. Global Money has more than 1.3 million customers, up from 550,000 a year ago. We also launched a new, strengthened international banking proposition. Overall, we grew revenue from WPB international customers by 41% last year, from $7.2 billion to $10.2 billion. And while you might assume this was driven solely by higher rates, I am pleased to say there was a 43% jump in new-to-bank international WPB customers last year. Again, these are higher revenue generating customers, bringing in three times as much revenue as an average domestic-only customer. Next is the continued growth in our two home markets. Our leading propositions in Hong Kong and the U.K. provide us with deep liquidity and a differentiated proposition. These two pools of liquidity underpin our exceptionally strong balance sheet, which gives us the safety and security that our clients trust us to provide. Hong Kong and the U.K. are both highly connected global financial centers. We have increased our market leading share of trade finance in Hong Kong by 6.6 percentage points over the last three years. This included a 2.4 percentage point increase last year alone. We are also ideally positioned to capitalize as the mass affluent population in Hong Kong and mainland China continues to grow. Driven by rapid urbanization across mainland China and the increased use of the connect schemes between mainland China and Hong Kong. We grew new to bank retail customers in Hong Kong by 36% over the last three years, including by capitalizing on the significant increase of visitors from mainland China post reopening. In the U.K., we also have good traction in commercial banking. In 2023, we were the number one bank for U.K. large corporates, as well as the best bank in the U.K. for SMEs, according to Euro Money. And we are continuing to grow in wealth and personal banking. We attracted over 1 million new to bank customers in the U.K. last year. And we've had steady mortgage growth, increasing our market share of U.K. stock to 8%. As economic conditions improve and we continue to invest, we're confident in our ability to grow our business further in these critical areas. Next, I showed a slide like this last year to demonstrate how we've gone from a business that depended on our home markets for the vast majority of our profits, while the rest of the franchise underperformed, to one with broad based profitability across markets. This slide shows the increasing profitability of these diversified growth opportunities. The number one rankings speak for themselves. And I especially want to call out the great work that the global banking and markets team are doing in the Middle East. They now topped these rankings three years in a row in a region that presents significant growth opportunities going forward. India, mainland China, excluding associates and Singapore all contributed more than $1 billion of profits in 2023. With Singapore doing so for the first time. This underlines why HSBC was named best bank in Asia by Euromoney. But there was strong growth across all these markets. The next slide underlines that we have reshaped our portfolio to reinforce strengths while exiting areas of underperformance and/or lower strategic priority. Over the last 12 months, we've announced exits in a number of our smaller markets. This is one way that we expect to take out further costs alongside our continued focus on improving the internal efficiency of the bank. And by making savings, we can invest in the areas on the left that help us to drive growth. Before I move on, I want to mention SVB UK. Everyone knows that HSBC is an international bank. But we also have a long history of supporting innovative entrepreneurs. And the acquisition of SVB UK enabled us to build a bigger proposition that can help us to become known as the go to bank for innovation companies. It's encouraging that innovation banking had its best ever quarter for customer onboarding in the fourth quarter of 2023. I'm also encouraged by how many of those innovative companies want to take their capabilities cross border. The next slide sets out how we're investing in technology to make customer experiences better, sell process is more efficient and our cost of execution lower. I'm pleased to see more of our personal and corporate customers are mobile and digitally active. HSBC has traditionally grown by cross-selling products to our existing banking clients, but innovation also enables us to open up growth avenues that are beyond our traditional customer footprint. Zing is one such growth avenue because it offers cross-border payment capabilities, but critically it is targeted at non-HSBC customers. Our embedded finance joint venture announced with Tradeshift last year is another such growth avenue. It's still early days for both, but they will allow us to break outside of the existing business model. I will also briefly cover our final two pillars. There isn't a conversation I have with a client where the net zero transition doesn't come up. Our first net zero transition plan shows how we intend to finance and support the transition to net zero and collaborate globally to help enable change at scale. It will be a complex journey, but we have exactly the right geographic footprint where the need and opportunity are greatest. Finally, energize. Over the last four years, we've increased the pace of execution across the organization. The management team is confident about the business, but it's even more important that our colleagues are confident, because when they are, we stand a much greater chance of succeeding. So I'm pleased that our 2023 staff survey showed the number of colleagues seeing the positive impact of our strategy was up 11 percentage points from 2020 to 73%. And I'm also very excited by the number of quality new hires we've been able to bring into the organization over the last 12 months. It's also a vote of confidence in our strategy and the momentum we have built over the last four years. In summary, I will go back to what I said at the start. I'm really pleased with how we performed in 2023 and the contribution that our people made. We reported $30 billion of PBT for the first time and a mid-teens RoTE. There was good underlying growth in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation. Our profit before tax was $7.3 billion. We distributed $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of 2023. This included the best full-year dividend since 2008 and three share buybacks. And we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. We remain committed to cost discipline and we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue even in a lower rates environment. We're confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver mid-teens returns in 2024. With that, let me hand over to Noel for Q&A."

In particular, if the banking NII sensitivity for the next 100 basis points of trade cuts can be guided to us. The second one is around the gain, the implied improvement in the capital from the gain in Canadian operations. And that remains at around $10 billion of which $4 billion can be special dividend. So the $6 billion, have we decided on how much between capital distribution to shareholders and then business growth? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you Noel. Thanks Gurpreet. So we have not at this stage given guidance for full year 2025. I point you to the guidance we've given for full year 2024 of at least $41 billion in banking NII and mid-teens return on tangible equity. In terms of banking NII sensitivity, we do have a slide at the back end of the deck, which I can point you to, which shows for the further 100 basis point and for future years what's the impact. What I can point you to is number one, we continue to intend to increase subject to market conditions, but as of today to increase the structural hedge. Second the volume of the structural hedge. Second, we continue to intend to increase the weighted average life of the structural hedge, having now reached 2.8 years and with the intent to take it to about three years, both of which should give you a sense of how we're mitigating rate impacts into 2024 and 2025 from the structural hedging activity. With regards again on Canada, so $10 billion proceeds, $4 billion will be considered, well we committed to consider as a priority use for a special dividend. The residual $6 billion will constitute about 0.8%, 0.9% additional CET1, which may, which very likely will be at the Q1 outcome. We will continue looking at opportunities, but it remains our intent, subject to market conditions, our capital position, regulatory position, it remains our intent to continue a rolling series of share buybacks beyond this one."

        "text": "Hi. Good morning from London, good afternoon to yourselves. Two questions please. Firstly, I just want to clarify the messaging on the banking NII outlook. If I rewind 12 months ago, I think you gave guidance for greater than $36 billion of reported NII, but then this time a year ago you said you weren't seeking to move consensus, which at the time was actually higher, it was at $37. If I fast forward to today, you're guiding to greater than $41. If I look at consensus NII, I adjust the trading book funding costs, it looks like consensus banking NII is around $44. So are you seeking to rebase consensus banking NII or should we put greater emphasis on your greater than within that $41 target? So that's my first question. I just want to clarify that messaging. My second question is around the hedge. Thank you for the extra disclosure on the $478 billion nominal and the 2.8 years average life. Can you give us an idea of both the average yield on that book and also where it's currently rolling off that and what you're aiming to roll it back on at if you are extending the duration now? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "I think Georges will answer both of those."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Andrew. So obviously today we cannot see consensus banking NII and basically I'll use this opportunity to ask you collectively if you can start giving us your banking NII. So we can see the NII forecasts and then the funding costs of the Trading Book gets lumped together with the non-NII and it's to be fair difficult for us to unpack it. Although $44 billion does sound high if we try to do the math ourselves. But let me take a step back and just walk you through how we're thinking about NII and just bear with me for two minutes. But I think that explanation will probably help guide you. So we start from a Q4 10.7 billion banking NII. We would adjust then Q4 for the parts related to Argentina hyperinflation as well as the reclassification of the cash flow hedges between NII and non-NII. We'll adjust for the part that does not pertain to Q4. So that's a full year correction. And that's about an additional $0.5 billion you could use on the Q4 10.7 number. So that takes you to 11.2 adjusted quarterly run rates. Annualized taking into account day counts you get to 44.4. From that 44.4 remember you have to deduct the full year French NII, France retail NII, as well as three quarters from the Canada NII, which together combined come to about $1.3 billion. So $44.4 minus $1.3 takes you to just above $43 billion. That would be our starting position if you want, in terms of an annualization of a run rate, factoring in structural hedges, etcetera. Now from that $43 billion, there are various tailwinds and headwinds. We have the tailwind of reinvestment of all the structural hedges from lower rates into the current rate environment. We do have some tailwinds, probably cautious on H1, but tailwinds beyond H1 in terms of volume growth and loan growth. And we do have headwinds, including the rate cycle, if indeed we start seeing the decreases in the second half of the year. And we obviously have the headwinds, which we've observed specifically in Hong Kong around deposit migration to term deposits. Kind of baking all of that into account, we're getting to the guidance of at least $41 billion that we're comfortable sharing today. With regards to the structural hedge, we have shared with you volume. We have shared with you the weighted average life. And we have shared with you now banking NII sensitivity. We have not yet shared and we have not yet found the level of standard we would need to be able to share the yield. But what I can tell you about the yield is that both the yield of the maturing hedges being replaced at current rates, as well as the additional hedges we're doing with inverted curves are all baked into our at least $41 billion banking NII guidance."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "So if I could just add a couple of comments. One reason we're not giving a statement regarding consensus is, as Georges says, we think consensus is a mixture of updated thinking that has adjusted for some of these annualization effects of disposals and other things. And some consensus hasn't adjusted for that at the moment. So I think there's a little bit of apples and pears in today's consensus position. So what Georges is clearly trying to articulate for you is, take the Q4, adjust it for the known items, get to a new starting position of $43 billion, and he's underpinned that starting position of $43 billion with at least $41. Therefore, the range of modeling is going to be somewhere between $41 and $43, depending on the assumptions you might make on the headwinds and the tailwinds. And we think that given that lack of consistency on consensus, the uncertainty in the market, that's probably the best way to guide you on banking NII. There's a very clear repositioning of the starting position to get us back on an apples and apples basis. And then the other thing, no, that was it. That's what I wanted to say. Those two comments. Thank you."

      {
        "speaker": "Katherine Lei",
        "text": "Katherine Lee from JPMorgan. So I have two questions here. The first question I want to clarify, the mid-teen RoTE guidance is on normalized lot. That means that the RoTE, excluding Canada disposal game. So I want to clarify that because if that is the case in mid-teen RoTE, then if you look at the company compiler consensus, I think the RoTE is 17.4%. Then I just calculated on a very like top-down basis, excluding the disposal gain and consensus RoTE is roughly about mid-teens as well. But the thing is that I think that means that the HSBC guidance and consensus is quite in line in terms of normalized RoTE. But I think on NII, on cost, I think in the previous questions, I think there may be a bit of reset in expectation. And then I think cost, the 5% cost is a bit higher than where consensus was indicating. Then that means -- does it mean that you are quite optimistic on non-NII growth, i.e., fee growth or maybe you have a different view on asset quality and, hence, the ECL charges. I think this is the first part of the big question. The second part is on BoCom. May I know like what trigger the $3 billion impairment charges? And as China's yield is declining like they just announced a 25 basis point on 5-year LPL cuts in all those. Should we be expecting more impairments on the BoCom investment? So basically, I want to see if there is any onetime of events that trigger this impairment or if it is going to be a normalized part of the business. So I think in the statement, you clearly stated that they will have no impact on dividends and shareholders' return. I believe this is related to the $14 billion capital deduction, which you have already made on associate. I think that is primarily BoCom. But can you explain a bit of that mechanism? Because I think today's share price reaction is partly factoring in the kind of concern that if there is an ongoing impairment on BoCom, that will affect the company's ability to deliver shareholders' return. Yes."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Katherine. So Katherine, taking them in the order you said the first mid-teens RoTE is excluding notable items. Therefore, it is excluding the gain on Canada. So your calculation is correct. In terms of NII and cost, there's a couple of things to share. We recognize the cost assessment. In terms of banking NII, we have given the guidance here. Just point to -- I mentioned it in my earlier speech, but I just point you that our banking NII sensitivity has reduced more than -- by more than half from the full year 2022 due to, among other parameters, our structured lending activity. So therefore, the rate impact on our banking NII is reduced commensurately. Equally, we do have some anticipation of volume growth if and when rates start increasing, which is now planned for H2, and this is why we have some positive outlook for H2. If rate decrease volume could pick up, subject to economic conditions, etcetera. But that's the assessment we have made today. And then thirdly, on the non-rate sensitive earnings. I've called out transaction banking and went earlier. Between them, they constitute about 80% of our non-rate sensitive earnings. One has grown 5%, 23 to 22, and the other one has grown 7%. And therefore, we do feel there is momentum in both these areas for continued growth. And I didn't talk about the residual 20%, but in the residue 20% capital market activities, for instance, is included. And again, in a different rate environment, we have grounds to believe this can also pick up. So yes, we are comfortable with the momentum we have in the revenue. Can I point you on one thing about cost? We called it out 5% for the 2024 has a flow-through impact from inflation in 2023. 2023 experienced high inflation. There is some flow-through, some adjustments, including wage inflation, which we anticipate to do in 2024. Based on current outlook of inflation, that parameter is easing as we look forward beyond 2024 without giving you any guidance for 2025. The inflationary component flow through into 2025 does look like easing from where we stand today, looking at 2024 outlook for inflation. If I move on to your second question about BoCom. So this is a -- we do talk about the value-in-use model. It's following the Hong Kong accounting standards, international accounting standards. Without boring you with the accounting details, the ARNA has many pages, which we can point you to that explain it. It feeds into parameters all in the -- essentially, in the public domain including macro data, other factors, including analyst comments, feeds into the model. But the model is not highly intuitive, but the outcome is the outcome, and we've been consistently applying it for umpteenth quarters now and therefore, we'll apply for Q4. It is very difficult to predict what the model will give us in Q1. We will take into account the information we receive over the course of Q1, and we will run the model as we do every quarter and consistently apply the outcome. Finally, captive deduction. I think this is a very important point. Your math, Katherine is correct. There is about $14 billion sitting today in our regulatory capital deductions because they sit above our threshold. Therefore, you could legitimately assume that there is that much of buffer against any impairments we face in our financial holdings, BoCom being one of them. The other one is insurance. That's the two essentially. And therefore, you can legitimately assume that the compensation we would get from any hypothetical future impairment will be commensurate given the size of our threshold deductions at this stage. Yes."

I think you can probably get a sense that there's some reasonable confusion about what the message is for the 2024 baseline. If we work back from your kind of clean mid-teens ROE, you've given us some guidance on cost. You've given us some guidance on credit. It's kind of getting into a baseline revenue number of about $64 billion in consensus is $63.5 billion or thereabouts. Are you comfortable with that consensus number? Are you seeking to change that with this guide? So that is question number one. And question number 2 is, why the focus on banking NII versus total NII because it's going to be as rates come down a lot of moving parts on the trading book funding cost dynamic because, indeed, if I look at your annual report, you've actually got a benefit coming through in the USD bucket from rates falling in terms of the aggregate NII. So I guess why are you trying to distinguish between those two conceptually for us? Because again, it's creating a fair amount of confusion with investors."

Otherwise, I'll be giving you guidance on our full profitability. But we recognize your arithmetics. A couple of things just to highlight if you want to for your consideration. The first one is our guidance for banking NII is not $41 billion. It's at least $41 billion, factoring in elements of uncertainty that I called out earlier, that's for full year 2024. You do have the building blocks for cost and for ECL. And then the residual part, if you want, of our earnings story is the non-NII component, excluding the gains from Canada. And as I said earlier, about 80% of it is generated from transaction banking and wealth, both of which do have momentum, both of which are areas where we continue investing both in terms of digital capabilities and client servicing and in terms of net new invested assets. And we are excited about the potential of these two businesses, and we believe our meetings RoTE is not based on unreasonable growth in these areas. It's based on momentum growth in these areas. Maybe I can point you to our net new invested assets, $84 billion for the year, up from $80 billion last year, up from $64 billion the year before. So clearly, we're acquiring new assets. But equally, as you've seen, Asset Management, Private Banking grew double-digit percentage points. That's also partly due to the valuation because our AUM is also increasing because the underlying valuation is improving, which is, therefore, a generator of fees commensurately, subject to market conditions as we go forward."

We think it is much simpler to look at our overall rate sensitive earnings through banking NII lens. They kind of shift from one to the other, which is zero-sum game. So it moves from one to the other is reflective of business decisions as regards how much of our funding we would want to give to the trading book based on various parameters, including opportunities in the trading book as well as opportunities for loan growth. And we would think that it would be too noisy if we have to really manage both on a separate basis."

In relation to your guidance of 40 basis points, is there still a plausible downside to this guidance? Or does the 40 basis points encapsulate that plausible downside? And then secondly, on loan growth, I know you're cautious on loan growth in the first half of 2024. Do you expect growth to pick up in Half 2, but 2024 as a whole, can you just confirm that you expect net growth in the balance sheet? It sounds like you do because you earlier described volumes and a potential tailwind to NII. And could you narrow down how much lending we should expect for growth for this year? Thank you."

        "text": "Sure. Thank you, Benjamin. So our cost of risk of 40 basis points encapsulates everything we currently foresee in our balance sheet. We have not communicated a further plausible downside on the China commercial real estate portfolio booked in Hong Kong because we believe at this stage that, number one, we're well provisioned for this portfolio afterwards -- after the provisioning that's taken place last year. And number two, we also have less concerns going forwards on our residual exposure in that portfolio. I can point you to our exposure is now at $6.2 billion, that's down $3.1 billion from full year 2022. So therefore, we do not -- we have reduced level of concern. I can walk you through, if needed, the -- how well ECL positioning is in this portfolio but we're comfortable. No additional concerns than we caught out last year. On the loan growth, yes, our expectations is that as economic conditions continue improving and the interest rate environment becomes more supportive, we would expect to see loan growth. We continue to guide on a medium-term basis to mid-single-digit percentage points loan growth and balance sheet growth. It's very difficult to forecast what H2 will look like, but that is part of our projections."

We're not expecting significant growth in the balance sheet in the first half. If you start to see that kick in the second half, you're unlikely to see full year mid-single-digit growth in 2024. You're going to see a proportion of that start to kick in, in the second half of the year. And then you'll see it kicking in more strongly in 2025 and beyond. So I think in your modeling, you're probably looking at limited growth in the first half, growth starting to come back in the second half."

        "text": "Thanks, Noel. So Robert, we've added about 80 -- or north of $80 billion to our hedge this year in terms of bond notional a little bit more in terms of other derivative notional. And that's on top of $80 billion we've added over Q4 and starting in Q3 in 2022. So that should give you an idea of also what is the quantum we could reasonably do in 2024 if the market conditions remain supportive for the hedge. In terms of duration, I mean, the kind of -- the obvious one to call out is we can certainly hedge on our weighted average life for slightly longer currencies such as the pound, the U.S. dollar and some extent, the euro. We have an inability to hedge in any reasonable size or shape and this is due to structural market, our Hong Kong dollar exposure. So our Hong Kong dollar exposure hedge would remain much lower. And therefore, our exposure in Hong Kong dollar would remain more sensitive to the rate outlook compared to the other currencies. In terms of Canada sale, you could expect in Q1, subject to completion, which is now I believe -- which is now planned to be -- on track to be by the end of Q1. We would expect to see a jump of 1.2%, 1.3% in our CET1 ratio. The special dividend, which we're committed to consider would happen afterwards. Our best estimate is H1, but frankly, afterwards as soon as we can subject to all necessary approvals. And that will drop the CET1 by about 0.5, with a result in net of around 0.8 in our CET1 after the dividend. We will update you at the Q1 results about the special dividend considerations."

        "speaker": "Perlie Mong",
        "text": "Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple. I guess the first one is as -- just what can you do with cost in the falling rate environment because you've talked about management actions. I guess the reason I'm asking is because this year, I believe all in is about 7% year-on-year. And of course, it includes a lot of one-offs like levies in this quarter and SVB earlier in the year. But on the basis that it crept up from plus 2% year-on-year, which is, I think, the first we talked about the 2023 guidance to the end result being something like 6%, 7%. And just wondering what levers do you have in your sort of cost management action pocket to combat costs if revenue were to disappoint. So that's number one. And the second question is, I think we will talk a lot about what might happen to revenues in various rate environments. But -- and also just thank you for the disclosures on the structural hedge. But I guess stepping back a little bit from that. Just a couple of clarifications. So in a falling rate environment, how would you expect things like customer behavior to respond? So things like deposit mix shift like in Hong Kong. So I guess the mix shift towards term happened quite a lot faster in Hong Kong versus the U.K. on the way up and it's still ongoing from the disclosures today. So if rates were to turn, would you expect that flip back to be pretty quick? Or on a pretty high rate environment? Or do you still expect to make sure to continue? So I think you talked about things like capital markets might outperform in a falling rate environment. So I guess, on an underlying basis, just how do you see that because capital markets and loan growth, etcetera, I guess a lot of it is also to do with the underlying GDP as well. And there's still a lot of uncertainty sort of on the horizon. So even if rates were to come down, just how quickly do you think these benefits can come through?"

        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",

On costs, Georges, do you want to just do a quick analysis of reported costs 2023 versus 2022 target basis and then reported 2023 to 2024 target basis. And I might just add a few comments at the end of that on cost levers the way I look at it. But Georges?"

      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Good. Yes. Thanks. So on a reported basis, 2023 to 2022, we were down 1%. And so the growth against our target of 6% also is reflective of the fact that a lot of the restructuring costs we've taken in 2022 did not repeat. We've guided how the costs have increased from our initial 3% where we included severance into the 6%. Obviously, the last percent this quarter was unexpected. The rules for the FDIC special assessment came in November. The earlier draft rules we've seen in September indicated we would be incurring that cost in 2024 and 2025, but the rules that came in November had us to have to -- have a different accounting treatment and accelerate all that as did all other banks who were subject to the FDIC special assessment. So I just want to call it out that this one a particular event we called out. We -- as we look at going forward for 2024, we're looking at a 5% on a target basis growth. This is excluding the cost reduction we would get from exiting the French retail business and the Canada business. Between the two of them, we will be exiting on an annual basis and equivalent to $1 billion, just shy of that, which is around 3%. That would be a reduction in cost of 3%, but that is excluded from the way we're managing our target basis. Just explaining how we're coming up with this cost, and then Noel can talk you through the levers to manage our cost. So first, there is this flow-through inflation from 2023. There is some wage adjustments we need to take into account for 2024 based on the flow-through inflation from 2023. That component, we feel is easing and hopefully, and the outlook of inflation will ease as we go out of 2024 into the future. There is continued spend in technology and continued investment in some of the growth areas -- organic growth areas. That's particularly true in wealth. And those spending are partly offset by a number of cost management actions, some of which we have taken already such as the severance program, which will have a flow-through benefit into 2024, and other actions we're planning to take. Just before Noel talks to levers, we're looking at cost as in growth on a target basis in dollar numbers. We're not looking at our cost efficiency ratio basis. There may be fluctuation to our revenue, but frankly, in a year like 2023, our CER has dropped from 65% in 2022 to 48%. So we will tolerate some volatility on the CER as long as we're managing our cost in spend dollar basis. But..."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "Thank you. Thanks Georges. And I know this is an important topic, and let me reiterate upfront, we remain committed to cost discipline. The question is how are we achieving cost discipline? We obviously look for efficiencies in the existing organization. We invest in tech to drive efficiencies in our processing costs, and we're continuing to do that. We invest in simplification of the portfolio, closing down businesses organically, exiting costs organically. But we're also exiting costs through M&A. And in our target basis, we adjust for that. But I don't want you to lose sight. We have exited -- we'll be exiting $1 billion of cost in 2024 as a function of M&A decisions. Portfolio choices made for good strategic reasons. $300 million of that was the exit of our French retail business. It's a business that was losing money. So we've exited $300 million of costs by selling and it's going to be profit accretive because that business was a loss-making business. We've exited $800 million of costs in Canada through selling. We hope to by the end of Q1, not tempting fate. Why are we doing it? Because that business in our hands was probably valued at around 1 times book, and we were able to generate 2.5 times book as over 2.5 times book. We sold it because it was worth more to somebody else than to us. And we're redistributing the proceeds of that to our shareholders because we thought it was the right answer for our shareholders. So we do internally generated cost efficiency and externally generated cost efficiency for good strategic reasons, and we'll continue to pull those levers. Now the other thing is we are -- we do believe an organization like us with the growth opportunities we have, we should invest. And we made a decision last year on our original cost target of 3% to actually move it up to 4% because we were continuing to invest in tech. And in tech today as part of our overall cost base is now around 22%. When I took over four years ago, tech as a percent of our cost base was 16%. So we're trying to remain disciplined on cost and change the nature of the costs to be a much more strategic cost component in driving future enhancements for customer propositions and efficiencies. So that's sort of the thinking we have. You have our absolute commitment, both myself and Georges and the management teams. We will keep cost discipline. We'll invest and save at the same time. We have to acknowledge the flow-through of inflation. But the other component we made a decision on in 2023, given the very, very strong performance the business had, we thought it was right to go from 4% to 5% by topping up the variable pay pool by an extra percent. We thought that was the right decision for our people. So we think it's the right cost decision, but it has inflated our cost compared to our original target of 3%. But I think we had to do the right thing by our people on that. And then the final 1% taking us to the 6% number you talked about was unexpected. When we talked to you in Q3, we didn't expect that final 1% to come through for FDIC and bank levies. The FDIC is probably a timing issue. It was going to come through in 2024 or 2025, but it actually surprisingly came through in the final quarter of the year. So you've got our commitment will remain tight with high cost. There is now turn to revenues. And let me maybe again, decompose how we think about revenue growth outside of NII or interest income. Clearly, the great work that Georges and the team have done on hedging and further structural hedges we put in place and the extra duration is a mitigant to the downside. I look at the opportunity on the upside in two components. One, is our core USP of International Banking. We have within our franchise, clients who operate in more countries than we currently bank them, be they personal clients or corporate clients. We still have huge amounts of untapped opportunity to further penetrate our client base. And every time you saw in the revenue multipliers, we take a client to multiple jurisdictions, a revenue multiplier of 5 times domestic revenue in Wholesale Banking, 3 times domestic revenue in retail banking. That's an internal generated revenue opportunity, not dependent on GDP. That's in our hands. The second revenue opportunity you talked about in your analysis is countercyclical. And I do believe -- I've been around 37 years, so I've seen some cycles. And I do believe lower inflation, leads to lower interest rates, lower interest rates lead to a pickup in economic activity normally for the lag effect. And I do believe that pickup will have a positive impact on capital market activity in our Global Banking and Markets business. I think it will have a big and positive impact on demand for corporate lending and personal lending in our wholesale and retail business, lag effect, as I've talked about. And thirdly, I think consumers will start to shift out of cash into invested assets, and that's a huge opportunity for our wealth business. And you've seen our track record on our ability to attract net new invested assets over the last three years, $84 billion, $80 billion, $64 billion. That's where we're very focused and a lot of our investment is going. Now it's for us, the management team to deliver on that. So we know we got to deliver on tight costs and cost discipline, and we've got to deliver on revenue diversification. My final comment on this is I'm grateful that we've had four years of transformation because we now are through the majority of that transformation focus, majority, and we're now focused on that growth opportunity. And we're in a fortunate position that all of the hard work over the last four years has given us that platform for growth. Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you very much. Hi, Noel, hi Georges. I have two broad questions. The first one is kind of split into two. I've got a second question around GB&M, sorry, capital return. First broad question, it's around fee income. The first part of it is, I'm a bit confused by your banking NII sensitivity. You can see on Slide 34, $3.4 billion on 100 basis points rate cap. But the majority of that comes from nonbanking -- sorry, non-NII. So can you help me there because I just don't understand that? I thought banking NII kind of stripped out the trading funding cost. So whatever color you can give us there? And the related question is that your outlook for fee income, more broadly, I get your messaging around wealth. Transaction banking is kind of demonstrating positive momentum. But can I ask you about the other big chunk of fee income, which is GB&M. And there's various moving parts there. I suspect that you think cyclically, it's not earning its full amount. But I also do note that Global FX has kind of been decent for a while. So can you give us your view on to what extent that business is operating at, below or ahead of kind of capacity? That was a kind of broad two-pronged question on fee income, believe it or not. The second question was around your distribution, your approach to distribution that you're potentially phasing down the barrel of slower volume growth in 2024. And I'm interested in you're arguably then going to be more capital generative this year on still decent profits, and not a lot of balance sheet growth. How do you approach that? Do you kind of give us additional buybacks through the course of this year? Or do you kind of hold that powder dry for a bigger rebound in 2025, say? Thank you very much."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure. Aman, so what historically we've been giving you is NII sensitivity. But there is a big component that is rate sensitive in our earnings, which doesn't sit in NII. It sits in non-NII under funding cost of the trading book. And what we've been doing, and hopefully, that slide was meant to clarify it, but I'm assuming now we have to take probably more offline with you to go through it. What we've been doing is showing the sensitivity of both the NII to rates as well as the sensitivity of the funding cost of trading book to rate. And then giving you the full sensitivity of banking NII to rate because that would be a better representation of how sensitive our earnings are to rate, and it will take away the noise that is created by ongoing commercial decisions on how much we've -- how much funds we provide the trading activity or take away from the trading activity in year. It kind of cleanses that information out because it's just giving you the total that is relevant for our overall earnings. That sensitivity has reduced by more than half over the year in part at least for 30%, 40% of it due to our structural hedging activity. With regards the fee income, you mentioned FX having a good and decent income. A couple of things about GB&M to call out. First, the PBT of GB&M was more than 20% or 25% higher year-on-year. So clearly, a business that increases PBT. Its return on tangible equity has exceeded our cost of capital. It's something that has been not achieved for many years. It's above 12%. And to be also fair to GB&M, it's return tangible equity only increased by about 10% because there are some corporate center related adjustments, which is affected them. Otherwise, the return on tangible equity could have followed the trend of PBT growth because their RWAs were down, and they could have seen close to 20%. And therefore, well above their cost of equity. So we're comfortable with how the business is continue to transform itself, focusing on their strength and adjusting their footprint, and that momentum continues. In terms of distribution, well, first, it remains our ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks as long as our capital supports it and the outlook for capital does support it, but this remains subject to ongoing macroeconomic developments and regulatory approvals, etcetera. And one thing to call out with regards our bolt-on acquisitions is when we look at an acquisition, obviously, the first parameter is making sure it's a strategic and accelerating growth area that we strategically want to grow. But the second parameter that we also use equally is that it is accretive compared to a share buyback. So we're making sure that when we go for a bolt-on acquisition, the investments is more accretive than the investment in buying our own shares. And this is -- this would be a disciplined measure to make sure we're doing M&A that is both strategic and accretive. And finally, in terms of other parts of the distribution, 50% dividend payout ratio for 2024, which we reaffirmed. And then if you want to give a -- if you want to have a benchmark on where we would operate on a target basis, our CET1 ratio, it will be in the 14 to 14.5 range, which we reiterate, but we recognize we may not meet that target because we may be well above it for a few quarters in particular, thanks to Canada, but also to our own capital generation."

But I think it's fair to say there's going to be excess of our CET1 over our target range more in the near term because probably the capacity of the market to take the volume of buybacks that could be done."

Clearly, GB&M has focused itself and the kind of the message is that in the areas where they're focusing strategically, yes. In the areas where they have exited or are downsizing, then this would be nonstrategic areas that they will continue doing downsizing."

Really pleased we were able to reward our loyal shareholders with $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect to 2023. This included the best full year dividend since 2008 and three share buybacks. We still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. And we are committed to cost discipline. I want you in no doubt on that. We expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue, and we're very focused on it because we've come out of that 4-year transformation phase with a very strong focus on growth. We continue to target a mid-teens RoTE in 2024. And I just want to say thank you for joining us. And Neil, the team are available should you need them. I hope to see many of you here in Hong Kong in April when we hold our inaugural Global Investment Summit. Looking forward to being back here at the end of March and for the Investment Summit in early April. Thank you all very much."

    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the analyst and investor webinar on the 2024 first quarter results for HSBC Holdings plc. For your information, this webinar is being recorded. We are now ready to start the webinar, so I will hand over to Mark Tucker, Group Chairman.\nMark Tucker: Good morning to those of you in London, and good afternoon to those of you in Hong Kong. I'm joining you today from London and have alongside me know enjoy. I'll be making some short opening remarks before handing over to Noel. As you may have already seen, we have announced today that Noel has informed the Board of his intention to retire from the bank after nearly 5 years in the law. The Board and I would like to pay tribute to Noel's exceptional [indiscernible] As Group Chief Executive, he drags both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler, more focused business through the disposal of assets in the U.S., France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver an improved performance, achieving record profits last year and create a platform for future growth and development. Now, you'll hear from him in a second, has decided it's the right time to step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments. As you would expect, the Board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already have started a robust and rigorous process to find our next group Chief Executive. This process will look at both internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased that now has agreed to remain in his role while this process takes place, ensuring a smooth and orderly transition. And on a personal note, I'd like to thank Noel for his unwavering commitment and dedication to HSBC, which he joined 37 years ago. Now, it's been a pleasure and privilege to work with and alongside you.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you, Mark. I'm very grateful for your support, guidance, friendship and partnership. I'm proud of what my HSBC colleagues and I have achieved together over the past 5 years. Over that period, we have hit some significant milestones, record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade and the highest dividend since 2008. As Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we have built a strong platform for the bank's next phase of development and growth. That's why I feel this is the right time to step back to find a better balance between my personal and business commitments with the intention going forward after a break of pursuing a portfolio career. When I reflect back on the last 37 years, I have held intensive leadership roles, particularly since I took over the U.K. Commercial Bank in October of 2008. After 16 years of intensive leadership, I'm ready for a change. But it's also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It's an ideal time to bring in new leadership. The Board has now started a process to find my successor, and I'm very happy to continue in my role as that process takes place. Rest assured, I will be working hard to ensure a smooth and orderly transition for my successor and to keep the momentum going in this business, as you have seen in Q1. Until then, it's business as usual. So, let's now turn to our Q1 results, which have showed continued progress. We had a good first quarter. Reported profit before tax was $12.7 billion. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion. Our return on tangible equity was 16.4%, excluding notable items. I'm also pleased with the further capital distributions of $8.8 billion, which brings the total amount of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last 15 months to almost $28 billion. And we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance for 2024. I will now hand over to George to take you through the numbers.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Noel. I'd like to open by paying tribute to the enormous contribution Noel has made to the bank. I've greatly enjoyed working alongside him. And I know everyone at the bank has appreciated this strong and effective leadership. I'm also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since my appointment as CFO, 15 months ago. The Board has announced the process to find a successor, and I know Non and I will continue to remain very focused on the job at hand until that process has been completed. Turning now to the numbers. Reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion was down $0.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, down $0.4 billion on last year's first quarter. On an annualized basis, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 26.1% or 16.4%, excluding notable items. We completed the $2 billion share buyback announced in February in 2 months. This means that since the end of 2022, we have bought back 6% of our outstanding shares. And the trend of strong shareholder distributions continues this quarter. We have announced, as Noel said, a further $8.8 billion of distributions consisting of first interim dividend for '24 of $0.10 per share. The special dividend of $0.21 per share from the Canada sale proceeds and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we plan to begin right after the AGM and complete within 3 months. Finally, we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items and our commitment to limit cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. So, on the next slide, reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion included $4.8 billion gain on the sale of Canada, partly offset by the $1.1 billion impairment on the classification of Argentina as held for sale. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion with revenue growth offset primarily by higher costs and ECLs. Revenue of $20.8 billion was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue was $17 billion, which was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year, with growth in banking NII, partly offset by lower fee and other income. Within that, we saw high single-digit growth in multi-jurisdictional revenue in the first quarter, which underlines the value of our global network. Banking NII of $11.3 billion was up $0.6 billion on the fourth quarter on the reported FX basis, mainly driven by Argentina banking NII as well as the nonrecurrence of the cash flow hedge reclassification in the last quarter. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, a few things to keep in mind. First, our Q1 banking NII included $0.3 billion from Canada, which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion of the sale in March this year. Second, first quarter banking NII also included $0.5 billion from Argentina. This contribution will continue to be highly volatile until the sale is completed, which we expect to be within the next 12 months. Please, therefore, do not extrapolate the $0.5 billion run rate for the remainder of the year. Our banking NII guidance assumes a contribution of around $1 billion in full year '24 for Argentina, which is in line with full year 2023. Third, the banking NII outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our full year results in February. The Hong Kong time deposit mix remained stable as a percentage of customer deposits in the quarter and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates. However, it is still early in the year, and these things can change. So, we are maintaining our 2024 banking NII guidance of at least $41 billion. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was down by 9%, primarily due to the normalization of FX revenues compared to a very strong foreign exchange performance in the first quarter of last year, which benefited from higher market volatility. Fees from Global Payment Solutions had another good quarter, up by 6%. Wealth is another growth area that had a very good quarter, up by 14% on the same period last year as our investment continued to drive improved results. Private Banking was a standout performer, mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia, but growth in wealth has been broad-based. To illustrate this, we acquired around 135,000 new-to-bank retail wealth customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. Approximately 60% of these were nonresidents attracted by our service and product capabilities in Hong Kong. Building on previous quarters, we attracted $27 billion of net new invested assets, of which $19 billion were in Asia. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.8 billion, up from $0.4 billion in the first quarter of last year. On credit, expected credit losses were $0.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 30 basis points of average loans. These were primarily Stage 3 charges across retail and wholesale. There was a $54 million charge related to our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. While challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more benign ECL contribution from it than last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue monitoring developments closely. And we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around 40 basis points of average loans, recognizing the overall uncertainty from the flow-through effect of higher rates on the economy. Next, we are on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. This quarter's year-on-year cost growth was impacted by 3 items. First, we chose to face the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. This accounted for 2 percentage points of cost growth this quarter. We do not currently expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly different to 2023. So, the accrual will be lower over the next 3 quarters than it was in the same period last year. Second, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to 1 percentage point of cost growth this quarter as we only acquired SBB U.K. in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide you with a fuller update on that business at the half year, but I'm pleased that it has good momentum. In the U.K., we onboarded 183 new-to-bank innovation banking client groups in the quarter, the best quarter since acquisition. Finally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank Finland levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost discipline, and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis, inclusive of all the above items. On lending and deposits. There was good loan growth in the U.K., the Middle East, Mexico and Asia, excluding Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remains subdued, largely due to the high interest rate differential with Mainland China. Overall, we continue to expect mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium to long term, but we expect demand to remain subdued in the near term. Deposits were down 2%. This was due to a range of factors, including seasonality, the switch from time deposits to wealth products in Hong Kong and our deliberate choice to forsake some highly price-sensitive deposits. Next, our CET 1 ratio was 15.2%, up 40 basis points on the fourth quarter. Organic capital generation and the gain from the sale of the Canadian business enabled us to announce $8.8 billion of capital distributions this quarter. This includes a share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have an impact of around 40 basis points on our CET1 ratio in the second quarter. For modeling purposes, please note that the $5.8 billion of dividends announced today as well as the $5.9 billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full year results in February will both be reflected in TNAV in the second quarter. At closing of the sale of HSBC Argentina, which is expected within 12 months, we will also recognize $4.9 billion of foreign exchange reserve recycling losses subject to any movement in this reserve up until completion. These losses have already been accumulated in capital over the previous years. Therefore, recognition in the P&L will have no impact on CET1 nor on TNAV. Finally, looking forward to the rest of the year, our good first quarter puts us on track and we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance. A mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items, a banking NII of at least $41 billion, ECLs of around 40 basis points cost growth limited to around 5% on a target basis and a 50% dividend payout ratio. And with that, Louis, can we please go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Joseph Dickerson at Jefferies.\nJoseph Dickerson: Congrats, Noel on a great tenure at the bank and well done for the ROE and the capital return. I guess, just in terms of my question, the PD migration in Hong Kong, if you go back to the way you were computing it previously actually looks like it improved quarter-on-quarter and certainly under the new definition, has stabilized. I think it's Slide 17, if I'm not mistaken, in the presentation. Is that a little bit better than where your expectations were a few months ago? I know when I was in Hong Kong recently, it sounded like things were starting to stabilize, but is that better than where you were thinking a few months ago? And then secondly, on the buybacks, is the $3 billion number due more to the calendar effect? Or are you looking to kind of boost the run rate there from the $2 billion in the quarter?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Joseph. So, first, on the time deposit reclassification, we have actually reclassified some private bank term deposits to time deposits. This is due to the observation of their behavior and the recognition that they better classify this time deposits. This rebases the number. But as you could see from the 2 choices we have, it does not affect the trend. So, therefore, the trend that we've seen under both classifications is the same, and we've seen the first quarter stable quarter-on-quarter. It's too early to call it a peak, but we've always expected migration this year to be slower than what we've seen last year. And this just confirms the trend change from what we've seen in full year 2023. As regards to your buyback question, so the short answer is, yes, this is indeed due to calendar effects. We just completed a \u20ac2 billion buyback in 2 months. That's about $1 billion a month. That is the fastest run rate we've done in terms of share buybacks ever. We are now announcing a \u20ac3 billion buyback, which we intend to to do over the next 3 months, starting after AGM. We will see how the run rate goes, it will remain at the $1 billion run rate. We will see how it will go. As regards any future amount of buyback or whether we're doing a buyback, one, it remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share buyback. And, second, we will decide on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on our capital outlook, the loan growth outlook and other parameters as and when every quarter.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question today comes from Raul Sinha at JPMorgan.\nRaul Sinha: Maybe two from me as well. Just doing, George, on this point on distribution and looking at the sort of moving parts for capital, one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the growth in RWAs. The \u20ac7 billion of increase driven by asset quality trends. I think you're calling out is predominantly in Asia. What should we think about the sort of outlook for RWA growth from here even if loan build is muted, just to get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in content terms for distributions? And I guess the second question to Noel, just maybe a question for your broader thoughts, no. The 5 years proceeding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC, but I guess, for a lot of people given in your markets given the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you exited Canada, you announced Argentina. You're in the process of exiting quite a few smaller markets. Return on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens. You're buying back stock at $3 billion a quarter, you've got a special dividend as well. I guess what I'm really interested in is from here onwards, what do you think is left to do for the group to kind of progress?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Raul. I'll start with your first question first. So, on RWA outlook. So the RWA growth, we called on a quarter-on-quarter basis, $24 billion. First, about 40% of it related to lending and other asset growth. And as you can see from our lending book, we've grown our lending book by \u20ac5 billion. There's a number of areas of growth that contributed to around 40% of it, $9 billion. Then we've had a $5 billion market tristRWA growth. This is due to a pickup in NSS activity against a subdued 4Q, and it's more in line with their activity levels in the first 3 quarters of the year, if you want. And this is the normalization of the market's activity. And then there is $7 billion, which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, first, it is a continuous exercise. We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis. We have recognized across a number of geographies and a number of sectors, certain names, which we've decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe. You will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ECL. And that's mainly because for many of these customers, their balance sheet remains strong. So, we're comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore, there is no ECL implication from this downgrade. But just closing the loop, this RWA downgrade, you will see some of it materialize in our Stage 3 loans, where we increased our Stage 3 loans by about $2 billion, and that's exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality. With regards to how we look forward, we are very comfortable where we are today. Our credit metrics remain solid. As I say, the balance sheet of our customers remains strong for a number of them for at least the exposure that is collateralized. We're very comfortable with the level of collateralization and the LTV. And therefore, we do not foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking. We will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always do. Noel?\nNoel Quinn: Thank you. It has certainly been an extraordinary 5 years, I should say, not just for HSBC, but for the world. And I'm really pleased and grateful I want to pay tribute to the team for the way they've collectively navigated that. And during that whole process, the external environment executed on a complex but absolutely critical transformation plan over the past 5 years. And the outcome of that hard work is evident in the financial performance last year and the financial performance in Q1. I also want to say thanks to Mark, with such volatility in an external environment. Any CEO needs the support of their chair, their advice, their guidance, and I've had that all the way through and have had the support from the Board all the way through in navigating what has been a very complex external environment. But the team, the Board, Mark, collectively, we've done a good job of navigating it. Now, if I look forward, I'm not going to give to do list to my successor because that is not the fair thing to do to anyone. But I will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very much focused on. And I'm focused on for as long as I'm still CEO, and that is continuing the momentum. You don't work as hard as we worked for the past 5 years and then take the eye off the ball at this moment in time. So, I'm very focused on a smooth, orderly transition. I'm very focused on continued execution of the strategy. I want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy. We have exited a lot of businesses, a lot of RWAs over the past 5 years. The one thing we've protected whilst doing that is the international core of HSBC. The countries we remain in, the businesses we remain in are fundamentally now focused on the international nature and essence of HSBC, and we will continue to do that. Our key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are sustainable and repeatable whilst also taking advantage of the growth opportunities as they emerge in a world that becomes more stable and there are inherent in our customer franchise. Therefore, we're very focused on continuing the development of wealth, our transaction banking capabilities, our global wholesale banking capabilities and then being ready for when corporate loan demand picks up, we can take advantage of that to couple good returns with sustainable growth. And I think you've seen evidence of that in these results. Hong Kong is subdued at the moment, but we understand why with the rate differential in China. But if you look at the rest of the world, as George said, there's balance sheet growth in Wholesale Banking, in the rest of Asia, in the Middle East, in U.K., in Europe. We're seeing good growth elsewhere. So, it's about focus, momentum, continuing to couple good returns with good growth.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question today comes from Jeremy Hugh at CICC.\nJeremy Hugh: So, the first question is on deposits. We're glad to see that cat migration in Hong Kong is slowing down, but if not stabilized at this level. But on the other hand, I think the bank has seen some deposit outflow in Q1, while your Hong Kong local peers still see some deposit growth. So, I'm wondering if there is a strategic trade-off between the deposit growth and the cost for you at this stage? And how do you see that trend in the rest of the year? The second question is on the structural hedge. So, I'm wondering if this quarter, you could share with us some breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the reinvestment of the structural hedge? And if there is any run rate that we can refer to?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Jeremy. So, on your first question about deposits in Hong Kong. So, if you remember at Q4, our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. What we've seen in Q1 this year is a decrease of about $16 billion. Therefore, you can see seasonality playing across the 2 quarters, and therefore, is broadly stable across the 2 quarters. What happened though is, some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some deposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. And when you look at Q1, while you see the deposit outflows, you also can see that $19 billion of our net new invested assets were in Asia. Therefore, a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated into wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4 and explains if you want the seasonality of this deposit. Second, look, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and viable franchise. We continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail and wholesale customers. We cherish this. We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. And throughout the last 6 quarters, you've seen how our deposit base has been very stable with our deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers. Therefore, I won't comment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers. If I move on to your second question about the structural hedge. So, first, you would have noticed that we increased this quarter, the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 million, with the average weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of 3 years. Second, we commit at this stage to continue our structural hedging activity. Obviously, this will remain subject to market conditions, but we will continue the trend that we put in Q1 based on current market outlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind toward banking NII. And this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted as you know, and you can do the math. But equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates. And this reinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into banking NII. Between the 2 of those effects, the structural hedge activity for the full year 2024 would remain a net tailwind to our banking NII. We have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind. We're looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space. But that tailwind has been factored into our guidance of at least $41 billion bank NII and obviously, factored into our return on tangible equity mid-teens guidance.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Jason Napier at UBS.\nJason Napier: First of all, just to echo the best wishes, Noel, for the next chapter of your career and private life, I think, a well-earned rebalancing. George, I just wondered whether you talk a little bit within the context of higher for longer, you've referenced subdued loan demand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates. And I just wonder whether one of your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue. So, I wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether that's a material part of the plan? And sort of what do you think that means for revenue sort of evolution in the next few quarters? I think I certainly was somewhat surprised that we didn't see an upgrade to banking NII guidance this quarter. I know you don't rebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that Higher for longer has on asset mix and then on credit demand. And then secondly, wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there's a part of the business that's quite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now 20% in in a short space of time. But I just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. Is that the strategy delivering the sort of net new money flows? Or is there an element of sort of market volume there that we should be a little bit careful about?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Jason. So, first on Banking NII, we recognize there are kind of a couple of encouraging developments. The first one is the higher for longer on the rate side that would look like more favorable than when we discussed last in February. And, the second one we just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix, specifically in Hong Kong, where we've seen term deposits remain stable for this quarter. So, we recognize these tailwinds to our banking NII, but we also recognize quite early in the year, and these factors can still change. So this is why we didn't change our guidance. And as you said, Jason, I don't think you should expect us to update our guidance every quarter. We would reconsider this every quarter. But for this quarter, we're just sticking with our at least $41 billion. In terms of the wealth performance, so recognize mid-teens percentage growth in wealth, 34% for our private bank. I would say a couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that we've already said it's a focused strategic area. We are investing in this area. Big part of our investments goes towards this area, and we're very pleased to see the results of our investments generate revenue fairly quickly. You can see that through net new invested assets growth. You can see that through our CSM, new business CSM growth in insurance as well as in the actual revenue performance. This being said, I would just caution you not to annualize the numbers you're seeing because Q1 2023 had somewhat subdued January in it when China and Hong Kong were still closed. So, therefore, you've seen more pickup in activity in the Q1 '23 at the back end of it, whereas we had a full proper Q1 '24. So, there is an element of not annualizing the performance, but expecting that performance to continue growing. I just realized I didn't touch on your asset mix question of the first question. Look, we do not foresee a material change in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year, the main growth take place in mortgages and recognizing mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in the U.K. and Hong Kong, and the margins have been quite tight. As we start seeing pickup in wholesale demand, as we start peeing pickup in unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that those will drive higher margins than if you want what we see in mortgages. And our numbers in Q1 did show that this pickup definitely is there in areas of Asia, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, the U.K., et cetera. And the next in line for that pickup will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some stage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Perlie Mong from KBW.\nPerlie Mong: Can I just dig a little bit further into Jason's question just now on higher for longer. So, I know you probably don't like to comment on longer-term NII. But I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, which is how are you thinking about the trajectory going from here because it sounds to me that deposit migration is probably, well, stabilized a lot. And I would have thought any longer pricing that hasn't already come through will come through in the next few months. And I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, you can probably build more hedges at better rates as well, et cetera. And there's obviously a tailwind as you mentioned in this year already. So, how does that inform your thinking on your medium-term RoTE? So I guess that's the first question. And the second question, again, on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit. So, again, I guess just noting your point that Hong Kong might be a mix in line to pick up. But I guess, overall, the emerging market is probably not benefiting in terms of activity level and in terms of capital inflows from the higher U.S. rates. So, how does that impact, I guess, trading activities and capital flows, et cetera, just how are you thinking about the flip side of hirer longer?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Perlie. So first, look, yes, we recognize higher for longer is definitely a tailwind or a reduction of a headwind we've forecast in our banking NII. And as I said, there has been a number of manifestation of tailwinds now compared to when we last spoke in February. But equally, it is early in the year. And as you've seen, these things do change. And, therefore, want to beccon in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing parameters. We will update some longer than what we're updating but not at this quarter, barely. So, do expect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future. I would say the one parameter, just to keep in mind, as you start planning for '25 is take Argentina out because, obviously, subject to the sale completing, which we expect to complete in the next 12 months, that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from our banking NII. That's the most kind of predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025. In terms of the broader activity level, first, if you look at the wealth performance, it just demonstrates how wealth remains very resilient. And that's particularly true in Hong Kong, but very much so across Asia. Second, when you look at our transaction banking activities, apart from foreign exchange, which has an idiosyncrasy related to Q1 '23 with a very high volatility has performed across the various areas of its fee earning activities. And then our activity is very much benefiting from cross-border trends. If you look at some of the investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra region in Asia between China and ASEAN between India and ASEAN, between India and the west, et cetera, all of those trends are growing. I mean the numbers are staggering in some cases. And these are the activities that our business is operating on. So, therefore, while recognizing that there will be some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels, there is still a very strong underlying network activity, which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in wholesale transaction banking, anyway.\nPerlie Mong: On that, it's just I've also noticed that China exports volumes have been going up, but value has been coming down. And that is in part because of various things. FX is be part of it but also government subsidies. How does that affect your, I guess, your profitability in the region, volumes going up, the value is going down?\nGeorges Elhedery: Perlie, if I can just give you an indication. What we are seeing at the moment is a very strong level of activity of China corporates expanding across the rest of Asia. So, our outbound activity from Mainland China to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase in activity over the past 12 months. We've seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this year. So, a lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down. But what I would say is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up at quite a pace a very significant pace. We're very well placed to capture that outflow, and we are capturing that outflow. And our business in Mainland China performed well last year. It's performing well again in the first quarter of this year and its outbound activity is performing extremely well. So, we'll give more updates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that. And that is why actually I think the rest of Asia is performing well on balance sheet because a lot of it is being fed by good intra-Asia activity and outbound from Mainland China.\nOperator: Next question today comes from Katherine Lai at JPMorgan.\nKatherine Lei: I have three questions, three small questions, actually. The first one is on noninterest income. I look at the breakdown of noninterest income. It seems like wealth is doing quite well. But on Transaction Banking, there is some weakness, I think it's down 9% Y-o-Y. Can we know what is the reason? And how should we triangulate this to the full year? What are the drivers to that? So this is the first one. The second one is on Hong Kong. With Hong Kong relaxing LTV ratios, I think basically, not only they would be they relax the the purchase requirements and the stability requirements on residential properties. So, I think that there is a significant jump in transaction. So, I was thinking that this should be positive to mortgage at least, and then we are a big mortgage providers in Hong Kong. So, will that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth, particularly related to Hong Kong? Second one. And then the last one, I think, is on cost. If I look at the first quarter, I think cost is up 8%, including levy. How should I look at this? And then are we on track to the 5% cost growth this year?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Katherine. I'll take question 1 and 3, and I'll hand over to Noel to address your second question about the outlook for Hong Kong. So, first on non-NII. Wealth has performed well. Transaction banking weakness is specifically due to foreign exchange. That's driving the whole weakness. And the reason, as I called it out earlier, the reason is that foreign exchange had a record strong quarter 1 '23 on the back of heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis. So, therefore, we're doing a comparison to a record quarter, and it will show that drop. But if you look at the number itself, and the revenue itself for foreign exchange, it is back to normalized levels. So, there is nothing to worry about here. It's on the contrary back to normalized levels, and we continue to expect some cyclicality in that space, while we continue expecting growth in the other areas of transaction banking. So, I wouldn't read more than that into it, and we remain very confident that the investment we're putting both in wealth and transaction banking and in the technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain strategic focus and bearing results as we look into future quarters and years. On your third question about cost. So, first, I just want to reiterate, it is a clear priority for us to maintain cost discipline, okay? And we are very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5%. We will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis. We're confident about it. And we're actually on track to do so. And the reason why we're kind of on track to do so yet, we showed a 7% quarter 1 growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic items related to the quarter, which are not repeated in future quarters or some of them will reverse in future quarters. I'll just call the 3 of them out that matter. First, there was a 2% accrual of the performance-related pay where we decided to phase that accrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher performance-related pay accrual in Q1, hence, the 2% contribution towards the 7%, but it will contribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a full year basis, we are not accruing to a significantly different number than the full year '23 performance-related pay. Second, there was 1% contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter because last year's first quarter, we only acquired SBB in the middle of March, which means we practically didn't have it in the first quarter last year, and that's a base effect. And then third, we had the one-offs or the expected nonrecurrence of the FDIC special assessment additional charge this quarter as well as the bank of in levy. Bank of Finland levy is a new charge, which used to be an interest expense as an NII and now it's moved to operations expense as in cost. And between the 2 of them, they contributed to 1%. So, if you adjust for those and you bake them in, we're still and remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year or circa 5% on a full year basis. On your second question, I'll hand over to Noel.\nNoel Quinn: Katherine, I was in Hong Kong recently and spoke to a number of the market participants there and the developers. And I think firstly, I think the change to the stamp duty arrangements in Hong Kong in March in the budget was very well received, and it's had a positive impact on the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong market residential sales. It was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month. That will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions of many of those developers. We have to wait and see how that stabilizes because undoubtedly, there was an element of catch up in that first month because people were anticipating some change. Therefore, there was low activity in the preceding months. And then we got to see how that stabilizes. But I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance liquidity within the market. It will enhance activity in the mortgage market. But I think it's too early to call a trend at the moment. I think we need to see how Q2 stabilizes following those changes, but a very helpful intervention.\nOperator: We have time for one last question today and that comes from Andrew Coombs at Citigroup.\nAndrew Coombs: Just to commend [indiscernible] HSBC and two questions please, and firstly on the UK NIMs has been improved second consecutive quarter in other six basis points so performing some of the domestic peers, I can see your loans in deposit is looking very flat in the entity. Can you just comment on what you are seeing in terms of positive migration, mortage refi and what's driving that NIM improvement and how sustainable NIM improvement is going forward as well? And second, allocation in Argentina, 2.5 in Q1, guiding to 1 billion based on last year's experience. Assuming what your [indiscernible] a step down to 2 billion for the quarter for the remaining of the year given that you don't expect that transaction to necessarily close until 12 months time? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andrew. So the UK NIM was up 6 basis points, indeed, essentially benefited from some idiosyncrasies of structural hedges and timing of structural hedge maturities and reinvestments. So, if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of plus or minus 10 basis points. I would say U.K. NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple of quarters. And we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. And you will, therefore, add to that broadly flat, some structural hedge due increases, which will drive you within this plus or minus 10 basis point range. As regards our loans and deposits have been stable. Again, the U.K. economy has been resilient, we're very optimistic about the outlook for the U.K., specifically around inflation and employment. It remains a very important customer franchise for us. It remains a very important market for us, and we continue gaining market share. I mean, we continue gaining market share in mortgages with a 10% new business market share when our back book now market share has moved or our kind of overall portfolio market shares moved from 7% to 8%. We are a 25% market share in SME lending. And obviously, we continue investing in this business. You can look at the ring-fenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment growth for their infants bank within our overall circa 5% cost growth. So, all this demonstrates the confidence we have in our business in the U.K., our client activity in the U.K. and the outlook for the U.K. If I move to Argentina, I wish I could give you a trend for Argentina, then the way it works is the numbers balloon with hyperinflation, and then they kind of they shrink with devaluation, and it depends how they manifest themselves over month-over-month. Q4 last year has seen hyperinflation to some level, but they have seen a massive devaluation. If you recall, in December, we've seen more than 50% currency devaluation. That's contributed to a disinflation of the amount that Banking Argentina brought to Q4. And then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We've seen 6% devaluation only, but we've seen 54% inflation, and that will just inflate the numbers. So, it will be volatile quarter-on-quarter. And our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it averaged out over the last year, which is around \u20ac1 billion. Now just looking at the overall Argentina, if you take in the nonbanking NII, you take in the cost base, et cetera, last year's Argentina contribution to our PBT was $0.2 billion. Just to put it in perspective, this is about $0.01 earnings per share or 0.5% dividend per share. Therefore, I think as you look at the full year '24, that's the quantum that Argentina volatility will create. So, it should not distract you from the way you're forecasting the bank's outcomes.\nAndrew Coombs: I guess just to follow up on this. In a scenario whereby you didn't have any devaluation of peso. Inflation was a more moderate normal amount? And what would the NII contribution be under that more kind of BAU scenario a quarter for Argentina?\nGeorges Elhedery: Look, again, it's a difficult one to say. But if you just do the arithmetic of our \u20ac1 billion expected for the full year, of which already \u20ac0.5 billion has manifested in the first quarter, a smooth out outcome would be the other $0.5 billion phased out evenly over three quarters. But that's a highly volatile number. So, I wouldn't use it as a for [indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That ends today's webinar.

I'll be making some short opening remarks before handing over to Noel. As you may have already seen, we have announced today that Noel has informed the Board of his intention to retire from the bank after nearly 5 years in the law. The Board and I would like to pay tribute to Noel's exceptional [indiscernible] As Group Chief Executive, he drags both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler, more focused business through the disposal of assets in the U.S., France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver an improved performance, achieving record profits last year and create a platform for future growth and development. Now, you'll hear from him in a second, has decided it's the right time to step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments. As you would expect, the Board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already have started a robust and rigorous process to find our next group Chief Executive. This process will look at both internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased that now has agreed to remain in his role while this process takes place, ensuring a smooth and orderly transition. And on a personal note, I'd like to thank Noel for his unwavering commitment and dedication to HSBC, which he joined 37 years ago. Now, it's been a pleasure and privilege to work with and alongside you."

        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "Thank you, Mark. I'm very grateful for your support, guidance, friendship and partnership. I'm proud of what my HSBC colleagues and I have achieved together over the past 5 years. Over that period, we have hit some significant milestones, record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade and the highest dividend since 2008. As Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we have built a strong platform for the bank's next phase of development and growth. That's why I feel this is the right time to step back to find a better balance between my personal and business commitments with the intention going forward after a break of pursuing a portfolio career. When I reflect back on the last 37 years, I have held intensive leadership roles, particularly since I took over the U.K. Commercial Bank in October of 2008. After 16 years of intensive leadership, I'm ready for a change. But it's also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It's an ideal time to bring in new leadership. The Board has now started a process to find my successor, and I'm very happy to continue in my role as that process takes place. Rest assured, I will be working hard to ensure a smooth and orderly transition for my successor and to keep the momentum going in this business, as you have seen in Q1. Until then, it's business as usual. So, let's now turn to our Q1 results, which have showed continued progress. We had a good first quarter. Reported profit before tax was $12.7 billion. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion. Our return on tangible equity was 16.4%, excluding notable items. I'm also pleased with the further capital distributions of $8.8 billion, which brings the total amount of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last 15 months to almost $28 billion. And we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance for 2024. I will now hand over to George to take you through the numbers."

      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Noel. I'd like to open by paying tribute to the enormous contribution Noel has made to the bank. I've greatly enjoyed working alongside him. And I know everyone at the bank has appreciated this strong and effective leadership. I'm also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since my appointment as CFO, 15 months ago. The Board has announced the process to find a successor, and I know Non and I will continue to remain very focused on the job at hand until that process has been completed. Turning now to the numbers. Reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion was down $0.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, down $0.4 billion on last year's first quarter. On an annualized basis, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 26.1% or 16.4%, excluding notable items. We completed the $2 billion share buyback announced in February in 2 months. This means that since the end of 2022, we have bought back 6% of our outstanding shares. And the trend of strong shareholder distributions continues this quarter. We have announced, as Noel said, a further $8.8 billion of distributions consisting of first interim dividend for '24 of $0.10 per share. The special dividend of $0.21 per share from the Canada sale proceeds and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we plan to begin right after the AGM and complete within 3 months. Finally, we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items and our commitment to limit cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. So, on the next slide, reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion included $4.8 billion gain on the sale of Canada, partly offset by the $1.1 billion impairment on the classification of Argentina as held for sale. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion with revenue growth offset primarily by higher costs and ECLs. Revenue of $20.8 billion was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue was $17 billion, which was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year, with growth in banking NII, partly offset by lower fee and other income. Within that, we saw high single-digit growth in multi-jurisdictional revenue in the first quarter, which underlines the value of our global network. Banking NII of $11.3 billion was up $0.6 billion on the fourth quarter on the reported FX basis, mainly driven by Argentina banking NII as well as the nonrecurrence of the cash flow hedge reclassification in the last quarter. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, a few things to keep in mind. First, our Q1 banking NII included $0.3 billion from Canada, which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion of the sale in March this year. Second, first quarter banking NII also included $0.5 billion from Argentina. This contribution will continue to be highly volatile until the sale is completed, which we expect to be within the next 12 months. Please, therefore, do not extrapolate the $0.5 billion run rate for the remainder of the year. Our banking NII guidance assumes a contribution of around $1 billion in full year '24 for Argentina, which is in line with full year 2023. Third, the banking NII outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our full year results in February. The Hong Kong time deposit mix remained stable as a percentage of customer deposits in the quarter and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates. However, it is still early in the year, and these things can change. So, we are maintaining our 2024 banking NII guidance of at least $41 billion. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was down by 9%, primarily due to the normalization of FX revenues compared to a very strong foreign exchange performance in the first quarter of last year, which benefited from higher market volatility. Fees from Global Payment Solutions had another good quarter, up by 6%. Wealth is another growth area that had a very good quarter, up by 14% on the same period last year as our investment continued to drive improved results. Private Banking was a standout performer, mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia, but growth in wealth has been broad-based. To illustrate this, we acquired around 135,000 new-to-bank retail wealth customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. Approximately 60% of these were nonresidents attracted by our service and product capabilities in Hong Kong. Building on previous quarters, we attracted $27 billion of net new invested assets, of which $19 billion were in Asia. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.8 billion, up from $0.4 billion in the first quarter of last year. On credit, expected credit losses were $0.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 30 basis points of average loans. These were primarily Stage 3 charges across retail and wholesale. There was a $54 million charge related to our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. While challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more benign ECL contribution from it than last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue monitoring developments closely. And we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around 40 basis points of average loans, recognizing the overall uncertainty from the flow-through effect of higher rates on the economy. Next, we are on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. This quarter's year-on-year cost growth was impacted by 3 items. First, we chose to face the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. This accounted for 2 percentage points of cost growth this quarter. We do not currently expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly different to 2023. So, the accrual will be lower over the next 3 quarters than it was in the same period last year. Second, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to 1 percentage point of cost growth this quarter as we only acquired SBB U.K. in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide you with a fuller update on that business at the half year, but I'm pleased that it has good momentum. In the U.K., we onboarded 183 new-to-bank innovation banking client groups in the quarter, the best quarter since acquisition. Finally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank Finland levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost discipline, and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis, inclusive of all the above items. On lending and deposits. There was good loan growth in the U.K., the Middle East, Mexico and Asia, excluding Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remains subdued, largely due to the high interest rate differential with Mainland China. Overall, we continue to expect mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium to long term, but we expect demand to remain subdued in the near term. Deposits were down 2%. This was due to a range of factors, including seasonality, the switch from time deposits to wealth products in Hong Kong and our deliberate choice to forsake some highly price-sensitive deposits. Next, our CET 1 ratio was 15.2%, up 40 basis points on the fourth quarter. Organic capital generation and the gain from the sale of the Canadian business enabled us to announce $8.8 billion of capital distributions this quarter. This includes a share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have an impact of around 40 basis points on our CET1 ratio in the second quarter. For modeling purposes, please note that the $5.8 billion of dividends announced today as well as the $5.9 billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full year results in February will both be reflected in TNAV in the second quarter. At closing of the sale of HSBC Argentina, which is expected within 12 months, we will also recognize $4.9 billion of foreign exchange reserve recycling losses subject to any movement in this reserve up until completion. These losses have already been accumulated in capital over the previous years. Therefore, recognition in the P&L will have no impact on CET1 nor on TNAV. Finally, looking forward to the rest of the year, our good first quarter puts us on track and we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance. A mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items, a banking NII of at least $41 billion, ECLs of around 40 basis points cost growth limited to around 5% on a target basis and a 50% dividend payout ratio. And with that, Louis, can we please go to Q&A."

        "text": "Congrats, Noel on a great tenure at the bank and well done for the ROE and the capital return. I guess, just in terms of my question, the PD migration in Hong Kong, if you go back to the way you were computing it previously actually looks like it improved quarter-on-quarter and certainly under the new definition, has stabilized. I think it's Slide 17, if I'm not mistaken, in the presentation. Is that a little bit better than where your expectations were a few months ago? I know when I was in Hong Kong recently, it sounded like things were starting to stabilize, but is that better than where you were thinking a few months ago? And then secondly, on the buybacks, is the $3 billion number due more to the calendar effect? Or are you looking to kind of boost the run rate there from the $2 billion in the quarter?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Joseph. So, first, on the time deposit reclassification, we have actually reclassified some private bank term deposits to time deposits. This is due to the observation of their behavior and the recognition that they better classify this time deposits. This rebases the number. But as you could see from the 2 choices we have, it does not affect the trend. So, therefore, the trend that we've seen under both classifications is the same, and we've seen the first quarter stable quarter-on-quarter. It's too early to call it a peak, but we've always expected migration this year to be slower than what we've seen last year. And this just confirms the trend change from what we've seen in full year 2023. As regards to your buyback question, so the short answer is, yes, this is indeed due to calendar effects. We just completed a \u20ac2 billion buyback in 2 months. That's about $1 billion a month. That is the fastest run rate we've done in terms of share buybacks ever. We are now announcing a \u20ac3 billion buyback, which we intend to to do over the next 3 months, starting after AGM. We will see how the run rate goes, it will remain at the $1 billion run rate. We will see how it will go. As regards any future amount of buyback or whether we're doing a buyback, one, it remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share buyback. And, second, we will decide on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on our capital outlook, the loan growth outlook and other parameters as and when every quarter."

        "text": "Maybe two from me as well. Just doing, George, on this point on distribution and looking at the sort of moving parts for capital, one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the growth in RWAs. The \u20ac7 billion of increase driven by asset quality trends. I think you're calling out is predominantly in Asia. What should we think about the sort of outlook for RWA growth from here even if loan build is muted, just to get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in content terms for distributions? And I guess the second question to Noel, just maybe a question for your broader thoughts, no. The 5 years proceeding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC, but I guess, for a lot of people given in your markets given the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you exited Canada, you announced Argentina. You're in the process of exiting quite a few smaller markets. Return on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens. You're buying back stock at $3 billion a quarter, you've got a special dividend as well. I guess what I'm really interested in is from here onwards, what do you think is left to do for the group to kind of progress?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Raul. I'll start with your first question first. So, on RWA outlook. So the RWA growth, we called on a quarter-on-quarter basis, $24 billion. First, about 40% of it related to lending and other asset growth. And as you can see from our lending book, we've grown our lending book by \u20ac5 billion. There's a number of areas of growth that contributed to around 40% of it, $9 billion. Then we've had a $5 billion market tristRWA growth. This is due to a pickup in NSS activity against a subdued 4Q, and it's more in line with their activity levels in the first 3 quarters of the year, if you want. And this is the normalization of the market's activity. And then there is $7 billion, which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, first, it is a continuous exercise. We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis. We have recognized across a number of geographies and a number of sectors, certain names, which we've decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe. You will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ECL. And that's mainly because for many of these customers, their balance sheet remains strong. So, we're comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore, there is no ECL implication from this downgrade. But just closing the loop, this RWA downgrade, you will see some of it materialize in our Stage 3 loans, where we increased our Stage 3 loans by about $2 billion, and that's exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality. With regards to how we look forward, we are very comfortable where we are today. Our credit metrics remain solid. As I say, the balance sheet of our customers remains strong for a number of them for at least the exposure that is collateralized. We're very comfortable with the level of collateralization and the LTV. And therefore, we do not foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking. We will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always do. Noel?"

        "text": "Thank you. It has certainly been an extraordinary 5 years, I should say, not just for HSBC, but for the world. And I'm really pleased and grateful I want to pay tribute to the team for the way they've collectively navigated that. And during that whole process, the external environment executed on a complex but absolutely critical transformation plan over the past 5 years. And the outcome of that hard work is evident in the financial performance last year and the financial performance in Q1. I also want to say thanks to Mark, with such volatility in an external environment. Any CEO needs the support of their chair, their advice, their guidance, and I've had that all the way through and have had the support from the Board all the way through in navigating what has been a very complex external environment. But the team, the Board, Mark, collectively, we've done a good job of navigating it. Now, if I look forward, I'm not going to give to do list to my successor because that is not the fair thing to do to anyone. But I will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very much focused on. And I'm focused on for as long as I'm still CEO, and that is continuing the momentum. You don't work as hard as we worked for the past 5 years and then take the eye off the ball at this moment in time. So, I'm very focused on a smooth, orderly transition. I'm very focused on continued execution of the strategy. I want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy. We have exited a lot of businesses, a lot of RWAs over the past 5 years. The one thing we've protected whilst doing that is the international core of HSBC. The countries we remain in, the businesses we remain in are fundamentally now focused on the international nature and essence of HSBC, and we will continue to do that. Our key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are sustainable and repeatable whilst also taking advantage of the growth opportunities as they emerge in a world that becomes more stable and there are inherent in our customer franchise. Therefore, we're very focused on continuing the development of wealth, our transaction banking capabilities, our global wholesale banking capabilities and then being ready for when corporate loan demand picks up, we can take advantage of that to couple good returns with sustainable growth. And I think you've seen evidence of that in these results. Hong Kong is subdued at the moment, but we understand why with the rate differential in China. But if you look at the rest of the world, as George said, there's balance sheet growth in Wholesale Banking, in the rest of Asia, in the Middle East, in U.K., in Europe. We're seeing good growth elsewhere. So, it's about focus, momentum, continuing to couple good returns with good growth."

        "text": "So, the first question is on deposits. We're glad to see that cat migration in Hong Kong is slowing down, but if not stabilized at this level. But on the other hand, I think the bank has seen some deposit outflow in Q1, while your Hong Kong local peers still see some deposit growth. So, I'm wondering if there is a strategic trade-off between the deposit growth and the cost for you at this stage? And how do you see that trend in the rest of the year? The second question is on the structural hedge. So, I'm wondering if this quarter, you could share with us some breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the reinvestment of the structural hedge? And if there is any run rate that we can refer to?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Jeremy. So, on your first question about deposits in Hong Kong. So, if you remember at Q4, our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. What we've seen in Q1 this year is a decrease of about $16 billion. Therefore, you can see seasonality playing across the 2 quarters, and therefore, is broadly stable across the 2 quarters. What happened though is, some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some deposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. And when you look at Q1, while you see the deposit outflows, you also can see that $19 billion of our net new invested assets were in Asia. Therefore, a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated into wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4 and explains if you want the seasonality of this deposit. Second, look, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and viable franchise. We continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail and wholesale customers. We cherish this. We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. And throughout the last 6 quarters, you've seen how our deposit base has been very stable with our deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers. Therefore, I won't comment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers. If I move on to your second question about the structural hedge. So, first, you would have noticed that we increased this quarter, the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 million, with the average weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of 3 years. Second, we commit at this stage to continue our structural hedging activity. Obviously, this will remain subject to market conditions, but we will continue the trend that we put in Q1 based on current market outlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind toward banking NII. And this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted as you know, and you can do the math. But equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates. And this reinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into banking NII. Between the 2 of those effects, the structural hedge activity for the full year 2024 would remain a net tailwind to our banking NII. We have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind. We're looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space. But that tailwind has been factored into our guidance of at least $41 billion bank NII and obviously, factored into our return on tangible equity mid-teens guidance."

        "text": "First of all, just to echo the best wishes, Noel, for the next chapter of your career and private life, I think, a well-earned rebalancing. George, I just wondered whether you talk a little bit within the context of higher for longer, you've referenced subdued loan demand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates. And I just wonder whether one of your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue. So, I wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether that's a material part of the plan? And sort of what do you think that means for revenue sort of evolution in the next few quarters? I think I certainly was somewhat surprised that we didn't see an upgrade to banking NII guidance this quarter. I know you don't rebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that Higher for longer has on asset mix and then on credit demand. And then secondly, wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there's a part of the business that's quite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now 20% in in a short space of time. But I just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. Is that the strategy delivering the sort of net new money flows? Or is there an element of sort of market volume there that we should be a little bit careful about?"

        "text": "Thank you, Jason. So, first on Banking NII, we recognize there are kind of a couple of encouraging developments. The first one is the higher for longer on the rate side that would look like more favorable than when we discussed last in February. And, the second one we just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix, specifically in Hong Kong, where we've seen term deposits remain stable for this quarter. So, we recognize these tailwinds to our banking NII, but we also recognize quite early in the year, and these factors can still change. So this is why we didn't change our guidance. And as you said, Jason, I don't think you should expect us to update our guidance every quarter. We would reconsider this every quarter. But for this quarter, we're just sticking with our at least $41 billion. In terms of the wealth performance, so recognize mid-teens percentage growth in wealth, 34% for our private bank. I would say a couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that we've already said it's a focused strategic area. We are investing in this area. Big part of our investments goes towards this area, and we're very pleased to see the results of our investments generate revenue fairly quickly. You can see that through net new invested assets growth. You can see that through our CSM, new business CSM growth in insurance as well as in the actual revenue performance. This being said, I would just caution you not to annualize the numbers you're seeing because Q1 2023 had somewhat subdued January in it when China and Hong Kong were still closed. So, therefore, you've seen more pickup in activity in the Q1 '23 at the back end of it, whereas we had a full proper Q1 '24. So, there is an element of not annualizing the performance, but expecting that performance to continue growing. I just realized I didn't touch on your asset mix question of the first question. Look, we do not foresee a material change in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year, the main growth take place in mortgages and recognizing mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in the U.K. and Hong Kong, and the margins have been quite tight. As we start seeing pickup in wholesale demand, as we start peeing pickup in unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that those will drive higher margins than if you want what we see in mortgages. And our numbers in Q1 did show that this pickup definitely is there in areas of Asia, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, the U.K., et cetera. And the next in line for that pickup will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some stage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease."

But I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, which is how are you thinking about the trajectory going from here because it sounds to me that deposit migration is probably, well, stabilized a lot. And I would have thought any longer pricing that hasn't already come through will come through in the next few months. And I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, you can probably build more hedges at better rates as well, et cetera. And there's obviously a tailwind as you mentioned in this year already. So, how does that inform your thinking on your medium-term RoTE? So I guess that's the first question. And the second question, again, on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit. So, again, I guess just noting your point that Hong Kong might be a mix in line to pick up. But I guess, overall, the emerging market is probably not benefiting in terms of activity level and in terms of capital inflows from the higher U.S. rates. So, how does that impact, I guess, trading activities and capital flows, et cetera, just how are you thinking about the flip side of hirer longer?"

        "text": "Thank you, Perlie. So first, look, yes, we recognize higher for longer is definitely a tailwind or a reduction of a headwind we've forecast in our banking NII. And as I said, there has been a number of manifestation of tailwinds now compared to when we last spoke in February. But equally, it is early in the year. And as you've seen, these things do change. And, therefore, want to beccon in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing parameters. We will update some longer than what we're updating but not at this quarter, barely. So, do expect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future. I would say the one parameter, just to keep in mind, as you start planning for '25 is take Argentina out because, obviously, subject to the sale completing, which we expect to complete in the next 12 months, that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from our banking NII. That's the most kind of predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025. In terms of the broader activity level, first, if you look at the wealth performance, it just demonstrates how wealth remains very resilient. And that's particularly true in Hong Kong, but very much so across Asia. Second, when you look at our transaction banking activities, apart from foreign exchange, which has an idiosyncrasy related to Q1 '23 with a very high volatility has performed across the various areas of its fee earning activities. And then our activity is very much benefiting from cross-border trends. If you look at some of the investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra region in Asia between China and ASEAN between India and ASEAN, between India and the west, et cetera, all of those trends are growing. I mean the numbers are staggering in some cases. And these are the activities that our business is operating on. So, therefore, while recognizing that there will be some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels, there is still a very strong underlying network activity, which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in wholesale transaction banking, anyway."

So, our outbound activity from Mainland China to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase in activity over the past 12 months. We've seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this year. So, a lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down. But what I would say is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up at quite a pace a very significant pace. We're very well placed to capture that outflow, and we are capturing that outflow. And our business in Mainland China performed well last year. It's performing well again in the first quarter of this year and its outbound activity is performing extremely well. So, we'll give more updates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that. And that is why actually I think the rest of Asia is performing well on balance sheet because a lot of it is being fed by good intra-Asia activity and outbound from Mainland China."

        "text": "I have three questions, three small questions, actually. The first one is on noninterest income. I look at the breakdown of noninterest income. It seems like wealth is doing quite well. But on Transaction Banking, there is some weakness, I think it's down 9% Y-o-Y. Can we know what is the reason? And how should we triangulate this to the full year? What are the drivers to that? So this is the first one. The second one is on Hong Kong. With Hong Kong relaxing LTV ratios, I think basically, not only they would be they relax the the purchase requirements and the stability requirements on residential properties. So, I think that there is a significant jump in transaction. So, I was thinking that this should be positive to mortgage at least, and then we are a big mortgage providers in Hong Kong. So, will that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth, particularly related to Hong Kong? Second one. And then the last one, I think, is on cost. If I look at the first quarter, I think cost is up 8%, including levy. How should I look at this? And then are we on track to the 5% cost growth this year?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Katherine. I'll take question 1 and 3, and I'll hand over to Noel to address your second question about the outlook for Hong Kong. So, first on non-NII. Wealth has performed well. Transaction banking weakness is specifically due to foreign exchange. That's driving the whole weakness. And the reason, as I called it out earlier, the reason is that foreign exchange had a record strong quarter 1 '23 on the back of heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis. So, therefore, we're doing a comparison to a record quarter, and it will show that drop. But if you look at the number itself, and the revenue itself for foreign exchange, it is back to normalized levels. So, there is nothing to worry about here. It's on the contrary back to normalized levels, and we continue to expect some cyclicality in that space, while we continue expecting growth in the other areas of transaction banking. So, I wouldn't read more than that into it, and we remain very confident that the investment we're putting both in wealth and transaction banking and in the technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain strategic focus and bearing results as we look into future quarters and years. On your third question about cost. So, first, I just want to reiterate, it is a clear priority for us to maintain cost discipline, okay? And we are very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5%. We will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis. We're confident about it. And we're actually on track to do so. And the reason why we're kind of on track to do so yet, we showed a 7% quarter 1 growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic items related to the quarter, which are not repeated in future quarters or some of them will reverse in future quarters. I'll just call the 3 of them out that matter. First, there was a 2% accrual of the performance-related pay where we decided to phase that accrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher performance-related pay accrual in Q1, hence, the 2% contribution towards the 7%, but it will contribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a full year basis, we are not accruing to a significantly different number than the full year '23 performance-related pay. Second, there was 1% contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter because last year's first quarter, we only acquired SBB in the middle of March, which means we practically didn't have it in the first quarter last year, and that's a base effect. And then third, we had the one-offs or the expected nonrecurrence of the FDIC special assessment additional charge this quarter as well as the bank of in levy. Bank of Finland levy is a new charge, which used to be an interest expense as an NII and now it's moved to operations expense as in cost. And between the 2 of them, they contributed to 1%. So, if you adjust for those and you bake them in, we're still and remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year or circa 5% on a full year basis. On your second question, I'll hand over to Noel."

And I think firstly, I think the change to the stamp duty arrangements in Hong Kong in March in the budget was very well received, and it's had a positive impact on the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong market residential sales. It was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month. That will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions of many of those developers. We have to wait and see how that stabilizes because undoubtedly, there was an element of catch up in that first month because people were anticipating some change. Therefore, there was low activity in the preceding months. And then we got to see how that stabilizes. But I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance liquidity within the market. It will enhance activity in the mortgage market. But I think it's too early to call a trend at the moment. I think we need to see how Q2 stabilizes following those changes, but a very helpful intervention."

        "text": "Thank you, Andrew. So the UK NIM was up 6 basis points, indeed, essentially benefited from some idiosyncrasies of structural hedges and timing of structural hedge maturities and reinvestments. So, if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of plus or minus 10 basis points. I would say U.K. NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple of quarters. And we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. And you will, therefore, add to that broadly flat, some structural hedge due increases, which will drive you within this plus or minus 10 basis point range. As regards our loans and deposits have been stable. Again, the U.K. economy has been resilient, we're very optimistic about the outlook for the U.K., specifically around inflation and employment. It remains a very important customer franchise for us. It remains a very important market for us, and we continue gaining market share. I mean, we continue gaining market share in mortgages with a 10% new business market share when our back book now market share has moved or our kind of overall portfolio market shares moved from 7% to 8%. We are a 25% market share in SME lending. And obviously, we continue investing in this business. You can look at the ring-fenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment growth for their infants bank within our overall circa 5% cost growth. So, all this demonstrates the confidence we have in our business in the U.K., our client activity in the U.K. and the outlook for the U.K. If I move to Argentina, I wish I could give you a trend for Argentina, then the way it works is the numbers balloon with hyperinflation, and then they kind of they shrink with devaluation, and it depends how they manifest themselves over month-over-month. Q4 last year has seen hyperinflation to some level, but they have seen a massive devaluation. If you recall, in December, we've seen more than 50% currency devaluation. That's contributed to a disinflation of the amount that Banking Argentina brought to Q4. And then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We've seen 6% devaluation only, but we've seen 54% inflation, and that will just inflate the numbers. So, it will be volatile quarter-on-quarter. And our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it averaged out over the last year, which is around \u20ac1 billion. Now just looking at the overall Argentina, if you take in the nonbanking NII, you take in the cost base, et cetera, last year's Argentina contribution to our PBT was $0.2 billion. Just to put it in perspective, this is about $0.01 earnings per share or 0.5% dividend per share. Therefore, I think as you look at the full year '24, that's the quantum that Argentina volatility will create. So, it should not distract you from the way you're forecasting the bank's outcomes."

    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to the Analyst and Investor Webinar on the 2024 Interim Results for HSBC Holdings plc. For your information, this webinar is being recorded. We are now ready to start the webinar. So I will hand over to Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive.\nNoel Quinn: Good morning to everyone in London, and good afternoon to those joining from Hong Kong. Today is my last results announcement before Georges takes over in September. I'm delighted to be handing the stewardship of the bank over to him. Georges is an exceptional leader who understand what makes HSBC special. I'd like to thank my colleagues around the world for everything they've done over the last five years. And I wish Georges every success for the future. I have always been immensely proud of the heritage of this bank and the strategic role it plays in the world. But when I took this job on five years ago, we didn't have the financial performance to match our standing. My aim was to change that. I believe we've done so and created a strong platform for future growth. This was evidenced by the record profit performance last year and by the strong first half performance this year, revenue of $37.3 billion was up 1%. Profit before tax of $21.6 billion was stable on the same period last year. This performance enabled continued strong capital generation. Our return on tangible equity was 17%, excluding notable items. We've announced $4.8 billion of further capital distributions today. This takes the total capital we have distributed by way of dividends and buybacks in respect of the last 18 months to $34.4 billion. Finally, we've updated our guidance to reflect our increased confidence about the future. We're providing new guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025. In addition to the 2024 guidance we already had. We're upgrading our 2024 banking NII guidance from at least $41 billion to around $43 billion. We're revising our 2024 ECL guidance to be back within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. And we're reconfirming our 2024 cost guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. That's despite growth of 7% in the first half, which as Georges will explain, is mainly due to timing differences compared to last year. The benefits of our strategy execution over the last five years are evidence in our performance. Before getting into detail on the further progress made over the last six months, please allow me to share some reflections on our five year journey. When we set out, there were two key strategies to delivering higher returns. The first thing we had to do was to reshape our portfolio. Building on the work of my predecessors who initiated important structural changes, we've continued to exit businesses and client portfolios that were non-strategic, subscale and unprofitable. First, via organic portfolio reductions, which delivered RWA savings of around $128 billion. And then via inorganic means through disposals. The second and very important strategy, which we commenced at the same time was to build alternative sources of revenue growth. Within this, we've invested to grow fee income, particularly in areas where we have significant strengths such as wholesale transaction banking and wealth. We've also continued to invest in our differentiated international propositions. And we've significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates from approximately $7 billion of banking NII for a 100 basis points down shock in interest rates at 30th of June 2022 to around $3.4 billion at the end of 2023 and now down to around $2.7 billion today. All of this had to be underpinned by a culture of cost discipline, which we have instilled across the group. These savings enabled us to invest in the areas I've spoken about. And this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance. As you know, we delivered a record profit in 2023 and a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2023 and in the first half of 2024. It has been over 15 years since the group was generating returns at current levels. And we now expect to sustain it this year and in 2025. The other tangible measure of success is capital distributions to our shareholders. I'm really pleased that we delivered around $54 billion by way of dividends and buybacks to our shareholders over the last five years, including the distributions announced today. And I'm especially pleased to have paid the special dividend of $0.21 per share earlier this year following the sale of HSBC Canada. I see this payment not just as a financial return, but as a return for the loyalty that our shareholders have shown us over the recent years. Let me now summarize the further progress evidenced in the first half. First, wealth has been a key component of revenue diversification strategy. It delivered two very good quarters, growing revenue by 12% in total. In Transaction Banking, fee and other income in Global Payment Solutions grew by 4% and in Global Trade Solutions by 1% in a very difficult environment for trade. Revenue for HSBC Innovation Banking was up 4% quarter-on-quarter as our new global proposition continues to gain traction. Second, our scale markets in Hong Kong and the U.K. enabled us to grow profits each year as we captured new opportunities in both the corporate and retail businesses. As you can see, we also have positive growth in other markets, including India, which was up 4% in the first half and Singapore, which was up 2%. Third, we continue to grow multi-jurisdictional client revenue in both wholesale and retail. Fourth, we saw good growth in both customer lending and deposits in the second quarter despite what is still a relatively sluggish environment. Finally, we've continued to grow the size and duration of the structural hedge to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate movements. Georges has new disclosures on the expected benefits in his section. All of this progress underlines why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity this year and in 2025 as well. Let me get into some more detail. The steps we've taken to change our retail business model and our continued investment in people and digitization have made wealth a key driver of revenue growth. Wealth revenue was up 12% in the first half to $4.3 billion. And that growth is broad-based. As you can see in the boxes on the right side of the slide, wealth fee and other income was up 14%. Private Banking revenue was up 16%. We attracted $32 billion of net new invested assets. Our new business insurance CSM was up 77%. Moving to the next topic. Transaction Banking revenue was stable in the first half. There was good growth in payments, which was up 3%. This included growth in fee and other income of 4%. This is a result of the investment we made to grow and digitize that business, which helped to improve our ranking from a top four bank in 2022 to number two today. Foreign exchange was down 8% compared to a strong performance last year when there was very high volatility. And while trade was slightly down in the half, the pace of decline slowed to the point that it was broadly flat in the second quarter. But we still grew our trade volumes despite global trade volumes remaining subdued. And we also increased our market share in trade in Hong Kong to more than 26%. On the next topic, our businesses in Hong Kong and the U.K. both continue to perform well in the first half. Profit before tax in Hong Kong was up 1% on a constant currency basis, while the Hong Kong corporate loan market remains subdued, it was resilience in the second quarter. It's too early to call it a trend, but deposits and investment activity increased, which underlines that the right differential works in both directions. We attracted 345,000 new to bank customers in the half as we continue to capitalize on significant inflows into Hong Kong from customers seeking opportunities for investment. Profit before tax in the U.K. business grew by 11%, excluding the gain on SVB U.K. last year. Customer lending was also up 2%, but our U.K. business is differentiated by its connectivity with the rest of the group. In the first half, we grew the number of U.K. international customers by 8% to 2.7 million customers. We have a strong international franchise. We evidenced this through our multi-jurisdictional revenue disclosures in February. And in the first half, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 4% to $9.7 billion. And as I said earlier, this isn't just a wholesale story. We're doing more with our international retail and wealth customers as well. We now have 7 million international wealth and personal banking customers with revenue from these customers up 6% to $5.4 billion. So these are the levers that have put us on track to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity this year and why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025. With that, I'll hand over to Georges. Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Noel, and hello, everyone. Before I get to the Q2 numbers, I'd like to comment briefly on the recent announcement. I'm deeply honored by the trust placed in me to lead this great institution into the future. Many of you may have questions about the future strategy and direction of the group. Although I don't take over as Group Chief Executive until the 2nd of September from Noel, I'm ready to share a few high level thoughts. Under Noel's leadership, we have delivered financial performance and built a strong platform for growth. The strategy of the group is working, and I'm committed to building on this. The shape of the group is broadly where we wanted to be with the bulk of our capital and other resources deployed in our four scale activities that's Hong Kong, the U.K. Our international wholesale bank underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities and our wealth proposition, particularly in Asia. This puts us in a very strong position. In each of these activities, we have scale and sustainable competitive advantages, and our strength are aligned to the needs of our customers. They account for the vast majority of the economic profit we generate today and present some of our most exciting opportunities to grow over the next five to 10 years. And together, they are capable of delivering above cost of capital returns sustainably through the cycle. We've made good progress and we are now in a position to accelerate the pace of execution of the strategy with focus and intensity to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, to improve operating leverage, while maintaining strong cost discipline and prudent risk management and to continue to improve client service and experience. You'll also have seen that we have announced this morning that Jon Bingham has been appointed Interim Group CFO from the 2nd of September. Jon is currently our Financial Controller, and has outstanding technical accounting and regulatory knowledge and expertise. A process to identify the next permanent group CFO is underway, and I will update you further in due course. Now though, turning to Q2. In summary, profit before tax of $8.9 billion was up $0.4 billion on the second quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis. In terms of the drivers, the banking NII run rate was stable on the first quarter. There was another strong wealth performance, while wholesale transaction banking was stable in last year's second quarter. Despite cost growth of 7% in the first half on a target basis, we remain on track to meet our 2024 guidance of around 5% cost growth, and there was growth in both loans and deposits in the quarter. On the next slide, so HSBC Canada contributed around $0.5 billion of revenue and around $0.2 billion of profit before tax in the quarter before the sale completed in March. To make like-for-like comparisons easier, these contributions and some other impacts have been excluded from some of the commentary. So excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions, profit before tax was up 7% to $9.1 billion. Revenue of $16.5 billion was up $0.3 billion on the second quarter of last year. Excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions, revenue was up $0.8 billion or 5% on the second quarter of last year. Banking NII of $10.9 billion was down $0.4 billion on the first quarter on a reported FX basis, primarily because of a $0.3 billion reduction from the Canada sale. Excluding this, the banking NII run rate was stable. We're now in a position to upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance to around $43 billion. This assumes a $1 billion contribution from Argentina, which was its reported NII in 2023, although we note that it remains volatile and difficult to predict. We're also providing new details to help you understand the expected benefits from the structural hedge. Around $55 billion of assets are due to mature in the second half of 2024 with an average yield of 2.8%, and around $105 billion of assets will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8% as well. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was stable on the second quarter of last year or up 2% excluding the impact of strategic transactions. Within this, Global Payment Solutions had another good quarter, up 2% as the security services, which was up 3%. Foreign exchange delivered broadly stable revenue compared to a strong quarter last year. And wealth had another very good quarter, underlying that our investment is continuing to drive improved results. Wealth fee and other income was up by 13% compared to last year's second quarter. Private Banking was a standout performer mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia. But growth in wealth remained broad-based. Customer growth and improved wealth penetration primarily in Asia, helped drive growth in investment distribution. Invested assets were up 2% to $1.3 trillion, including $6 billion of net new invested assets in the quarter. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.6 billion, up $0.2 billion on the second quarter of last year. On credit, expected credit losses were $0.3 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 15 basis points of average loans. This included $0.4 billion of recoveries and other items mentioned on the slide. Excluding these, ECLs were broadly in line with our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. Stage 3 balances were 2.4% of customer loans, up $1.4 billion compared to the first quarter. This was driven by Hong Kong commercial real estate book, but there was a limited impact on ECL charge because of the high level of collateralization. We are revising our 2024 ECL guidance to our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points of average loans. Next, costs grew by 7% in the first half on a target basis, but we remain on track to meet our guidance of 2024 cost growth of around 5%. 2 percentage points of cost growth in the first half came from higher performance-related pay accrual and levies. As we explained at the first quarter, we have phased the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than last year. We do not expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be materially different to 2023. So the accrual in the second half is expected to be lower year-on-year. In addition, the second half of last year included $0.3 billion of levies that we do not expect to repeat this year. We are, therefore, reconfirming our guidance of around 5% cost growth for 2024 on a target basis and we remain committed to cost discipline. On lending and deposits, there was positive loan growth in the quarter in both the U.K. and Asia, whilst Hong Kong was broadly stable. Overall, we are promising signs in the first half. Deposits were up 2% with the majority of this in Hong Kong. There was also growth in the U.K., Europe and U.S. and the rest of Asia, but it also included the benefits of seasonality in commercial banking and a large one-off in Global Banking and Markets. So I would encourage you not to annualize the 2% figure. Next, our CET1 ratio was 15%, down 20 basis points on the first quarter as strong organic capital generation was offset by distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We have announced a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we expect to complete within three months and to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points on our CET1 ratio in the third quarter. Finally, to recap, our strong first half performance and our confidence about the bank's position enable us to provide new guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items for 2025, in addition to our existing mid-teens guidance for 2024. Upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance from at least $41 billion to around $43 billion, revise our 2024 ECL guidance to within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points and we confirm our guidance for '24 cost growth of around 5% on a target basis and mid-single digit loan growth over the medium term. With that, Louis, can we please go to Q&A. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Georges. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Andrew Coombs at Citigroup. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nNoel Quinn: Andrew.\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. Thank you both for your comments. A couple of questions from my side, one big picture, one into the numbers. First, a big picture question. Noel, you highlighted all the things you can be out of journal and any, but perhaps with the benefit of hindsight be interested in any thoughts you have or anything you might have done differently? And then linked to that as well, George, I think you're on the tape this morning talking about accelerating the existing execution. So any tangible examples you can provide on that would be helpful as well. And then in terms of the numbers question, thank you for the additional disclosure around structural hedge. I think you talked about $55 billion maturing in second half at a 2.8% yield. Is it fair to assume the new positions that you're putting on are probably about 1% higher than that, given where the forward curve is? So prior to any of debt from adding to the existing structural hedge notional. It's about $0.5 billion of NII uplift. Is that fair?\nNoel Quinn: Andrew, thanks for your questions. I'll take the first one. Listen, I've got no regret, Andrew. I think performing this role is an absolute privilege. And look, you never finish with an institution like this, and that's why Georges is right to comment there. You always want to do more yours. There's always things you want to improve. There's always investment you can do to grow more revenue, to improve customer experience, improve systems and processes. So there's never a notion of finishing. There's always -- should always be a notion of continuous improvement and continuous ambition. And I think that's probably the bridge from me to Georges, because I have no regrets about the last five years. I think we've done a lot of good things, and I thank my colleagues for everything they've done. But equally, you should never be complacent and think the job is finished. The job of running an organization as large as ours and with so much opportunity before us to further improve is never finished, and that's the bridge over to Georges now to take it on to the next level and to continue to execute the strategy. So Georges, hand to you on both of the next two questions, please?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thanks, Noel. Yes, Andrew, it was just echoing Noel and building on that. We've called out some of the key areas of our strategy. I've called out Hong Kong, the U.K., the international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by a leading transaction banking capabilities as well as wealth, all of which have demonstrated very strong momentum, certainly over the last few years, but definitely over the first half of this year, we're confident about the momentum. We're confident in our ability to continue investing in them. And we're confident also we have ample capital to support additional growth. So it's just about getting pace -- continued pace in the execution of this strategy that has proved its results. On your question about the structural hedge, Andrew. So $55 billion are expected to mature over the course of the second half at an average yield of 2.8%. If I try to reverse engineer your math and if you assume the reinvestment happens at around 3.8%, with a 1% uplift, then you get $500 billion. But remember, this is maturities that are happening over the course of the half. Therefore, I think you have to average the number and therefore you have to assume half the number as in-year 2024 benefit from that structure and hedging investment. So say, the half of your $0.5 billion you quoted. Also bear in mind that we are increasing the structural hedge, subject to market conditions. We've done about $25 billion in the first half. It's a good estimate of the run rate for the second half. And that is a mild headwind, because we're increasing the hedge from higher short-term rates into lower longer-term rates due to the inversion of the curve. So you have to take all of this into consideration when factoring in the impact for 2024 banking NII.\nOperator: Thank you, Georges. Our next question today comes from Amit Goel at Mediobanca. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nNoel Quinn: Amit, hi.\nAmit Goel: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. So I have three. Firstly, I was a bit surprised to get the 2025 profitability target, which does seem to be a little bit above consensus. So I think consensus is about 14%. So I guess a bit of variation on mid-teens, but if that's kind of 15%, 16%, 17%. Just curious where you see a bit more upside. Is that mainly on the revs or can you see a bit more cost control? And then linked to that, Georges, I think in your comments as well, you talked about growing revenues on a sustainable basis. So just curious, again, how you're thinking about that potentially with some NII headwinds? And then lastly, Noel, I think you used the term sluggish or subdued a few times when talking about the environment. Just curious when you think that will potentially turn and we can see a more constructive environment for some of those markets? Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: Sounds good, Amit. I'll ask Georges to answer the first one, I think, is probably best on the mid-teens and the definition of mid-teens and then also maybe sustainable revenue. And then I'll cover the third.\nGeorges Elhedery: Very good. Thank you, Amit. So consensus -- if you adjust consensus for 2025 for the impact of the loss from the sale of Argentina, which -- by the way, as we communicated now, we expect by the end of the year. Therefore, it's more reasonable to assume that that loss the recycling of the foreign exchange loss of $5 billion, which has no impact on capital or on distribution it's fair to assume that impact will happen in '24. But if you adjust the consensus in '25, you get to around 14% indeed. Our definition of mid-teens is broadly around 14% to 16%. So without commenting on the consensus, our mid-teens definition is broadly that 14%, 16% range. On the growing revenue on a sustainable basis, let me point you to three major indicators, which are going to be important in the way we look at the future. The first one related to banking NII. Banking NII, number one, has been stabilized partly with the reduction of banking NII sensitivity. If you recall, two years ago, we called down $7 billion to be the impact on banking NII on our revenue for a 100 basis point drop in interest rates. That number at the year-end was $3.4 billion. And that number, as we reported it now is $2.7 billion. So therefore, we have through activities of structural hedging, but also through other methodology improvements and balance sheet composition, we have reduced the dependency of our earnings and of our banking NII to the impact of low rates. The second component, again, relating to banking NII is that while for a few quarters, we've seen subdued loan growth in particular in the U.K. and Hong Kong wholesale market. We have now seen stabilization. It's early to call it a trend, but we are encouraged by the stabilization we've observed. And importantly, we will be more encouraged to when we see rates coming off in the support they can have for loan growth, in particular in these two areas that historically have been a little bit more sluggish. Other parts of our activity remained resilient loan growth and in South and Southeast Asia remained very strong loan growth in the mortgage businesses and the U.K. and Hong Kong remain very strong. So there is a volume component to banking NII, which we supported. And as you can see from our capital, we have ample capacity to support loan growth. And the third component I would call out is the non-banking NII part of our earnings. Fees and other income in particular wholesale transaction banking and wealth. You've seen the momentum in these businesses. You've seen the continued investment we've put in these businesses. We believe these momentums are sustainable. There's an underlying sustain sustainable trend supporting wealth in particular, in Asia. And there is an additional support through our own investments, both technology and people relationship management related to support growth in this area, and we believe the momentum is sustainable. So those are the big -- broadly three components that we believe will sustain our earnings as we look into the future.\nNoel Quinn: And Amit, just to come a little bit more elaboration on the sluggish subdued. Listen, I'm not surprised that the corporate loan market is a bit subdued at the moment. But I think it's right for that to be the case because in the higher interest rate environment, there's not many corporates out there want to borrow at today's interest rates. And actually, they've still got a lot of cash sitting on their balance sheet. They don't need to borrow, which is a good position to be in. But as you see interest rates come down, I would expect there to be a pickup in activity. And I suppose, what Georges just said is, we're starting to see the very early signs of that starting to emerge. It's very early. It's too early to call it a trend. But I was pleased in Hong Kong, the rate of decline in the lending book -- corporate lending book in Hong Kong in Q1 reduced dramatically. So we've been declining through 2023. And it actually plateaued in the Q2 and there was us in Hong Kong. And then in the rest of Asia, we saw a growth in Q1 and Q2. And in the rest of the world, we saw growth in Q1 and Q2. So Q1 was the first time we saw net growth in corporate lending. Q2, we saw net growth as well. So I think it's encouraging early signs as interest rates come off, I see that happening. And the other thing is, we've also got to remember, there's another site of the Hong Kong market. The deposit market and the investment market is very strong, as you saw in our wealth businesses. Now the net new invested assets going in to the business. I think in the first half of this year was about $34 billion, if I remember correctly. And I think as rates come off, cash moves into invested assets. And I think we're seeing -- we're a beneficiary of that, particularly in Hong Kong, where rate differentials are playing strongly into the investment market, whereas they're subduing, the rate differentials are subduing the demand for loans in the Hong Kong market, but the rate differential is working in the opposite direction on investments. Okay. Next question.\nAmit Goel: Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Noel. Our next question today comes from Joseph Dickerson at Jefferies. Please accept prompt to unmute your line.\nNoel Quinn: Joseph, thank you.\nJoseph Dickerson: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just a couple of quick things. So on the ROTE guidance, if you look in the first half of the year, you've kind of done an underlying number of 17%, and that was with some -- you've had a few credit headwinds, but generally benign. I mean I guess if you think about things like cash moving into invested assets, which should be higher ROE. Your wealth and personal banking ROEs around 31% at the moment. You're doing about a 22% U.K. ROE. I guess, what would hold you back from maintaining that level in '25 and '26, notwithstanding some rate cuts? It seems like there's a lot more flex in the model from the -- in your business model. I mean I know you need to be conservative, but I guess is it rates that would hold you back lack of activity? And I guess the follow-on question...\nNoel Quinn: I think it's a fair observation, but I think -- and we're not being conservative for the sake of being conservative. I think it is too early to call a return to volume growth in the corporate loan market in substantial proportions. I think we all expect the rates to come off and cash to move from cash to invested assets. I think we're just -- it's still a bit early in the cycle. There's a lot of uncertainty still out there. And I think given our guidance of mid-teens, which is somewhere between the 14% and 16% range is fair at this point in time. I think the most important thing we've tried to do over the past few years is deliver each quarter and let each quarter be the base for the future. So I think it's better to set reasonable and sensible guidance, and then we continue to evidence progress against that as quarter-by-quarter go. So I don't think we're in the mold as an institution of being overly bullish one way or the other, particularly when there's still quite a bit of uncertainty out there. But Georges, is there anything you want to add?\nGeorges Elhedery: Yes. No, nothing, Noel. You covered it. I mean just one parameter also just to add is just remember to remove the impact of Argentina with the expected sale taking place at the end of this year in your 2025 assessments.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Raul Sinha at JPMorgan. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nRaul Sinha: Hi, good morning.\nGeorges Elhedery: Good morning.\nRaul Sinha: Thank you for taking my questions. I was just trying to dig into some of your commentary around the hedge. I was wondering -- I have about two questions. The first one is just trying to understand how the notional size of the hedge is changing in the U.K. versus the rest of the world? My understanding was that the structural hedging in the U.K. is quite a mature book. So I wouldn't have expected that to increase in size going forward. And I would think that most of the low-yielding refinancings are coming from the U.K. But as when we think about the rest of the world, it looks like your structural hedging was more recent. So there's probably scope to increase that, but maybe the refinancing yield is a bit higher. Is that kind of right understanding, is the first question? The second question is just coming to the Hong Kong CRE book and some of the disclosures we've pulled out there. I think $36 billion of total exposure, 40% of that is unsecured. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more additional color around the unsecured part of Hong Kong CRE. I think you say it's very good quality, but how you look to manage the risks given the unsecured nature of this CRE book? Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you. Georges, do you want to pick up both of those?\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure, Noel. So Raul, on the hedge size, we haven't given the specific currency split to a balance sheet split. But yes, you should assume the Sterling component is one of the largest component in terms of the hedge size. And the U.K., therefore, the Sterling component is one of the most mature by way of size of hedge, but there is obviously still or previous hedges maturing, previous hedges stuck at lower yields maturing, and we're able to benefit from the reinvestment of maturing hedges at higher yield. That was still a component in the U.K. bank's NIM which has been broadly stable, and we expect to remain broadly stable and the structural hedge reinvestment is playing a role in that. With regards to the rest of the world, it's a story of two tales, indeed, there is a reinvestment of all structural hedges at higher yields, and that is a tailwind in our banking NII. There is also additional hedges we're doing where we can, and these additional hedges are suffering from a partial -- a partial set off or a partial offset as a headwind because they're suffering from the fact that are inverted, but it's still the right thing to do for the management of our banking NII sensitivity. And then, obviously, always keep in mind that the Hong Kong dollar exposure we have remains largely under hedged, and that's due to the fact that the structure of the market does not give us enough instruments to be able to invest in the long-term to support hedging. So the Hong Kong dollar would remain structurally underhedged in that sense. With regards to the Hong Kong CRE question. So 40% of the book is -- of the $36 billion you mentioned is unsecured, it is typically exposure to large conglomerates with a diversified revenue stream, including revenue streams from activities not related to real estate, 90% of that book today is rated strong and good and literally 0% is in the impaired category. We're very comfortable over the exposure we've had in that book and we continue obviously supporting our customers through the cycle in this phase.\nOperator: Thank you, Georges. We will take our next question today from Jeremy Hugh at CICC. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nNoel Quinn: Jeremy, hi.\nJeremy Hugh: Hi, can you hear me?\nNoel Quinn: Yes.\nJeremy Hugh: Okay, good morning, Noel. Good morning, Georges. My first question is on the noninterest income, if my math is correct. My calculation shows that our adjusted noninterest income is $5.8 billion this quarter compared to $5.3 billion a year ago. And we had $200 million gross NOLs, transaction banking is relatively stable. So since GBM contributed a lot this quarter. So I understand that this business seasonality and is volatile. But do you expect that momentum to continue going forward? Or do you think in the second half of last year is relatively a weak comparison? Yes. The second question is a broader one. Because I realize now you speak less about focusing Asia these days than you used to and emphasizing more on the global network. Yes, sometimes in some way, they do intersect, but I'm wondering do you still focus on exploring some bolt-on opportunities in Asia and lost business in the future and do you have a capital distribution hierarchy or preference among dividend, buyback and growth. Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: Okay. Georges, do you want to take the first one? I'll give a few comments on the second one and you take the third one on capital distribution.\nGeorges Elhedery: Very good. Thanks, Noel. Jeremy, so without giving specific comments on the quarter-by-quarter specifics in the development of our fees and other income component, the growth that you've observed during the year in Q2 were mainly driven from two areas. The first one is wealth, which is obviously a very strategic area where we continue to invest and exhibited growth. The other one was from markets, in particular, from some of the equity business in markets. This is coming on the basis of two components: one, a subdued Q2 last year. So there was a base effect which benefited the outlook for Q2 this year. And then the second one is the fact that we've seen more activity and more vigorousness than if you want the Asian stock markets, in particular, the Hong Kong stock market. And we're encouraged by this. And if the trend continues, this will bode well for additional activity in this space. Let me jump to the third question, and I'll hand over to Noel to conclude on the second one. Capital distribution hierarchy. First, we've committed to 50% dividend payout ratio for this year, which means half our earnings will be earmarked for foreseeable dividend. Part of it will be distributed through our interim dividends. The rest will be netted out at the end of the year. After that, we obviously will use capital to support the organic growth of our business. Loan growth, as we said earlier, started to pick up in certain areas. We are encouraged but we have ample capital to support the loan growth, the appetite we have. We look at bolt-on acquisitions or areas that are dead on strategy, both supportive of acceleration of the strategy that will be part of utilization of excess capital and any excess beyond that we will distribute back to shareholders to a rolling series of share buybacks. If you look at our CET1 ratio today at 15% and you look at our capital accretion that we remain capital generative in the business based on the guidance we've given for this year and next year. We're confident we will have capacity to deliver on the three, and I will say the buybacks will continue looking at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis with the ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks.\nNoel Quinn: Thanks, Jeremy. And on your second question, is it an Asia strategy? Is there an international strategy? I think they're interchange. Well, I don't think they're mutually exclusive because if you look at what we do at the core of what we've done for 158 years or more is we've connected entrepreneurs and businesses who want to trade with the world. That's what we've done from day one of HSBC being founded. So we're essentially about helping businesses and individuals trade internationally, invest internationally. Now why are they one and the same? Well, a huge amount of the entrepreneurs that we have as clients are based in Asia, they're based in the Middle East, they're based in the East and they trade with the West and the West trades with the East. And Asia and the Middle East, the high-growth markets. So I don't think it's an either or. I think for us, it's very simple that is we're internationally driven. And Asia is a hugely connected international part of the world and will remain so going forward. The nature of trade will change as it has done for 158 years. So I think we use the words Asia and international is and probably interchangeably, and sometimes it gets people confused. We're investing where there is growth and where we have differentiation. There is growth, there is international connectivity. There is differentiation in Asia. There is in the Middle East. And we have the same here in the U.K. or fundamentally at the core, we're an international bank.\nOperator: Thank you, Noel.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions].

Noel, I just wanted to start off and congratulate you on your excellent tenure at HSBC. I just wanted to wish you the very best going forward or whatever it is you decide to do. And yes, Georges, on a similar thing, just to extend my congratulations around your appointment as CEO. I had two questions, please, both on net interest income. So a point of clarification. I guess your banking NII guide this year of circa $43 billion, that face value does imply a material step off in net interest income in H2. I just wanted to check, I mean you're guiding for Argentina being $1 billion this year, and I think it was the best part of $900 million in H1. So is it literally just Argentina dropping out of net interest income in H2 is driving that? And what would really, really help is the kind of momentum of NII in H2 and the extent to which that carries over into '25. I'm not necessarily looking for an updated guide here. But if I just take again your banking NII disclosure at face value, it's implying a kind of $42 billion annualized run rate in H2 ex-Argentina. What do you think the puts and takes are on that if we were to kind of look a bit further afield beyond this year? And then the second question was, if I could just get you to update your thoughts around deposit pass-throughs, you're obviously noting you've hedged more of your balance sheet now. And what is actually pass-throughs where to be, say, 10% lower than what you're modeling in your updated banking NII sensitivity, that would be really helpful. Thank you very much.\nNoel Quinn: Georges, do you want to take that?\nGeorges Elhedery: Yes, thanks Noel. Aman, thank you. So on your first question, look, 40 -- around $43 billion of banking NII for this year is a reasonable expectation. And we're more confident about it because we're already seven month into the year. And somewhat the forward rate outlook has become a bit less volatile than we've experienced over the last few months. Argentina, we have worked with a planning assumption of $1 billion. So within around $43 billion, we've factored in around $1 billion contribution from Argentina. It is a very difficult to predict number. It is a very volatile number, and therefore, the best of estimate you can use around $42 billion and add whatever other expectations you may have for Argentina, but we're sticking with this $1 billion estimate on the uncertainty, just for reference, $1 billion was the banking NII contribution of Argentina in 2023, and this is how we're building the assumption for our -- for planning for this year. Now if you look forward for H2, headwinds and tailwinds facing the banking NII. The first one to call out is the rate outlook. We're using the mid-July curves, which comprise broadly between one and two rate cuts across all the major currencies in the second half. This is the working assumption. The second one is on the structural hedge since we called out earlier, you should expect to benefit from the $55 billion maturing assets in 2H at 2.8% yields, which would be reinvested at higher yields than the prevailing yields in H2, which will be higher, take a five-year rate as a good benchmark for what rates will be reinvested at. But this is partly offset by the additional structural hedging we are likely to do on an inverted curve. Again, here, your best guide is what we've done in H1, $25 billion of additional structural hedging is a reasonable run rate to expect for H2, but will depend on market conditions in H2. The other components that are playing is headwinds and tailwinds are the balance sheet growth, where we continue to see strong growth in South and Southeast Asia. We continue to see resilience in the mortgage books in the U.K. and Hong Kong. But we are now encouraged to see stability in the Hong Kong wholesale book, which has been on a decline for a few quarters. It's early to call it a trend, but it is now -- it is definitely green shoots when we look forward, and it will be supported with rate reductions as in the balance sheet growth in this space. And then the last one to call out is deposit migration. That's particularly true in Hong Kong. Again, Q1, Q2, we've seen migration at 0% and 1%, respectively, which is a 1% overall on the half. Just to put it in perspective, this is after full-year '23, where we've seen 12%. So again, the trend here is much more encouraging. We're very unlikely to see anywhere near the trend of last year, but it remains a difficult one to predict. Now as you look forward into the full-year 2025, we're not guiding on banking NII, but a few points for you to bear in mind. The first one is, please remove Argentina's contribution. Again, working assumption, $1 billion, this is following the planned sale of Argentina to take place before the end of the year. Second, remove the one quarter contribution from Canada, $0.3 billion in your NII, then we've shared that there will be $105 billion of existing structural hedge assets which will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8%. So those will provide some tailwind as we reinvest them at higher yield. So beyond that, you can apply your own interest rate assumptions on the banking NII sensitivity we provided, $2.7 billion is the sensitivity we provided across all currencies for a 100 basis point drop. And you can apply your balance sheet growth assumption. And again, we believe lower rates will be more supportive of growth in balance sheet when you look into 2025. But basically, all of that is factored into our guidance for return on tangible equity for 2025 at mid-teens.\nAman Rakkar: So thank you very much. Color is excellent. Just around pass-throughs. I think earlier this year, you talked about 10% lower beats is adding something like $600 million.\nGeorges Elhedery: Okay, so the banking NII sensitivity to 10% change in pass-through rates is around $600 million. It remains around $600 million. And this is based on an assumption of around $600 billion of IPCAs. So we can work out the math, if you want offline. That number is broadly stable. We're still working on an assumption of a 50% pass-through in our banking NII sensitivity. Second, if you look at the cumulative pass-throughs, we're broadly around 50% from the start of the rate hikes in late 2022, all the way to now broadly around 50%. The earlier part was much lower than 50%. The latter part was much higher than 50%. It is difficult to predict how pass-throughs will work out on the rate cut scenario, and this is why I think 50% remains a good estimate of what it could look like, noting that we don't have recent history of that. I would point you to one thing to be mindful of is in the U.K. and a number of other geographies, we will have to provide customer notice of at least 60 days before we pass through rate cuts. So there will be a delay in pass-throughs on the way down, and that's a 60 to 90 day on average, for instance, in the U.K. Thank you, Aman.\nAman Rakkar: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you, Georges. Our next question today will come from Ed Firth at KBW. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nEdward Firth: Hi, thanks and again good morning everybody. Yes, and just echo Aman's comments and thank you, particularly do you know because it's been a pretty turbulent period for HSBC, I think there are a number of times when if somebody said you'd be making mid-teens returns, I think I would have thought that was delusional. So thank you very much for that. It benefits us all. My two questions were -- the first one was, could you tell me -- you probably disclosed it somewhere and I missed it, but performance-related pay, I see it is going to be flat this year. Is it possible to tell us what the total quantum of that is because I guess there must be some potential that, that may have to go up, particularly given the revenue performance. So that would be my first question. And then the second one is, to me, if I look at these results, I guess the standout to me was the performance in Q2 of the Wealth and Private Banking business. If I look in the past, it's generally been quite seasonal in Q2, but it seems that actually it's held up pretty flat. So should we expect that -- is that like a sort of new base level of run rate? Is that something we should continue into the second half now and then sort of grow on from there. Was there something about Q2, which held it up better than we might have expected. Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: Well, well, firstly, thank you for your comments. And on your second point on Wealth, listen, I'll give a very personal comment. You normally expect Q1 to be the seasonal high and then a bit lower in Q2 and a bit lower. So actually, Q2 did exceed expectations in terms of seasonality. It was a strong quarter. At the moment, I can't -- we tend to be a bit on the conservative side and say don't base a trend on a quarter or two. But I think your assessment there actually, Q2 was a strong performance is exactly where we are, it was stronger than probably one would have expected through normal seasonality. I think it is, if I talk to the team, they were confident of a good performance. They're seeing good lead indicators. I mean we've taken in, in excess of $250 billion of net new invested assets just over the last two and a bit years, two and half years. And I think we've all got to probably -- we haven't seen this period where how will cash move from cash to invested assets as interest rates come off. And therefore, I think it is difficult to predict a trend. I think we just got to see it go quarter-by-quarter, but the lead indicators are good. We've invested in the business over the last few years to put us in this position. It was all about getting ready for lower interest rates and being in a position to take advantage of it. We invested heavily in the product lineup for our clients to make sure that if they were going to move into invested assets, they could do so with us rather than another bank. And we invested in distribution. We had good distribution in Hong Kong, but we didn't have as good a distribution in other markets. So we built out distribution in Mainland China, in Singapore, in India and in the rest of the world. So I think it's put us in a good position to take advantage of it, but it's too early to call it a trend. But your observation is a fair observation for Q2. It was good. And it's nice to be able to report that. On performance-related pay and costs, I mean I'll let Georges cover that, but we're absolutely committed to the 5%, so.\nGeorges Elhedery: So we paid $3.8 billion through full-year 2023 on performance-related pay. This is disclosed in our annual reports and accounts. But if you look at how we accrued for that number through the year in 2023, we actually under accrued in the first quarter 2023. And then we topped it up at the fourth quarter to get to that total number. When you look at full-year 2024, we are accruing towards a broadly similar number for the full-year than for the full-year '23. And any decision on the performance rate pay will take place in January with the Remuneration Committee after the full-year's performance has been delivered. But we are accruing broadly to the same number. The difference is that we're accruing more evenly. So this is why you'll see a higher accrual on a year-on-year basis in the first half, and you will be seeing a lower accrual in the second half on that trajectory. It is -- all of this is factored in our cost guidance of limiting cost growth to around 5%. We're absolutely committed to our 5% or circa 5% cost growth guidance. We're confident we can deliver it, and we are on track to deliver it.\nOperator: Thank you, Georges. Our next question today comes from Katherine Lei at JPMorgan. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nNoel Quinn: Hi, Katherine.\nKatherine Lei: Hi, good morning. Thanks for answering my questions. I have one question, actually two, both related to capital. On the capital side, we saw there is $6.4 billion of addition to RWA. May I know like what is that related to, I think in the note is that something related to modeling. So I would like to know like what kind of assumption changes leads to this $6.4 billion? And is that one-off? Or should we see this ongoing, I would say, additions to the RWA. So this is number one. Number two, we noticed some deterioration on asset quality on [indiscernible] book actually according to the disclosures, the deterioration seems quite significant as well. Can you explain to us what is the impact on capital because we understand that there is a limited impact on ECL charges but mainly reflected on capital. So what is the drag on capital? And then also like going forward, whether it's your view on Hong Kong CRE, in particular, for the loans which are already Stage 2E categories. Are you expecting that there will be recovery of loans through disposal of the collaterals? Or are you expecting the borrowers will eventually make up for the loans? Thank you.\nNoel Quinn: Okay. Thanks, Katherine. Georges, do you want to pick up those points.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sure. Sure, Noel, thanks. Katherine, so on the capital, so we've indicated the $6.4 billion increase in RWAs due to modeling adjustment. To be specific, we've adjusted the probability of default models for banks globally. And the reason we adjusted this probability for default model for banks is because we wanted to factor in some of the observations and learnings from the March 2023 crisis in the way governments have supported the bank resolution, that's specifically true for the U.S. and Switzerland. We've taken those learnings. We've baked them in our modeling, and this resulted in this additional RWA, insofar that bank model is probability of default, et cetera are concerned, we consider this to be done. And if you ask me, well, we continuously look at our models in a general fashion, Look, the next big model update is going to be Basel 3.1 as and when Basel 3.1 becomes live in the various geographies or jurisdictions where we operate. We have not indicated the impact, which we do not expect to be material, but we're waiting to see some of the final rules that are still missing in a number of jurisdictions before we can call out the exact impact to the market, but we don't expect it to be material. In terms of Hong Kong CRE, we've spoken earlier about the 40% that is unsecured with which we remain very comfortable. And so your question probably relates to the other 60%, which is the secured portfolio of our $36 billion exposure. So of this about $3.2 billion are credit impaired. What's happening basically is a number of -- a few of our customers basically are facing some short-term cash flow pressure challenges, and this is partly due to high rates. But the balance sheet remains strong and our level of collateralization remains strong. Typically, for this impaired $3.2 billion portfolio, the level of collateralization on average is 55% loan to value. So that -- this is why there is a material of any ECL impact from the designation to Stage 3. In terms of the capital impact, some of -- depending on which models we're using and what form of lending it is, some of the impact may manifest in RWAs and we've seen a little bit of that in last quarter. Some of it will manifest in EEL, excess expected loss, which will go straight into our CET1, we publish these numbers, but by and large, these are immaterial numbers. And again, it's all supported by the fact that we have a very strong level of collateralization against the exposure. As we look forward, first, these customers, the specifically credit impaired customers are current, remain current. We expect some of the pressure they're facing to ease as rates reduce and as economic activity in Hong Kong picks up. In terms of medium- to long-term outlook for the sector, we are actually positive. We are confident first in the Hong Kong economy in general to rebound. But in particular, for the sector, we expect that the sector's pressure will ease in the medium to long-term, and we remain confident and positive about the sector.\nOperator: Thank you, George. We have time for one last question today, and that comes from Gurpreet Singh Sahi from Goldman Sachs. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you.\nGurpreet Singh Sahi: Thank you. Can you guys hear me?\nNoel Quinn: Yes, yes, very good.\nGurpreet Singh Sahi: Okay, good morning. Noel, first of all -- and Georges, congrats and Noel, congratulations for a new part wherever you choose to be.\nNoel Quinn: Thank you.\nGurpreet Singh Sahi: Thank you for the helpful disclosures on the hedge, et cetera. I have a question regarding -- two questions, which are pretty much linked regarding falling rates and how does the management see it. First of all, the wealth income. It's an odd cycle with wealth income and AUM growth rates being elevated as interest rates are high. So when they do fall, do we have any precedent as to whether they will be an impact on the wealth income from falling rates or we don't get that much benefit from income. We see right now that a lot of Mainland Chinese money is also coming out and parking in Hong Kong. So that's the first part of the question. The second is lending growth, we have targets for mid-single-digit. But when we think about modeling banking NII, we have to look at average interest earning assets. So I'm wondering, we have lots of liquidity on the balance sheet. If rates do fall, and then some of these depositors don't feel incentivized. Do we get overall deposit growth not so strong, which internal leads to average interest-earning assets not growing and hence, we should not be modeling in average interest earning assets growth at mid-single digits, so help us shrink out that. Thank you so much.\nNoel Quinn: Okay. I think Georges will pick up both of those.\nGeorges Elhedery: Very good. Thanks, Noel. Gurpreet, so first, one thing on the way we report it essentially is fees and other income. So the slide I have there for wealth, that's particularly the fees part, which is fees earned on assets under management or on -- for insurance, in particular, related to new business CSM. So the impact, if you want, on rates is more about transition of customers from deposits into AUMs. So this has been happening. We are seeing some of our deposits move into net new invested assets and transferring if you want to AUMs and our wealth proposition. It is likely on a trend basis that when rates come down and deposit -- the earnings you can make on deposits reduce that customer may shift some of it into AUMs through, we'll be visible now the net new invested assets proposition, and then we will be able to service them in the fee space. So yes, there is a component where we do expect more wealth activity to take place as we see deposits being less remunerative, but this is more on a broad trend basis, not a direct linkage. We are also benefiting from the structural growth of wealth, in particular, in Asia, where we believe the underlying market is growing at very high-single-digit, if not double-digit percent over the next five years. And on top of that underlying growth, which we're benefiting from, we are taking market share because of our additional investment in this space. So this is definitely a platform that can benefit from a number of trends that will support the momentum. On your second point, it's a very good point because we talk about balance sheet growth and loan growth, but we have also strong dependence for our banking NII to deposit growth, which constitute the underlying for our average interest earning assets. So we've seen this quarter deposit growing 2%. I caution you not to annualize the 2% because some of it is seasonal, some of it is one-off. But we have a fantastic deposit franchise. I mean you know us everywhere we operate, we have a very strong balance sheet that's very appealing, and we have a very strong proposition in deposits and transaction banking for both wholesale and retail, which means that we will continuously look to capture deposits. We continue winning global payment solutions mandates in the wholesale space. We continue being attractive for retail customers, and we just shared, Noel shared 345,000 new customers joining our Hong Kong business alone. This is in the U.K. in 2023, we added 1 million new customers. So therefore, we do continue seeing a good momentum, underlying momentum to grow our deposits with this very attractive deposit franchise of ours.\nNoel Quinn: I think I'd reinforce that and add another comment. The trick for us in the past, we were very good as a retail bank. We were very good as a corporate bank. But when customers, whether they were retail customers or corporate customers wanting to invest in alternative asset classes other than cash, they tended to go to other banks because our product range and our distribution wasn't strong enough. We deliberately set out to invest in our products and distribution capability for wealth. So that, that cash, if it did move, it moved within the bank, not outside the bank. One of the byproduct benefits is if you've got a good wealth proposition, you also attract the cash. You keep the cash in the bank as well. They go hand-in-hand. And so I think look, I think we're in a very different position today in offering wealth propositions to clients. And what we've done is deliberately try to diversify the revenue stream. So it's less dependent on purely corporate banking and retail banking. And there is a continuum from retail and corporate banking into banking the individuals and the entrepreneurs in their personal capacity and doing their wealth management in their personal capacity. And that's, I think, the exciting trend for the future. And I think that's why we believe that we're well positioned to deliver mid-teens ROTE next year because we have that diversity and that continuum of offering. So I just want to say that's not a by chance strategy. That was a very deliberate strategy to keep both the cash in the bank and the invested assets in the bank.\nOperator: Thank you. That ends today's Q&A. So I will now hand back to Noel for closing remarks.\nNoel Quinn: Well, thank you, Louise, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before we close, I'd like to thank you for your questions and for all the discussions we've had over the last five years. I've always enjoyed representing my colleagues when we announce our results, and I'm really pleased that the strong first half numbers announced today demonstrate the improved financial performance that our strategy execution is driven. It's been over 15 years since the group has generated returns at the current levels and our new guidance underlines that we expect to be able to sustain it through this year and in 2025. I wish Georges, the team and all of you the very best and enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for joining today's webinar.

        "text": "Good morning to everyone in London, and good afternoon to those joining from Hong Kong. Today is my last results announcement before Georges takes over in September. I'm delighted to be handing the stewardship of the bank over to him. Georges is an exceptional leader who understand what makes HSBC special. I'd like to thank my colleagues around the world for everything they've done over the last five years. And I wish Georges every success for the future. I have always been immensely proud of the heritage of this bank and the strategic role it plays in the world. But when I took this job on five years ago, we didn't have the financial performance to match our standing. My aim was to change that. I believe we've done so and created a strong platform for future growth. This was evidenced by the record profit performance last year and by the strong first half performance this year, revenue of $37.3 billion was up 1%. Profit before tax of $21.6 billion was stable on the same period last year. This performance enabled continued strong capital generation. Our return on tangible equity was 17%, excluding notable items. We've announced $4.8 billion of further capital distributions today. This takes the total capital we have distributed by way of dividends and buybacks in respect of the last 18 months to $34.4 billion. Finally, we've updated our guidance to reflect our increased confidence about the future. We're providing new guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025. In addition to the 2024 guidance we already had. We're upgrading our 2024 banking NII guidance from at least $41 billion to around $43 billion. We're revising our 2024 ECL guidance to be back within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. And we're reconfirming our 2024 cost guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. That's despite growth of 7% in the first half, which as Georges will explain, is mainly due to timing differences compared to last year. The benefits of our strategy execution over the last five years are evidence in our performance. Before getting into detail on the further progress made over the last six months, please allow me to share some reflections on our five year journey. When we set out, there were two key strategies to delivering higher returns. The first thing we had to do was to reshape our portfolio. Building on the work of my predecessors who initiated important structural changes, we've continued to exit businesses and client portfolios that were non-strategic, subscale and unprofitable. First, via organic portfolio reductions, which delivered RWA savings of around $128 billion. And then via inorganic means through disposals. The second and very important strategy, which we commenced at the same time was to build alternative sources of revenue growth. Within this, we've invested to grow fee income, particularly in areas where we have significant strengths such as wholesale transaction banking and wealth. We've also continued to invest in our differentiated international propositions. And we've significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates from approximately $7 billion of banking NII for a 100 basis points down shock in interest rates at 30th of June 2022 to around $3.4 billion at the end of 2023 and now down to around $2.7 billion today. All of this had to be underpinned by a culture of cost discipline, which we have instilled across the group. These savings enabled us to invest in the areas I've spoken about. And this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance. As you know, we delivered a record profit in 2023 and a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2023 and in the first half of 2024. It has been over 15 years since the group was generating returns at current levels. And we now expect to sustain it this year and in 2025. The other tangible measure of success is capital distributions to our shareholders. I'm really pleased that we delivered around $54 billion by way of dividends and buybacks to our shareholders over the last five years, including the distributions announced today. And I'm especially pleased to have paid the special dividend of $0.21 per share earlier this year following the sale of HSBC Canada. I see this payment not just as a financial return, but as a return for the loyalty that our shareholders have shown us over the recent years. Let me now summarize the further progress evidenced in the first half. First, wealth has been a key component of revenue diversification strategy. It delivered two very good quarters, growing revenue by 12% in total. In Transaction Banking, fee and other income in Global Payment Solutions grew by 4% and in Global Trade Solutions by 1% in a very difficult environment for trade. Revenue for HSBC Innovation Banking was up 4% quarter-on-quarter as our new global proposition continues to gain traction. Second, our scale markets in Hong Kong and the U.K. enabled us to grow profits each year as we captured new opportunities in both the corporate and retail businesses. As you can see, we also have positive growth in other markets, including India, which was up 4% in the first half and Singapore, which was up 2%. Third, we continue to grow multi-jurisdictional client revenue in both wholesale and retail. Fourth, we saw good growth in both customer lending and deposits in the second quarter despite what is still a relatively sluggish environment. Finally, we've continued to grow the size and duration of the structural hedge to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate movements. Georges has new disclosures on the expected benefits in his section. All of this progress underlines why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity this year and in 2025 as well. Let me get into some more detail. The steps we've taken to change our retail business model and our continued investment in people and digitization have made wealth a key driver of revenue growth. Wealth revenue was up 12% in the first half to $4.3 billion. And that growth is broad-based. As you can see in the boxes on the right side of the slide, wealth fee and other income was up 14%. Private Banking revenue was up 16%. We attracted $32 billion of net new invested assets. Our new business insurance CSM was up 77%. Moving to the next topic. Transaction Banking revenue was stable in the first half. There was good growth in payments, which was up 3%. This included growth in fee and other income of 4%. This is a result of the investment we made to grow and digitize that business, which helped to improve our ranking from a top four bank in 2022 to number two today. Foreign exchange was down 8% compared to a strong performance last year when there was very high volatility. And while trade was slightly down in the half, the pace of decline slowed to the point that it was broadly flat in the second quarter. But we still grew our trade volumes despite global trade volumes remaining subdued. And we also increased our market share in trade in Hong Kong to more than 26%. On the next topic, our businesses in Hong Kong and the U.K. both continue to perform well in the first half. Profit before tax in Hong Kong was up 1% on a constant currency basis, while the Hong Kong corporate loan market remains subdued, it was resilience in the second quarter. It's too early to call it a trend, but deposits and investment activity increased, which underlines that the right differential works in both directions. We attracted 345,000 new to bank customers in the half as we continue to capitalize on significant inflows into Hong Kong from customers seeking opportunities for investment. Profit before tax in the U.K. business grew by 11%, excluding the gain on SVB U.K. last year. Customer lending was also up 2%, but our U.K. business is differentiated by its connectivity with the rest of the group. In the first half, we grew the number of U.K. international customers by 8% to 2.7 million customers. We have a strong international franchise. We evidenced this through our multi-jurisdictional revenue disclosures in February. And in the first half, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 4% to $9.7 billion. And as I said earlier, this isn't just a wholesale story. We're doing more with our international retail and wealth customers as well. We now have 7 million international wealth and personal banking customers with revenue from these customers up 6% to $5.4 billion. So these are the levers that have put us on track to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity this year and why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025. With that, I'll hand over to Georges. Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Noel, and hello, everyone. Before I get to the Q2 numbers, I'd like to comment briefly on the recent announcement. I'm deeply honored by the trust placed in me to lead this great institution into the future. Many of you may have questions about the future strategy and direction of the group. Although I don't take over as Group Chief Executive until the 2nd of September from Noel, I'm ready to share a few high level thoughts. Under Noel's leadership, we have delivered financial performance and built a strong platform for growth. The strategy of the group is working, and I'm committed to building on this. The shape of the group is broadly where we wanted to be with the bulk of our capital and other resources deployed in our four scale activities that's Hong Kong, the U.K. Our international wholesale bank underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities and our wealth proposition, particularly in Asia. This puts us in a very strong position. In each of these activities, we have scale and sustainable competitive advantages, and our strength are aligned to the needs of our customers. They account for the vast majority of the economic profit we generate today and present some of our most exciting opportunities to grow over the next five to 10 years. And together, they are capable of delivering above cost of capital returns sustainably through the cycle. We've made good progress and we are now in a position to accelerate the pace of execution of the strategy with focus and intensity to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, to improve operating leverage, while maintaining strong cost discipline and prudent risk management and to continue to improve client service and experience. You'll also have seen that we have announced this morning that Jon Bingham has been appointed Interim Group CFO from the 2nd of September. Jon is currently our Financial Controller, and has outstanding technical accounting and regulatory knowledge and expertise. A process to identify the next permanent group CFO is underway, and I will update you further in due course. Now though, turning to Q2. In summary, profit before tax of $8.9 billion was up $0.4 billion on the second quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis. In terms of the drivers, the banking NII run rate was stable on the first quarter. There was another strong wealth performance, while wholesale transaction banking was stable in last year's second quarter. Despite cost growth of 7% in the first half on a target basis, we remain on track to meet our 2024 guidance of around 5% cost growth, and there was growth in both loans and deposits in the quarter. On the next slide, so HSBC Canada contributed around $0.5 billion of revenue and around $0.2 billion of profit before tax in the quarter before the sale completed in March. To make like-for-like comparisons easier, these contributions and some other impacts have been excluded from some of the commentary. So excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions, profit before tax was up 7% to $9.1 billion. Revenue of $16.5 billion was up $0.3 billion on the second quarter of last year. Excluding notable items and the impact of strategic transactions, revenue was up $0.8 billion or 5% on the second quarter of last year. Banking NII of $10.9 billion was down $0.4 billion on the first quarter on a reported FX basis, primarily because of a $0.3 billion reduction from the Canada sale. Excluding this, the banking NII run rate was stable. We're now in a position to upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance to around $43 billion. This assumes a $1 billion contribution from Argentina, which was its reported NII in 2023, although we note that it remains volatile and difficult to predict. We're also providing new details to help you understand the expected benefits from the structural hedge. Around $55 billion of assets are due to mature in the second half of 2024 with an average yield of 2.8%, and around $105 billion of assets will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8% as well. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was stable on the second quarter of last year or up 2% excluding the impact of strategic transactions. Within this, Global Payment Solutions had another good quarter, up 2% as the security services, which was up 3%. Foreign exchange delivered broadly stable revenue compared to a strong quarter last year. And wealth had another very good quarter, underlying that our investment is continuing to drive improved results. Wealth fee and other income was up by 13% compared to last year's second quarter. Private Banking was a standout performer mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia. But growth in wealth remained broad-based. Customer growth and improved wealth penetration primarily in Asia, helped drive growth in investment distribution. Invested assets were up 2% to $1.3 trillion, including $6 billion of net new invested assets in the quarter. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.6 billion, up $0.2 billion on the second quarter of last year. On credit, expected credit losses were $0.3 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 15 basis points of average loans. This included $0.4 billion of recoveries and other items mentioned on the slide. Excluding these, ECLs were broadly in line with our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. Stage 3 balances were 2.4% of customer loans, up $1.4 billion compared to the first quarter. This was driven by Hong Kong commercial real estate book, but there was a limited impact on ECL charge because of the high level of collateralization. We are revising our 2024 ECL guidance to our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points of average loans. Next, costs grew by 7% in the first half on a target basis, but we remain on track to meet our guidance of 2024 cost growth of around 5%. 2 percentage points of cost growth in the first half came from higher performance-related pay accrual and levies. As we explained at the first quarter, we have phased the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than last year. We do not expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be materially different to 2023. So the accrual in the second half is expected to be lower year-on-year. In addition, the second half of last year included $0.3 billion of levies that we do not expect to repeat this year. We are, therefore, reconfirming our guidance of around 5% cost growth for 2024 on a target basis and we remain committed to cost discipline. On lending and deposits, there was positive loan growth in the quarter in both the U.K. and Asia, whilst Hong Kong was broadly stable. Overall, we are promising signs in the first half. Deposits were up 2% with the majority of this in Hong Kong. There was also growth in the U.K., Europe and U.S. and the rest of Asia, but it also included the benefits of seasonality in commercial banking and a large one-off in Global Banking and Markets. So I would encourage you not to annualize the 2% figure. Next, our CET1 ratio was 15%, down 20 basis points on the first quarter as strong organic capital generation was offset by distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We have announced a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we expect to complete within three months and to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points on our CET1 ratio in the third quarter. Finally, to recap, our strong first half performance and our confidence about the bank's position enable us to provide new guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items for 2025, in addition to our existing mid-teens guidance for 2024. Upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance from at least $41 billion to around $43 billion, revise our 2024 ECL guidance to within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points and we confirm our guidance for '24 cost growth of around 5% on a target basis and mid-single digit loan growth over the medium term. With that, Louis, can we please go to Q&A. Thank you."

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you both for your comments. A couple of questions from my side, one big picture, one into the numbers. First, a big picture question. Noel, you highlighted all the things you can be out of journal and any, but perhaps with the benefit of hindsight be interested in any thoughts you have or anything you might have done differently? And then linked to that as well, George, I think you're on the tape this morning talking about accelerating the existing execution. So any tangible examples you can provide on that would be helpful as well. And then in terms of the numbers question, thank you for the additional disclosure around structural hedge. I think you talked about $55 billion maturing in second half at a 2.8% yield. Is it fair to assume the new positions that you're putting on are probably about 1% higher than that, given where the forward curve is? So prior to any of debt from adding to the existing structural hedge notional. It's about $0.5 billion of NII uplift. Is that fair?"

And look, you never finish with an institution like this, and that's why Georges is right to comment there. You always want to do more yours. There's always things you want to improve. There's always investment you can do to grow more revenue, to improve customer experience, improve systems and processes. So there's never a notion of finishing. There's always -- should always be a notion of continuous improvement and continuous ambition. And I think that's probably the bridge from me to Georges, because I have no regrets about the last five years. I think we've done a lot of good things, and I thank my colleagues for everything they've done. But equally, you should never be complacent and think the job is finished. The job of running an organization as large as ours and with so much opportunity before us to further improve is never finished, and that's the bridge over to Georges now to take it on to the next level and to continue to execute the strategy. So Georges, hand to you on both of the next two questions, please?"

      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thanks, Noel. Yes, Andrew, it was just echoing Noel and building on that. We've called out some of the key areas of our strategy. I've called out Hong Kong, the U.K., the international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by a leading transaction banking capabilities as well as wealth, all of which have demonstrated very strong momentum, certainly over the last few years, but definitely over the first half of this year, we're confident about the momentum. We're confident in our ability to continue investing in them. And we're confident also we have ample capital to support additional growth. So it's just about getting pace -- continued pace in the execution of this strategy that has proved its results. On your question about the structural hedge, Andrew. So $55 billion are expected to mature over the course of the second half at an average yield of 2.8%. If I try to reverse engineer your math and if you assume the reinvestment happens at around 3.8%, with a 1% uplift, then you get $500 billion. But remember, this is maturities that are happening over the course of the half. Therefore, I think you have to average the number and therefore you have to assume half the number as in-year 2024 benefit from that structure and hedging investment. So say, the half of your $0.5 billion you quoted. Also bear in mind that we are increasing the structural hedge, subject to market conditions. We've done about $25 billion in the first half. It's a good estimate of the run rate for the second half. And that is a mild headwind, because we're increasing the hedge from higher short-term rates into lower longer-term rates due to the inversion of the curve. So you have to take all of this into consideration when factoring in the impact for 2024 banking NII."

So I think consensus is about 14%. So I guess a bit of variation on mid-teens, but if that's kind of 15%, 16%, 17%. Just curious where you see a bit more upside. Is that mainly on the revs or can you see a bit more cost control? And then linked to that, Georges, I think in your comments as well, you talked about growing revenues on a sustainable basis. So just curious, again, how you're thinking about that potentially with some NII headwinds? And then lastly, Noel, I think you used the term sluggish or subdued a few times when talking about the environment. Just curious when you think that will potentially turn and we can see a more constructive environment for some of those markets? Thank you."

        "text": "Sounds good, Amit. I'll ask Georges to answer the first one, I think, is probably best on the mid-teens and the definition of mid-teens and then also maybe sustainable revenue. And then I'll cover the third."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Very good. Thank you, Amit. So consensus -- if you adjust consensus for 2025 for the impact of the loss from the sale of Argentina, which -- by the way, as we communicated now, we expect by the end of the year. Therefore, it's more reasonable to assume that that loss the recycling of the foreign exchange loss of $5 billion, which has no impact on capital or on distribution it's fair to assume that impact will happen in '24. But if you adjust the consensus in '25, you get to around 14% indeed. Our definition of mid-teens is broadly around 14% to 16%. So without commenting on the consensus, our mid-teens definition is broadly that 14%, 16% range. On the growing revenue on a sustainable basis, let me point you to three major indicators, which are going to be important in the way we look at the future. The first one related to banking NII. Banking NII, number one, has been stabilized partly with the reduction of banking NII sensitivity. If you recall, two years ago, we called down $7 billion to be the impact on banking NII on our revenue for a 100 basis point drop in interest rates. That number at the year-end was $3.4 billion. And that number, as we reported it now is $2.7 billion. So therefore, we have through activities of structural hedging, but also through other methodology improvements and balance sheet composition, we have reduced the dependency of our earnings and of our banking NII to the impact of low rates. The second component, again, relating to banking NII is that while for a few quarters, we've seen subdued loan growth in particular in the U.K. and Hong Kong wholesale market. We have now seen stabilization. It's early to call it a trend, but we are encouraged by the stabilization we've observed. And importantly, we will be more encouraged to when we see rates coming off in the support they can have for loan growth, in particular in these two areas that historically have been a little bit more sluggish. Other parts of our activity remained resilient loan growth and in South and Southeast Asia remained very strong loan growth in the mortgage businesses and the U.K. and Hong Kong remain very strong. So there is a volume component to banking NII, which we supported. And as you can see from our capital, we have ample capacity to support loan growth. And the third component I would call out is the non-banking NII part of our earnings. Fees and other income in particular wholesale transaction banking and wealth. You've seen the momentum in these businesses. You've seen the continued investment we've put in these businesses. We believe these momentums are sustainable. There's an underlying sustain sustainable trend supporting wealth in particular, in Asia. And there is an additional support through our own investments, both technology and people relationship management related to support growth in this area, and we believe the momentum is sustainable. So those are the big -- broadly three components that we believe will sustain our earnings as we look into the future."

        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "And Amit, just to come a little bit more elaboration on the sluggish subdued. Listen, I'm not surprised that the corporate loan market is a bit subdued at the moment. But I think it's right for that to be the case because in the higher interest rate environment, there's not many corporates out there want to borrow at today's interest rates. And actually, they've still got a lot of cash sitting on their balance sheet. They don't need to borrow, which is a good position to be in. But as you see interest rates come down, I would expect there to be a pickup in activity. And I suppose, what Georges just said is, we're starting to see the very early signs of that starting to emerge. It's very early. It's too early to call it a trend. But I was pleased in Hong Kong, the rate of decline in the lending book -- corporate lending book in Hong Kong in Q1 reduced dramatically. So we've been declining through 2023. And it actually plateaued in the Q2 and there was us in Hong Kong. And then in the rest of Asia, we saw a growth in Q1 and Q2. And in the rest of the world, we saw growth in Q1 and Q2. So Q1 was the first time we saw net growth in corporate lending. Q2, we saw net growth as well. So I think it's encouraging early signs as interest rates come off, I see that happening. And the other thing is, we've also got to remember, there's another site of the Hong Kong market. The deposit market and the investment market is very strong, as you saw in our wealth businesses. Now the net new invested assets going in to the business. I think in the first half of this year was about $34 billion, if I remember correctly. And I think as rates come off, cash moves into invested assets. And I think we're seeing -- we're a beneficiary of that, particularly in Hong Kong, where rate differentials are playing strongly into the investment market, whereas they're subduing, the rate differentials are subduing the demand for loans in the Hong Kong market, but the rate differential is working in the opposite direction on investments. Okay. Next question."

So on the ROTE guidance, if you look in the first half of the year, you've kind of done an underlying number of 17%, and that was with some -- you've had a few credit headwinds, but generally benign. I mean I guess if you think about things like cash moving into invested assets, which should be higher ROE. Your wealth and personal banking ROEs around 31% at the moment. You're doing about a 22% U.K. ROE. I guess, what would hold you back from maintaining that level in '25 and '26, notwithstanding some rate cuts? It seems like there's a lot more flex in the model from the -- in your business model. I mean I know you need to be conservative, but I guess is it rates that would hold you back lack of activity? And I guess the follow-on question..."

I think it is too early to call a return to volume growth in the corporate loan market in substantial proportions. I think we all expect the rates to come off and cash to move from cash to invested assets. I think we're just -- it's still a bit early in the cycle. There's a lot of uncertainty still out there. And I think given our guidance of mid-teens, which is somewhere between the 14% and 16% range is fair at this point in time. I think the most important thing we've tried to do over the past few years is deliver each quarter and let each quarter be the base for the future. So I think it's better to set reasonable and sensible guidance, and then we continue to evidence progress against that as quarter-by-quarter go. So I don't think we're in the mold as an institution of being overly bullish one way or the other, particularly when there's still quite a bit of uncertainty out there.

The first one is just trying to understand how the notional size of the hedge is changing in the U.K. versus the rest of the world? My understanding was that the structural hedging in the U.K. is quite a mature book. So I wouldn't have expected that to increase in size going forward. And I would think that most of the low-yielding refinancings are coming from the U.K. But as when we think about the rest of the world, it looks like your structural hedging was more recent. So there's probably scope to increase that, but maybe the refinancing yield is a bit higher. Is that kind of right understanding, is the first question? The second question is just coming to the Hong Kong CRE book and some of the disclosures we've pulled out there. I think $36 billion of total exposure, 40% of that is unsecured. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more additional color around the unsecured part of Hong Kong CRE. I think you say it's very good quality, but how you look to manage the risks given the unsecured nature of this CRE book? Thank you."
      },
      {

      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure, Noel. So Raul, on the hedge size, we haven't given the specific currency split to a balance sheet split. But yes, you should assume the Sterling component is one of the largest component in terms of the hedge size. And the U.K., therefore, the Sterling component is one of the most mature by way of size of hedge, but there is obviously still or previous hedges maturing, previous hedges stuck at lower yields maturing, and we're able to benefit from the reinvestment of maturing hedges at higher yield. That was still a component in the U.K. bank's NIM which has been broadly stable, and we expect to remain broadly stable and the structural hedge reinvestment is playing a role in that. With regards to the rest of the world, it's a story of two tales, indeed, there is a reinvestment of all structural hedges at higher yields, and that is a tailwind in our banking NII. There is also additional hedges we're doing where we can, and these additional hedges are suffering from a partial -- a partial set off or a partial offset as a headwind because they're suffering from the fact that are inverted, but it's still the right thing to do for the management of our banking NII sensitivity. And then, obviously, always keep in mind that the Hong Kong dollar exposure we have remains largely under hedged, and that's due to the fact that the structure of the market does not give us enough instruments to be able to invest in the long-term to support hedging. So the Hong Kong dollar would remain structurally underhedged in that sense. With regards to the Hong Kong CRE question. So 40% of the book is -- of the $36 billion you mentioned is unsecured, it is typically exposure to large conglomerates with a diversified revenue stream, including revenue streams from activities not related to real estate, 90% of that book today is rated strong and good and literally 0% is in the impaired category. We're very comfortable over the exposure we've had in that book and we continue obviously supporting our customers through the cycle in this phase."

But do you expect that momentum to continue going forward? Or do you think in the second half of last year is relatively a weak comparison? Yes. The second question is a broader one. Because I realize now you speak less about focusing Asia these days than you used to and emphasizing more on the global network. Yes, sometimes in some way, they do intersect, but I'm wondering do you still focus on exploring some bolt-on opportunities in Asia and lost business in the future and do you have a capital distribution hierarchy or preference among dividend, buyback and growth.

        "text": "Very good. Thanks, Noel. Jeremy, so without giving specific comments on the quarter-by-quarter specifics in the development of our fees and other income component, the growth that you've observed during the year in Q2 were mainly driven from two areas. The first one is wealth, which is obviously a very strategic area where we continue to invest and exhibited growth. The other one was from markets, in particular, from some of the equity business in markets. This is coming on the basis of two components: one, a subdued Q2 last year. So there was a base effect which benefited the outlook for Q2 this year. And then the second one is the fact that we've seen more activity and more vigorousness than if you want the Asian stock markets, in particular, the Hong Kong stock market. And we're encouraged by this. And if the trend continues, this will bode well for additional activity in this space. Let me jump to the third question, and I'll hand over to Noel to conclude on the second one. Capital distribution hierarchy. First, we've committed to 50% dividend payout ratio for this year, which means half our earnings will be earmarked for foreseeable dividend. Part of it will be distributed through our interim dividends. The rest will be netted out at the end of the year. After that, we obviously will use capital to support the organic growth of our business. Loan growth, as we said earlier, started to pick up in certain areas. We are encouraged but we have ample capital to support the loan growth, the appetite we have. We look at bolt-on acquisitions or areas that are dead on strategy, both supportive of acceleration of the strategy that will be part of utilization of excess capital and any excess beyond that we will distribute back to shareholders to a rolling series of share buybacks. If you look at our CET1 ratio today at 15% and you look at our capital accretion that we remain capital generative in the business based on the guidance we've given for this year and next year. We're confident we will have capacity to deliver on the three, and I will say the buybacks will continue looking at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis with the ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks."

        "text": "Thanks, Jeremy. And on your second question, is it an Asia strategy? Is there an international strategy? I think they're interchange. Well, I don't think they're mutually exclusive because if you look at what we do at the core of what we've done for 158 years or more is we've connected entrepreneurs and businesses who want to trade with the world. That's what we've done from day one of HSBC being founded. So we're essentially about helping businesses and individuals trade internationally, invest internationally. Now why are they one and the same? Well, a huge amount of the entrepreneurs that we have as clients are based in Asia, they're based in the Middle East, they're based in the East and they trade with the West and the West trades with the East. And Asia and the Middle East, the high-growth markets. So I don't think it's an either or. I think for us, it's very simple that is we're internationally driven. And Asia is a hugely connected international part of the world and will remain so going forward. The nature of trade will change as it has done for 158 years. So I think we use the words Asia and international is and probably interchangeably, and sometimes it gets people confused. We're investing where there is growth and where we have differentiation. There is growth, there is international connectivity. There is differentiation in Asia. There is in the Middle East. And we have the same here in the U.K. or fundamentally at the core, we're an international bank."

        "text": "Good morning. Noel, I just wanted to start off and congratulate you on your excellent tenure at HSBC. I just wanted to wish you the very best going forward or whatever it is you decide to do. And yes, Georges, on a similar thing, just to extend my congratulations around your appointment as CEO. I had two questions, please, both on net interest income. So a point of clarification. I guess your banking NII guide this year of circa $43 billion, that face value does imply a material step off in net interest income in H2. I just wanted to check, I mean you're guiding for Argentina being $1 billion this year, and I think it was the best part of $900 million in H1. So is it literally just Argentina dropping out of net interest income in H2 is driving that? And what would really, really help is the kind of momentum of NII in H2 and the extent to which that carries over into '25. I'm not necessarily looking for an updated guide here. But if I just take again your banking NII disclosure at face value, it's implying a kind of $42 billion annualized run rate in H2 ex-Argentina. What do you think the puts and takes are on that if we were to kind of look a bit further afield beyond this year? And then the second question was, if I could just get you to update your thoughts around deposit pass-throughs, you're obviously noting you've hedged more of your balance sheet now. And what is actually pass-throughs where to be, say, 10% lower than what you're modeling in your updated banking NII sensitivity, that would be really helpful. Thank you very much."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Yes, thanks Noel. Aman, thank you. So on your first question, look, 40 -- around $43 billion of banking NII for this year is a reasonable expectation. And we're more confident about it because we're already seven month into the year. And somewhat the forward rate outlook has become a bit less volatile than we've experienced over the last few months. Argentina, we have worked with a planning assumption of $1 billion. So within around $43 billion, we've factored in around $1 billion contribution from Argentina. It is a very difficult to predict number. It is a very volatile number, and therefore, the best of estimate you can use around $42 billion and add whatever other expectations you may have for Argentina, but we're sticking with this $1 billion estimate on the uncertainty, just for reference, $1 billion was the banking NII contribution of Argentina in 2023, and this is how we're building the assumption for our -- for planning for this year. Now if you look forward for H2, headwinds and tailwinds facing the banking NII. The first one to call out is the rate outlook. We're using the mid-July curves, which comprise broadly between one and two rate cuts across all the major currencies in the second half. This is the working assumption. The second one is on the structural hedge since we called out earlier, you should expect to benefit from the $55 billion maturing assets in 2H at 2.8% yields, which would be reinvested at higher yields than the prevailing yields in H2, which will be higher, take a five-year rate as a good benchmark for what rates will be reinvested at. But this is partly offset by the additional structural hedging we are likely to do on an inverted curve. Again, here, your best guide is what we've done in H1, $25 billion of additional structural hedging is a reasonable run rate to expect for H2, but will depend on market conditions in H2. The other components that are playing is headwinds and tailwinds are the balance sheet growth, where we continue to see strong growth in South and Southeast Asia. We continue to see resilience in the mortgage books in the U.K. and Hong Kong. But we are now encouraged to see stability in the Hong Kong wholesale book, which has been on a decline for a few quarters. It's early to call it a trend, but it is now -- it is definitely green shoots when we look forward, and it will be supported with rate reductions as in the balance sheet growth in this space. And then the last one to call out is deposit migration. That's particularly true in Hong Kong. Again, Q1, Q2, we've seen migration at 0% and 1%, respectively, which is a 1% overall on the half. Just to put it in perspective, this is after full-year '23, where we've seen 12%. So again, the trend here is much more encouraging. We're very unlikely to see anywhere near the trend of last year, but it remains a difficult one to predict. Now as you look forward into the full-year 2025, we're not guiding on banking NII, but a few points for you to bear in mind. The first one is, please remove Argentina's contribution. Again, working assumption, $1 billion, this is following the planned sale of Argentina to take place before the end of the year. Second, remove the one quarter contribution from Canada, $0.3 billion in your NII, then we've shared that there will be $105 billion of existing structural hedge assets which will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8%. So those will provide some tailwind as we reinvest them at higher yield. So beyond that, you can apply your own interest rate assumptions on the banking NII sensitivity we provided, $2.7 billion is the sensitivity we provided across all currencies for a 100 basis point drop. And you can apply your balance sheet growth assumption. And again, we believe lower rates will be more supportive of growth in balance sheet when you look into 2025. But basically, all of that is factored into our guidance for return on tangible equity for 2025 at mid-teens."

        "text": "So thank you very much. Color is excellent. Just around pass-throughs. I think earlier this year, you talked about 10% lower beats is adding something like $600 million."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Okay, so the banking NII sensitivity to 10% change in pass-through rates is around $600 million. It remains around $600 million. And this is based on an assumption of around $600 billion of IPCAs. So we can work out the math, if you want offline. That number is broadly stable. We're still working on an assumption of a 50% pass-through in our banking NII sensitivity. Second, if you look at the cumulative pass-throughs, we're broadly around 50% from the start of the rate hikes in late 2022, all the way to now broadly around 50%. The earlier part was much lower than 50%. The latter part was much higher than 50%. It is difficult to predict how pass-throughs will work out on the rate cut scenario, and this is why I think 50% remains a good estimate of what it could look like, noting that we don't have recent history of that. I would point you to one thing to be mindful of is in the U.K. and a number of other geographies, we will have to provide customer notice of at least 60 days before we pass through rate cuts. So there will be a delay in pass-throughs on the way down, and that's a 60 to 90 day on average, for instance, in the U.K. Thank you, Aman."

        "text": "Hi, thanks and again good morning everybody. Yes, and just echo Aman's comments and thank you, particularly do you know because it's been a pretty turbulent period for HSBC, I think there are a number of times when if somebody said you'd be making mid-teens returns, I think I would have thought that was delusional. So thank you very much for that. It benefits us all. My two questions were -- the first one was, could you tell me -- you probably disclosed it somewhere and I missed it, but performance-related pay, I see it is going to be flat this year. Is it possible to tell us what the total quantum of that is because I guess there must be some potential that, that may have to go up, particularly given the revenue performance. So that would be my first question. And then the second one is, to me, if I look at these results, I guess the standout to me was the performance in Q2 of the Wealth and Private Banking business. If I look in the past, it's generally been quite seasonal in Q2, but it seems that actually it's held up pretty flat. So should we expect that -- is that like a sort of new base level of run rate? Is that something we should continue into the second half now and then sort of grow on from there. Was there something about Q2, which held it up better than we might have expected. Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "Well, well, firstly, thank you for your comments. And on your second point on Wealth, listen, I'll give a very personal comment. You normally expect Q1 to be the seasonal high and then a bit lower in Q2 and a bit lower. So actually, Q2 did exceed expectations in terms of seasonality. It was a strong quarter. At the moment, I can't -- we tend to be a bit on the conservative side and say don't base a trend on a quarter or two. But I think your assessment there actually, Q2 was a strong performance is exactly where we are, it was stronger than probably one would have expected through normal seasonality. I think it is, if I talk to the team, they were confident of a good performance. They're seeing good lead indicators. I mean we've taken in, in excess of $250 billion of net new invested assets just over the last two and a bit years, two and half years. And I think we've all got to probably -- we haven't seen this period where how will cash move from cash to invested assets as interest rates come off. And therefore, I think it is difficult to predict a trend. I think we just got to see it go quarter-by-quarter, but the lead indicators are good. We've invested in the business over the last few years to put us in this position. It was all about getting ready for lower interest rates and being in a position to take advantage of it. We invested heavily in the product lineup for our clients to make sure that if they were going to move into invested assets, they could do so with us rather than another bank. And we invested in distribution. We had good distribution in Hong Kong, but we didn't have as good a distribution in other markets. So we built out distribution in Mainland China, in Singapore, in India and in the rest of the world. So I think it's put us in a good position to take advantage of it, but it's too early to call it a trend. But your observation is a fair observation for Q2. It was good. And it's nice to be able to report that. On performance-related pay and costs, I mean I'll let Georges cover that, but we're absolutely committed to the 5%, so."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "So we paid $3.8 billion through full-year 2023 on performance-related pay. This is disclosed in our annual reports and accounts. But if you look at how we accrued for that number through the year in 2023, we actually under accrued in the first quarter 2023. And then we topped it up at the fourth quarter to get to that total number. When you look at full-year 2024, we are accruing towards a broadly similar number for the full-year than for the full-year '23. And any decision on the performance rate pay will take place in January with the Remuneration Committee after the full-year's performance has been delivered. But we are accruing broadly to the same number. The difference is that we're accruing more evenly. So this is why you'll see a higher accrual on a year-on-year basis in the first half, and you will be seeing a lower accrual in the second half on that trajectory. It is -- all of this is factored in our cost guidance of limiting cost growth to around 5%. We're absolutely committed to our 5% or circa 5% cost growth guidance. We're confident we can deliver it, and we are on track to deliver it."

May I know like what is that related to, I think in the note is that something related to modeling. So I would like to know like what kind of assumption changes leads to this $6.4 billion? And is that one-off? Or should we see this ongoing, I would say, additions to the RWA. So this is number one. Number two, we noticed some deterioration on asset quality on [indiscernible] book actually according to the disclosures, the deterioration seems quite significant as well. Can you explain to us what is the impact on capital because we understand that there is a limited impact on ECL charges but mainly reflected on capital. So what is the drag on capital? And then also like going forward, whether it's your view on Hong Kong CRE, in particular, for the loans which are already Stage 2E categories. Are you expecting that there will be recovery of loans through disposal of the collaterals? Or are you expecting the borrowers will eventually make up for the loans? Thank you."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Sure. Sure, Noel, thanks. Katherine, so on the capital, so we've indicated the $6.4 billion increase in RWAs due to modeling adjustment. To be specific, we've adjusted the probability of default models for banks globally. And the reason we adjusted this probability for default model for banks is because we wanted to factor in some of the observations and learnings from the March 2023 crisis in the way governments have supported the bank resolution, that's specifically true for the U.S. and Switzerland. We've taken those learnings. We've baked them in our modeling, and this resulted in this additional RWA, insofar that bank model is probability of default, et cetera are concerned, we consider this to be done. And if you ask me, well, we continuously look at our models in a general fashion, Look, the next big model update is going to be Basel 3.1 as and when Basel 3.1 becomes live in the various geographies or jurisdictions where we operate. We have not indicated the impact, which we do not expect to be material, but we're waiting to see some of the final rules that are still missing in a number of jurisdictions before we can call out the exact impact to the market, but we don't expect it to be material. In terms of Hong Kong CRE, we've spoken earlier about the 40% that is unsecured with which we remain very comfortable. And so your question probably relates to the other 60%, which is the secured portfolio of our $36 billion exposure. So of this about $3.2 billion are credit impaired. What's happening basically is a number of -- a few of our customers basically are facing some short-term cash flow pressure challenges, and this is partly due to high rates. But the balance sheet remains strong and our level of collateralization remains strong. Typically, for this impaired $3.2 billion portfolio, the level of collateralization on average is 55% loan to value. So that -- this is why there is a material of any ECL impact from the designation to Stage 3. In terms of the capital impact, some of -- depending on which models we're using and what form of lending it is, some of the impact may manifest in RWAs and we've seen a little bit of that in last quarter. Some of it will manifest in EEL, excess expected loss, which will go straight into our CET1, we publish these numbers, but by and large, these are immaterial numbers. And again, it's all supported by the fact that we have a very strong level of collateralization against the exposure. As we look forward, first, these customers, the specifically credit impaired customers are current, remain current. We expect some of the pressure they're facing to ease as rates reduce and as economic activity in Hong Kong picks up. In terms of medium- to long-term outlook for the sector, we are actually positive. We are confident first in the Hong Kong economy in general to rebound. But in particular, for the sector, we expect that the sector's pressure will ease in the medium to long-term, and we remain confident and positive about the sector."

        "text": "Thank you for the helpful disclosures on the hedge, et cetera. I have a question regarding -- two questions, which are pretty much linked regarding falling rates and how does the management see it. First of all, the wealth income. It's an odd cycle with wealth income and AUM growth rates being elevated as interest rates are high. So when they do fall, do we have any precedent as to whether they will be an impact on the wealth income from falling rates or we don't get that much benefit from income. We see right now that a lot of Mainland Chinese money is also coming out and parking in Hong Kong. So that's the first part of the question. The second is lending growth, we have targets for mid-single-digit. But when we think about modeling banking NII, we have to look at average interest earning assets. So I'm wondering, we have lots of liquidity on the balance sheet. If rates do fall, and then some of these depositors don't feel incentivized. Do we get overall deposit growth not so strong, which internal leads to average interest-earning assets not growing and hence, we should not be modeling in average interest earning assets growth at mid-single digits, so help us shrink out that. Thank you so much."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Very good. Thanks, Noel. Gurpreet, so first, one thing on the way we report it essentially is fees and other income. So the slide I have there for wealth, that's particularly the fees part, which is fees earned on assets under management or on -- for insurance, in particular, related to new business CSM. So the impact, if you want, on rates is more about transition of customers from deposits into AUMs. So this has been happening. We are seeing some of our deposits move into net new invested assets and transferring if you want to AUMs and our wealth proposition. It is likely on a trend basis that when rates come down and deposit -- the earnings you can make on deposits reduce that customer may shift some of it into AUMs through, we'll be visible now the net new invested assets proposition, and then we will be able to service them in the fee space. So yes, there is a component where we do expect more wealth activity to take place as we see deposits being less remunerative, but this is more on a broad trend basis, not a direct linkage. We are also benefiting from the structural growth of wealth, in particular, in Asia, where we believe the underlying market is growing at very high-single-digit, if not double-digit percent over the next five years. And on top of that underlying growth, which we're benefiting from, we are taking market share because of our additional investment in this space. So this is definitely a platform that can benefit from a number of trends that will support the momentum. On your second point, it's a very good point because we talk about balance sheet growth and loan growth, but we have also strong dependence for our banking NII to deposit growth, which constitute the underlying for our average interest earning assets. So we've seen this quarter deposit growing 2%. I caution you not to annualize the 2% because some of it is seasonal, some of it is one-off. But we have a fantastic deposit franchise. I mean you know us everywhere we operate, we have a very strong balance sheet that's very appealing, and we have a very strong proposition in deposits and transaction banking for both wholesale and retail, which means that we will continuously look to capture deposits. We continue winning global payment solutions mandates in the wholesale space. We continue being attractive for retail customers, and we just shared, Noel shared 345,000 new customers joining our Hong Kong business alone. This is in the U.K. in 2023, we added 1 million new customers. So therefore, we do continue seeing a good momentum, underlying momentum to grow our deposits with this very attractive deposit franchise of ours."

      {
        "speaker": "Noel Quinn",
        "text": "I think I'd reinforce that and add another comment. The trick for us in the past, we were very good as a retail bank. We were very good as a corporate bank. But when customers, whether they were retail customers or corporate customers wanting to invest in alternative asset classes other than cash, they tended to go to other banks because our product range and our distribution wasn't strong enough. We deliberately set out to invest in our products and distribution capability for wealth. So that, that cash, if it did move, it moved within the bank, not outside the bank. One of the byproduct benefits is if you've got a good wealth proposition, you also attract the cash. You keep the cash in the bank as well. They go hand-in-hand. And so I think look, I think we're in a very different position today in offering wealth propositions to clients. And what we've done is deliberately try to diversify the revenue stream. So it's less dependent on purely corporate banking and retail banking. And there is a continuum from retail and corporate banking into banking the individuals and the entrepreneurs in their personal capacity and doing their wealth management in their personal capacity. And that's, I think, the exciting trend for the future. And I think that's why we believe that we're well positioned to deliver mid-teens ROTE next year because we have that diversity and that continuum of offering. So I just want to say that's not a by chance strategy. That was a very deliberate strategy to keep both the cash in the bank and the invested assets in the bank."

    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Analyst and Investor Webinar on the 3Q 2024 Results for HSBC Holdings plc. For your information, this webinar is being recorded. I will now hand over to Georges Elhedery, Group Chief Executive.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Luis. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today. I'm here with Jon Bingham, our Group Financial Controller, who is acting as Interim Group Chief Financial Officer. We delivered another good quarter, which shows that our strategy is working, and we have a strong platform for growth. I am committed to building on that. Before Jon takes you through the third quarter numbers, I'd like to make a few comments. We made several announcements last week. First, Pam Kaur will take over as Group Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1st of January. Pam is an exceptional leader who joined HSBC in 2013 as Group Head of Audit and is currently our Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. With almost 40 years' experience in the financial sector, she brings a global perspective to the strategic challenges and opportunities we face today. I look forward to partnering with her for the next stage of the bank's growth and development. I would also like to thank Jon for his outstanding support during the interim period. Second, we announced a reorganization to simplify and streamline the group. We are currently organized around three businesses in five regions. From the 1st of January, we will operate through four businesses: Hong Kong and the UK, serving personal banking and commercial banking customers in our two home markets; Corporate & Institutional Banking; and International Wealth and Premier Banking. We will also streamline our geographic governance structures, reducing them from five regions to two, further enhancing our ability to serve our customers' needs throughout our global network. Our current group Executive Committee of 18 members will be replaced by a new group operating committee with 12 members. The analysis we've done so far demonstrate that the reorganization will result in net cost savings with a relatively short payback period on any upfront costs. We will share these details with you at our full year results in February as part of a wider business update. And third, turning to the external environment, I welcome the clarity provided by the UK government on its prudential rules. The PRA's second near final policy statement and rules on the implementation of Basel 3.1 bring an end to years of uncertainty and will help the banking sector to support growth in the UK. Similarly, I am encouraged by the recent policy measures in Mainland China and in Hong Kong. I'm confident that the monetary stimulus announced last month and potential further fiscal and other measures will help to stabilize key sectors and strengthen Mainland China's economy, meanwhile, Hong Kong's easing of macro prudential constraints is proportionate and timely, and we expect these measures to have a positive impact on the Hong Kong economy. With that, Jon will take you through the Q3 numbers.\nJon Bingham: Thanks, Georges. In summary, we had another good quarter. Profit before tax of $8.5 billion was up $0.9 billion or 11% on the third quarter of last year on a constant currency basis. This brings our annualized return on tangible equity for the first nine months of the year to 19.3% or 16.7%, excluding notable items. Revenue of $17 billion was up $1.1 billion on last year's third quarter and up $0.3 billion on the second quarter this year, underlying the good momentum within the business. We've announced today a further $4.8 billion of distributions consisting of a third interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion. We intend to complete this buyback during the four-month period before our full year results announcement in February. Last week, we also completed the share buyback announcement at the half year results in July. We've now repurchased 9% of our share count since the start of last year. As you can see on the next slide, strategic transactions, principally the disposal of Canada in the first quarter were a small impact on the year-on-year revenue and profit growth. Excluding this impact of these transactions, profit before tax, excluding notable items, was up 13% on the third quarter of last year. Revenue of $17 billion was up $1.1 billion in the third quarter of last year, driven by a $1.6 billion increase in fee and other income. This included a $0.7 billion increase in wholesale transaction banking and wealth. The remaining $1 billion increase primarily reflected strong performance in equities and global debt markets with Global Banking and Markets, and adverse items in the third quarter of last year that did not repeat, including $0.3 billion of treasury disposal losses and other notable items. Banking NII of $10.6 billion was down $0.3 billion on the second quarter on a reported FX basis, primarily due to a loss arising from the early redemption of legacy securities. Excluding this, the banking NII run rate was stable on the previous quarter. Our 2024 banking NII guidance is unchanged at around $43 billion. Our guidance includes the impact of the $0.3 billion early redemption loss taken this quarter. It also assumes a $1 billion contribution from Argentina this year, which is what we reported in 2023. Argentina has contributed $1.2 billion to banking NII in the year-to-date, but volatility created by hyperinflation accounting makes that number very difficult to forecast from quarter-to-quarter. Accordingly, I would encourage you to think of our guidance as being around $42 billion, excluding Argentina. Turning to fee and other income, wholesale transaction banking was up 7% on last year's third quarter. The key driver was global foreign exchange, which grew 12%, benefiting from an increased client activity. Higher volumes also contributed to growth in both Global Trade Solutions and Global Payment Solutions. Wealth was up 32% on the third quarter last year, it was our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in wealth as our continued investments in this business and the importance of Hong Kong as a global wealth hub have enabled us to capitalize on a favorable operating environment. There was double-digit growth in all wealth products, but life insurance was the biggest driver. About half of the growth in life Insurance was from the non-repetition of a charge we took in Q3 last year excluding that, Life Insurance still grew well into double-digits, mainly because a higher CSM balance drove an increase in CSM release. The CSM balance is a store of value, all else remaining equal, growth in the balance means growth in future earnings. And our CSM balances continue to grow. In the first three quarters of this year, we've generated more than $2 billion of new business CSM. This has driven our CSM balance to $13.2 billion, a 22% increase since last year's third quarter, creating a foundation for future revenue growth. Hong Kong continued to benefit from inflows of international customers. There were 243,000 new-to-bank customers in the third quarter versus an average of just over 170,000 per quarter in the first half. Net new invested assets were $26 billion in the quarter, $11 billion of which were in Asia. On credit, you'll recall that our second quarter had a lower ECL charge due to recoveries and other items. The third quarter ECL charge was $1 billion or 40 basis points of average loans. The wholesale ECL charge was $0.6 billion, driven by $0.4 billion in Hong Kong, of which $0.1 billion related to Hong Kong Commercial real estate, whilst the personal charge was $0.4 billion. This brings our annualized ECL charge to 28 basis points of average loans for the year-to-date, which is broadly in line with our 30 to 40 basis point guidance for the full year. Next, on costs. Costs were up 6% in the first nine months of the year on a target basis, which was 1% lower than for the first half. As we explained in the previous quarter, the phasing of performance-related pay and the additional levies from the end of last year will give us a tailwind heading into the fourth quarter. We're on track to meet our target of around 5% cost growth for 2024 on a target basis and remain committed to cost discipline. On Lending and Deposits, loan balances were stable in the third quarter. Deposits were up 1% driven by a $16 billion increase in Hong Kong WPB. This reflected short-term flows between invested assets and deposits and are cautionary against annualizing that number. Term deposits were 39% of total Hong Kong deposits, unchanged since the second quarter. Next, our CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 20 basis points in the second quarter, a strong organic capital generation was partly offset by distributions. CET1 grew $3.1 billion during the quarter on a constant currency basis. This growth included $2.9 billion of other movements, mainly gains in the market value of securities classified as held to collect and sell, which are fair value through other comprehensive income. RWAs grew by $14 billion on a constant currency basis, mainly due to broader balance sheet growth. Finally, I'd like to point out a number of upcoming events, which will help you with your modeling. First, we expect the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points on our CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter. It remains our intention to return excess capital to shareholders through a rolling series of share buybacks. Secondly, we expect to complete the sale of HSBC Argentina in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, around $5.1 billion of historical foreign exchange translation and other reserve losses will be recycled to the income statement on completion. This has already been recognized in capital, and there will be no incremental impact on CET1, TNAV or distributions. These losses will also be excluded from our dividend calculation. We expect the completion of the sale to reduce RWAs by around $8 billion, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. Third, we intend to begin to actively market our $8 billion legacy French home loan portfolio during the fourth quarter. We expect to reclassify this portfolio as held to collect and sell in the first quarter next year, leading to a recognition of an estimated $1 billion pretax loss, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. Finally, the PRA recently published near final rules on Basel III.1, and -- these are incrementally better than we previously expected. We continue to expect them to have an immaterial impact on our CET1 ratio upon implementation. To conclude, our guidance remains unchanged, namely a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items for 2024 and 2025, banking NII of around $43 billion in 2024, ECL for the full year within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. Cost growth of around 5% for 2024 on a target basis and mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium term. With that, Louise, can we hand over to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Jon. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andrew Coombs at Citigroup. Please accept the prompt to mute your line.\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning, and good afternoon those in Hong Kong. Two questions, please. One, firstly, just on the re-organs strategy, a very simple question. Given the new structure. Where does that lead Mexico? So any thoughts on Mexico would be appreciated. And secondly, on the financials themselves on that non-NII strength. Where fees and other income were up first 2% year-on-year. And you've highlighted you've now had 3 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. And previously, if I go back to your Investor Day in 2023, you talked about high single-digit growth for Asian wealth, specifically, you're clearly running well ahead of that and consistently running well ahead of that. So to what extent do you think we can extrapolate that double-digit growth into future quarters in next year?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andrew. I'm going to take your first question about Mexico and Jon will address the second one. So we have -- Andrew, we have a good market position in Mexico. We have a good performance in Mexico. Our wholesale business in Mexico is in a particular strength in our global network of connectivity. It's very strongly connected with our North American business. It's equally very strongly connected with our Asia Pacific business, and therefore, is a key strategic and anchor stone for our -- for our customers. Our retail business in Mexico will form part of the international wealth and personal bank now all our personal banking businesses outside UK, our two home markets will be part of the international wealth and personal banking and premier banking business which will be focused on growing the affluent segment of the -- in the market and creating a strategic differentiation for us in the market, where we operate in personal banking space outside the home market. Jon will take the second question.\nJon Bingham: Andrew, as you know, we've been investing in our wealth capabilities for sometime. Wealth was up 32% year-on-year in third quarter and 20% year-on-year for the 9 months. That growth was particularly driven in Asia where we see a favorable operating environment, but we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth across the main segments. That\u2019s supported by strong customer growth and growth in net new invested assets. So we have guided previously to high single-digit growth. I think it's fair that we may well outperform that in the short term.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aman Rakkar at Barclays. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nAman Rakkar: Good morning and good afternoon, thanks very much for the presentation and the questions. I had a question on one on restructuring and one on net interest income please. Just trying to scope the degree of ambition that you might have around restructuring. It looks like efforts to restructure the business are focused on delivering net cost saves. You're clearly doing very well on revenues at the moment, particularly fee businesses are presumably a source of near-term upside to market expectations. But I think the outlook is volatile. A lot of these things are outside of your area of control. So what is the scale of the ambition around what you'd be looking to achieve on things like costs and indeed, RWAs as you try and kind of future-proof the medium term return on tangible equity outlook? And then I had a second question on net interest income. So I think the -- I'm taking the kind of banking NII guide at face value and trying to mix out Argentina, I think it's implying a kind of annualized run rate of around $41.5 billion at the fourth quarter as a jumping off point into '25? Maybe a bit of a low-value question, but interested if you were able to at this stage, just to comment on banking net interest income as per consensus in '25. I've been streets at around $41 billion, so versus that $41.5 billion not looking for too much attrition from here. It would be great to get -- if you're not willing to put a number on it, how you see the moving parts are there, please? Thank you, very much.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Aman, for the 2 questions. Again, I'm going to address your first question on the reorganization, and Jon can take us through the NII elements. So Aman, the primary reason for the reorganization is to create a simpler more dynamic, more agile, leaner bank. It's really to allow us to empower our frontline staff and make it faster to make decisions and ultimately serve our customers better. That's the primary reason. Now, as a result of simpler, leaner, more efficient bank, there will be cost saves. The cost takeout will be essentially in the form of severance or related costs. It will be affecting senior roles that will be deduplicated or the reduction of the number of senior roles will drive this. We will be giving you those details about the \u2013 figures about the upfront costs as well as the benefits realization in the full year -- in the full year results in February. What I can say is, number one, the benefits will exceed the upfront costs and the payback is going to happen in the short time frame thereafter. And then the second point to share with you is that we remain fully committed to cost discipline. I've been sharing this in my days, as group CFO. I carry on this mission of being fully committed to cost discipline, and this is now embedded in the firm, as you have seen from our Q3 results. For 2024, we remain on track to deliver on our cost target. We are committed to it, and we're confident we will be able to achieve it. Jon?\nJon Bingham: So on banking, thanks for the question, Aman, if I might be giving you a slightly longer answer to this. So if we start on 2024, we've reintegrated our guidance on 2024 of banking NII of around 43 billion. But I encourage you to think about that as 42 billion ex Argentina. In total, we've printed 31.6 billion for the nine months to date. And we think the Q3 run rate of 10.6 billion is a pretty clean run rate for you to think about modeling 2025. We don't provide guidance at this stage on 2025 banking NII guidance. But if you take that clean run rate of the 10.6 billion, which I agree it's about 42 billion, we'll have disposed of Argentina. So therefore, we then think of the building blocks for you to model this along four factors. Firstly, rates, the reduction in rates implied in markets will be clearly a headwind. The cuts during the third quarter, given the timing of the \u2013 they had a relatively modest impact on the third quarter's results, but we'd encourage you to use our banking NII sensitivity against market implied rates to generate that component. We then have the structural hedge that will provide a tailwind. We've got the reinvestment of maturing positions that will enable us to reinvestment at higher rates. We've signaled that for 2025, we've got 115 billion maturing at an average yield of about 2.9%. So think about those maturing and being replaced at something along the lines of five-year bond rates. We've then got volume growth, whilst volume growth has been relatively subdued in 2024, we do hope that with interest rates coming off and economic activity picking up, that we will see more loan growth. We continue to guide to mid-single digits in the medium to long-term. The timing of getting there will be unpredictable. And then lastly, we keep an eye on time deposit migration. That has been relatively stable, particularly in Hong Kong, at 39% over the last couple of quarters. But the impact on that as rates come off, will be variable. It depends on competitive pressures and customer behavior. So all of those factors is how we have thought about it to modeled it and included that within our mid-teens royalty guidance for 2025. Thanks, Aman.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you,\nAman Rakkar: Could I just one follow-up and thanks very much for that really detailed answer. In relation to the mid-teens ROTE aspiration next year, does that include or exclude any potential kind of upfront costs as part of any restructuring\nGeorges Elhedery: So the mid-teen ROTE guidance is excluding notable items. We will come back to you in February with full details of the benefits and costs of the reorganization.\nAman Rakkar: Thank you so much\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Aman.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from James Invine [ph] at Redburn. Please accept the prompt to ummute your line.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning to both. Good evening. I've got two, please. The first is on the wealth business. So clearly, not some really good revenue numbers. I was just wondering if you could kind of explain the slight disconnect with the net new invested asset number in Asia, which certainly was positive but probably not quite as positive as I might have expected given how good the revenue line was? And then second, could you just share your thoughts about the outlook for corporate loan growth across Asia. So in fact, loan growth were generally across Asia. So I think in the second quarter, we saw both Hong Kong and ex Hong Kong, all slightly. But I think three months ago, [indiscernible] more positively at least on Honk Kong also we had the announcements in China about a month ago, so just where do we go from here on the Asia loan volumes.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, James. I'm going to share some thoughts on your two questions, and I'll ask Jon to go into more details about both of them. First, our Wealth business, as you've seen in this quarter, has exhibited double-digit returns. This is the third quarter in a row with similar type returns. Wealth business, as you know, is generated from four segments one of which has performed quite well, which is the trading activities of our customers. And that manifests both in the private bank as well as in our invested assets. They have been very even stronger following the measures we've seen in China. On the outlook for corporate loan growth in Asia, we are -- as I shared earlier, we are -- we are very encouraged by the policy measures that have been taking place that have taken place, both in Mainland China as well as in Hong Kong. We see these measures combined with the outlook on rates coming down as supportive of future growth, specifically in our Hong Kong book. Outside Hong Kong, the rest of Asia remains a resilient Southeast Asia and South Asia remained quite strong in terms of loan growth, although, of course, a different size in our books than Hong Kong. Jon?\nJon Bingham: So just to amplify your comments on wealth. So we're seeing good growth in wealth. We see the net new investor assets. We're very pleased with that. In Asia, they've grown by $11 billion in the quarter and $49 billion over the nine months. You will see some movements as we grow our wealth franchise. We also had $16 billion of deposits, which Georges talked about. We'll see also deposits increase, they will ultimately feed into the wealth share of wallets that we've gone. So continue to be encouraged on corporate loan growth, nothing more to add than Georges comments. Thanks.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, James.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Kunpeng Ma at China Securities. Please accept the prompt to ummute your line.\nQ \u2013 Kunpeng Ma: Hi. Good morning, Georges. Good morning, Jon. This is Kunpeng, China Securities. Thank you for taking my question. I got one question on transaction banking because we've seen a slight recovery in the transaction banking income in the third quarter, but I think that's maybe driven by the FX volatilities. But going forward, maybe we can see more rate cuts going forward time we can -- maybe we're going to see continued FX volatilities going forward. So could you please give me a little bit more color on the future outlook of the transaction banking income? If you could comment on both the NII and non-NII that's going to be quite appreciate it. Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery : Thank you, Kunpeng. I'll ask Jon to comment on this area where, as you've heard us saying, an area of strategic differentiation for us for our wholesale customers and where we keep investing and do expect continued growth in this space given our investments and our leadership in this space. Jon?\nJon Bingham: Yes. So we've been pleased by the growth in wholesale transaction banking in the quarter, up 7%. As you say, an element of that is client-driven activity around FX and rate volatility. But within that, we continue to invest in Global Trade Solutions and Global Payments. And Global Trade Solutions, we continue to grow our market share in both Hong Kong and the U.K. And so as that market comes back, there is the opportunity for us to that be a platform for our growth. Similarly, you can see us to continue to invest in Global Payment Solutions, and we see a very optimistic path for the payment markets going forward.\nQ \u2013 Kunpeng Ma: Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery : Thank you, Kunpeng.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Amit Goel, Mediobanca. Please except the prompt to mute your line.\nAmit Goel : Hi. Thank you. Two questions for me. One, just coming back on the simplification program. Just curious, I guess, in the past, the group hasn't opted to combine Commercial Banking GBM. So just curious what's kind of seen as different now, which makes this more feasible and easier to execute with less maybe revenue attrition or consideration? And then secondly, just on the ECL charges, those were a little bit higher than what I anticipated. It looks like a bit of that's from Hong Kong wholesale and in the U.K. ring-fenced bank. So just can you kind of you can provide on that? And how you're thinking about the kind of 40 bps in the context of the guidance into next year?\nGeorges Elhedery : Thank you, Amit. Let me address your first question, and Jon can address the ECL charges question. So the primary reason of this reorganization is to simplify the bank, as we share. But we've been on a multiyear journey to simplify the activities we do in the bank. We've been exiting activities that were non-strategic. We've been reshaping our portfolio, we exited markets or activities currently, we're on track to complete the sale of our Argentina business and our Armenia business and announced two additional exits in September, including South Africa as well as the Private Bank in Germany. Now that equity was addressing the what in terms of what we do as a strategy. The reorganization we have announced last week is basically addressing the how we execute our strategy is not changing the what is changing the hole. And the reason we could effectively execute how we change our strategy as in be simpler, more agile is because of the work we have done over the past few years in simplifying what we do. So, it is the right time now to address how we execute our strategy, because we've simplified what we're doing. We've clarified what our core strategic areas for us, where we have competitive strength and where we have leadership and opportunities to grow. So the timing, therefore, is a natural kind of conclusion of the various activities that we have been taking through the transformation over the last five years. I want to say that outside the UK and Hong Kong, where we're merging all our commercial banking activities with Global Banking and Market activities to form the corporate and institutional bank. It will comprise our core products, including our balance sheet-related products, credit and lending and deposits, our transaction banking products, as well as our other products such as Investment Banking or Markets. And this should give our customers a more seamless way to deal with HSBC across all this product spectrum that we offer them. Jon?\nJon Bingham: So thanks, Amit. I'll give you a bit more color on the ECL charge. There's a $1 billion charge in third quarter, which is 40 basis points of average loans. That's actually a more normal charge, because Q2 benefited from releases and recoveries. If you then dissect the third quarter charge, there's three things within there. So firstly, the UK, which is $0.2 billion charge, again, that benefited from the releases in the second quarter. It's a more normal charge. There's nothing more going on in there. Hong Kong, in total, we incurred a $0.5 billion charge. As you said, that was mainly $0.4 billion charge in wholesale, which included $0.1 billion of Mainland China CRE and $0.1 billion of Hong Kong CRE. The rest of it was across the number of sectors, again, nothing of particular note. And then relative to third quarter, last year, we did have an increase in our Mexico retail charge. So that went up to $0.2 billion charge. That's actually been relatively normal through the quarters of 2024 but relative to third quarter 2023 is a little higher. So, we're confident, as we see this that we will be in our 30 basis points to 40 basis points planning range over the medium-term and certainly that for 2024.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Amit.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Gurpreet Singh Sahi from Goldman Sachs. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nGurpreet Singh Sahi: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a good set of numbers. I have two and mostly follow-ups. First is on wealth, and then we'll move to Hong Kong CRE. On wealth, can I check with the, so-called policy rescue in China, only a month old and for this reporting quarter, maybe only a week? So have we seen like from August as we transitioned into September, good wealth management income traction better than what we are reporting in third quarter, and then in October, that continued, maybe even accelerated. So some color there would be helpful. And then on Hong Kong, CRE specifically, not talking about Hong Kong in general, can we get numbers on the NPL ratio within the overall global CRE book and also the Hong Kong CRE book. As at the half year, we were 9% Stage 3 loans in both. Thank you very much.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Gurpreet. Let me just briefly address wealth, and ask Jon to complement it and address your Hong Kong CRE question. So there are two trends in wealth. There is the underlying trend, which is a continued growth in our wealth business, which has been there quarter-after-quarter. It's a result of both our increased investment in the space, it's a result of us winning market share given our brand and franchise. It's also a result of the underlying market growing. As you've seen, Hong Kong is now expected to become the largest private wealth hub in the world by the end of the decade. So that is definitely trend and we\u2019re privileged with our position in Hong Kong to be able to benefit from it and benefit our customers from it. That is the first component, which is an underlying continued investment and growth trend. You add to that, obviously, the additional activity we've seen following the measures that have been taken in China. This has created additional activity, which has been, as you said, for the week or so in the third quarter. We do see this activity continuing and obviously normalizing. But we do see these measures that have been taken to be supportive measures certainly of the economy at large, but in particular, supportive measures of the financial markets and the revival of some of the financial market sluggishness that we've seen in both in Mainland China and Hong Kong over the last few quarters. Jon?\nJon Bingham: So if I pick up your second point on Hong Kong CRE, it's actually a very similar picture to that we described in the second quarter. So a few customers continue to face cash flow pressures, some of that is rates resultant, and as rates come off, we would hope that begins to abate some of those cash flow pressures. If you look at the Asia wholesale Stage 3, they were up $1.1 billion in the quarter. Some of that relates to Hong Kong CRE. That also drove a modest amount of additional RWAs. The ECLs on that, we've referred to the fact that there was $100 million charge on ECL. That was both across Stage 1 and Stage 2. The Sage 3 ratio is slightly up quarter-on-quarter. But we continue to see good collateral across that portfolio, and so we don't see this as a material ECL driver going forward. Our focus is really on supporting our customers through this period as there's pressures we should see start to reduce as rates recede.\nGeorges Elhedery: Yes. And as we said, Gurpreet, we are confident about the outlook of the Hong Kong economy at large and the Hong Kong commercial real estate sector, in particular, partly because of the rate receding as Jon was just mentioning, but also partly due to the policy measures and the countercyclical measures that have been taken this month to support the sector. We see these as having positive developments for the outlook of the market. Thank you very much, Gurpreet.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jeremy Hugh at CICC. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nJeremy Hugh: Good morning, Georges. Good morning, Jon. My first question is on the structural hedge. I think, Georges, you mentioned that $25 billion is a good run rate for you, for how you to build up the structural hedge in the second half, but in Q3, that increased by $27 billion, and maybe most of that comes from FX impact. So do you still stick to $25 billion run rate, or you would like to accelerate it? And the second question is on; I would like to hear your thoughts on what area HSBC can further make investments because it feels like over the years, our strategy always emphasized that the bank had to make excellent cost discipline, and we did it. And we made some investments, but mostly small ones. So if we look forward, do you see any opportunities that may help us to further drive growth and take market share? Or do you think it's better to stay cautious as we are still facing some top line pressures? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Jeremy. Let me address your second question on investments, and then Jon can address your structural hedge question. So first, as you said, cost discipline, I've taken it from my days in my CFO role with me as CEO. It is embedded in the organization, and we will maintain cost discipline. You should expect this to be ingrained in the way we think is spending wisely and in the right places. In terms of strategy, we've basically -- in the reorganization we announced last week, we are basically organizing ourselves alongside our strategic pillars. So this creates clarity and this also creates simplicity in the way we can execute our strategy. We have two home markets where we have scale, a leading market position and great growth opportunities and certainly very strong competitive edge. In our Corporate and Institutional Banking business, we have a global connectivity capability and a transaction banking capability that is second to none, that is a very leading and providing excellent services to our customers. Our positioning is very cherished and very valued by our customers. And then we have Wealth and Premier Banking, which is really the proposition aimed at the affluent segment for investment needs in particular, across our network and in particular, so in Asia and the Middle East. Any opportunity we have to accelerate this strategy will be it organic or inorganic is an opportunity we will go after. We are looking -- these areas all exhibit fantastic growth opportunities. We have a real competitive edge, and we will continuously invest in them both organically and inorganically if the opportunities arise. What I should say there is -- we do have the capital to support our needs. We have the capital to support, obviously, our dividend distribution to support organic growth and to support inorganic opportunities should we find some that can accelerate our strategy and allow us to gain market share.\nJon Bingham: Jeremy, if I pick up your question on structural hedge, as you rightly say, we have increased our structural hedge during the period from $504 billion at the 30th of June to $531 billion at the 30th of September, but that was mostly FX driven. The duration of that remains 2.8 years. We would continue to expect to increase our structural hedge, but that will depend on market conditions that we have. And I would say that the big increases of our structural hedge are probably behind us. So further increases from here will only have a modest impact on our banking NII sensitivity. Thanks, Jeremy.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Katherine Lei at JPMorgan. Please accept the prompts to meet your line.\nKatherine Lei: Hi. Thanks, George and thanks, Jon. So my questions will be two. The first one I would like to ask about NII. I think the confusing thing here is that I think on the headline NII actually slightly missed expectation. But if we work out the banking NII, there's a moderate peaks and also we try to calculate whether it's the banking net interest margin, it seems it's by and large stable despite in 3Q, have actually went down kind of on average 50 basis. So, may I ask like what is driving that stable net interest margin? Would it be from the liabilities management side? Just now John gave us some color in terms of, like, say, deposit migration. But is it possible to give me some -- give us some like numbers to work around, like what is the ratio in Hong Kong and how the trend has changed? So, this will be my first question. My second question is that when I look at RWA migration, I saw on the -- on numerate -- I saw that in the migration side, and there is $2 billion addition to CET1 capital due to movement in research. Can we get a bit of -- I would say, color on that one? Will we be seeing some kind of movement -- like similar type of movement in the coming quarters? Actually, I have one slight additional question is on the loss that we were talking about the legacy securities. Can you give us a bit of color on this one? And I understand that management put this into notable items, so supposedly to be one-off, but is it really one-off in nature? Will we have other securities, perpetual bonds that we would like to redeem in the future? Like, say, for example, do we have another 10% type of perpetual on currency in our books that we may be looking to redeem it when opportunities arise? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Katherine. I'm going to let Jon answer the three questions, but allow me one month of legacy securities. We have said that we will look at our legacy securities continuously, but we will take action that are accretive or neutral. We will not take action on legacy securities that are detrimental to our investors and our shareholders. In this case, we've taken an action on legacy security that has more than 10% coupon, that could be naturally and easily replaced with much lower rates. And therefore, there is a positive impact on a net present value basis of the actions we've taken. And these actions, we will always look at where there is value in it. Jon?\nJon Bingham: Yes. So, thanks, Katherine. The questions there. So, if I start on your net interest margin, we give some detail on the net interest margin on Page 17 of the slide deck. But effectively, the net interest margin has moved from 162 to 146. There's three things driving that. One, the loss on the early redemption of legacy securities, as you've mentioned; two, some Argentina volatility; and then, the remaining is on we've allocated more funding to the trading book. And as you know, that will be a drag on net interest income, but also an equal and opposite benefit on non-net interest income. So, our preferred measure and the way that we think about it is through the banking NII lens, there you'll see that our clean run rate ex-Argentina and ex-notables has been relatively stable period-on-period, reflecting the fact that the Q3 rate cuts had given their timing had a modest impact on Q3. If I -- you'd also asked about deposit migration, we've again got some detail in that on slide 17, but that has remained relatively stable at 39% for the Hong Kong deposits. If I move on to your CET1 question, and then particularly the change in other adjustments for CET1 capital. That is around the fair value movements of our securities that are classified as fair value through OCI. So we've generated a gain on those, which has given us also a capital benefit on that. I think on legacy security, George has covered most of the questions on that, but we're not signaling anything at this stage around further legacy securities redemptions. Thank you, Katherine.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Katherine.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Edward Firth at KBW. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nEdward Firth: Yeah. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the questions. I just had two questions. One just a clarification. Just to be clear, the $1.1 billion increase in Stage 3 loans in Hong Kong. Is that all CRE, that's just to be clear on that? That was the first question. The second one is we've obviously got a US election coming up in the next couple of weeks. And I just wondered if you could give us some thoughts from your perspective in terms of the possible sort of risks and opportunities that you see that could come out of that, I guess, with the two realistic options. And I guess just related to that, there was a lot of press comment that your organization was driven by splitting up Asian, and I guess the UK or developed markets businesses. Is that actually right? Or is that just sort of idle speculation from journalist? Great. Thanks so much.\nGeorges Elhedery: Okay. Thank you, Ed. Let me take your second and third questions, and Jon can address the Stage 3 question. So look, we -- this is a matter for the US Electorate to choose their President. I'm not going to speculate or comment we will see the outcomes on the 5th of November. But what is important for us is that we serve our customers. We have been serving our customers through various -- through an evolving set of rules and regulations on the -- on the global scale. We serve them for their needs, especially the cross-broader needs where we're unique at being able to do so. We obviously comply with all rules and regulations, we will make sure that our customers are able to comply with all rules and regulations and so far that their financial needs are concerned. And any new rules and regulations, which may come with any new administration are things that we will obviously comply with and support our customers to comply with. What I can say, though, is it remains a distinctive skill that we have in supporting our customers' cross-border needs. This is one of our unique areas of competitive edge. And this remains unchanged, and our customer needs remain broad-based and global, and we will continue supporting them on that mission. And with regard to the reorganization, this is categorically not either an intent or a preparation as has been speculated by some splitting of the Asia business or, et cetera, absolutely not. This is a simplification of the bank where we today govern ourselves through five regions, and we're bringing this regional setup down two, that is part of the simplification. It is also meant to help us speed up the build-out of what is a very promising corridor between the Middle East and Asia. We're seeing material growth in this corridor over the last few years. Our customers across both Middle East and Asia are looking for the opportunities of trade and investment in them. And we've been -- we have a leading -- we have a unique position to be able to help our customers across this corridor. That simplification should also help speed up to build up that corridor. And I remind you in our western geographies now, we\u2019re essentially a wholesale bank. We have sold our retail banking activities in France. We sold the mass retail activities in the US. We've sold the bank in Canada. We sold the bank in Greece. We are in the process of selling the bank in Argentina. And with that, we'll be left with what is essentially a corporate institutional banking business that also bring some simplification aspects to the way we govern ourselves in this region. These are the reasons why we did the simplification of reorganization we announced last week. Jon?\nJon Bingham: On your CRE question, Ed, so of the 1.1 billion increase in Asia wholesale Stage 3s, most of that was Hong Kong CRE. The picture is very similar to how we described it at the second quarter. We could see more migrations into Stage 3 until interest rates begin to ease the cash flow pressures in those businesses. But given the collateral levels that we have against that portfolio, we don't see that as a major driver of ECL risk going forward. We are focused on supporting our customers through this transition period. Thanks, Ed.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Ed.\nOperator: That ends today's Q&A. So I will now hand back to George for closing remarks. Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Louise, and thank you, everyone, for your questions today. To recap, we delivered another good quarter, which shows that our strategy is working. We have reconfirmed all of our guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2024 and for 2025, excluding notable items. And I'm committed to building on this, which our organization will enable us to do by simplifying and streamlining the group. We will share more details at our full year results in February, as part of a wider business update. Neil and the team are available to answer any questions, and I look forward to speaking with you again very soon. Please enjoy the rest of the day, wherever you are, and thank you again.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining today's webinar. You may now disconnect your lines.",

        "text": "Thank you, Luis. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today. I'm here with Jon Bingham, our Group Financial Controller, who is acting as Interim Group Chief Financial Officer. We delivered another good quarter, which shows that our strategy is working, and we have a strong platform for growth. I am committed to building on that. Before Jon takes you through the third quarter numbers, I'd like to make a few comments. We made several announcements last week. First, Pam Kaur will take over as Group Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1st of January. Pam is an exceptional leader who joined HSBC in 2013 as Group Head of Audit and is currently our Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. With almost 40 years' experience in the financial sector, she brings a global perspective to the strategic challenges and opportunities we face today. I look forward to partnering with her for the next stage of the bank's growth and development. I would also like to thank Jon for his outstanding support during the interim period. Second, we announced a reorganization to simplify and streamline the group. We are currently organized around three businesses in five regions. From the 1st of January, we will operate through four businesses: Hong Kong and the UK, serving personal banking and commercial banking customers in our two home markets; Corporate & Institutional Banking; and International Wealth and Premier Banking. We will also streamline our geographic governance structures, reducing them from five regions to two, further enhancing our ability to serve our customers' needs throughout our global network. Our current group Executive Committee of 18 members will be replaced by a new group operating committee with 12 members. The analysis we've done so far demonstrate that the reorganization will result in net cost savings with a relatively short payback period on any upfront costs. We will share these details with you at our full year results in February as part of a wider business update. And third, turning to the external environment, I welcome the clarity provided by the UK government on its prudential rules. The PRA's second near final policy statement and rules on the implementation of Basel 3.1 bring an end to years of uncertainty and will help the banking sector to support growth in the UK. Similarly, I am encouraged by the recent policy measures in Mainland China and in Hong Kong. I'm confident that the monetary stimulus announced last month and potential further fiscal and other measures will help to stabilize key sectors and strengthen Mainland China's economy, meanwhile, Hong Kong's easing of macro prudential constraints is proportionate and timely, and we expect these measures to have a positive impact on the Hong Kong economy. With that, Jon will take you through the Q3 numbers."

        "text": "Thanks, Georges. In summary, we had another good quarter. Profit before tax of $8.5 billion was up $0.9 billion or 11% on the third quarter of last year on a constant currency basis. This brings our annualized return on tangible equity for the first nine months of the year to 19.3% or 16.7%, excluding notable items. Revenue of $17 billion was up $1.1 billion on last year's third quarter and up $0.3 billion on the second quarter this year, underlying the good momentum within the business. We've announced today a further $4.8 billion of distributions consisting of a third interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion. We intend to complete this buyback during the four-month period before our full year results announcement in February. Last week, we also completed the share buyback announcement at the half year results in July. We've now repurchased 9% of our share count since the start of last year. As you can see on the next slide, strategic transactions, principally the disposal of Canada in the first quarter were a small impact on the year-on-year revenue and profit growth. Excluding this impact of these transactions, profit before tax, excluding notable items, was up 13% on the third quarter of last year. Revenue of $17 billion was up $1.1 billion in the third quarter of last year, driven by a $1.6 billion increase in fee and other income. This included a $0.7 billion increase in wholesale transaction banking and wealth. The remaining $1 billion increase primarily reflected strong performance in equities and global debt markets with Global Banking and Markets, and adverse items in the third quarter of last year that did not repeat, including $0.3 billion of treasury disposal losses and other notable items. Banking NII of $10.6 billion was down $0.3 billion on the second quarter on a reported FX basis, primarily due to a loss arising from the early redemption of legacy securities. Excluding this, the banking NII run rate was stable on the previous quarter. Our 2024 banking NII guidance is unchanged at around $43 billion. Our guidance includes the impact of the $0.3 billion early redemption loss taken this quarter. It also assumes a $1 billion contribution from Argentina this year, which is what we reported in 2023. Argentina has contributed $1.2 billion to banking NII in the year-to-date, but volatility created by hyperinflation accounting makes that number very difficult to forecast from quarter-to-quarter. Accordingly, I would encourage you to think of our guidance as being around $42 billion, excluding Argentina. Turning to fee and other income, wholesale transaction banking was up 7% on last year's third quarter. The key driver was global foreign exchange, which grew 12%, benefiting from an increased client activity. Higher volumes also contributed to growth in both Global Trade Solutions and Global Payment Solutions. Wealth was up 32% on the third quarter last year, it was our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in wealth as our continued investments in this business and the importance of Hong Kong as a global wealth hub have enabled us to capitalize on a favorable operating environment. There was double-digit growth in all wealth products, but life insurance was the biggest driver. About half of the growth in life Insurance was from the non-repetition of a charge we took in Q3 last year excluding that, Life Insurance still grew well into double-digits, mainly because a higher CSM balance drove an increase in CSM release. The CSM balance is a store of value, all else remaining equal, growth in the balance means growth in future earnings. And our CSM balances continue to grow. In the first three quarters of this year, we've generated more than $2 billion of new business CSM. This has driven our CSM balance to $13.2 billion, a 22% increase since last year's third quarter, creating a foundation for future revenue growth. Hong Kong continued to benefit from inflows of international customers. There were 243,000 new-to-bank customers in the third quarter versus an average of just over 170,000 per quarter in the first half. Net new invested assets were $26 billion in the quarter, $11 billion of which were in Asia. On credit, you'll recall that our second quarter had a lower ECL charge due to recoveries and other items. The third quarter ECL charge was $1 billion or 40 basis points of average loans. The wholesale ECL charge was $0.6 billion, driven by $0.4 billion in Hong Kong, of which $0.1 billion related to Hong Kong Commercial real estate, whilst the personal charge was $0.4 billion. This brings our annualized ECL charge to 28 basis points of average loans for the year-to-date, which is broadly in line with our 30 to 40 basis point guidance for the full year. Next, on costs. Costs were up 6% in the first nine months of the year on a target basis, which was 1% lower than for the first half. As we explained in the previous quarter, the phasing of performance-related pay and the additional levies from the end of last year will give us a tailwind heading into the fourth quarter. We're on track to meet our target of around 5% cost growth for 2024 on a target basis and remain committed to cost discipline. On Lending and Deposits, loan balances were stable in the third quarter. Deposits were up 1% driven by a $16 billion increase in Hong Kong WPB. This reflected short-term flows between invested assets and deposits and are cautionary against annualizing that number. Term deposits were 39% of total Hong Kong deposits, unchanged since the second quarter. Next, our CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 20 basis points in the second quarter, a strong organic capital generation was partly offset by distributions. CET1 grew $3.1 billion during the quarter on a constant currency basis. This growth included $2.9 billion of other movements, mainly gains in the market value of securities classified as held to collect and sell, which are fair value through other comprehensive income. RWAs grew by $14 billion on a constant currency basis, mainly due to broader balance sheet growth. Finally, I'd like to point out a number of upcoming events, which will help you with your modeling. First, we expect the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points on our CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter. It remains our intention to return excess capital to shareholders through a rolling series of share buybacks. Secondly, we expect to complete the sale of HSBC Argentina in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, around $5.1 billion of historical foreign exchange translation and other reserve losses will be recycled to the income statement on completion. This has already been recognized in capital, and there will be no incremental impact on CET1, TNAV or distributions. These losses will also be excluded from our dividend calculation. We expect the completion of the sale to reduce RWAs by around $8 billion, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. Third, we intend to begin to actively market our $8 billion legacy French home loan portfolio during the fourth quarter. We expect to reclassify this portfolio as held to collect and sell in the first quarter next year, leading to a recognition of an estimated $1 billion pretax loss, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. Finally, the PRA recently published near final rules on Basel III.1, and -- these are incrementally better than we previously expected. We continue to expect them to have an immaterial impact on our CET1 ratio upon implementation. To conclude, our guidance remains unchanged, namely a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items for 2024 and 2025, banking NII of around $43 billion in 2024, ECL for the full year within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. Cost growth of around 5% for 2024 on a target basis and mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium term. With that, Louise, can we hand over to Q&A."

Where fees and other income were up first 2% year-on-year. And you've highlighted you've now had 3 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. And previously, if I go back to your Investor Day in 2023, you talked about high single-digit growth for Asian wealth, specifically, you're clearly running well ahead of that and consistently running well ahead of that. So to what extent do you think we can extrapolate that double-digit growth into future quarters in next year?"

We have a good performance in Mexico. Our wholesale business in Mexico is in a particular strength in our global network of connectivity. It's very strongly connected with our North American business. It's equally very strongly connected with our Asia Pacific business, and therefore, is a key strategic and anchor stone for our -- for our customers. Our retail business in Mexico will form part of the international wealth and personal bank now all our personal banking businesses outside UK, our two home markets will be part of the international wealth and personal banking and premier banking business which will be focused on growing the affluent segment of the -- in the market and creating a strategic differentiation for us in the market, where we operate in personal banking space outside the home market. Jon will take the second question."

That growth was particularly driven in Asia where we see a favorable operating environment, but we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth across the main segments. That\u2019s supported by strong customer growth and growth in net new invested assets. So we have guided previously to high single-digit growth. I think it's fair that we may well outperform that in the short term."

        "speaker": "Aman Rakkar",
        "text": "Good morning and good afternoon, thanks very much for the presentation and the questions. I had a question on one on restructuring and one on net interest income please. Just trying to scope the degree of ambition that you might have around restructuring. It looks like efforts to restructure the business are focused on delivering net cost saves. You're clearly doing very well on revenues at the moment, particularly fee businesses are presumably a source of near-term upside to market expectations. But I think the outlook is volatile. A lot of these things are outside of your area of control. So what is the scale of the ambition around what you'd be looking to achieve on things like costs and indeed, RWAs as you try and kind of future-proof the medium term return on tangible equity outlook? And then I had a second question on net interest income. So I think the -- I'm taking the kind of banking NII guide at face value and trying to mix out Argentina, I think it's implying a kind of annualized run rate of around $41.5 billion at the fourth quarter as a jumping off point into '25? Maybe a bit of a low-value question, but interested if you were able to at this stage, just to comment on banking net interest income as per consensus in '25. I've been streets at around $41 billion, so versus that $41.5 billion not looking for too much attrition from here. It would be great to get -- if you're not willing to put a number on it, how you see the moving parts are there, please? Thank you, very much."

        "text": "Thank you, Aman, for the 2 questions. Again, I'm going to address your first question on the reorganization, and Jon can take us through the NII elements. So Aman, the primary reason for the reorganization is to create a simpler more dynamic, more agile, leaner bank. It's really to allow us to empower our frontline staff and make it faster to make decisions and ultimately serve our customers better. That's the primary reason. Now, as a result of simpler, leaner, more efficient bank, there will be cost saves. The cost takeout will be essentially in the form of severance or related costs. It will be affecting senior roles that will be deduplicated or the reduction of the number of senior roles will drive this. We will be giving you those details about the \u2013 figures about the upfront costs as well as the benefits realization in the full year -- in the full year results in February. What I can say is, number one, the benefits will exceed the upfront costs and the payback is going to happen in the short time frame thereafter. And then the second point to share with you is that we remain fully committed to cost discipline. I've been sharing this in my days, as group CFO. I carry on this mission of being fully committed to cost discipline, and this is now embedded in the firm, as you have seen from our Q3 results. For 2024, we remain on track to deliver on our cost target. We are committed to it, and we're confident we will be able to achieve it. Jon?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jon Bingham",
        "text": "So on banking, thanks for the question, Aman, if I might be giving you a slightly longer answer to this. So if we start on 2024, we've reintegrated our guidance on 2024 of banking NII of around 43 billion. But I encourage you to think about that as 42 billion ex Argentina. In total, we've printed 31.6 billion for the nine months to date. And we think the Q3 run rate of 10.6 billion is a pretty clean run rate for you to think about modeling 2025. We don't provide guidance at this stage on 2025 banking NII guidance. But if you take that clean run rate of the 10.6 billion, which I agree it's about 42 billion, we'll have disposed of Argentina. So therefore, we then think of the building blocks for you to model this along four factors. Firstly, rates, the reduction in rates implied in markets will be clearly a headwind. The cuts during the third quarter, given the timing of the \u2013 they had a relatively modest impact on the third quarter's results, but we'd encourage you to use our banking NII sensitivity against market implied rates to generate that component. We then have the structural hedge that will provide a tailwind. We've got the reinvestment of maturing positions that will enable us to reinvestment at higher rates. We've signaled that for 2025, we've got 115 billion maturing at an average yield of about 2.9%. So think about those maturing and being replaced at something along the lines of five-year bond rates. We've then got volume growth, whilst volume growth has been relatively subdued in 2024, we do hope that with interest rates coming off and economic activity picking up, that we will see more loan growth. We continue to guide to mid-single digits in the medium to long-term. The timing of getting there will be unpredictable. And then lastly, we keep an eye on time deposit migration. That has been relatively stable, particularly in Hong Kong, at 39% over the last couple of quarters. But the impact on that as rates come off, will be variable. It depends on competitive pressures and customer behavior. So all of those factors is how we have thought about it to modeled it and included that within our mid-teens royalty guidance for 2025. Thanks, Aman."

I was just wondering if you could kind of explain the slight disconnect with the net new invested asset number in Asia, which certainly was positive but probably not quite as positive as I might have expected given how good the revenue line was? And then second, could you just share your thoughts about the outlook for corporate loan growth across Asia. So in fact, loan growth were generally across Asia. So I think in the second quarter, we saw both Hong Kong and ex Hong Kong, all slightly. But I think three months ago, [indiscernible] more positively at least on Honk Kong also we had the announcements in China about a month ago, so just where do we go from here on the Asia loan volumes."

First, our Wealth business, as you've seen in this quarter, has exhibited double-digit returns. This is the third quarter in a row with similar type returns. Wealth business, as you know, is generated from four segments one of which has performed quite well, which is the trading activities of our customers. And that manifests both in the private bank as well as in our invested assets. They have been very even stronger following the measures we've seen in China. On the outlook for corporate loan growth in Asia, we are -- as I shared earlier, we are -- we are very encouraged by the policy measures that have been taking place that have taken place, both in Mainland China as well as in Hong Kong. We see these measures combined with the outlook on rates coming down as supportive of future growth, specifically in our Hong Kong book. Outside Hong Kong, the rest of Asia remains a resilient Southeast Asia and South Asia remained quite strong in terms of loan growth, although, of course, a different size in our books than Hong Kong.

And then secondly, just on the ECL charges, those were a little bit higher than what I anticipated. It looks like a bit of that's from Hong Kong wholesale and in the U.K. ring-fenced bank. So just can you kind of you can provide on that? And how you're thinking about the kind of 40 bps in the context of the guidance into next year?"

        "text": "Thank you, Amit. Let me address your first question, and Jon can address the ECL charges question. So the primary reason of this reorganization is to simplify the bank, as we share. But we've been on a multiyear journey to simplify the activities we do in the bank. We've been exiting activities that were non-strategic. We've been reshaping our portfolio, we exited markets or activities currently, we're on track to complete the sale of our Argentina business and our Armenia business and announced two additional exits in September, including South Africa as well as the Private Bank in Germany. Now that equity was addressing the what in terms of what we do as a strategy. The reorganization we have announced last week is basically addressing the how we execute our strategy is not changing the what is changing the hole. And the reason we could effectively execute how we change our strategy as in be simpler, more agile is because of the work we have done over the past few years in simplifying what we do. So, it is the right time now to address how we execute our strategy, because we've simplified what we're doing. We've clarified what our core strategic areas for us, where we have competitive strength and where we have leadership and opportunities to grow. So the timing, therefore, is a natural kind of conclusion of the various activities that we have been taking through the transformation over the last five years. I want to say that outside the UK and Hong Kong, where we're merging all our commercial banking activities with Global Banking and Market activities to form the corporate and institutional bank. It will comprise our core products, including our balance sheet-related products, credit and lending and deposits, our transaction banking products, as well as our other products such as Investment Banking or Markets. And this should give our customers a more seamless way to deal with HSBC across all this product spectrum that we offer them. Jon?"

        "text": "So thanks, Amit. I'll give you a bit more color on the ECL charge. There's a $1 billion charge in third quarter, which is 40 basis points of average loans. That's actually a more normal charge, because Q2 benefited from releases and recoveries. If you then dissect the third quarter charge, there's three things within there. So firstly, the UK, which is $0.2 billion charge, again, that benefited from the releases in the second quarter. It's a more normal charge. There's nothing more going on in there. Hong Kong, in total, we incurred a $0.5 billion charge. As you said, that was mainly $0.4 billion charge in wholesale, which included $0.1 billion of Mainland China CRE and $0.1 billion of Hong Kong CRE. The rest of it was across the number of sectors, again, nothing of particular note. And then relative to third quarter, last year, we did have an increase in our Mexico retail charge. So that went up to $0.2 billion charge. That's actually been relatively normal through the quarters of 2024 but relative to third quarter 2023 is a little higher. So, we're confident, as we see this that we will be in our 30 basis points to 40 basis points planning range over the medium-term and certainly that for 2024."

On wealth, can I check with the, so-called policy rescue in China, only a month old and for this reporting quarter, maybe only a week? So have we seen like from August as we transitioned into September, good wealth management income traction better than what we are reporting in third quarter, and then in October, that continued, maybe even accelerated. So some color there would be helpful. And then on Hong Kong, CRE specifically, not talking about Hong Kong in general, can we get numbers on the NPL ratio within the overall global CRE book and also the Hong Kong CRE book. As at the half year, we were 9% Stage 3 loans in both. Thank you very much."

        "text": "Thank you, Gurpreet. Let me just briefly address wealth, and ask Jon to complement it and address your Hong Kong CRE question. So there are two trends in wealth. There is the underlying trend, which is a continued growth in our wealth business, which has been there quarter-after-quarter. It's a result of both our increased investment in the space, it's a result of us winning market share given our brand and franchise. It's also a result of the underlying market growing. As you've seen, Hong Kong is now expected to become the largest private wealth hub in the world by the end of the decade. So that is definitely trend and we\u2019re privileged with our position in Hong Kong to be able to benefit from it and benefit our customers from it. That is the first component, which is an underlying continued investment and growth trend. You add to that, obviously, the additional activity we've seen following the measures that have been taken in China. This has created additional activity, which has been, as you said, for the week or so in the third quarter. We do see this activity continuing and obviously normalizing. But we do see these measures that have been taken to be supportive measures certainly of the economy at large, but in particular, supportive measures of the financial markets and the revival of some of the financial market sluggishness that we've seen in both in Mainland China and Hong Kong over the last few quarters. Jon?"

        "text": "So if I pick up your second point on Hong Kong CRE, it's actually a very similar picture to that we described in the second quarter. So a few customers continue to face cash flow pressures, some of that is rates resultant, and as rates come off, we would hope that begins to abate some of those cash flow pressures. If you look at the Asia wholesale Stage 3, they were up $1.1 billion in the quarter. Some of that relates to Hong Kong CRE. That also drove a modest amount of additional RWAs. The ECLs on that, we've referred to the fact that there was $100 million charge on ECL. That was both across Stage 1 and Stage 2. The Sage 3 ratio is slightly up quarter-on-quarter. But we continue to see good collateral across that portfolio, and so we don't see this as a material ECL driver going forward. Our focus is really on supporting our customers through this period as there's pressures we should see start to reduce as rates recede."

And as we said, Gurpreet, we are confident about the outlook of the Hong Kong economy at large and the Hong Kong commercial real estate sector, in particular, partly because of the rate receding as Jon was just mentioning, but also partly due to the policy measures and the countercyclical measures that have been taken this month to support the sector. We see these as having positive developments for the outlook of the market. Thank you very much, Gurpreet."

I think, Georges, you mentioned that $25 billion is a good run rate for you, for how you to build up the structural hedge in the second half, but in Q3, that increased by $27 billion, and maybe most of that comes from FX impact. So do you still stick to $25 billion run rate, or you would like to accelerate it? And the second question is on; I would like to hear your thoughts on what area HSBC can further make investments because it feels like over the years, our strategy always emphasized that the bank had to make excellent cost discipline, and we did it. And we made some investments, but mostly small ones. So if we look forward, do you see any opportunities that may help us to further drive growth and take market share? Or do you think it's better to stay cautious as we are still facing some top line pressures? Thank you."

So first, as you said, cost discipline, I've taken it from my days in my CFO role with me as CEO. It is embedded in the organization, and we will maintain cost discipline. You should expect this to be ingrained in the way we think is spending wisely and in the right places. In terms of strategy, we've basically -- in the reorganization we announced last week, we are basically organizing ourselves alongside our strategic pillars. So this creates clarity and this also creates simplicity in the way we can execute our strategy. We have two home markets where we have scale, a leading market position and great growth opportunities and certainly very strong competitive edge. In our Corporate and Institutional Banking business, we have a global connectivity capability and a transaction banking capability that is second to none, that is a very leading and providing excellent services to our customers. Our positioning is very cherished and very valued by our customers. And then we have Wealth and Premier Banking, which is really the proposition aimed at the affluent segment for investment needs in particular, across our network and in particular, so in Asia and the Middle East. Any opportunity we have to accelerate this strategy will be it organic or inorganic is an opportunity we will go after. We are looking -- these areas all exhibit fantastic growth opportunities. We have a real competitive edge, and we will continuously invest in them both organically and inorganically if the opportunities arise. What I should say there is -- we do have the capital to support our needs. We have the capital to support, obviously, our dividend distribution to support organic growth and to support inorganic opportunities should we find some that can accelerate our strategy and allow us to gain market share."

The duration of that remains 2.8 years. We would continue to expect to increase our structural hedge, but that will depend on market conditions that we have. And I would say that the big increases of our structural hedge are probably behind us. So further increases from here will only have a modest impact on our banking NII sensitivity. Thanks, Jeremy."

        "text": "Hi. Thanks, George and thanks, Jon. So my questions will be two. The first one I would like to ask about NII. I think the confusing thing here is that I think on the headline NII actually slightly missed expectation. But if we work out the banking NII, there's a moderate peaks and also we try to calculate whether it's the banking net interest margin, it seems it's by and large stable despite in 3Q, have actually went down kind of on average 50 basis. So, may I ask like what is driving that stable net interest margin? Would it be from the liabilities management side? Just now John gave us some color in terms of, like, say, deposit migration. But is it possible to give me some -- give us some like numbers to work around, like what is the ratio in Hong Kong and how the trend has changed? So, this will be my first question. My second question is that when I look at RWA migration, I saw on the -- on numerate -- I saw that in the migration side, and there is $2 billion addition to CET1 capital due to movement in research. Can we get a bit of -- I would say, color on that one? Will we be seeing some kind of movement -- like similar type of movement in the coming quarters? Actually, I have one slight additional question is on the loss that we were talking about the legacy securities. Can you give us a bit of color on this one? And I understand that management put this into notable items, so supposedly to be one-off, but is it really one-off in nature? Will we have other securities, perpetual bonds that we would like to redeem in the future? Like, say, for example, do we have another 10% type of perpetual on currency in our books that we may be looking to redeem it when opportunities arise? Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Katherine. I'm going to let Jon answer the three questions, but allow me one month of legacy securities. We have said that we will look at our legacy securities continuously, but we will take action that are accretive or neutral. We will not take action on legacy securities that are detrimental to our investors and our shareholders. In this case, we've taken an action on legacy security that has more than 10% coupon, that could be naturally and easily replaced with much lower rates. And therefore, there is a positive impact on a net present value basis of the actions we've taken. And these actions, we will always look at where there is value in it. Jon?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jon Bingham",
        "text": "Yes. So, thanks, Katherine. The questions there. So, if I start on your net interest margin, we give some detail on the net interest margin on Page 17 of the slide deck. But effectively, the net interest margin has moved from 162 to 146. There's three things driving that. One, the loss on the early redemption of legacy securities, as you've mentioned; two, some Argentina volatility; and then, the remaining is on we've allocated more funding to the trading book. And as you know, that will be a drag on net interest income, but also an equal and opposite benefit on non-net interest income. So, our preferred measure and the way that we think about it is through the banking NII lens, there you'll see that our clean run rate ex-Argentina and ex-notables has been relatively stable period-on-period, reflecting the fact that the Q3 rate cuts had given their timing had a modest impact on Q3. If I -- you'd also asked about deposit migration, we've again got some detail in that on slide 17, but that has remained relatively stable at 39% for the Hong Kong deposits. If I move on to your CET1 question, and then particularly the change in other adjustments for CET1 capital. That is around the fair value movements of our securities that are classified as fair value through OCI. So we've generated a gain on those, which has given us also a capital benefit on that. I think on legacy security, George has covered most of the questions on that, but we're not signaling anything at this stage around further legacy securities redemptions. Thank you, Katherine."

The second one is we've obviously got a US election coming up in the next couple of weeks. And I just wondered if you could give us some thoughts from your perspective in terms of the possible sort of risks and opportunities that you see that could come out of that, I guess, with the two realistic options.

So look, we -- this is a matter for the US Electorate to choose their President. I'm not going to speculate or comment we will see the outcomes on the 5th of November. But what is important for us is that we serve our customers. We have been serving our customers through various -- through an evolving set of rules and regulations on the -- on the global scale. We serve them for their needs, especially the cross-broader needs where we're unique at being able to do so. We obviously comply with all rules and regulations, we will make sure that our customers are able to comply with all rules and regulations and so far that their financial needs are concerned. And any new rules and regulations, which may come with any new administration are things that we will obviously comply with and support our customers to comply with. What I can say, though, is it remains a distinctive skill that we have in supporting our customers' cross-border needs. This is one of our unique areas of competitive edge. And this remains unchanged, and our customer needs remain broad-based and global, and we will continue supporting them on that mission. And with regard to the reorganization, this is categorically not either an intent or a preparation as has been speculated by some splitting of the Asia business or, et cetera, absolutely not. This is a simplification of the bank where we today govern ourselves through five regions, and we're bringing this regional setup down two, that is part of the simplification. It is also meant to help us speed up the build-out of what is a very promising corridor between the Middle East and Asia. We're seeing material growth in this corridor over the last few years. Our customers across both Middle East and Asia are looking for the opportunities of trade and investment in them. And we've been -- we have a leading -- we have a unique position to be able to help our customers across this corridor. That simplification should also help speed up to build up that corridor. And I remind you in our western geographies now, we\u2019re essentially a wholesale bank. We have sold our retail banking activities in France. We sold the mass retail activities in the US. We've sold the bank in Canada. We sold the bank in Greece. We are in the process of selling the bank in Argentina. And with that, we'll be left with what is essentially a corporate institutional banking business that also bring some simplification aspects to the way we govern ourselves in this region. These are the reasons why we did the simplification of reorganization we announced last week. Jon?"

But given the collateral levels that we have against that portfolio, we don't see that as a major driver of ECL risk going forward. We are focused on supporting our customers through this transition period. Thanks, Ed."

    "transcript": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Investor and Analyst Webinar for HSBC Holdings plc's 2024 Annual Results. For your information, this call is being recorded. At this time, I will hand the call over to George Elhedery, Group CEO.\nGeorges Elhedery: Welcome, all, to today\u2019s call. I\u2019m joined by Pam, our new Group CFO. We\u2019re delighted to be here in Hong Kong, the city where HSBC was founded 160 years ago. Our history and heritage stand us in good stead in so many ways. Adapting to new economic realities and technologies is what we have always done. It brings out the best in our people and culture, especially when acting as a trusted advisor to our customers as they navigate the world\u2019s economic uncertainties and look towards new opportunities. Before Pam takes you through the fourth quarter numbers, I will cover four items. First, I will go through our full-year 2024 results. Second, I will set out the changes implemented over the past few months to create a simple, more agile, focused bank addressing the ways we operate in a fundamental way. Third, I will describe in some detail the solid foundations we are building on. And finally, I will share with you what we plan to do next in order to deliver sustainable strategic growth and meet our return targets. Starting with the full-year numbers, 2024 performance was strong. We delivered record profit before tax of $32.3 billion, or $34.1 billion excluding notable items. We generated a 14.6% return on tangible equity, or 16% excluding notable items, in line with our mid-teens target. We announced a total of $26.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders in respect of 2024, including $0.87 per share of dividends and $11 billion of share buybacks. When I took the role in September, my priority was to inject energy and intent in the way we deliver our strategy, while maintaining continued focused cost discipline. At our third-quarter results, I committed to provide you with more detail on the expected benefits from our organizational simplification. We have simplified HSBC in two important ways. We have elevated and empowered our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK and our Wealth proposition, and we have combined our two wholesale businesses. In doing so, we have eliminated large parts of our complex matrix governance structure. This significantly improved operating model is now led by a tighter Group Operating Committee. It has clarity of accountability, fewer management lines and layers, reducing the need for the number of committees we previously ran across the bank. This has increased our agility. As an illustration, previously, every dollar of revenue we generated had at least two accountable executives at the Group Executive Committee. Today, around 60% of our revenue has a single accountable executive at the Group Operating Committee. This will empower our people to make faster decisions, collaborate better and innovate for the benefit of our customers. In short, we\u2019ve simplified our structure and we\u2019ve aligned it to our strategy. This will enable us to deliver around $1.5 billion of annualized savings by the end of full-year 2025, primarily through deduplication of roles. This represents circa 8% reduction of our global staffing costs. This will cost around $1.8 billion in severance and other up-front costs. Those $1.5 billion savings will have no meaningful impact on revenue and they will be taken straight to the bottom line. Separately, we will redeploy circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities as incremental investments to our priority growth areas, where we have clear competitive advantages and generate accretive returns. We have started to do this by announcing that we will begin to wind down our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, Europe and the U.S. I will cover our priority growth areas shortly. These actions give us the confidence to target a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Each of our four businesses are firmly rooted in our core strengths. In our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK, we have two strong businesses. In both businesses, we serve Personal Banking customers as well as Commercial Banking and Small and Medium Enterprises. We are a leading bank and are growing market share in key products. Importantly, in both, we are profitable and delivering very good returns. As for the large corporations with global banking needs in both home markets, alongside individuals with multi-country personal financial needs, they will be served by our two international businesses, as I am about to set out. Corporate and Institutional Banking, CIB, is a global wholesale bank with significant competitive advantages. It has a powerful deposit franchise with strong financing capabilities, and it also has a market-leading transaction bank, leveraging our global network. As the world\u2019s number one trade bank for the last seven consecutive years, we are exceptionally well placed to help our customers and capture global and intra-regional trade flows as supply chains reconfigure, new trade routes emerge, economies grow, and our customer expectations evolve. CIB is also well positioned to help entrepreneurs secure the capital they need to build the businesses of the future and help our customers decarbonize. International Wealth and Premier Banking, IWPB, is ideally placed to capture the increasing number of affluent and high-net-worth customers, especially those with international banking needs who seek new investment opportunities to help them protect and grow their wealth. Our recognized brand, financial strength and complementary footprints across Asia and the Middle East reinforce our position in the world\u2019s fastest growing wealth markets. Let me now highlight our distinctive strengths, starting with our high-quality revenue streams. Our franchise generates resilient recurring revenue from three key sources. As you can see, in 2024, two-thirds of revenue was from Banking NII. This is the result of the strong deposit and lending positions in each of our four core businesses. As you know, we have built up the structural hedge to protect this revenue stream from falling interest rates. Pam will speak more about this. The remaining third was from fee and other income. Around a half of this was from our market-leading Wholesale Transaction Banking business, which is built on our global network, covering 85% of global trade and capital flows, including high-growth markets such as India, ASEAN, of course mainland China, the Middle East and Mexico. Around a third was from Wealth, which I will talk about shortly. Taken together, this means that more than 90% of our revenue comes from three high-quality streams. Moving to our strong deposit franchise, our customers trust the strength of our balance sheet and have chosen us to look after their deposits. This gives us a highly liquid and profitable balance sheet, which provides greater flexibility through the cycle. Within our $1.7 trillion deposit base, we have large deposit surpluses in each of our four businesses, giving us the funding capacity to support our clients. Turning now to our high-quality loan portfolio, we have always maintained a conservative approach to risk management, as evidenced by the quality of our loan portfolio. In the period since 2018, we have experienced a global pandemic, an energy crisis and the real-estate cycle in the U.S., in Hong Kong and in mainland China. Our average annual ECL charge over that period was 32 basis points of average gross loans, which is well within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. On our disciplined capital management, over the last two years, our capital generation has enabled us to return $47.7 billion to our shareholders. This comprises of $27.7 billion of dividends and $20 billion of share buybacks, including those announced today. Through the rolling series of share buybacks we have undertaken since the start of 2023, we have now repurchased 11% of our year-end 2022 issued share count. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. The external environment presents us with opportunities but also challenges. The interest rate outlook is benign but it remains volatile. We can adapt to changing patterns of trade and economic growth, but there is a risk of disruption, and we have a major opportunity in wealth in Asia and the Middle East, but it is a highly competitive space. Despite these challenges, we have levers we can pull on to support us to deliver on our target. We\u2019re confident we can take decisive action to do so. These levers are, first, driving operating leverage as an ongoing process through cost efficiency and optimization, as well as continuous improvements in productivity, second, dynamic balance sheet management and capital allocation, which I\u2019ll cover shortly, and third, investing for strategic long-term growth. Let me turn to this next. We're creating the capacity to invest for growth in the business and to drive efficiencies. We\u2019re focusing our growing investment pot, as shown on this and the next slide. First, in our home markets, we intend to expand the number of wealth centers and enhance our wealth capabilities in Hong Kong, which is set to become the world\u2019s leading cross-border wealth center. We attracted around 800,000 new-to-bank personal banking customers in Hong Kong last year, and we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities as international customers choose Hong Kong as their cross-border wealth hub. In the UK, we plan to also grow the Wealth business, and we plan to improve our SME coverage and proposition. This is an extremely attractive and profitable segment, where we will intensify our focus. Second, in CIB, we intend to leverage our network and further enhance our transaction banking capabilities, including in high-growth markets such as Mainland China, ASEAN, India, Middle East and Mexico. We are also looking to scale up our broad loan origination capabilities by underwriting more and distributing more to our institutional and wealth clients. This ability to leverage our loan origination for the purpose of distribution will give us larger opportunities to generate fee income, improve capital efficiencies and, in turn, improve CIB returns. Third, in IWPB, we intend to accelerate the wealth build-up in our home markets, and particularly also in key growth markets such as Singapore, the UAE, India and Mainland China. In each of these, we aim to accelerate the hiring of relationship managers, establish new wealth centers, and expand our product offering. While we are benefiting from an underlying growth in this segment, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, we also aim to grow our market share by, first, better driving wealth penetration with our own wholesale or Premier customers, second, better capturing cross-border flows of our own customers in their outbound location, and third, increasing the proportion of mandates within our invested assets. Finally, underpinning all of this and across the Group, we aim to seize the opportunity of AI and generative AI. Our flagship initiatives will focus on improving customer service through both our mobile apps and our contact centers. We also intend to increase tech productivity with tools such as coding assistants, and improve process efficiency in areas such as onboarding, KYC, credit applications and many others. Mid-teens returns will give us a range of attractive options for capital deployment and will drive EPS and DPS growth over time. As the illustration on the right-hand side of the slide demonstrates, a mid-teens return on tangible equity will enable us to deliver the 50% dividend payout ratio in 2025, and still have sufficient capital to grow the balance sheet, buy back shares, or both. Supporting our customers will always be our first priority, and we expect our loan book to grow in the mid-single digits over the medium- to long-term. However, fluctuations in customer demand for credit mean our loan book may grow at an uneven pace. Share buybacks remain our preferred method of returning excess capital to our shareholders, because they drive growth in EPS and DPS. For instance, in 2024, while our earnings grew by circa 2%, our earnings per share grew by circa 9%, reflecting the benefit from the circa 6% reduction of share count through share buybacks in this year. So in summary, we\u2019ve simplified the Group and, along with our continued focus on costs, are committed to delivering circa $1.5 billion savings to the bottom line. We\u2019re focused on delivering for our customers by capturing growth opportunities where we have a clear competitive advantage and accretive returns. And we\u2019re eliminating, over the medium term, an additional circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities, and redeploying them into these priority growth areas. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027. With that, let me hand over to Pam.\nPam Kaur: Thanks, Georges. Thank you, everyone, for joining. I would like to begin by sharing my approach as Group CFO. In short, I\u2019m fully focused on discipline, performance and delivery. Discipline means prioritizing with precision, maintaining strong cost control, and ensuring investment rigor for growth. Performance means gearing our financial strategy towards achieving our mid-teens returns target. Delivery means ensuring we remain agile and resilient, enhance operating leverage, and are always well positioned to support our customers. Let me now turn to the Q4 numbers. Starting with the highlights, profit before tax was $2.3 billion, or $7.3 billion excluding notable items. This strong performance enabled us to announce a further $8.4 billion of distributions in respect of the fourth quarter. This consists of a fourth interim dividend of 36 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we intend to complete before our first-quarter results in April. On this slide, you can see the impact of notable items on year-on-year revenue and profit growth. This was principally the $5.2 billion related to historical foreign exchange translation losses from the Argentina disposal. Excluding these, profit before tax was up 10% on the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue of $16.5 billion was up $1.2 billion on the fourth quarter of last year, driven by Banking NII and a strong performance in Wealth. On Banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina and other notable items, the Banking NII run rate remained broadly stable. Deposit growth and benefits from the structural hedge were partially offset by lower interest rates. Looking ahead, we expect Banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. To be clear, this is a change to the way we have given you guidance before. \u2018Around $42 billion\u2019 is not an underpin. It is our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections. We also want to give you some additional detail on the structural hedge. As you know, we have been building up the structural hedge to help manage our interest rate sensitivity. During 2024, we increased the notional balance by around $50 billion. We also extended the duration from 2.8 years to 3.1 years. This contributed to a further reduction in the interest rate sensitivity of our Banking NII last year. We have reduced our sensitivity to a 100-basis-point rate shock from around $7 billion in June 2022 to around $2.9 billion at the end of 2024. We\u2019re also providing additional disclosures on the expected reinvestment profile of the structural hedge. We expect to reinvest around $95 billion of assets in each of 2025 and 2026, from a current average yield of around 2.8%. We also expect to reinvest around $90 billion of assets in 2027, from a current average yield of around 3.4%. Moving to fee and other income, Wholesale Transaction Banking was stable on last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of strategic transactions, primarily the sale of Canada, it was up by 3%, as we continue to leverage our global network and capitalize on our position as the world\u2019s number one trade bank. The standout performance was again in Wealth, which was up 27% on the same quarter last year. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth. I\u2019m pleased we added 234,000 new-to-bank Personal Banking customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. This brings the total number added in 2024 to 799,000, as Hong Kong continues to grow in importance as a cross-border wealth hub. I\u2019m also pleased with the strong momentum in the business in January, which is in line with previous years. All of this gives us confidence that we can continue to grow this business further. Our medium-term target is to continue to grow fee and other income by double-digit CAGR. There are three trends that underpin this ambition. First, the multi-year growth in new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong underlines that the city is on track to becoming the number one cross-border wealth hub before the end of this decade. Our past experience suggests that new customers grow their total balances and wealth products over time, so this is expected to provide a tailwind. Second, the strength of our business in key international wealth hubs, particularly Hong Kong, has enabled us to grow invested assets in Asia at 17% CAGR. This was also the key driver of our 13% CAGR growth in invested assets at the Group level. There have also been strong multi-year inflows of net new invested assets, with Asia accounting for the majority. Finally, our CSM balance is a third bigger than it was two years ago, despite the reclassification of our French life insurance business in the fourth quarter. This reflects continued year-on-year growth in new business CSM from higher volumes, particularly in Hong Kong. As you know, the CSM balance is a store of future earnings, which released into the P&L at between 9% and 10% in the last two years. All things being equal, this means that future earnings growth has been built in. Also, last year the value of new business CSM was substantially greater than the CSM released to the P&L. On credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1.4 billion. $1 billion of this was in wholesale, including around $300 million from two clients, one in the UK and one in Mainland China commercial real estate sector. Overall, our portfolios in our home markets remained strong. This brought our 2024 charge to 36 basis points of average loans, which is within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. We expect our 2025 charge to be within our medium-term planning range. On costs, we are committed to deliver $1.5 billion of simplification savings from our reorganization to the bottom line, of which around $0.3 billion will be recognized in our 2025 P&L. We expect to incur around $1.8 billion of severance and other up-front costs by the end of 2026. The bulk of these costs will be incurred this year. Separately, we are also aiming to reallocate a further around $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic activities to priority growth areas. You will have seen that we have announced that we will begin to wind down our ECM and M&A activities in the UK, Europe and the US while refocusing on Asia. Those businesses were not materially profitable and exiting them will make around $300 million of costs available for reinvestment in our priority growth areas. The slide also shows some businesses that we have recently agreed to dispose of, German Private Banking and French life insurance, to which I\u2019ll add the sale of our retail banking operations in Bahrain, which was announced today. These were not aligned with our four businesses where we will focus our investment dollars and our time. Through these actions, we are creating investment space in our priority areas within our strict cost discipline. As Georges said, these include Wealth in Asia and the Middle East, UK SME coverage and wholesale transaction banking. Entry to the extra investment list is a high hurdle requiring strategic alignment and financial returns. As we continue to work through exits of low return and non-strategic activities, we are confident the investment dollars they provide will deliver a higher return to the bank. The actions taken last year mean that 2024 costs were in line with our guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. We remain fully committed to cost discipline. We expect 2025 costs to grow by around 3% compared with 2024 on a target basis, which excludes notable items and the direct costs of the Canada and Argentina disposals. Our guidance of around 3% growth includes up to 4% underlying growth from inflation and investment, partly offset by around $0.3 billion of efficiency cost savings that we expect to realize this year. On loans and deposits, loan balances were stable. Deposits were up 3% in the fourth quarter. This included an increase in Hong Kong supported by customer growth as well as seasonality. As we have said before, I would caution you against annualising that number. Our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, above our target range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect the buyback of up to $2 billion announced today to have an impact of around 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter. We have reclassified our $7 billion legacy French home loan portfolio as hold to collect and sell in the first quarter. This will lead to recognition of an estimated $1 billion pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. In summary, we have set out our current expectations in respect of 2025 and the medium term, but our key target is mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. We will run the bank to deliver this. Neil, can we go to Q&A please?\nA - Neil Sankoff: Thanks, Pam. We'll go to Q&A now. We\u2019ll start with questions from the room. Okay. I will start with you, Gurpreet. And please just wait for the microphone and remember to say your name and the name of your firm. Thank you.\nGurpreet Sahi: Thank you. Gurpreet Sahi from Goldman Sachs. If I can have two, please, the first is on CIB. Thank you for the 14% trailing RoTE. So with the cost saves, et cetera, where do we expect the CIB RoTE to trend over the next couple of years and how would the management think about incremental capital allocation in that business division? I know that interest rates are having an impact. So implied question is \u2013 let\u2019s say interest rates were a lot lower and payments, cash management, et cetera, earn us less. And then the second one is on International Wealth and Premier Banking. Thanks, again, for the 16% RoTE. So how should we think about incremental technology or new apps or kind of gaining market share in the cross-border area as it relates to International Wealth, given that the RoTE is not so high? So how would be for example, Zing and those kinds of apps, where we were looking at competing with the fintech, how competitive would we want to be? Thank you so much.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Gurpreet. I will handle the two questions. On CIB, we haven\u2019t given specific returns medium-term returns for CIB. As Pam said, we\u2019ve given the bank-wide target of mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We haven\u2019t given a business-specific, but let me give you some indications of how we\u2019re looking at the business. First, this business will benefit from the largest of the reorganization-related cost saves because this business is the result of the merger of two wholesale businesses and, as per any merger, you would expect a lot of cost synergies in areas where we had duplicative activities, be it mostly back-office activities that are duplicative where we will achieve the savings. This business also will benefit from additional we call it also the investment space from additional capital allocation efficiencies. We will be looking for more originate and distribute model. We will be looking to churn the balance sheet more, sweat the balance sheet more, drive higher earnings and fee income from this balance sheet and create better efficiency in the capital, and therefore we have a number of activities that will support this business\u2019s return on tangible equity performance. And remember also this business is a leading business in wholesale transaction banking. We\u2019re the largest trade bank in the world for seven consecutive years. We\u2019re a top-two bank in payments and a top-two bank in foreign exchange. We\u2019re the largest bank in securities services across Asia and the Middle East, so we\u2019re benefiting from an amazing transaction banking capability. We\u2019re also benefiting from an amazing deposit franchise. As you\u2019ve seen, this business is in the 50s percent loan-to-deposit ratio, and that is a highly stable and highly profitable proposition. So a lot of investment in this business is to support this direction of travel. I didn\u2019t mention the activities such as debt capital markets, et cetera, which also remain core in the wider capital solutions we provide to our customers. On your second question about IWPB, I think you have to look at this business as one of the largest growth engines of this firm. I mean, starting with Hong Kong, Hong Kong is on track to become the world\u2019s largest cross-border wealth hub, ahead of Switzerland, by the end of this decade. We\u2019re talking a few years. 800,000 new-to-bank customers, and we see this trend continuing. Then you look at various other parts of our network. Singapore is a major financial hub. The UAE has become a major wealth hub. We are the leading international wealth provider in mainland China and in India. So we continue to invest in these areas, and that investment will come in all forms, like more relationship managers, more wealth centers, more products on the shelf, more technology capabilities, and therefore, you have to expect that a lot of investment will go to this business, but this business is exhibiting already double-digit growth. I mean this business, Wealth in particular, has grown more than 20% year-on-year, and if you look at Asia alone our Wealth business in 2024 has grown more than 30% year-on-year, and therefore it deserves a lot of investment, even if that means we will eat a little bit on our return growth because we want to really secure our future as a leading provider, and our brand in parts of the world, such as Asia and the Middle East, is frankly second to none in our capability to attract this. Cross-border is a very important area for us. Frankly, we have to punch at our weight. We\u2019re punching below our weight in cross-border. Our customers are with us in a given location, and then we lose them as their wealth or part of their wealth moves to another location. By just setting the right referral mechanisms, the product capabilities cross-border, the internal incentives, there is so much we can capture. It\u2019s our own customers. So the reach is fairly easy. It\u2019s a self-help mechanism that we\u2019re trying to just recover on. As for Zing, so Zing was a fantastic technology platform which we built and were rolling out to non-clients that we were building from scratch and built a few tens of thousands. What we did is we flipped it over its head, and we\u2019re bringing in the technology platform right in the core proposition. As we roll this technology platform within our core proposition in the UK, 15 million clients will be able to benefit from it practically straight away, and we shouldn\u2019t be preventing that. That, on the contrary, accelerates our acquisition of international customers. And then, as we start thinking, rolling these new technologies widely in our Wealth business, there\u2019s a lot of potential we can get there. And that is a much faster gain than trying to build it from scratch in an area where we have non-customers working with a different brand than our very strong brand, HSBC. Thank you, Gurpreet.\nNeil Sankoff: Let\u2019s take a couple from the Zoom, and then we\u2019ll come back with Kunpeng and Jeremy. We\u2019ll take our first question from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. [Operator Instructions] Please, so we can get to as many of you as possible, please limit yourselves to two questions each. Thank you.\nKian Abouhossein: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is related to the $1.5 billion reallocation of costs. I just wanted to understand a bit if you could talk around the revenues associated, the capital and the risk-weighted assets, so we get a bit of an idea of the optimization of this capital? And secondly, also what the return on investment on this that you expect? You mentioned a high hurdle rate. And then the second question is more general to you, Georges. I mean, you are a CIB guy; you think about curveball issues all the time, spillover effects. So I\u2019m quite interested about how you are planning for tariffs within the Group, and in particular how you\u2019re thinking about the curveballs, not the direct impacts, but the indirect impacts that are impacting you from CRE to Wealth growth, et cetera, FX, and how you\u2019re basically putting that in your planning on your outlook and sensitivities around that? Thanks.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Kian. Okay. I\u2019ll take the two questions, but if there are more details, additional granularity on CRE, I\u2019m sure Pam can handle that, but I\u2019ll just give you a general sense. So on your first question, $1.5 billion reallocation of costs, so what we did say is we would reallocate it from non-strategic or low-returning activities into activities where we have a competitive edge, where we have better returns, and where we have opportunities to grow. So you have to look at this as returns incremental. Just as an illustration, the wind-down of our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, U.S. and Europe will give us $300 million of saves as we achieve them, that we can redeploy elsewhere. This cost was generating broadly break-even profits, so we\u2019re marginally profitable in these activities. We do expect these to give us a much higher return as they\u2019re reinvested, and we haven\u2019t quantified that, but the expectation is that there\u2019s an accretion of return. Second, if you look at the areas we\u2019re looking to invest in, wealth, transaction banking, as big callouts, they are actually none or low balance sheet-consuming businesses. They\u2019re materially fee and other income-driving businesses, with low, if any, impact on RWA growth. And if you look at the SME business, this business is essentially liability-driven and transaction banking- driven. The loans portion of this business is relatively small. The loan to deposit ratio is in the low-teens percentage points, which means, again, it\u2019s a low RWA impact, high in Banking NII from deposits or transaction banking, but low RWA impact. In terms of your CIB curveball question, look, tariffs are not a new feature of global trade. There has always been various forms of tariffs on various products along various corridors, and we\u2019ve always navigated those with our clients and supported them along the route. I think what\u2019s changed now is maybe the speed at which the landscape will be evolving, the speed at which we may see new tariffs or changes in tariffs. But with the bank present on 85% of the trade corridors, with our global network, with our deep knowledge in all the markets where we operate, deep understanding of local rules and regulations, deep understanding of global rules and regulations, we\u2019re actually very well placed to support our customers adjust and position their businesses to navigate these tariffs. Now, I add to that also, remember, most of the jurisdictions we operate in have pro-growth government policies. The UK is a good example, pro-growth government policy; the US is a very good example;. mainland China, pro-growth initiatives, consumer support initiatives. You look at Hong Kong, the removal of the cooling off measures on the commercial real estate or real estate in general. These measures have been effective, and we\u2019re seeing the benefits in the economy and economic growth. So, there are a number of positive factors that also we can benefit from. We\u2019ve seen that in January, by the way. The start of this year has been very encouraging. And look, the idea of all the simplification work we\u2019ve done is that so we are simple, so we are agile, and agile means we can dynamically react and support our customers. And we will adapt quickly. We will react. We will make sure that we\u2019re supporting our customers along these journeys. Thank you, Kian.\nNeil Sankoff: Let\u2019s take one more from the call. Ben Toms, from RBC.\nBenjamin Toms: Good morning, both. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on capital, please. In relation to your CET1 ratio guidance of 14% to 14.5%, before today, this used to have a caveat: you\u2019d aim to manage this down further over time. I just note that that hasn\u2019t been mentioned in today\u2019s update. What are your latest thoughts on your medium- term ambitions for the CET1 ratio and has there been any change in sentiment? And then, secondly, on costs in relation to your $1.5 billion of savings, you note that they will be taken to the bottom line, although presumably there\u2019ll be offsets from drivers such as inflation. Maybe you could just clarify directionally what you expect the shape of costs will do coming out of 2025 and going into 2026 and 2027? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Ben, for the two questions. I am going to ask Pam to address both your questions, Ben, but remember, our capital, our CET1 ratio today is at 14.9%. So we\u2019re well above our medium-term operating range and expect to remain so this quarter. So the question is really a medium to long term as opposed to anything now. Pam.\nPam Kaur: Yes. Thanks, Georges. And Ben, coming to your first question, we are very comfortable operating between the 14% to 14.5% range. The comment on looking at it again was removed some time ago, so no change for now in that respect. I want to just unbundle a little bit more on the cost point. So on the cost point, if you look at the guidance that we have, and this is the $1.5 billion of cost savings that are going straight to the bottom line. So the way we\u2019ve looked at it is that it\u2019s about 4%, if you look at inflation, as well as BAU investment. The benefit of that $1.5 billion this year that we are taking straight to the bottom line is $300 million. So if you compare to on a target basis, and you\u2019re starting excluding disposals and hyperinflation, you start from 2024, it\u2019s going to be a 3% year-on-year growth. So that\u2019s what we are looking at. Now, severance and other one-off costs, they will be treated as notable items. Now, the timing of the $1.5 billion, yes, is $300 million this year. There\u2019ll be more to come, clearly, in 2026. We see the full benefit of the $1.5 billion savings coming through for the full-year 2027, and the severance costs, et cetera, will be more upfront.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Ben.\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Let\u2019s come back to the room. So I think we have Kunpeng and then Jeremy.\nKunpeng Ma: Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. This is Kunpeng of China Securities. And congratulations to the very strong result. I also have two questions. The first question is a little bit out of the bank itself. And Georges, could you please share us some color on the global trade business and also the wealth management business? I mean your feelings about the trends in these two businesses. I think, as a CEO, your feeling must be quite insightful. The second is about the new business areas you mentioned, along with your reform. I think many of them are non-capital consuming. So to what level should we expect the revenue structure to change to, going forward? Maybe the non-NII portion will be much higher than one- third. Yeah, that\u2019s my two questions. Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Kun. I\u2019ll take your first question, and I\u2019ll ask Pam to address your second question. So, look, trade and wealth. First, it\u2019s very difficult to predict what will happen to global trade in an uncertain environment, but what we can say is, for the last eight years, that trade has started to become more disrupted. Global trade has continued growing, low-single-digit percentage points. The trade routes have reconfigured. ASEAN has become the largest trading partner of China, ahead of the U.S. and Europe. We\u2019ve seen more intra-regional trade pick up. We\u2019ve seen more fragmentation of trade routes. So rather than the goods moving from point A to point B from, say, manufacturing to consumption, they\u2019re usually going through multiple legs on the journey, across various other jurisdictions. Now, it so happens that we still have expectations that global trade will grow at low-single-digit percentage points. And it so happens that this reconfiguration segmentation is playing to our strength, because many of these new jurisdictions that have become major participants in global trade are jurisdictions where we have deep presence and, in some cases, leading presence as an international bank, and we are able to capture these flows and we will be supporting our customers along these routes. In wealth, again, if you look at various analysts and consultants\u2019 consideration, Asia and Middle East wealth is expected to grow at high single digit into 10% CAGR for the next five years. So the underlying trend of the growth of the middle class in many of these Asian economies is there. And simply being a leading bank in this space, we benefit from this underlying trend, but what we are doing is we also want to increase our market share because, in some areas, apart from Hong Kong, where we\u2019ve really been a leading player, in other places, we\u2019ve been punching below our weight. And the idea is to be able to step up our product capabilities, our customer reach, the various metrics, which I shared in the slide without repeating. And the additional investment is not only to capture the underlying trend, but also to grow to our more natural share. This will be focused essentially on Asia and the Middle East. We recognize there are other pockets of wealth that will be important for us, but we\u2019re not going to be a wealth player in the U.S. because we don\u2019t have the right to win. Pam.\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Georges. So just in terms of our focus on both NII and fee income, clearly, as we sit today, our NII, given our strong balance sheet, deposit base, loans and advances, is a much bigger proportion of earnings compared to fee income. But given the guidance we\u2019ve just shared with you, that we are looking at double-digit growth in Wealth over the medium term, even though it\u2019s on a smaller base, whereas on loans and advances, we are looking at a mid-single-digit growth in the medium-term. So that balance will tilt, but I won\u2019t go over my skates just as yet because the baseline starting point is so much bigger for balance sheet-driven business as opposed to fee income, but in direction of travel, absolutely. And also, the two things are a bit correlated. Hopefully, with your customers, when you do more, it\u2019s not just balance sheet-related products. You do more fee income-driven. And we think that really gets us more into the space of hearts and minds of our customers, which is what we are here for.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Kun.\nNeil Sankoff: Jeremy?\nJeremy Hou: Thank you for taking up my question. My first question is related to the capital distribution. Thank you for elaborating on the capital distribution hierarchy, but I recognise that you are guiding to a mid-teens RoTE for the next three years, but only a 50% dividend payout for 2025. So what are the implications behind it? And we can see the bank\u2019s share price is above one-times price to book, so will that affect your future consideration between buybacks and maybe raise the dividend payout? And the second question is on the loan growth. HSBC has been consistently guiding to a mid- single-digit loan growth for the medium to long term, but it\u2019s still very challenging in the near term. So what circumstances do you think might be necessary for the bank to finally hit the target, and to what extent is that loan growth assumption baked into our Banking NII guidance? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Jeremy. I\u2019ll ask Pam to address both questions. Let me share some insight on capital distribution. Look, with a mid-teens return guidance, there\u2019s plenty of space to do the 50% dividend payout ratio and to support the businesses to grow, which has always been the priority use of additional capital. But as you said, loan growth hasn\u2019t been there for the last many quarters, and the opportunity for us was to return the excess capital through share buybacks. It remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through share buybacks, because we see this also as a means to create an accretion in our dividend per share \u2013 earnings per share and dividends per share, by reducing the share count. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Georges. Firstly, in terms of our views on the 50% earnings per share, we are very comfortable with that number, and as you can see, we look at obviously distribution but also opportunities for growth that we can deploy our surplus capital. I\u2019m very pleased that we are trading above tangible book value, and we absolutely don\u2019t consider the tangible book value to be a ceiling for our buybacks. Share buybacks will continue to be our preferred mode of distribution going forward. The other thing on dividends is that you obviously have to look at where your CET1 is at a point of time. You have to look at regulatory changes. For now 50%, we\u2019re very comfortable with. Now, in terms of your next question on loan growth, we need to unbundle it a little bit. Yes, loan growth is flat. It was down $3 billion in Hong Kong, up $3 billion for the rest of Asia, up $1 billion for the UK, down $1 billion for the rest of the world. We are optimistic that as the interest rate trajectory stabilizes there will be customer demand, and when there\u2019s customer demand we\u2019ll be there obviously to support our customers. But what\u2019s also really important is as we\u2019re seeing that from a Hong Kong perspective there is some momentum coming back, we expect at least the loan trajectory in Hong Kong to stabilise and not reduce. Once that happens, given the other breakdown I\u2019ve given you, that gives us more optimism in terms of loan growth.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Jeremy.\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Let\u2019s go back to the call. Andy Coombs from Citigroup, please.\nAndy Coombs: Good morning. If I can have two follow-ups, please, firstly on the capital return and secondly on the costs. On the buybacks, if you could just clarify, the $2 billion is obviously a step down from $3 billion. Should we think about that as a permanent step down, given that you now need to absorb these upfront restructuring charges, or does the $2 billion reflect a shorter timing period between Q4 and Q1 results compared to other quarters? That\u2019s the first question. The second question, I want to have another stab at the costs. Ben asked about this. I think the walk to 2025 is very clear, but if we then think about the walk to 2026, should we assume a similar level of inflation and investment? Is 4% a fair assumption for future years in your view as well? Then when we eyeball slide 29, which has that cost phasing, and it looks like there\u2019s a $600 million, $700 million step up in the cost saves in 2026, before the full run rate is recognized in 2027. So are we looking at a 4% increase in 2026 from that 2025 guide, less another incremental $700 million of cost saves, so a sub-$34 billion cost number? Anything you can give us in terms of how to frame, more explicitly, that 2026 and 2027 cost base would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andy. Let me deal with your capital question, and I\u2019ll ask Pam to talk you through cost. But remember, we only guided return on tangible equity for 2026 and 2027. We haven\u2019t given additional specific guidance. So look, on capital, $2 billion because we have two months until April and that amount will be reviewed on a case-by-case, quarter-by-quarter basis. We do not pre-commit on any future amounts. It will depend on the outlook and the loan growth and other parameters as we get to it. But the current $2 billion is obviously because we have two months until the results in April. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Georges. In terms of cost, we are not giving a cost guidance beyond full-year 2025. The big moving parts always when we look at our cost is what\u2019s the underlying inflation, staff costs and we also track very closely what\u2019s the increase in fixed pay from a staff cost perspective. So it was expected 3.6% in 2025. It was 4.4% in 2024, so you can see the trajectory shifting as obviously inflation is coming down. We also include in that 4%, and we have for 2025, additional investments, so you can do the math in terms of where we go to for 2026. But also let\u2019s be mindful, so far we\u2019re saying for 2025 we are only taking $300 million of the $1.5 billion down to the savings line, so there is an absolute tailwind for the rest of it coming through for 2026, so that\u2019s how the math works. And as we go into 2027, I would expect two things to happen. You\u2019ll see some normalization on the inflation and the underlying built number. We will have the BAU investment, so that continues the same building block, but what\u2019s important is even though the $1.5 billion has been taken down to the bottom line we expect through our simplification some of the additional efficiency costs beyond just FTE-related costs, i.e. the ways of working, so that will give us some tailwind, but obviously not to the same extent as you\u2019ve had in 2026.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andy.\nNeil Sankoff: Our next question is from Amit Goel at Mediobanca. Amit, you're on mute.\nGeorges Elhedery: Amit, you maybe still on mute.\nNeil Sankoff: Amit, we will \u2013 we can come back to you. Let's go to\u2026\nAmit Goel: Sorry. Actually, the system wouldn't allow me to unmute myself. Thank you. So two questions then from me. One is, again, just when you\u2019re talking about the mid-teens RoTE target, so this year on a reported basis it was 14.6%, on ex notable items 16%. I just wanted to see, are you thinking about that more in line with the underlying ex notable items level that you\u2019ve achieved this year and that you can maintain that given the cost savings and wealth management growth that you\u2019re targeting, or are you looking at it closer to the reported number that you achieved in 2024? Then secondly, I just wanted to dig in a bit more in terms of the potential revenue impact or lack of from the cost actions, including the re-prioritization, just to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the marginal or negligible revenue impact. Is that because you just expect the revenue growth elsewhere from the reallocation of cost, or how you\u2019re thinking about that? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Amit. I\u2019ll take your first question and I\u2019ll ask Pam to address your second question about how we\u2019re looking to phase cost and the reallocation and the revenue impact of that. Look, it\u2019s quite simple for the first question. What we mean by mid-teens is around 14% to 16%, and our target is on return on tangible equity excluding notable items. This is how you should look at it. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Georges and Amit. Just adding a little bit to the RoTE question, mid- teens is mid-teens, what it says on the tin: 14 to 16%. It\u2019s a target and obviously, if the world\u2019s in a better place, there is an upside, but you also have to look at the downside and that\u2019s how we look at all scenarios in our assumptions. Coming back to your second question on the $1.5 billion. Firstly I want to clarify, the first $1.5 billion, which is simplification savings, has no revenue impact because it\u2019s literally more senior roles, deduplication, simplifying the matrix. On that, there is no revenue impact and the whole savings is a tailwind which goes straight to the bottom line. On the second $1.5 billion, which is different, it is clearly a reallocation, which will happen from the individual business level, but we will take it all to the Group level. Now, when you take it all to the Group level, there is going to be some time lag between the cost coming up and re-investing, but we do think that the payback period is pretty quick because we know it\u2019s in existing areas we want to reinvest. So that time lag on the revenue should not be that long and that will get compensated. But as we have said before, we are taking this reallocation of cost, particularly from two areas: ones where we are sub-scale, and so materially it doesn\u2019t really make an impact in terms of your profit \u2013 they\u2019re small-scale divestments \u2013 but there are others where in terms of profitability they are not materially profitable, like we said on the investment bank. Therefore, as we take them through into new areas with higher returns and being very focused on those which are our competitive strengths, we do think that positivity will come back pretty quickly.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Amit.\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Any more in the room before we go back to the \u2013 Is that Katherine? Okay. Katherine, please.\nKatherine Lei: Thank you. I'm Katherine from JPMorgan. I just want to clarify on the cost questions. I would like to ask about the second $1.5 billion. Have we factored that in the mid-teens RoTE guidance? Because when we are exiting some business, we need some regulatory approval and it\u2019s hard to gauge the timeline. What assumptions do we have regarding these parts in our mid-teens RoTE guidance? The underlying question is will we see some upside, because if we do it faster or slower like that. The second one, I still want to ask about CRE question. I think it\u2019s an old question, but I think we still have a lot of people, a lot of investors care about it. Both in Hong Kong and China in last quarter we heard some events which led to some concerns on these areas. If I look at our Q4 numbers, I know that some are edging up on the ECL charges. Is any parts of that related to CRE and what is our outlook on CRE in both regions? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Katherine. I\u2019m going to ask Pam to address both your questions but let me share with you just briefly my outlook on the CRE situation. So firstly, in mainland China we believe that we\u2019ve hit a trough, really, in the challenges that the sector has faced. We believe the measures that have been taken to stabilise and start a normalisation process are working their way effectively through the economy. But more importantly, our exposure has materially reduced and therefore it is not going to be any more any major driver for our ECL. Second, about Hong Kong. We\u2019re actually positive about the outlook of Hong Kong. Hong Kong, first the economy and certainly rate trajectory is going to support that, we\u2019re seeing growth manifest in 2024, in growth outlook in 2025 and a number of sectors really have revived. But also in the CRE space, the underlying CRE market in Hong Kong is strong and resilient. The supply/demand equation is very supportive for the medium to long term and as we said, the rate outlook will also support that. But then if you look at our exposure to many of the borrowers in the space, the borrowers are much stronger and much less leveraged than what we\u2019ve seen in the China CRE space. They are in a better balance sheet position, albeit they may have cash flow challenges due to high rates, et cetera, but the loan to valuation we have on our exposure is also very strong. We are in the 50s percent. Therefore, we do not think the Hong Kong CRE exposure in our books will be any material driver of our future ECLs. Pam can address your questions on cost and take you more specifically in the CRE elements.\nPam Kaur: Thank you for your question. So firstly, yes, we have factored the reallocation into our mid-teens RoTE guidance, and we\u2019ll work as quickly as we can to reallocate costs to higher- return areas. Obviously, if it is faster than our assumptions \u2013 we tend to be a bit conservative, which is a good space to be, then there will be some upside. But given regulatory approvals, et cetera, things can be slower. But all in all, we are still very comfortable to have a mid-teens RoTE for each of the next three years. I\u2019ll take the China CRE question first, and then I\u2019ll do Hong Kong CRE. Now China CRE, we\u2019ve always been very comfortable with our onshore exposure, which has been secured. The issue really has been with the offshore exposure, which was unsecured, but that number is way down from where we started. We are now down to $2.2 billion net of ECLs, and, out of that, there is very little of the exposures where we feel that there is more headwind. And as you can see, the chart for ECL last year was much lower than the prior years. So that, I think, gives me a sense of optimism with regard to the trajectory of the China CRE outlook. And of course, you can have one-off cases, and things move on, but, overall, it\u2019s based upon our exposure. Now, on Hong Kong CRE, just as a starting point, as long as the interest rate trajectory is high, of course you can see some customers facing headwinds, because it\u2019s a cash flow issue, fundamentally, and that makes you bring more names into the stage 3s. But what\u2019s very important to note is that, despite them coming into stage 3s, our ECLs haven\u2019t increased, and the answer is quite simple. Most of the names coming through the stage 3s last year have been from a secured portfolio, which is 54% of our total portfolio. And as Georges said, there\u2019s a very high level of collateralization. I mean, average LTV on sub-standard is 46% and, on the impaired, is at 58%, so there\u2019s enough room in that space and there is strong collateral. So even when they go to stage 3, there is not an ECL increase, and the ECL increase this year has been minimal and we see nothing changing there. On the unsecured, 90% of it is investment grade, so 46% of portfolio is unsecured; 90% is investment grade. And it\u2019s primarily with the conglomerates and strong developers and, because they have diversified cash flows, the inflow into stage 3 from this portion of the book is very small. So all in all, even though, with the increase in stage 3s, you see a minimal uplift in RWAs and the capital impact, but a very small capital impact, from an ECL perspective, there is really no material change in the ECL trajectory at this point of time, and we are very comfortable that it\u2019s all well within our mid-term guidance of 30 to 40 basis points.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Katherine.\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Let\u2019s go to Joe Dickerson from Jefferies, please.\nJoe Dickerson: Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one following on from the Hong Kong CRE question. If I look at the ECL allowance to stage 3, it was 67% FY2023, and that\u2019s fallen to, I think, about 26%, 25%, 26% in respect of full-year for the Hong Kong piece. So I guess I\u2019m just wondering what explains that decline. Is it the proportion of the stage 3s that are secured that\u2019s driving that reduction in coverage? Or what\u2019s the answer there, and how low can that number go?\nPam Kaur: Yes. I\u2019m happy to take the question, thank you. You\u2019re absolutely right. It is really because all of the stage 3s, virtually \u2013 a very large majority is coming through from the secured and, given the cover, ECL coverage is dropping through. But also we\u2019ve written off some of the China CRE exposure overall, and you should think in terms of total exposures that we have, and that\u2019s also reducing the ECL coverage.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Joe.\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Our next question is from Aman Rakkar at Barclays.\nAman Rakkar: Hi, guys. Good morning, Pam. Good morning, Georges. I had two questions. I think you\u2019re pointing to much better pre-provision profit outlook than consensus. I guess we\u2019ve laboured the discussion around costs, but my takeaway is that it is broadly flattish beyond 2025, and maybe a bit of growth, but well lower than where the street is. I think Banking NII guidance also speaks for itself, so there are two related questions to that. One is around non-interest income. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts on non-interest income, but I think you\u2019re coming in with significant momentum on non-interest income, in excess of consensus, but we do have a lot of moving parts there. Is there anything you can do to help us? I know you don\u2019t like to talk too much about non-interest income, because there\u2019s volatile line items in it, but you\u2019ve got double-digit growth momentum in wealth management, trade that\u2019s probably growing low to mid-single digits. Who knows what markets do, but they\u2019re probably not going backwards. Then you\u2019ve got a retail piece as well. But it just does feel like that is something that is trending well in excess. So if you were able to comment in respect of 2025 consensus, that would be really helpful. The second is about Banking NII. So the $42 billion guidance this year is great. And I know there\u2019s a lot of focus on lending, but really it\u2019s deposits that matter, right? You alluded to the strength of your franchise. And loans are going to be subdued for a while, but deposits are already growing and, indeed, they\u2019re going to continue growing from here. Can you try and help us with that? Are you able to quantify the deposit growth and average interest-earning asset growth that we might look to expect? Because I think you can comfortably grow your balance sheet despite a subdued demand dynamic in your key markets. I think that really helps underpin the kind of Banking NII beyond 2025. My kind of slight follow-up question, then, I\u2019m going to sneak it in, but it\u2019s just around FX. And if you were to mark to market any of the cost guide, for example, for the spot FX rate, if that would affect any of your kind of guide or commentary today, that would be really helpful. Thanks so much.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Aman. I\u2019ll ask Pam to handle your Banking NII question and the FX question, which will have an impact on our Banking NII guidance. I\u2019ll take your first question by saying, \u2018Nice try\u2019. Unfortunately, I cannot give you more than what we shared. What we\u2019ve shared is a confidence that we\u2019re running the bank towards a mid-teens target on return on tangible equity excluding notable items for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We\u2019re also guiding to a medium-term outlook on Wealth at double-digit growth, which we\u2019re comfortable with, given this is an area where we\u2019re investing in and we see the underlying trends supportive, but this is more a medium-term guidance. It\u2019s difficult to evaluate what it means on a year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter basis. And we\u2019re also comfortable that our wholesale transaction banking \u2013 given our strong leadership position in many of these areas, we will be able to ride the wave, and we think the wave \u2013 the macro is in a low-single-digit percentage growth. It\u2019s subject to possible disruptions, but the underlying trend, if you look at global trade with all forms of corridors \u2013 not just some of the disrupted corridors \u2013 other corridors are likely to continue growing. I think this is how you should look at it. And remember the rate trajectory as well. It\u2019s still uncertain, but that will be a way if we see faster rate cuts than we\u2019ve implied. Let me just pause here on that part of the question and ask Pam to take you through Banking NII and FX.\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Aman. So firstly, our cost guidance is on a constant currency basis, so clearly, from an FX perspective, there could be an impact. In terms of the $42 billion guidance, you\u2019re right. On loans, we say it\u2019s mid-single-digit growth in the medium term, and lower rates will help to get some momentum back, but it\u2019s also driven by overall market confidence, so I can\u2019t really call out the timing of the return to loan growth exactly. Now, deposits, clearly, was a key one in the fourth quarter, but we know that, in the fourth quarter, there\u2019s a bit of a seasonality effect, so I would very much caution you against annualizing that number. But I think, in terms of deposits, if I look at just the drivers for the $42 billion guidance, there\u2019s interest rates, which is a headwind at this point of time, given the market-implied rate curves, and then there is the structural hedge, which will be a tailwind. The loans, we have talked about. On deposits, we feel very lucky to have a strong deposit base, as you\u2019ve said, and the trust of our customers to give us those deposits is a cornerstone for our strong balance sheet. The deposit benefit for next year is driven by what\u2019s going to be the time deposit mix, because that held through in the fourth quarter. As the interest rates come down, we expect the time deposit mix to also come down. So in that context, you can factor that in as part of your overall calculation in terms of the headwinds and the tailwinds.\nGeorges Elhedery: Perfect. Thank you, Aman.\nNeil Sankoff: And our last question today comes from Rob Noble at Deutsche Numis.\nRobert Noble: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the $1.5 billion of reallocation in the strategy. How much line of sight do you have on it at this point? So I presume GBM, Germany and France is around $500 million in costs. Do you know where the other $1 billion is coming from, and the phasing of it? And then, linked to that, what are the restructuring charges from this part of the strategy? Should I still be thinking about 1.2x the costs saved as additional below-the-line items against that $1.5 billion, or is that the wrong way to think about it?\nGeorges Elhedery: Okay. Thank you, Rob, for the question. Look, let me handle the reallocation, and I\u2019ll ask Pam to comment on the cost implication and treatment, if you want. So first, look your math is right. There are a number of activities we already called out. The investment banking refocus will generate around $0.3 billion of saves, and we\u2019ll lose about $0.3 billion of revenue against it, so that\u2019s quite there. We did announce the German Private Bank, the French insurance. We announced this morning also the sale of our Bahrain retail business. So those are kind of in motion. There are a number of other things we\u2019ve called out that are in motion. There are a number of selectively identified number of activities that are non-strategic, which we\u2019re working on, and they\u2019ll be a continuation of that journey. If you just kind of note that we said this is a medium-term number. We haven\u2019t given a strict deadline, because some of these actions may take longer or may be subject to various approvals that are beyond our control, and we will be able to share with you as and when we move forward. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Thanks. So first, yes, we have identified the rest of the costs. We can\u2019t give a precise cost at this point of time. We\u2019ll obviously keep you updated over the next quarters. Now, in terms of the one-off costs, yes, there will be severance and other one-off costs, and we will be looking at those costs, to a large extent, given the materiality, where there is, from a notable \u2013 as notable items, so that\u2019s kind of the broad picture in terms of how we\u2019re progressing. So good broad line beyond where we are, but I can\u2019t give you any more precision at this point of time.\nGeorges Elhedery: Perfect. Thank you very much, Rob. Okay. Well, thank you, all, for your questions. So in closing, strong 2024 performance. This provides us firm foundations upon which we are building. We\u2019ve simplified the Group and, along with our continued focus on costs, as Pam said, we are committed to delivering circa $1.5 billion of savings to the bottom line. We\u2019re also focused on delivering for our customers by capturing growth opportunities where we have a clear competitive advantage and accretive returns. And we are eliminating, over the medium term, an additional circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities, and redeploying them into these priority growth areas. We\u2019re also targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027. As usual, Neil and the team are available for any follow-ups. Meanwhile, Pam and I hope to see many of you here in Hong Kong next month for our second HSBC Global Investment Summit. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you.

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Welcome, all, to today\u2019s call. I\u2019m joined by Pam, our new Group CFO. We\u2019re delighted to be here in Hong Kong, the city where HSBC was founded 160 years ago. Our history and heritage stand us in good stead in so many ways. Adapting to new economic realities and technologies is what we have always done. It brings out the best in our people and culture, especially when acting as a trusted advisor to our customers as they navigate the world\u2019s economic uncertainties and look towards new opportunities. Before Pam takes you through the fourth quarter numbers, I will cover four items. First, I will go through our full-year 2024 results. Second, I will set out the changes implemented over the past few months to create a simple, more agile, focused bank addressing the ways we operate in a fundamental way. Third, I will describe in some detail the solid foundations we are building on. And finally, I will share with you what we plan to do next in order to deliver sustainable strategic growth and meet our return targets. Starting with the full-year numbers, 2024 performance was strong. We delivered record profit before tax of $32.3 billion, or $34.1 billion excluding notable items. We generated a 14.6% return on tangible equity, or 16% excluding notable items, in line with our mid-teens target. We announced a total of $26.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders in respect of 2024, including $0.87 per share of dividends and $11 billion of share buybacks. When I took the role in September, my priority was to inject energy and intent in the way we deliver our strategy, while maintaining continued focused cost discipline. At our third-quarter results, I committed to provide you with more detail on the expected benefits from our organizational simplification. We have simplified HSBC in two important ways. We have elevated and empowered our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK and our Wealth proposition, and we have combined our two wholesale businesses. In doing so, we have eliminated large parts of our complex matrix governance structure. This significantly improved operating model is now led by a tighter Group Operating Committee. It has clarity of accountability, fewer management lines and layers, reducing the need for the number of committees we previously ran across the bank. This has increased our agility. As an illustration, previously, every dollar of revenue we generated had at least two accountable executives at the Group Executive Committee. Today, around 60% of our revenue has a single accountable executive at the Group Operating Committee. This will empower our people to make faster decisions, collaborate better and innovate for the benefit of our customers. In short, we\u2019ve simplified our structure and we\u2019ve aligned it to our strategy. This will enable us to deliver around $1.5 billion of annualized savings by the end of full-year 2025, primarily through deduplication of roles. This represents circa 8% reduction of our global staffing costs. This will cost around $1.8 billion in severance and other up-front costs. Those $1.5 billion savings will have no meaningful impact on revenue and they will be taken straight to the bottom line. Separately, we will redeploy circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities as incremental investments to our priority growth areas, where we have clear competitive advantages and generate accretive returns. We have started to do this by announcing that we will begin to wind down our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, Europe and the U.S. I will cover our priority growth areas shortly. These actions give us the confidence to target a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Each of our four businesses are firmly rooted in our core strengths. In our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK, we have two strong businesses. In both businesses, we serve Personal Banking customers as well as Commercial Banking and Small and Medium Enterprises. We are a leading bank and are growing market share in key products. Importantly, in both, we are profitable and delivering very good returns. As for the large corporations with global banking needs in both home markets, alongside individuals with multi-country personal financial needs, they will be served by our two international businesses, as I am about to set out. Corporate and Institutional Banking, CIB, is a global wholesale bank with significant competitive advantages. It has a powerful deposit franchise with strong financing capabilities, and it also has a market-leading transaction bank, leveraging our global network. As the world\u2019s number one trade bank for the last seven consecutive years, we are exceptionally well placed to help our customers and capture global and intra-regional trade flows as supply chains reconfigure, new trade routes emerge, economies grow, and our customer expectations evolve. CIB is also well positioned to help entrepreneurs secure the capital they need to build the businesses of the future and help our customers decarbonize. International Wealth and Premier Banking, IWPB, is ideally placed to capture the increasing number of affluent and high-net-worth customers, especially those with international banking needs who seek new investment opportunities to help them protect and grow their wealth. Our recognized brand, financial strength and complementary footprints across Asia and the Middle East reinforce our position in the world\u2019s fastest growing wealth markets. Let me now highlight our distinctive strengths, starting with our high-quality revenue streams. Our franchise generates resilient recurring revenue from three key sources. As you can see, in 2024, two-thirds of revenue was from Banking NII. This is the result of the strong deposit and lending positions in each of our four core businesses. As you know, we have built up the structural hedge to protect this revenue stream from falling interest rates. Pam will speak more about this. The remaining third was from fee and other income. Around a half of this was from our market-leading Wholesale Transaction Banking business, which is built on our global network, covering 85% of global trade and capital flows, including high-growth markets such as India, ASEAN, of course mainland China, the Middle East and Mexico. Around a third was from Wealth, which I will talk about shortly. Taken together, this means that more than 90% of our revenue comes from three high-quality streams. Moving to our strong deposit franchise, our customers trust the strength of our balance sheet and have chosen us to look after their deposits. This gives us a highly liquid and profitable balance sheet, which provides greater flexibility through the cycle. Within our $1.7 trillion deposit base, we have large deposit surpluses in each of our four businesses, giving us the funding capacity to support our clients. Turning now to our high-quality loan portfolio, we have always maintained a conservative approach to risk management, as evidenced by the quality of our loan portfolio. In the period since 2018, we have experienced a global pandemic, an energy crisis and the real-estate cycle in the U.S., in Hong Kong and in mainland China. Our average annual ECL charge over that period was 32 basis points of average gross loans, which is well within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. On our disciplined capital management, over the last two years, our capital generation has enabled us to return $47.7 billion to our shareholders. This comprises of $27.7 billion of dividends and $20 billion of share buybacks, including those announced today. Through the rolling series of share buybacks we have undertaken since the start of 2023, we have now repurchased 11% of our year-end 2022 issued share count. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. The external environment presents us with opportunities but also challenges. The interest rate outlook is benign but it remains volatile. We can adapt to changing patterns of trade and economic growth, but there is a risk of disruption, and we have a major opportunity in wealth in Asia and the Middle East, but it is a highly competitive space. Despite these challenges, we have levers we can pull on to support us to deliver on our target. We\u2019re confident we can take decisive action to do so. These levers are, first, driving operating leverage as an ongoing process through cost efficiency and optimization, as well as continuous improvements in productivity, second, dynamic balance sheet management and capital allocation, which I\u2019ll cover shortly, and third, investing for strategic long-term growth. Let me turn to this next. We're creating the capacity to invest for growth in the business and to drive efficiencies. We\u2019re focusing our growing investment pot, as shown on this and the next slide. First, in our home markets, we intend to expand the number of wealth centers and enhance our wealth capabilities in Hong Kong, which is set to become the world\u2019s leading cross-border wealth center. We attracted around 800,000 new-to-bank personal banking customers in Hong Kong last year, and we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities as international customers choose Hong Kong as their cross-border wealth hub. In the UK, we plan to also grow the Wealth business, and we plan to improve our SME coverage and proposition. This is an extremely attractive and profitable segment, where we will intensify our focus. Second, in CIB, we intend to leverage our network and further enhance our transaction banking capabilities, including in high-growth markets such as Mainland China, ASEAN, India, Middle East and Mexico. We are also looking to scale up our broad loan origination capabilities by underwriting more and distributing more to our institutional and wealth clients. This ability to leverage our loan origination for the purpose of distribution will give us larger opportunities to generate fee income, improve capital efficiencies and, in turn, improve CIB returns. Third, in IWPB, we intend to accelerate the wealth build-up in our home markets, and particularly also in key growth markets such as Singapore, the UAE, India and Mainland China. In each of these, we aim to accelerate the hiring of relationship managers, establish new wealth centers, and expand our product offering. While we are benefiting from an underlying growth in this segment, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, we also aim to grow our market share by, first, better driving wealth penetration with our own wholesale or Premier customers, second, better capturing cross-border flows of our own customers in their outbound location, and third, increasing the proportion of mandates within our invested assets. Finally, underpinning all of this and across the Group, we aim to seize the opportunity of AI and generative AI. Our flagship initiatives will focus on improving customer service through both our mobile apps and our contact centers. We also intend to increase tech productivity with tools such as coding assistants, and improve process efficiency in areas such as onboarding, KYC, credit applications and many others. Mid-teens returns will give us a range of attractive options for capital deployment and will drive EPS and DPS growth over time. As the illustration on the right-hand side of the slide demonstrates, a mid-teens return on tangible equity will enable us to deliver the 50% dividend payout ratio in 2025, and still have sufficient capital to grow the balance sheet, buy back shares, or both. Supporting our customers will always be our first priority, and we expect our loan book to grow in the mid-single digits over the medium- to long-term. However, fluctuations in customer demand for credit mean our loan book may grow at an uneven pace. Share buybacks remain our preferred method of returning excess capital to our shareholders, because they drive growth in EPS and DPS. For instance, in 2024, while our earnings grew by circa 2%, our earnings per share grew by circa 9%, reflecting the benefit from the circa 6% reduction of share count through share buybacks in this year. So in summary, we\u2019ve simplified the Group and, along with our continued focus on costs, are committed to delivering circa $1.5 billion savings to the bottom line. We\u2019re focused on delivering for our customers by capturing growth opportunities where we have a clear competitive advantage and accretive returns. And we\u2019re eliminating, over the medium term, an additional circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities, and redeploying them into these priority growth areas. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027. With that, let me hand over to Pam."

        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "Thanks, Georges. Thank you, everyone, for joining. I would like to begin by sharing my approach as Group CFO. In short, I\u2019m fully focused on discipline, performance and delivery. Discipline means prioritizing with precision, maintaining strong cost control, and ensuring investment rigor for growth. Performance means gearing our financial strategy towards achieving our mid-teens returns target. Delivery means ensuring we remain agile and resilient, enhance operating leverage, and are always well positioned to support our customers. Let me now turn to the Q4 numbers. Starting with the highlights, profit before tax was $2.3 billion, or $7.3 billion excluding notable items. This strong performance enabled us to announce a further $8.4 billion of distributions in respect of the fourth quarter. This consists of a fourth interim dividend of 36 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we intend to complete before our first-quarter results in April. On this slide, you can see the impact of notable items on year-on-year revenue and profit growth. This was principally the $5.2 billion related to historical foreign exchange translation losses from the Argentina disposal. Excluding these, profit before tax was up 10% on the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue of $16.5 billion was up $1.2 billion on the fourth quarter of last year, driven by Banking NII and a strong performance in Wealth. On Banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina and other notable items, the Banking NII run rate remained broadly stable. Deposit growth and benefits from the structural hedge were partially offset by lower interest rates. Looking ahead, we expect Banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. To be clear, this is a change to the way we have given you guidance before. \u2018Around $42 billion\u2019 is not an underpin. It is our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections. We also want to give you some additional detail on the structural hedge. As you know, we have been building up the structural hedge to help manage our interest rate sensitivity. During 2024, we increased the notional balance by around $50 billion. We also extended the duration from 2.8 years to 3.1 years. This contributed to a further reduction in the interest rate sensitivity of our Banking NII last year. We have reduced our sensitivity to a 100-basis-point rate shock from around $7 billion in June 2022 to around $2.9 billion at the end of 2024. We\u2019re also providing additional disclosures on the expected reinvestment profile of the structural hedge. We expect to reinvest around $95 billion of assets in each of 2025 and 2026, from a current average yield of around 2.8%. We also expect to reinvest around $90 billion of assets in 2027, from a current average yield of around 3.4%. Moving to fee and other income, Wholesale Transaction Banking was stable on last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of strategic transactions, primarily the sale of Canada, it was up by 3%, as we continue to leverage our global network and capitalize on our position as the world\u2019s number one trade bank. The standout performance was again in Wealth, which was up 27% on the same quarter last year. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth. I\u2019m pleased we added 234,000 new-to-bank Personal Banking customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. This brings the total number added in 2024 to 799,000, as Hong Kong continues to grow in importance as a cross-border wealth hub. I\u2019m also pleased with the strong momentum in the business in January, which is in line with previous years. All of this gives us confidence that we can continue to grow this business further. Our medium-term target is to continue to grow fee and other income by double-digit CAGR. There are three trends that underpin this ambition. First, the multi-year growth in new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong underlines that the city is on track to becoming the number one cross-border wealth hub before the end of this decade. Our past experience suggests that new customers grow their total balances and wealth products over time, so this is expected to provide a tailwind. Second, the strength of our business in key international wealth hubs, particularly Hong Kong, has enabled us to grow invested assets in Asia at 17% CAGR. This was also the key driver of our 13% CAGR growth in invested assets at the Group level. There have also been strong multi-year inflows of net new invested assets, with Asia accounting for the majority. Finally, our CSM balance is a third bigger than it was two years ago, despite the reclassification of our French life insurance business in the fourth quarter. This reflects continued year-on-year growth in new business CSM from higher volumes, particularly in Hong Kong. As you know, the CSM balance is a store of future earnings, which released into the P&L at between 9% and 10% in the last two years. All things being equal, this means that future earnings growth has been built in. Also, last year the value of new business CSM was substantially greater than the CSM released to the P&L. On credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1.4 billion. $1 billion of this was in wholesale, including around $300 million from two clients, one in the UK and one in Mainland China commercial real estate sector. Overall, our portfolios in our home markets remained strong. This brought our 2024 charge to 36 basis points of average loans, which is within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. We expect our 2025 charge to be within our medium-term planning range. On costs, we are committed to deliver $1.5 billion of simplification savings from our reorganization to the bottom line, of which around $0.3 billion will be recognized in our 2025 P&L. We expect to incur around $1.8 billion of severance and other up-front costs by the end of 2026. The bulk of these costs will be incurred this year. Separately, we are also aiming to reallocate a further around $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic activities to priority growth areas. You will have seen that we have announced that we will begin to wind down our ECM and M&A activities in the UK, Europe and the US while refocusing on Asia. Those businesses were not materially profitable and exiting them will make around $300 million of costs available for reinvestment in our priority growth areas. The slide also shows some businesses that we have recently agreed to dispose of, German Private Banking and French life insurance, to which I\u2019ll add the sale of our retail banking operations in Bahrain, which was announced today. These were not aligned with our four businesses where we will focus our investment dollars and our time. Through these actions, we are creating investment space in our priority areas within our strict cost discipline. As Georges said, these include Wealth in Asia and the Middle East, UK SME coverage and wholesale transaction banking. Entry to the extra investment list is a high hurdle requiring strategic alignment and financial returns. As we continue to work through exits of low return and non-strategic activities, we are confident the investment dollars they provide will deliver a higher return to the bank. The actions taken last year mean that 2024 costs were in line with our guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. We remain fully committed to cost discipline. We expect 2025 costs to grow by around 3% compared with 2024 on a target basis, which excludes notable items and the direct costs of the Canada and Argentina disposals. Our guidance of around 3% growth includes up to 4% underlying growth from inflation and investment, partly offset by around $0.3 billion of efficiency cost savings that we expect to realize this year. On loans and deposits, loan balances were stable. Deposits were up 3% in the fourth quarter. This included an increase in Hong Kong supported by customer growth as well as seasonality. As we have said before, I would caution you against annualising that number. Our CET1 ratio was 14.9%, above our target range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect the buyback of up to $2 billion announced today to have an impact of around 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter. We have reclassified our $7 billion legacy French home loan portfolio as hold to collect and sell in the first quarter. This will lead to recognition of an estimated $1 billion pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. In summary, we have set out our current expectations in respect of 2025 and the medium term, but our key target is mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. We will run the bank to deliver this. Neil, can we go to Q&A please?"

        "text": "Thank you. Gurpreet Sahi from Goldman Sachs. If I can have two, please, the first is on CIB. Thank you for the 14% trailing RoTE. So with the cost saves, et cetera, where do we expect the CIB RoTE to trend over the next couple of years and how would the management think about incremental capital allocation in that business division? I know that interest rates are having an impact. So implied question is \u2013 let\u2019s say interest rates were a lot lower and payments, cash management, et cetera, earn us less. And then the second one is on International Wealth and Premier Banking. Thanks, again, for the 16% RoTE. So how should we think about incremental technology or new apps or kind of gaining market share in the cross-border area as it relates to International Wealth, given that the RoTE is not so high? So how would be for example, Zing and those kinds of apps, where we were looking at competing with the fintech, how competitive would we want to be? Thank you so much."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you very much, Gurpreet. I will handle the two questions. On CIB, we haven\u2019t given specific returns medium-term returns for CIB. As Pam said, we\u2019ve given the bank-wide target of mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We haven\u2019t given a business-specific, but let me give you some indications of how we\u2019re looking at the business. First, this business will benefit from the largest of the reorganization-related cost saves because this business is the result of the merger of two wholesale businesses and, as per any merger, you would expect a lot of cost synergies in areas where we had duplicative activities, be it mostly back-office activities that are duplicative where we will achieve the savings. This business also will benefit from additional we call it also the investment space from additional capital allocation efficiencies. We will be looking for more originate and distribute model. We will be looking to churn the balance sheet more, sweat the balance sheet more, drive higher earnings and fee income from this balance sheet and create better efficiency in the capital, and therefore we have a number of activities that will support this business\u2019s return on tangible equity performance. And remember also this business is a leading business in wholesale transaction banking. We\u2019re the largest trade bank in the world for seven consecutive years. We\u2019re a top-two bank in payments and a top-two bank in foreign exchange. We\u2019re the largest bank in securities services across Asia and the Middle East, so we\u2019re benefiting from an amazing transaction banking capability. We\u2019re also benefiting from an amazing deposit franchise. As you\u2019ve seen, this business is in the 50s percent loan-to-deposit ratio, and that is a highly stable and highly profitable proposition. So a lot of investment in this business is to support this direction of travel. I didn\u2019t mention the activities such as debt capital markets, et cetera, which also remain core in the wider capital solutions we provide to our customers. On your second question about IWPB, I think you have to look at this business as one of the largest growth engines of this firm. I mean, starting with Hong Kong, Hong Kong is on track to become the world\u2019s largest cross-border wealth hub, ahead of Switzerland, by the end of this decade. We\u2019re talking a few years. 800,000 new-to-bank customers, and we see this trend continuing. Then you look at various other parts of our network. Singapore is a major financial hub. The UAE has become a major wealth hub. We are the leading international wealth provider in mainland China and in India. So we continue to invest in these areas, and that investment will come in all forms, like more relationship managers, more wealth centers, more products on the shelf, more technology capabilities, and therefore, you have to expect that a lot of investment will go to this business, but this business is exhibiting already double-digit growth. I mean this business, Wealth in particular, has grown more than 20% year-on-year, and if you look at Asia alone our Wealth business in 2024 has grown more than 30% year-on-year, and therefore it deserves a lot of investment, even if that means we will eat a little bit on our return growth because we want to really secure our future as a leading provider, and our brand in parts of the world, such as Asia and the Middle East, is frankly second to none in our capability to attract this. Cross-border is a very important area for us. Frankly, we have to punch at our weight. We\u2019re punching below our weight in cross-border. Our customers are with us in a given location, and then we lose them as their wealth or part of their wealth moves to another location. By just setting the right referral mechanisms, the product capabilities cross-border, the internal incentives, there is so much we can capture. It\u2019s our own customers. So the reach is fairly easy. It\u2019s a self-help mechanism that we\u2019re trying to just recover on. As for Zing, so Zing was a fantastic technology platform which we built and were rolling out to non-clients that we were building from scratch and built a few tens of thousands. What we did is we flipped it over its head, and we\u2019re bringing in the technology platform right in the core proposition. As we roll this technology platform within our core proposition in the UK, 15 million clients will be able to benefit from it practically straight away, and we shouldn\u2019t be preventing that. That, on the contrary, accelerates our acquisition of international customers. And then, as we start thinking, rolling these new technologies widely in our Wealth business, there\u2019s a lot of potential we can get there. And that is a much faster gain than trying to build it from scratch in an area where we have non-customers working with a different brand than our very strong brand, HSBC. Thank you, Gurpreet."

        "text": "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is related to the $1.5 billion reallocation of costs. I just wanted to understand a bit if you could talk around the revenues associated, the capital and the risk-weighted assets, so we get a bit of an idea of the optimization of this capital? And secondly, also what the return on investment on this that you expect? You mentioned a high hurdle rate. And then the second question is more general to you, Georges. I mean, you are a CIB guy; you think about curveball issues all the time, spillover effects. So I\u2019m quite interested about how you are planning for tariffs within the Group, and in particular how you\u2019re thinking about the curveballs, not the direct impacts, but the indirect impacts that are impacting you from CRE to Wealth growth, et cetera, FX, and how you\u2019re basically putting that in your planning on your outlook and sensitivities around that? Thanks."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Kian. Okay. I\u2019ll take the two questions, but if there are more details, additional granularity on CRE, I\u2019m sure Pam can handle that, but I\u2019ll just give you a general sense. So on your first question, $1.5 billion reallocation of costs, so what we did say is we would reallocate it from non-strategic or low-returning activities into activities where we have a competitive edge, where we have better returns, and where we have opportunities to grow. So you have to look at this as returns incremental. Just as an illustration, the wind-down of our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, U.S. and Europe will give us $300 million of saves as we achieve them, that we can redeploy elsewhere. This cost was generating broadly break-even profits, so we\u2019re marginally profitable in these activities. We do expect these to give us a much higher return as they\u2019re reinvested, and we haven\u2019t quantified that, but the expectation is that there\u2019s an accretion of return. Second, if you look at the areas we\u2019re looking to invest in, wealth, transaction banking, as big callouts, they are actually none or low balance sheet-consuming businesses. They\u2019re materially fee and other income-driving businesses, with low, if any, impact on RWA growth. And if you look at the SME business, this business is essentially liability-driven and transaction banking- driven. The loans portion of this business is relatively small. The loan to deposit ratio is in the low-teens percentage points, which means, again, it\u2019s a low RWA impact, high in Banking NII from deposits or transaction banking, but low RWA impact. In terms of your CIB curveball question, look, tariffs are not a new feature of global trade. There has always been various forms of tariffs on various products along various corridors, and we\u2019ve always navigated those with our clients and supported them along the route. I think what\u2019s changed now is maybe the speed at which the landscape will be evolving, the speed at which we may see new tariffs or changes in tariffs. But with the bank present on 85% of the trade corridors, with our global network, with our deep knowledge in all the markets where we operate, deep understanding of local rules and regulations, deep understanding of global rules and regulations, we\u2019re actually very well placed to support our customers adjust and position their businesses to navigate these tariffs. Now, I add to that also, remember, most of the jurisdictions we operate in have pro-growth government policies. The UK is a good example, pro-growth government policy; the US is a very good example;. mainland China, pro-growth initiatives, consumer support initiatives. You look at Hong Kong, the removal of the cooling off measures on the commercial real estate or real estate in general. These measures have been effective, and we\u2019re seeing the benefits in the economy and economic growth. So, there are a number of positive factors that also we can benefit from. We\u2019ve seen that in January, by the way. The start of this year has been very encouraging. And look, the idea of all the simplification work we\u2019ve done is that so we are simple, so we are agile, and agile means we can dynamically react and support our customers. And we will adapt quickly. We will react. We will make sure that we\u2019re supporting our customers along these journeys. Thank you, Kian."

I just note that that hasn\u2019t been mentioned in today\u2019s update. What are your latest thoughts on your medium- term ambitions for the CET1 ratio and has there been any change in sentiment? And then, secondly, on costs in relation to your $1.5 billion of savings, you note that they will be taken to the bottom line, although presumably there\u2019ll be offsets from drivers such as inflation. Maybe you could just clarify directionally what you expect the shape of costs will do coming out of 2025 and going into 2026 and 2027? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "Yes. Thanks, Georges. And Ben, coming to your first question, we are very comfortable operating between the 14% to 14.5% range. The comment on looking at it again was removed some time ago, so no change for now in that respect. I want to just unbundle a little bit more on the cost point. So on the cost point, if you look at the guidance that we have, and this is the $1.5 billion of cost savings that are going straight to the bottom line. So the way we\u2019ve looked at it is that it\u2019s about 4%, if you look at inflation, as well as BAU investment. The benefit of that $1.5 billion this year that we are taking straight to the bottom line is $300 million. So if you compare to on a target basis, and you\u2019re starting excluding disposals and hyperinflation, you start from 2024, it\u2019s going to be a 3% year-on-year growth. So that\u2019s what we are looking at. Now, severance and other one-off costs, they will be treated as notable items. Now, the timing of the $1.5 billion, yes, is $300 million this year. There\u2019ll be more to come, clearly, in 2026. We see the full benefit of the $1.5 billion savings coming through for the full-year 2027, and the severance costs, et cetera, will be more upfront."

I mean your feelings about the trends in these two businesses. I think, as a CEO, your feeling must be quite insightful. The second is about the new business areas you mentioned, along with your reform. I think many of them are non-capital consuming. So to what level should we expect the revenue structure to change to, going forward? Maybe the non-NII portion will be much higher than one- third. Yeah, that\u2019s my two questions. Thank you."

        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Kun. I\u2019ll take your first question, and I\u2019ll ask Pam to address your second question. So, look, trade and wealth. First, it\u2019s very difficult to predict what will happen to global trade in an uncertain environment, but what we can say is, for the last eight years, that trade has started to become more disrupted. Global trade has continued growing, low-single-digit percentage points. The trade routes have reconfigured. ASEAN has become the largest trading partner of China, ahead of the U.S. and Europe. We\u2019ve seen more intra-regional trade pick up. We\u2019ve seen more fragmentation of trade routes. So rather than the goods moving from point A to point B from, say, manufacturing to consumption, they\u2019re usually going through multiple legs on the journey, across various other jurisdictions. Now, it so happens that we still have expectations that global trade will grow at low-single-digit percentage points. And it so happens that this reconfiguration segmentation is playing to our strength, because many of these new jurisdictions that have become major participants in global trade are jurisdictions where we have deep presence and, in some cases, leading presence as an international bank, and we are able to capture these flows and we will be supporting our customers along these routes. In wealth, again, if you look at various analysts and consultants\u2019 consideration, Asia and Middle East wealth is expected to grow at high single digit into 10% CAGR for the next five years. So the underlying trend of the growth of the middle class in many of these Asian economies is there. And simply being a leading bank in this space, we benefit from this underlying trend, but what we are doing is we also want to increase our market share because, in some areas, apart from Hong Kong, where we\u2019ve really been a leading player, in other places, we\u2019ve been punching below our weight. And the idea is to be able to step up our product capabilities, our customer reach, the various metrics, which I shared in the slide without repeating. And the additional investment is not only to capture the underlying trend, but also to grow to our more natural share. This will be focused essentially on Asia and the Middle East. We recognize there are other pockets of wealth that will be important for us, but we\u2019re not going to be a wealth player in the U.S. because we don\u2019t have the right to win. Pam."

So just in terms of our focus on both NII and fee income, clearly, as we sit today, our NII, given our strong balance sheet, deposit base, loans and advances, is a much bigger proportion of earnings compared to fee income. But given the guidance we\u2019ve just shared with you, that we are looking at double-digit growth in Wealth over the medium term, even though it\u2019s on a smaller base, whereas on loans and advances, we are looking at a mid-single-digit growth in the medium-term. So that balance will tilt, but I won\u2019t go over my skates just as yet because the baseline starting point is so much bigger for balance sheet-driven business as opposed to fee income, but in direction of travel, absolutely. And also, the two things are a bit correlated. Hopefully, with your customers, when you do more, it\u2019s not just balance sheet-related products. You do more fee income-driven. And we think that really gets us more into the space of hearts and minds of our customers, which is what we are here for."

Thank you for elaborating on the capital distribution hierarchy, but I recognise that you are guiding to a mid-teens RoTE for the next three years, but only a 50% dividend payout for 2025. So what are the implications behind it? And we can see the bank\u2019s share price is above one-times price to book, so will that affect your future consideration between buybacks and maybe raise the dividend payout? And the second question is on the loan growth. HSBC has been consistently guiding to a mid- single-digit loan growth for the medium to long term, but it\u2019s still very challenging in the near term. So what circumstances do you think might be necessary for the bank to finally hit the target, and to what extent is that loan growth assumption baked into our Banking NII guidance? Thank you."

Look, with a mid-teens return guidance, there\u2019s plenty of space to do the 50% dividend payout ratio and to support the businesses to grow, which has always been the priority use of additional capital. But as you said, loan growth hasn\u2019t been there for the last many quarters, and the opportunity for us was to return the excess capital through share buybacks. It remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through share buybacks, because we see this also as a means to create an accretion in our dividend per share \u2013 earnings per share and dividends per share, by reducing the share count. Pam?"

        "text": "Thank you, Georges. Firstly, in terms of our views on the 50% earnings per share, we are very comfortable with that number, and as you can see, we look at obviously distribution but also opportunities for growth that we can deploy our surplus capital. I\u2019m very pleased that we are trading above tangible book value, and we absolutely don\u2019t consider the tangible book value to be a ceiling for our buybacks. Share buybacks will continue to be our preferred mode of distribution going forward. The other thing on dividends is that you obviously have to look at where your CET1 is at a point of time. You have to look at regulatory changes. For now 50%, we\u2019re very comfortable with. Now, in terms of your next question on loan growth, we need to unbundle it a little bit. Yes, loan growth is flat. It was down $3 billion in Hong Kong, up $3 billion for the rest of Asia, up $1 billion for the UK, down $1 billion for the rest of the world. We are optimistic that as the interest rate trajectory stabilizes there will be customer demand, and when there\u2019s customer demand we\u2019ll be there obviously to support our customers. But what\u2019s also really important is as we\u2019re seeing that from a Hong Kong perspective there is some momentum coming back, we expect at least the loan trajectory in Hong Kong to stabilise and not reduce. Once that happens, given the other breakdown I\u2019ve given you, that gives us more optimism in terms of loan growth."

        "text": "Good morning. If I can have two follow-ups, please, firstly on the capital return and secondly on the costs. On the buybacks, if you could just clarify, the $2 billion is obviously a step down from $3 billion. Should we think about that as a permanent step down, given that you now need to absorb these upfront restructuring charges, or does the $2 billion reflect a shorter timing period between Q4 and Q1 results compared to other quarters? That\u2019s the first question. The second question, I want to have another stab at the costs. Ben asked about this. I think the walk to 2025 is very clear, but if we then think about the walk to 2026, should we assume a similar level of inflation and investment? Is 4% a fair assumption for future years in your view as well? Then when we eyeball slide 29, which has that cost phasing, and it looks like there\u2019s a $600 million, $700 million step up in the cost saves in 2026, before the full run rate is recognized in 2027. So are we looking at a 4% increase in 2026 from that 2025 guide, less another incremental $700 million of cost saves, so a sub-$34 billion cost number? Anything you can give us in terms of how to frame, more explicitly, that 2026 and 2027 cost base would be really helpful. Thank you."

We haven\u2019t given additional specific guidance. So look, on capital, $2 billion because we have two months until April and that amount will be reviewed on a case-by-case, quarter-by-quarter basis. We do not pre-commit on any future amounts. It will depend on the outlook and the loan growth and other parameters as we get to it. But the current $2 billion is obviously because we have two months until the results in April. Pam?"

The big moving parts always when we look at our cost is what\u2019s the underlying inflation, staff costs and we also track very closely what\u2019s the increase in fixed pay from a staff cost perspective. So it was expected 3.6% in 2025. It was 4.4% in 2024, so you can see the trajectory shifting as obviously inflation is coming down. We also include in that 4%, and we have for 2025, additional investments, so you can do the math in terms of where we go to for 2026. But also let\u2019s be mindful, so far we\u2019re saying for 2025 we are only taking $300 million of the $1.5 billion down to the savings line, so there is an absolute tailwind for the rest of it coming through for 2026, so that\u2019s how the math works. And as we go into 2027, I would expect two things to happen. You\u2019ll see some normalization on the inflation and the underlying built number. We will have the BAU investment, so that continues the same building block, but what\u2019s important is even though the $1.5 billion has been taken down to the bottom line we expect through our simplification some of the additional efficiency costs beyond just FTE-related costs, i.e. the ways of working, so that will give us some tailwind, but obviously not to the same extent as you\u2019ve had in 2026."

I just wanted to see, are you thinking about that more in line with the underlying ex notable items level that you\u2019ve achieved this year and that you can maintain that given the cost savings and wealth management growth that you\u2019re targeting, or are you looking at it closer to the reported number that you achieved in 2024? Then secondly, I just wanted to dig in a bit more in terms of the potential revenue impact or lack of from the cost actions, including the re-prioritization, just to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the marginal or negligible revenue impact. Is that because you just expect the revenue growth elsewhere from the reallocation of cost, or how you\u2019re thinking about that? Thank you."

I\u2019ll take your first question and I\u2019ll ask Pam to address your second question about how we\u2019re looking to phase cost and the reallocation and the revenue impact of that. Look, it\u2019s quite simple for the first question. What we mean by mid-teens is around 14% to 16%, and our target is on return on tangible equity excluding notable items. This is how you should look at it. Pam?"

        "text": "Thank you, Georges and Amit. Just adding a little bit to the RoTE question, mid- teens is mid-teens, what it says on the tin: 14 to 16%. It\u2019s a target and obviously, if the world\u2019s in a better place, there is an upside, but you also have to look at the downside and that\u2019s how we look at all scenarios in our assumptions. Coming back to your second question on the $1.5 billion. Firstly I want to clarify, the first $1.5 billion, which is simplification savings, has no revenue impact because it\u2019s literally more senior roles, deduplication, simplifying the matrix. On that, there is no revenue impact and the whole savings is a tailwind which goes straight to the bottom line. On the second $1.5 billion, which is different, it is clearly a reallocation, which will happen from the individual business level, but we will take it all to the Group level. Now, when you take it all to the Group level, there is going to be some time lag between the cost coming up and re-investing, but we do think that the payback period is pretty quick because we know it\u2019s in existing areas we want to reinvest. So that time lag on the revenue should not be that long and that will get compensated. But as we have said before, we are taking this reallocation of cost, particularly from two areas: ones where we are sub-scale, and so materially it doesn\u2019t really make an impact in terms of your profit \u2013 they\u2019re small-scale divestments \u2013 but there are others where in terms of profitability they are not materially profitable, like we said on the investment bank. Therefore, as we take them through into new areas with higher returns and being very focused on those which are our competitive strengths, we do think that positivity will come back pretty quickly."

Have we factored that in the mid-teens RoTE guidance? Because when we are exiting some business, we need some regulatory approval and it\u2019s hard to gauge the timeline. What assumptions do we have regarding these parts in our mid-teens RoTE guidance? The underlying question is will we see some upside, because if we do it faster or slower like that. The second one, I still want to ask about CRE question. I think it\u2019s an old question, but I think we still have a lot of people, a lot of investors care about it. Both in Hong Kong and China in last quarter we heard some events which led to some concerns on these areas. If I look at our Q4 numbers, I know that some are edging up on the ECL charges. Is any parts of that related to CRE and what is our outlook on CRE in both regions? Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Katherine. I\u2019m going to ask Pam to address both your questions but let me share with you just briefly my outlook on the CRE situation. So firstly, in mainland China we believe that we\u2019ve hit a trough, really, in the challenges that the sector has faced. We believe the measures that have been taken to stabilise and start a normalisation process are working their way effectively through the economy. But more importantly, our exposure has materially reduced and therefore it is not going to be any more any major driver for our ECL. Second, about Hong Kong. We\u2019re actually positive about the outlook of Hong Kong. Hong Kong, first the economy and certainly rate trajectory is going to support that, we\u2019re seeing growth manifest in 2024, in growth outlook in 2025 and a number of sectors really have revived. But also in the CRE space, the underlying CRE market in Hong Kong is strong and resilient. The supply/demand equation is very supportive for the medium to long term and as we said, the rate outlook will also support that. But then if you look at our exposure to many of the borrowers in the space, the borrowers are much stronger and much less leveraged than what we\u2019ve seen in the China CRE space. They are in a better balance sheet position, albeit they may have cash flow challenges due to high rates, et cetera, but the loan to valuation we have on our exposure is also very strong. We are in the 50s percent. Therefore, we do not think the Hong Kong CRE exposure in our books will be any material driver of our future ECLs. Pam can address your questions on cost and take you more specifically in the CRE elements."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "Thank you for your question. So firstly, yes, we have factored the reallocation into our mid-teens RoTE guidance, and we\u2019ll work as quickly as we can to reallocate costs to higher- return areas. Obviously, if it is faster than our assumptions \u2013 we tend to be a bit conservative, which is a good space to be, then there will be some upside. But given regulatory approvals, et cetera, things can be slower. But all in all, we are still very comfortable to have a mid-teens RoTE for each of the next three years. I\u2019ll take the China CRE question first, and then I\u2019ll do Hong Kong CRE. Now China CRE, we\u2019ve always been very comfortable with our onshore exposure, which has been secured. The issue really has been with the offshore exposure, which was unsecured, but that number is way down from where we started. We are now down to $2.2 billion net of ECLs, and, out of that, there is very little of the exposures where we feel that there is more headwind. And as you can see, the chart for ECL last year was much lower than the prior years. So that, I think, gives me a sense of optimism with regard to the trajectory of the China CRE outlook. And of course, you can have one-off cases, and things move on, but, overall, it\u2019s based upon our exposure. Now, on Hong Kong CRE, just as a starting point, as long as the interest rate trajectory is high, of course you can see some customers facing headwinds, because it\u2019s a cash flow issue, fundamentally, and that makes you bring more names into the stage 3s. But what\u2019s very important to note is that, despite them coming into stage 3s, our ECLs haven\u2019t increased, and the answer is quite simple. Most of the names coming through the stage 3s last year have been from a secured portfolio, which is 54% of our total portfolio. And as Georges said, there\u2019s a very high level of collateralization. I mean, average LTV on sub-standard is 46% and, on the impaired, is at 58%, so there\u2019s enough room in that space and there is strong collateral. So even when they go to stage 3, there is not an ECL increase, and the ECL increase this year has been minimal and we see nothing changing there. On the unsecured, 90% of it is investment grade, so 46% of portfolio is unsecured; 90% is investment grade. And it\u2019s primarily with the conglomerates and strong developers and, because they have diversified cash flows, the inflow into stage 3 from this portion of the book is very small. So all in all, even though, with the increase in stage 3s, you see a minimal uplift in RWAs and the capital impact, but a very small capital impact, from an ECL perspective, there is really no material change in the ECL trajectory at this point of time, and we are very comfortable that it\u2019s all well within our mid-term guidance of 30 to 40 basis points."

So I guess I\u2019m just wondering what explains that decline. Is it the proportion of the stage 3s that are secured that\u2019s driving that reduction in coverage?

I guess we\u2019ve laboured the discussion around costs, but my takeaway is that it is broadly flattish beyond 2025, and maybe a bit of growth, but well lower than where the street is. I think Banking NII guidance also speaks for itself, so there are two related questions to that. One is around non-interest income. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts on non-interest income, but I think you\u2019re coming in with significant momentum on non-interest income, in excess of consensus, but we do have a lot of moving parts there. Is there anything you can do to help us? I know you don\u2019t like to talk too much about non-interest income, because there\u2019s volatile line items in it, but you\u2019ve got double-digit growth momentum in wealth management, trade that\u2019s probably growing low to mid-single digits. Who knows what markets do, but they\u2019re probably not going backwards. Then you\u2019ve got a retail piece as well. But it just does feel like that is something that is trending well in excess. So if you were able to comment in respect of 2025 consensus, that would be really helpful. The second is about Banking NII. So the $42 billion guidance this year is great. And I know there\u2019s a lot of focus on lending, but really it\u2019s deposits that matter, right? You alluded to the strength of your franchise. And loans are going to be subdued for a while, but deposits are already growing and, indeed, they\u2019re going to continue growing from here. Can you try and help us with that? Are you able to quantify the deposit growth and average interest-earning asset growth that we might look to expect? Because I think you can comfortably grow your balance sheet despite a subdued demand dynamic in your key markets. I think that really helps underpin the kind of Banking NII beyond 2025. My kind of slight follow-up question, then, I\u2019m going to sneak it in, but it\u2019s just around FX. And if you were to mark to market any of the cost guide, for example, for the spot FX rate, if that would affect any of your kind of guide or commentary today, that would be really helpful.

I\u2019ll take your first question by saying, \u2018Nice try\u2019. Unfortunately, I cannot give you more than what we shared. What we\u2019ve shared is a confidence that we\u2019re running the bank towards a mid-teens target on return on tangible equity excluding notable items for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We\u2019re also guiding to a medium-term outlook on Wealth at double-digit growth, which we\u2019re comfortable with, given this is an area where we\u2019re investing in and we see the underlying trends supportive, but this is more a medium-term guidance. It\u2019s difficult to evaluate what it means on a year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter basis. And we\u2019re also comfortable that our wholesale transaction banking \u2013 given our strong leadership position in many of these areas, we will be able to ride the wave, and we think the wave \u2013 the macro is in a low-single-digit percentage growth. It\u2019s subject to possible disruptions, but the underlying trend, if you look at global trade with all forms of corridors \u2013 not just some of the disrupted corridors \u2013 other corridors are likely to continue growing. I think this is how you should look at it. And remember the rate trajectory as well. It\u2019s still uncertain, but that will be a way if we see faster rate cuts than we\u2019ve implied. Let me just pause here on that part of the question and ask Pam to take you through Banking NII and FX."

        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "Thank you, Aman. So firstly, our cost guidance is on a constant currency basis, so clearly, from an FX perspective, there could be an impact. In terms of the $42 billion guidance, you\u2019re right. On loans, we say it\u2019s mid-single-digit growth in the medium term, and lower rates will help to get some momentum back, but it\u2019s also driven by overall market confidence, so I can\u2019t really call out the timing of the return to loan growth exactly. Now, deposits, clearly, was a key one in the fourth quarter, but we know that, in the fourth quarter, there\u2019s a bit of a seasonality effect, so I would very much caution you against annualizing that number. But I think, in terms of deposits, if I look at just the drivers for the $42 billion guidance, there\u2019s interest rates, which is a headwind at this point of time, given the market-implied rate curves, and then there is the structural hedge, which will be a tailwind. The loans, we have talked about. On deposits, we feel very lucky to have a strong deposit base, as you\u2019ve said, and the trust of our customers to give us those deposits is a cornerstone for our strong balance sheet. The deposit benefit for next year is driven by what\u2019s going to be the time deposit mix, because that held through in the fourth quarter. As the interest rates come down, we expect the time deposit mix to also come down. So in that context, you can factor that in as part of your overall calculation in terms of the headwinds and the tailwinds."

We haven\u2019t given a strict deadline, because some of these actions may take longer or may be subject to various approvals that are beyond our control, and we will be able to share with you as and when we move forward.

We\u2019ll obviously keep you updated over the next quarters. Now, in terms of the one-off costs, yes, there will be severance and other one-off costs, and we will be looking at those costs, to a large extent, given the materiality, where there is, from a notable \u2013 as notable items, so that\u2019s kind of the broad picture in terms of how we\u2019re progressing. So good broad line beyond where we are, but I can\u2019t give you any more precision at this point of time."

This provides us firm foundations upon which we are building. We\u2019ve simplified the Group and, along with our continued focus on costs, as Pam said, we are committed to delivering circa $1.5 billion of savings to the bottom line. We\u2019re also focused on delivering for our customers by capturing growth opportunities where we have a clear competitive advantage and accretive returns. And we are eliminating, over the medium term, an additional circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities, and redeploying them into these priority growth areas. We\u2019re also targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027. As usual, Neil and the team are available for any follow-ups. Meanwhile, Pam and I hope to see many of you here in Hong Kong next month for our second HSBC Global Investment Summit. Enjoy the rest of your day."

    "transcript": "Operator: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to the Analyst and Investor Webinar on the First Quarter Results for HSBC Holdings plc. For your information, this webinar is being recorded. I will now hand over to Georges Elhedery, Group CEO.\nGeorges Elhedery: Welcome all to today's call. I'm joined here in London by Pam. Before Pam takes you through the numbers, I would like to begin with some opening remarks. Overall, there was a strong quarter marked by three key drivers. Momentum in our earnings, discipline our execution and confidence in our ability to deliver our targets. First, we have strong momentum in our business. We had a strong first quarter with profit before tax up 11% and an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, both excluding notable items. We had our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in wealth and attracted net new invested assets of $22 billion as well as another 300,000 new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong, continuing the trend from last year. We also had a strong performance in Transaction Banking, in particular, in FX. And our equities and debt trading businesses, benefiting from higher client activity on the back of higher volatility. Second, we remain focused on executing our strategy with discipline and are on track to deliver the cost actions we set out in February. We are progressing at pace to deliver on the simplification-related cost saves as well as the strategic cost reallocations. We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our investments and capital allocation to drive growth across our four businesses. We will provide you with a full update on this at the half year results in July. Third, the external macroeconomic environment is less favorable and more uncertain than it was in February as the uncertainty around trade policy dampens business confidence and constrained investment. However, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our targets. Our balance sheet is strong. This is reflected in the deposit surpluses we hold in every major currency in each of our four businesses in every geography in which we operate. This is why our clients place their trust in us during times of predictability and even more so during times of unpredictability. These provide us with a steady recurring income stream and underpin the lion's share of our banking NII. Growing our structural hedge has reduced the sensitivity of these revenues to interest rate cuts. Our balance sheet is also underpinned by a strong capital position and a high-quality credit portfolio. We also have resilient recurring fee income from stable floor-based activities in transaction banking and in wealth, with a much smaller contribution from investment banking event-driven business. I encourage you to keep the diversity and quality of our earnings in mind when considering how changes in trade policy will affect our business. Our wholesale transaction banking business covers much broader activities than those related to cross-border trade. And with our trade finance business, we have diverse products and cover all major global and intra-regional corridors. To assess the impact, higher tariffs could have on our business, We modeled scenarios that contemplate significant but plausible increases in tariffs by the world's largest trading blocks, resulting in a notable slowdown in global trade as well as a slowdown in global GDP growth. In a plausible downside tariff scenario, we estimate that there would be a low single-digit percentage impact on the group's revenues. Separately, our consensus downside scenario models a slowdown in global trade and GDP growth as a result of an increase in tariffs. The impact of this scenario would be incremental ECLs of $0.5 billion. On this basis, we remain confident in delivering a mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027 and are reaffirming all of the guidance that we gave in February. We recognize though, that the broader impacts of the current conditions are more difficult to quantify, and we will continue to monitor these as we formulate our ongoing outlook. Importantly, in the current environment, customers look for the strength, stability and expertise of a trusted partner. We are extremely well positioned to support all of our customers wherever they are; however, they need to evolve and whatever the market conditions. Finally, we're also pleased to announce an up to $3 billion share buyback and a $0.10 per share interim dividend, reflecting our continued focus on capital return to our investors. With that, let me hand over to Pam.\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Georges. Thank you everyone, for joining. The momentum in our business has enabled us to deliver a strong first quarter performance headlined by an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We had very good underlying profit and revenue performances. Credit remained stable, and we maintained a disciplined approach to cost management. We are pleased to announce a first interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a share buyback of up to $3 billion. The buybacks we completed over the last 12 months have helped take us closer to our target range of 14% to 14.5% CET1. We will continue to return surplus capital to shareholders with buybacks remaining our preferred method. As always, a decision on any share buyback will be made on a quarterly basis. It will depend on organic capital generation and the capital needs of the business. Unpacking the revenue story, excluding notable items, revenue of $17.7 billion was up $1.1 billion on the first quarter of last year, driven by fee and other income. It also included a $0.3 billion increase in debt and equity markets driven by higher volatility and a favorable impact of $0.2 billion in the quarter from the disposal of Argentina, which we completed at the end of last year. On banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina, and other notable items, the banking NII run rate remained broadly stable for the -- on the fourth quarter. The impact of interest rate cuts and two fewer days in the quarter were offset by the repricing of liabilities and structural hedge assets and some favorable changes in asset mix. We continue to expect banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. As previously stated, this is not an underpin. It remains our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections. Moving to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was up 13% on last year's first quarter. This was driven by a strong FX performance as elevated volatility drove substantial volumes of client hedging activity. Excluding the impact of disposals, Global Payment Solutions was up 3% year-on-year, and Global Trade Solutions was up 6%. In Wealth, the strong momentum from the fourth quarter continued as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth. High client activity levels in Asia, primarily Hong Kong were the key driver, and there was broad-based growth. We are pleased that the investment we are making in our wealth products, distribution channels and customer journeys is translating into results. A record new business CSM 301,000 [ph] new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong and $22 billion of net new invested assets, $16 billion of which was in Asia. The CSM balance, which is a store of future value was up again this quarter. As you know, the CSM balance is subject to market fluctuations and sensitivities to key indices are in the earning release. On credit, our first quarter ECL charge of $0.9 billion equivalent to an annualized charge of 37 basis points as a percentage of loans and advances. This included a $150 million provision to reflect heightened economic uncertainty. Excluding this, the first quarter charge was broadly the same as in the first quarter of 2024. The credit risk metrics that we track remains stable, and we continue to monitor them closely. Thinking about the potential impact of tariffs on credit performance, ECLs will be sensitive to macroeconomic performance, the outlook for which remains uncertain. We consider a variety of scenarios as part of our ECL calculation. One of these is the consensus downside scenario in which an increase in tariffs results in a global economic slowdown. In this scenario, there would be an incremental ECL charge of around $0.5 billion. On costs, we are taking a disciplined approach to cost management and are on target to achieve our target of around 3% cost growth in 2025, compared to 2024 on a target basis. We are also on track to deliver $0.3 billion of simplification savings into the P&L in 2025. On loans and deposits, loan balances were broadly stable quarter-on-quarter, as growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking was offset by the reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio. Deposits were also broadly stable quarter-on-quarter with a partial reversal of some of the seasonal inflows we saw in Q4. Year-on-year, deposits were up 6% with growth in all entities and businesses. Our CET1 ratio was 14.7%. The reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio led to a $1.3 billion pretax loss in the quarter, recognized in fair value through other comprehensive income. This had a capital impact of around 0.2 percentage points of CET1. Looking ahead, we expect the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points in the second quarter. You will have seen that BoCom has announced that it is approved a share issuance of up to \u00a5120 billion. Upon completion, we expect to recognize an accounting impact dilution loss of between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on our stake. This will be treated as a material notable item and will have no material impact on CET1 and no impact on the dividend. Let me end by summarizing. First, we have momentum in our earnings. We had a strong first quarter performance with an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We have also continued to perform well in the quarter-to-date. Second, we have discipline in our execution. We are on track to deliver the cost actions we set out in February. Third, although the external environment is more uncertain we are confident in our ability to deliver, and we are reaffirming our existing targets and guidance. This includes a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Louis, can we go to Q&A, please?\nOperator: Thank you, Pam. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Benjamin Toms at RBC. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nBenjamin Toms: Good morning guys. And thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, you mentioned in the release that you've launched a strategic review of Malta, full-year results. We were relatively early in the strategic refresh process, are the other geographies that you're also strategically reviewing the full-year results, you talked about $1.5 billion of gross cost saves. Now you're deeper into that process. Have you seen any potential to be able to achieve cost saves in excess of that target? And then secondly, one of the feature to your Q1 results was the strength in fees and other income. Can you provide some color on how sustainable that print is and how much is driven by the augmented volatility? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Ben. So we've announced at the -- in February, $1.5 billion of cost saves from the organizational simplification, which we expect to take to the bottom line. And as Pam shared earlier, we are on track to deliver those, and we're moving at pace. We separately announced $1.5 billion from strategic reallocation of costs from activities that are non-strategic or low returning into our core strategy where areas of our competitive strength. We continue to progress at pace on those. And we've made a number of announcements, which we've shared, including the investment banking in Europe and the U.S., including the French insurance, the private bank in Germany, et cetera. And we're progressing with those at pace. And again, on both items, we continue the execution with discipline and pace and we're not faced -- we remain unfaced with the external environment for the execution of those. This is our primary focus now. It's just focusing on delivering those. Matter -- kind of cost efficiencies as a matter of BAU, if you identify cost efficiencies, we will, of course, be taking them as a matter of BAU, but our primary focus is to deliver on those commitments. With regards fees and other income, look, we've talked to the plausible downside scenario, which may put some -- that it's an adverse scenario, but it is a plausible scenario. And it will slow down parts of our business in trade flows, but also the implication it has on other aspects of our business, including the volumes in general. But outside, I would say, this adverse scenario, we continue to see strength in the wealth business, five quarters double-digit growth, which we expect to continue in the medium term, at least for the medium term, and we continue to invest in this space. And we continue investing in a number of areas as we called out in February, because we believe in the growth potential that we can exhibit in these areas. Thank you, Ben.\nPam Kaur: So Ben, just to add, I mean, for the quarter, there's been good performance, and there's been a high level of client activity, which has benefited FX debt equities markets and wealth. Also, I want to just remind that one benefit was also the Argentina headwind that we had of $0.2 billion in Q1 of '24, which obviously didn't repeat in this quarter because of the sale. But the key franchise factors are, wealth, it's a structural growth, and those dynamics will persist. They are driven by our brand, they're driven by the range of products we have to offer, the improvements we've made in terms of technology, and that investment is going to pay. And as Georges said, we stay confident in terms of double-digit growth in the medium term. On wholesale transaction banking, it remains an area of competitive advantage. We will continue to grow there, but it's going to be hard to predict quarter-to-quarter, especially in the current environment. Volatility has definitely benefited us in this quarter. So it may not repeat at the very high levels that we've seen in this quarter, but we are still continuing to see underlying growth as we have progressed through in Q2.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Pam. Our next question today comes from Joseph Dickerson at Jefferies. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nJoseph Dickerson: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Congrats on a strong set of numbers and some clarity on your thinking on the path forward. Can I just ask on the plausible downside scenarios for the low-single digit impact on revenue. I guess, what was the point of undertaking that exercise? Was it to basically show that the perception of the bank is a global trade bank in some ways, maybe exaggerated about how you're not -- basically, you're not overly reliant on any particular corridors. And I guess, what kind of elements went into that scenario in terms of magnitude of drawdown on trade. And then secondly, just on that, could you opine on any opportunities that you're seeing or that you foresee as a result of what's happening, not that -- what's happening is necessarily starting at the moment, but just any opportunities that you're going to see based on any initial discussions? And then I would presume that the -- you had a very strong new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong. I presume -- can you make any comment on April trends there? I would have presumed that that would have continued from last quarter if what we're picking up on the ground in Hong Kong is accurate? Thanks.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Joseph. I'll take your question about the positioning of our trade business and our bank as well as the opportunities. And I'll ask Pam to take you through the elements of this analysis. So we are the world's trade bank. We have been ranked the #1 trade bank for eight consecutive years. But our trade covers a variety of products as well as we cover all the large corridors of trade, including intra-regional corridors, which have been growing quite fast over the last few years. The exercise that we've conducted is meant to basically evaluate the impact of plausible downside scenarios on our overall activities, obviously, including trade. But just to add on trade, number one, we have more than 5,000 trade specialists in 50 -- more than 50 markets. We're in a unique position to be able to support our customers with our expertise and trade, as the business environment shifts, the business outlook shifts, their trading pattern shifts and they -- our customers need to reconfigure some of their supply chains. And we expect to be able to deepen our relationships with existing clients, but also thanks to our strength, stability, and expertise to attract more clients and to continue building market share in the trade business, among other of the kind of robust business proposition and service proposition we have for our customers. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Yes. Thanks, Joseph, for the question. So firstly, broadly in terms of contact setting, every quarter, we do a range of scenario analysis. This quarter, we looked at the significant, but plausible downside scenario resulting from increase in tariffs. We homed in on one scenario after looking at a range of possible outcomes, which we, as you know are uncertain and remain very wide. So the specific scenario, which we homed into was based on significant increase in tariffs as well as retaliatory tariffs. We also took a holistic approach. We considered different businesses, different geographies as well as customer segments. And this scenario resulted in significant decline in trade and significant slowdown in global GDP growth. The impact of this, we looked at both in terms of revenue through lower balances, but also on flow-based income. In addition, just like we took a reserve of $150 million in this quarter from a downside scenario. We further looked at the downside scenario on a 100% probability basis and came up with a number, which is the $0.5 billion provision best estimate in terms of the tariffs.\nGeorges Elhedery: Then with regard to your new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong, we were pleased to announce that we acquired 300,000 new-to-bank customers in Q1. This is after we acquired 800,000 new-to-bank customers in the full-year 2024, and we continue to see that trend ongoing. Thank you very much, Joseph.\nOperator: Thank you both. Our next question today comes from Kunpeng Ma at China Securities. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nKunpeng Ma: Hi, Georges. Hi, Pam. This is Kunpeng Ma from China Securities. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions. First is also some follow-ups on the closable downside trade scenario. If we compare the -- you have two scenario tests, one for trade, one for ECL but -- and we got your set of assumptions for the ECL tests from your annual report. So if we compare those two tests, are there assumptions for the trade test, better or worse, than the -- I mean, the downside scenario better or worse than those set of assumptions used in the ECL test? And also is the low-single digit revenue impact, just for some one year revenue or for every year's revenue thereafter. Yes. That's the first question. The second question is, could you please give us some color on the latest trend on Hong Kong CRE? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Kunpeng Ma. I'm going to ask Pam to address both your questions, Kunpeng.\nPam Kaur: Thanks, Kunpeng. So we're not going to get into the detail, but the underpinned pinning of the scenarios, whether it's ECLs or indeed on revenue has the same starting point. And we are comfortable based on the work we have done to reaffirm our guidance on RoTE. I just want to be clear that the scenario does not include the secondary impact of any change in policy rates in terms of the revenue-related scenario. Secondly, none of these two scenarios have what you call an extreme downside to scenario with like a double-digit contraction of GDP like we saw in the COVID period. So just to give you some guardrails. So in terms of Hong Kong CRE, this was a relatively quiet quarter. We did have one specific name, which in the performing book, there was a credit downgrade. Otherwise, there's really nothing more significant. We continue to look at our book in detail, and there may be a few names up or down on the credit curve with very modest impact on RWAs, but no significant impact on ECLs.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Kunpeng.\nOperator: Thank you both. Our next question today comes from Aman Rakkar at Barclays. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nAman Rakkar: Hey, Georges. Hey, Pam. Thanks very much for the various updates and sensitivities that you've given us. I had two questions just around customer behavior. So I just wondered if you had observed any material shift in the way that your customers are transacting with you, you've seen any forward indicators around sentiment, any signs of derisking or deleveraging? Any shift in particularly your kind of corporate customers that might be on the receiving end of trade tariffs? Any insights there would be really helpful. And then the second is definitely get the message around continuing to execute on the existing strategy? I guess just two kind of related points to that, one around capital returns. I mean it's obviously great that you've announced a $3 billion buyback. You're talking about a more subdued outlook for lending by extension RWA. So presumably, you might be quite capital generative this year. So it seems like you're committed to distributions despite the uncertainty, right? It's an uncertain backdrop, but the pace of distributions that you're kind of executing on it, it feels like you're committed to that. Is that the right read? Should we be confident around things like the buyback sustainability from here. And just the related part of that question then is just around you talk about divestiture on track, the $1.5 billion, but in terms of the redeploy, because I think you talked about some potential revenue opportunities from the redeploy or cost savings if it doesn't come through, are you minded to delay any of this redeploy basically given the volatile backdrop? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Very good. Thank you very much, Aman. I'm going to take your first question about customer behavior, and I'll ask them to address both our capital return strategy as well as the cost redeployment from the reallocations. So in terms of customer behavior, I think nothing that would really surprise you. Corporate customers essentially are in a wait-and-see mode. So some of the CapEx or large investments are on hold. Certainly, some of the shipments from China specifically to the U.S. have slowed down, but we've seen no PMIC. So there's been no significant drawdowns. There is -- deposit behavior has remained normal. So nothing really to call out beyond the wait and see. In terms of personal banking and wealth customers activity. Actually, this has been quite strong. And remember, we have a diversified product offering. So we've seen customers rebalance their investments between various offerings and be it various geographic equity exposure or other assets such as mutual funds or structured products. And when customers want to take a risk of approach, we see the money flow into our deposit base, so we kind of capture the customer assets either in invested assets or in deposits. But when we look at our NNIA for the first three months of the year, it remained positive, strong. So we remain positive on the outlook of the growth in this business. Remember also, we're investing in this business. So we're capturing the underlying growth in the market, but we're also capturing market share in the way we're embedding in this business. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Thanks, Aman. So just one point to add on the wealth customer behaviors. Our strength relies in our very broad product proposition. So as we see the mix shift between U.S. equities or Asian equities, or indeed into short-term fixed income products. We are there to support our customers as well as in terms of insurance on more protection and savings related products. So given that gives us confidence that this double-digit growth continues. And we've seen the same trend even through April and the same trend also no panic, no drawdowns and deposit behavior normal through April. So that's just to say that. So coming down to distribution. So just as a starting point, we have a policy on ordinary dividends. I'm assuming your question is much more on share buybacks. But let me see overall the process we follow. Every quarter, we look at where we are in terms of a CET1. And you know our CET1 operating range is between 14% to 14.5%. We also look at our capital generation, less the capital needs or capital deployment that we want to do. And what's very important is routinely, we look at a range of scenarios in terms of the macroeconomic environment. And then based on that, we look at the quantum on share buybacks. And clearly, if we have excess capital, share buybacks continues to be our preferred method to return capital. We have not changed our view on capital redeployment. But as I've said, we look at opportunities. We look at the generator capability quarter-on-quarter, and that's how we make the decision on the quantum of share buybacks.\nGeorges Elhedery: And on the redeployment of cost of the...\nPam Kaur: Yes, the deployment of cost, absolutely. So far, we have not made any change to the time line of what we said we would do. That redeployment is going to be through the midterm period, so between '25, '26 and '27. Clearly, in terms of the macroeconomic uncertainty, we are very mindful in this current environment that there may be some delays. But overall, it doesn't shift the trajectory or indeed the transactions that we have both announced and are working on, they are progressing as we expected.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Aman.\nOperator: Thank you both. Our next question today comes from Jason Napier at UBS. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nJason Napier: Good morning. Can you hear me okay?\nGeorges Elhedery: We can hear you, Jason.\nJason Napier: Perfect. Thank you. So two questions, please. The first, Georges, HSBC is a signatory to a letter suggesting to the U.K. regulators that ring fencing is something that should go, I think that's the right view. But we've got a lot of investor demand for sense from the U.S. to the motivation for that? What is it that you'd say in terms of OpEx, funding costs and what restructuring charges may go with that? So when you made that motivation, what was the next behind it? And then secondly, very strong performance in costs in Q1, but guidance held constant for the year ahead. I guess that implies potentially some slippage in efficiency ratios in the quarters to come, notwithstanding the cost saving actions that are underway. Could you talk a little bit about sort of the moving parts? Is it just quarter-to-quarter volatility? Is there anything we should be thinking about in the upcoming quarters as far as cost inflation that is concerned? Thanks very much.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Jason. Let me address your first question on ring-fencing, and Pam will take your second question on the cost. So our view on ring-fencing is that we've taken major -- I mean there's been major enhancement to the prudential regulations for banks in the U.K. in particular, the broader regimes of capital, of loss absorbency through MREL, liquidity, recovery and resolution, et cetera. All these measures have basically put the bank in a much better safer prudential space that have made ring-fencing effectively redundant. The second thing to say is that the U.K. is the only major economy that is applied ring-fencing. So it's quite unique to the U.K. So as an outcome, is increase the cost to operate as a bank. It created capital inefficiencies at trapped liquidity, it effectively exposed our customers, including businesses and SMEs to higher costs. It did somewhat also stifle competition. The bar to be able to compete in the U.K. for banks has become stiffer and more difficult. So therefore, we believe that removing ring fencing or at least scaling back on some of the ring-fencing considerations will improve the outcome for customers and ultimately, therefore will support growth in the U.K. Now just to reiterate, we are very supportive of the government's growth agenda and we will play our role in the U.K. for that. And as regard to the financial impact of the removal or the scaling down of ring fencing, look, we haven't done full analysis, but we believe this will be positive for both capital cost and ability to compete and support the growth of the U.K. economy and our customers. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Yes. Thanks, Jason. So firstly, we managed cost to a full year number. And quarter-on-quarter, you can see some volatility. But just to clarify, our full year 2025 guidance of plus 3% is on a base of $31.9 billion, which is the full year '24, restated to the average FX for Q1 '25. So just unbundling that, the 3%, the dependencies on the inflation, investment, spend and the benefit of $0.3 billion so the 1% from the P&L sales from the simplification as we guided on the Q4. And the actions that are going to realize that $300 million in the year have been already broadly taken to the P&L will come through in subsequent months.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you both. Our next question today comes from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nKian Abouhossein: Yes, hi, Georges, and Pam. Thanks for taking my questions. Great results, but clearly, the focus is on the new tariff world. And I want to try to understand, first of all, your target and guidance around interest rates, in particular, but also GDP assumptions. You mentioned mid-April, but clearly a lot happened in April. So I'm just trying to understand what date or what week we should use as a guidance in terms of interest rate assumption, if you could give maybe GDP assumptions? And secondly, coming to your sensitivities or your analysis around tariff impact, if you could discuss again, interest rate assumptions, in particular in GDP but also your assumptions about China as a trading counterparty in terms of your revenues versus the corridors we talk about because clearly, really in the new world, the corridor seem to be impacted as well. So are you assuming corridors can grow? Or do you assume corridors would also be negatively impacted in a new tariff world. And lastly, in that context, can you just talk about cost flexibility as you didn't discuss it?\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Kian. Kian, I'm going to make some broad comments on the view of corridors and overall our business. And I'll ask Pam to give you additional information on the tariff scenarios as well as in the cost implications, okay? So a couple of things to note. The first one is as we did say, the Lion's share of our banking NII is driven by our deposit franchise. This deposit franchise is a hallmark of our balance sheet. We run 50s loan-to-deposit ratio in three of our four businesses. And in the U.K., we're on 80s, which is the lowest, Therefore, we have deposit surpluses in every currency, every geography, every business line, and this franchise is very robust and is a driver of a very important lion's share of our banking NII, very important revenue stream. The second, when you look at our fee income, when -- so far has continued to grow at double-digit returns, and we do expect it to continue to grow at double-digit returns in the medium term, given the underlying market opportunities and market growth as well as our own investment to continue gaining market share. So transaction banking is the one we really are diving into. Remember, first, Transaction Bank is a wide set of products that cover various areas outside trade. And remember, a lot of our businesses, let's say with multinational customers operating in Asia or in China, a lot of their business is in China for China or in Asia for Asia, where they produce and manufacture locally and distribute locally with limited impact on tariffs, albeit some may be impacted by tariffs. But even within trade, we have seen growth of trade corridors intra-Asia or within Asia, Middle East at a very fast pace, and a number of these corridors have become structurally resilient and on a growth trajectory. Now some of the China plus one trade patterns that are still meant to ultimately distribute or export to the U.S. will be affected for insofar that there's intra-Asia trade flows for that ultimate purpose, but there is a much bigger intra-Asia, and Middle East trade flows that are two-way and that are related to domestic manufacturing for the purposes of domestic consumption, which we continue to see as structurally growing. Our scenarios have really looked at differentiation between the areas of structural growth and the areas that will be widely impacted by tariffs, which Pam can talk to.\nPam Kaur: So thank you, Kian. So firstly, just to reiterate, the $40 billion banking NII continues to be our best estimate for full year 2025. Now we've looked at a range of reasonable upside, downside assumptions, including rates, but we are not immune to all scenarios despite the stress work that we have done. Our Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion puts us in a good trajectory given that range of scenarios you've looked at all plausible upsides and downsides. Now as always, there are four key drivers. The rates that we have included are based on the mid-April curves. The structural hedge will be a tailwind to this headwind of rates. We have $75 billion maturities in the remainder of the year, and they are on 2.8% yield at the moment. So there will be an upside to that. The other two elements are harder to forecast, particularly in terms of balance sheet growth, as we've said before and the loans stay muted. Having said that, loans and advances were slightly up in the first quarter of this year, primarily because Hong Kong loans and advances were stable compared to Q4 last year where they had contracted. Now the deposit migration trend from Hong Kong has stayed stable over last year into this year at 39%, and that is continuing even through April. So if I look at it in the round in terms of deposit behaviors of our customers, both from a corporate side and as well as from a retail side, we stay quite comfortable. So on tariffs, just in terms of the broad piece, what we have looked at from a tariff perspective is, and it's all in terms of seeing the various scenarios in terms of delivering the mid-teens RoTE. I mean firstly, we looked at our income stream beyond banking which is wholesale transaction banking. And it has many more products beyond trade finance. It also is in diverse products within trade finance and their diverse global and intra-regional corridors. Now when we have looked to the downside scenario, we've looked at higher tariffs. We have looked at impact on GDP. And we have looked more broadly on policy rates, inflation, the big picture. But again, to say we have not looked at GDP to the stress level of a downside scenario that we have called out in our release, which is like a double-digit contraction of GDP as we saw in the COVID period. So if you look at all that, we come to a low single-digit percentage impact on revenues. And within that and within the incremental $500 million ECLs, we stay very confident for our mid-teens ROTE for the next three years. Now the broader impacts are going to be hard to quantify. These are your second, third order impacts, but we'll continue to monitor them through our various scenarios and review them quarter-on-quarter. On costs, our cost trajectory is on track. And given this, there's no shift on that. And we will still continue through our envelope to be able to invest in the areas which we have been, as Georges has said, because we can see the direct benefit coming very quickly in those areas even in the current environment and continuing through April, and that's primarily on the well side.\nGeorges Elhedery: Perfect. Kian, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you both. Our next question today comes from Amit Goel at Mediobanca. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nAmit Goel: Hi, thank you. Potentially follow-up, actually, to Kian's question. So thank you and so essentially, the plausible tariff downside scenario is pretty similar or closer to the ECL downside 1 rather than the downside 2 type case. Again, just coming back in terms of the broader profitability mid-teens kind of target. So essentially, you're saying that if we were to see that plausible downside scenario, you still believe you can achieve that mid-teens profitability level and that's before factoring in any further kind of cost actions? Or would that be with any kind of rejigging or additional cost action taken by the group to mitigate some of that impact? And then secondly, I just wanted to check, when I look at the downside 1 ECL scenario now versus a full year, it seems like the China and Hong Kong drawdown is not quite as severe. I see the U.S. is maybe a little bit 30 bps more severe, so I was also kind of curious why that downside scenario is not quite as negative perhaps as what you assessed at the full year stage? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Okay. Thank you, Amit. Amit, on your -- so I'm going to ask Pam to comment on your second question. But on your first question, look, we're not going to give more details than what we shared. But I think your analogy to say that it's a downside 1 like scenario in the sense that it is adverse, but plausible is correct. And within that scenario, without additional cost actions than the one that we have set out to do and are on track for doing and obviously committed to do. We are confident we can achieve our targets in particular, our targets of mid-teen returns for '25, '26 and '27. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Thanks. So just in terms of the scenarios just to confirm, they are not identical scenarios, but in terms of severity and plausibility, you're right in the ballpark because the ECL scenario stresses a lot of things on interest rates, inflation, et cetera, from a range of factors, and this one on tariffs is quite specific on the revenue line. And to clarify on ECLs, we had to build our reserve for this quarter, change the weightings of the downside 1 from 15% to 30%. And when we look at the $500 million potential impact, that is if you change that downside 1 scenario weighting to 100%. So just to say that's a $500 million additional to the $150 million. Now in terms of Hong Kong and China CRE, absolutely, in terms of both from an individual customer level as well on the forward economic guidance, given the starting point, there is a lesser impact, and overall there has been very little noise from a Hong Kong CRE and China CRE other than isolated names in this quarter. There can be credit downgrades over a period of time. We saw a few now, but the impact from an RWA perspective is very modest. If you look from a U.S. perspective, also there was a specific name. And when we look at the credit downgrades, so that's also in the quarter. I wouldn't really build any trend from this quarter into a full year. And all these factors, bottom line are part of the scenario analysis, which we do on upside and downsides before we reaffirm our OT guidance -- target.\nGeorges Elhedery: Okay. Thank you, Amit.\nOperator: Thank you both. Our next question today comes from Gurpreet Singh Sahi from Goldman Sachs. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nGurpreet Singh Sahi: Thank you for taking my question Georges and Pam. Good morning. So really on banking NII, a couple, if I may, please. First is Q-on-Q. Banking NII held up pretty much flat, whereas interest rates would have added a headwind of, as per my calculation $170 million. So can you please double quick and tell us on how much was the benefit from the deposit pass-through being not that high and then improved asset mix and then the hedge structural hedge? That's one. And second, in the $42 billion, again, on banking NII $42 billion -- around $42 billion guidance, how much are we assuming for average interest-earning assets growth? Because that has, if I see deposit growth has been consistent, but that somehow on a YoY basis is now showing up as 4% growth. But then Q-on-Q, there is no growth and previously on YoY also, we could not show any growth? And then what is the around? Is 41.5% outcome around 42%. Does that tick the box and help us meet the target? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: I am going to ask Pam to address both of your questions on banking NII.\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Gurpreet. So firstly, banking NII was flat on a quarter-on-quarter on a constant currency basis, excluding notable items in Argentina. Now we don't split out the dollar impact of every moving part, but let me just unbundle. So the headwinds were to fewer days in the quarter as well as lower interest rates. But the tailwinds was reinvestment of maturing hedge assets at high yields, a bit of change in the mix of our market treasury assets as well as the benefit of deposit pass-throughs, particularly in the U.K., which come through with a delay of 90 days so the interest rate cuts, which we saw in August came in through for a full quarter in this quarter. And then we saw a bit of a tail of the November cuts as well. So that's how is the impact there. In terms of your other question, of course, we look at various upside and downsides in that $42 billion. And I just want to reiterate, that $42 billion is not an underpin, it is just around $42 billion. Our current best estimate based upon what we see in terms of deposit betas, based upon what we see in terms of actual deposit flows coming through updated not just for the quarter, but also considering the trend we've seen through April.\nGeorges Elhedery: Good. Thank you very much, Gurpreet.\nOperator: Thank you both. Our next question today comes from Andrew Coombs at Citigroup. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. If I could have a couple on the organizational simplification, and then also just one clarification on well. On the organizational simplification, you previously guided to $1.8 billion of restructuring costs. And you said the majority of that is expected to be booked in 2025. I think you only took $141 million in Q1. So presumably, we should expect a big step-up in the restructuring charges from Q2 onwards to the rest of this year? And then the second question kind of attached to this is, you said that the actions taken to date will already translate into $300 million of annualized savings. I appreciate in Q1, you've had very little of that. But nonetheless, you're still guiding to $300 million for the full-year '25 when you've already achieved $300 million annualized and there's presumably more to come over the remainder of the year with the additional restructuring. So can you just clarify it now on why more of the savings are not flowing into full-year '25 compared to '26? And then on wealth clarification, given the new segmental split, is it possible to get the split of the Asian invested assets and $16 billion Asian net new invested assets this quarter that's attributable to Hong Kong? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Andrew, I'm going to ask Pam to address your, the first two questions with regard to the organization simplification. Just saying that we will give, as I said earlier, we will give a more thorough update at the interim results. And on your final question, let us take it forward and see what we can communicate. $16 billion of net new invested assets in Asia with the majority in Hong Kong, but we will take it forward to see what additional granularity we're likely to share. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Okay. Thanks, Andy. So firstly, in terms of the actions taken and the P&L being coming through for the year. The actions taken typically is when you have colleagues put through at risk and decisions made, communicated. There is always a time lag typically between that and colleagues leaving the platform. Typically, it tends to be about a quarter 90 days. So when you say an action has been taken, you know it saving is going to come through, but there is going to be a time lag between that decision and the savings feeding into the P&L. So when we said the majority of the actions have already been taken, the annualized savings that we calculated, it's for the full-year. So it's not as though these actions are already banked in and there's going to be further. So that's sort of the main piece. Now on restructuring costs, you're absolutely right that there is going to be the majority of the restructuring costs taken in 2025 rather than 2026. And I would expect most of that to come through Q2, Q3 and then some Q4 and then tapering down as we go into 2026.\nGeorges Elhedery: Very good. Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question today comes from Ed Firth at KBW. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nEdward Firth: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I just had a couple. The first one, I noticed that your cost guidance is based on an average exchange rate in Q1. But the U.S. dollar, I think, is what off about 6% since then. So I assume that if we were actually to do that at today's exchange rate, your cost number will be somewhat higher than that. And I'm just trying to check, is your revenue guidance also based on those exchange rates. So should -- is it effectively like both where we should both gear up both revenue and costs for the weaker dollar in terms of our expectations. That's the first point. And then I guess partly related to that, are we actually in the plausible downside scenario now? I mean if I'm looking at trade flows from China to the U.S. are down, what, 45% bookings, something like that. I mean that feels to me like a pretty downside scenario. So should we assume that as we go through Q2 and Q3, we are actually in that scenario now. Is that effectively where we are, assuming nothing changes. And I guess nobody has any idea what will happen in terms of the changes, but assuming we stay where we are today. And then I guess my second question was just about BoCom. I just can't really understand the accounting, because you're still running with a valuation that's what, $10 billion above the market value, but you didn't subscribe for new shares with the capital raise, which I sort of assume you would have done if you had thought it really was worth that much more. So should we be expecting you to actually track that now down to what would be like a market price rather than just the 1.6 million, should we be revisiting how you do the sort of -- I think you call it value and news don't use something like that? Thanks so much.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Ed. Let me take your plausible downside scenario. And I'll ask Pam to address your, the cost question as well as the BoCom accounting question. So look, the adverse plausible downside scenario is a scenario that is further adverse from where we are today with significantly higher global tariffs on major trading blocks on an aggregate basis. And we've looked at their impact across, obviously, our trade business, but more importantly, across overall our volumes and the economic outlook of our businesses on the whole. We do recognize that there is uncertainty, and it's very difficult to understand how much downside or upside there is in the future outlook for this. But we believe this plausible downside scenario is not the expected scenario as in, it is a lower probability downside than the expected scenario. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Yes. Thank you, Ed. So I agree the downside scenario is not something where we are now because the downside scenario clearly has a broader impact in terms of GDP and other areas, which then gives the significant impacts that we talked about, so just to make that clear. And you're absolutely right, the target cost base of $31.9 billion, equivalent to full-year '24 costs was rebased on first quarter's average exchange rates, all things being equal, U.S. depreciation would put an upward pressure on an absolute cost, but in the same way, it will put an upward pressure. I have some benefit on the revenues, and we will do that on the same principle quarter-on-quarter as we progress. And our FX rates have been volatile. We'll continue to update you quarter-on-quarter. So in terms of BoCom, just in sort of simple terms, at this point of time, we continue to say that BoCom is an associate. We have done the assessment as we do every year in terms of further impairment. And there has been no impact for this quarter. The dilution impact into P&L, we will have an accounting impact on the completion of the share issuance, and that's where that will be taken. But I just want to reiterate all said and done. There is an insignificant impact from this dilution on our CET1. And because it's a material notable item, there is no impact on dividend or distribution.\nGeorges Elhedery: Sorry, Ed you are on mute. Please go ahead.\nEdward Firth: Yes, sorry about that. No, I just, I don't understand the logic why you didn't subscribe for this -- for more capital in the sense that if it is worth that much more it would seem to me that it was an opportunity to put more capital in and to value the -- to get the upside in due course.\nGeorges Elhedery: So Ed, the -- there was -- the share issuance was subscribed by government or government-related entities in China. We were happy with our holding as it is. And therefore, we're happy with the outcome. And with regards to the actual accounting value, probably kind of point you to the Investor Relations team, which can take you through some of the specificities of this equity accounting principles, which are quite unique in the way we treat the associate accounting BoCom. But I just want to reemphasize, we're happy with our holding in BoCom. We're happy with our strategic relationship with BoCom and the fact that they give us exposure to the domestic economy in China, be it retail, SME outlook, which is not something our organic business is involved in. And very importantly, what Pam said, the valuation in our NAV is deducted from CET1, which means these impairments do not have or have a very minimal second order impact on our CET1 ratio and therefore, also do not impact our distribution capability.\nPam Kaur: And Ed, very happy to offline go through with you on the equity accounting treatment and the rest in detail, if you so wish.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Ed.\nEdward Firth: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you both. Our next question today comes from Katherine Lei at JPMorgan. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nKatherine Lei: Hey, thank you. I have two questions. The first one I still want to ask about the tariff scenario, because I think for analysts, at least our investors in this part of the world, I think it's partly -- it's widely expected that the Chinese government will have more stimulus policy, because of the tariffs. So in your downside scenario analysis, have you incorporated some of the positive impact from the stimulus policies, which could potentially be benefiting the Hong Kong China market? So I think this is number one. Number two, I still want to ask about the loan growth because now the guidance is that there will be muted loan demands in 2025. So what sort of tariff scenarios that we are -- like when we're giving this type of guidance, what sort of tariff environments are we incorporating? And also that is there any guidance on, say, for example, like deposit growth and also banking asset or interest-generating asset growth? Like how should we look at this thing? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you Katherine. Katherine, I'm going to make some comments on your first question, and I'll ask Pam then to take it forward as well as the loan growth question, which gives you an overlook. So firstly, we recognize indeed, there is a lot of potential for China to take policy measures and other measures to stimulate the economy, and we would be very encouraged by that. We're confident about the outlook for China. We're optimistic that these measures as they are taken and they will be taken will have a positive impact on the economy. We believe in the foundational strength of the Chinese economy, and we're very encouraged to see the pickup in retail sales, and therefore, the pickup in domestic consumption also. so on the whole, our main scenario is that we are confident in the medium- to long-term outlook in China. This being said, in a plausible adverse downside scenario, we have not taken into account some of these potential positive impacts, which may be or not likely to come. Pam?\nPam Kaur: Yes. Thanks, Katherine. So absolutely being a stress downside scenario plausible, but severe, we typically take the downside. We don't take the upside of the mitigating actions or any other policy measures. It's purely tariffs and retaliatory tariffs in a plausible range. So all said and done, I just want to reaffirm, it was all calculated as part of the target RoTE guidance that we are giving. On loan growth, the situation is in some ways similar to where we were at the end of Q4 because macroeconomic uncertainty delays decision-making. So we are not seeing any of those CapEx decisions being brought forward or delayed. They were delayed. They will continue to be delayed hopefully at some stage when some certainty remains, there will be loan growth. We are also monitoring very closely to see if there is any increase in drawdowns just like we observed in Q2 of 2020. At this point of time, there's no increase in drawdowns. So overall, from a loan growth perspective, I would say, still muted in terms of what we are seeing. The only thing I would say is that if there is sort of continued tariff uncertainty, you will see maybe a little bit pickup from a OpEx perspective on working capital because when you have to pay import duties upfront and there's some delays in some of the monies coming and so on. So that kind of will have an impact. But from a materiality perspective, the real driver for our banking NII guidance of $42 billion is really deposits for which we have a very strong franchise. We are in a privileged position to be a trusted partner for our customers, and we expect that to grow. Of course, there will be a bit of seasonal fluctuation quarter-on-quarter. But overall, that trend has continued.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Katherine.\nOperator: Thank you both. Our final question today comes from Yan Jiahui from CICC. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.\nYan Jiahui: Thanks for taking my questions. My question is also about tariffs. Could you please give an example of how our major clients react to tariff policy in April? Are they facing a sharp decline in business demand? Or are they actively seeking the solutions to reduce the effect of tariffs or just cut their business? And how HSBC help them navigate through the challenge from tariffs. And beyond risks, have we seen any new business opportunities for HSBC in this context? Thank you.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Ian, for your questions. So yes, indeed, customer, I mean, look, first, the customers aren't taking any decisions in panic, customers essentially are in a wait and see mode. Number of CapEx or large investments have been slowed down and certainly trade between China and the U.S., we've seen a major slowdown. But on the whole, customers are looking at their business models. They are looking at their supply chains. They're looking at ways to create more resilience in their business. And we're definitely here to help them. As I said earlier, we are our customers' trusted banking partner. They trust the strength of our financial strength, the strength of our balance sheet and our proposition. They trust the stability of our commitments to support them through their needs and through all predictable and unpredictable times. And very importantly, they trust our expertise. We have more than 5,000 trade experts in more than 50 jurisdictions, working with clients to help them think through what this means for their business model and now how they can help them adapt and adjust and create resilience. So therefore, in an environment like this one, we expect to deepen relationships with clients. We expect to acquire new clients and to consolidate our position as a leading trade bank and we expect to make, hopefully, a difference for our customers in navigating these uncertainties.\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Yan. I think we have addressed all the questions. So I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your questions. So looking in closing, we had a strong quarter marked by momentum in our earnings, discipline in our execution and confidence in our ability to deliver our targets. Neil and the team are available for any follow-up questions with our Investor Relations expert. Meanwhile, Pam and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Enjoy the rest of the day.

        "text": "Welcome all to today's call. I'm joined here in London by Pam. Before Pam takes you through the numbers, I would like to begin with some opening remarks. Overall, there was a strong quarter marked by three key drivers. Momentum in our earnings, discipline our execution and confidence in our ability to deliver our targets. First, we have strong momentum in our business. We had a strong first quarter with profit before tax up 11% and an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, both excluding notable items. We had our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in wealth and attracted net new invested assets of $22 billion as well as another 300,000 new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong, continuing the trend from last year. We also had a strong performance in Transaction Banking, in particular, in FX. And our equities and debt trading businesses, benefiting from higher client activity on the back of higher volatility. Second, we remain focused on executing our strategy with discipline and are on track to deliver the cost actions we set out in February. We are progressing at pace to deliver on the simplification-related cost saves as well as the strategic cost reallocations. We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our investments and capital allocation to drive growth across our four businesses. We will provide you with a full update on this at the half year results in July. Third, the external macroeconomic environment is less favorable and more uncertain than it was in February as the uncertainty around trade policy dampens business confidence and constrained investment. However, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our targets. Our balance sheet is strong. This is reflected in the deposit surpluses we hold in every major currency in each of our four businesses in every geography in which we operate. This is why our clients place their trust in us during times of predictability and even more so during times of unpredictability. These provide us with a steady recurring income stream and underpin the lion's share of our banking NII. Growing our structural hedge has reduced the sensitivity of these revenues to interest rate cuts. Our balance sheet is also underpinned by a strong capital position and a high-quality credit portfolio. We also have resilient recurring fee income from stable floor-based activities in transaction banking and in wealth, with a much smaller contribution from investment banking event-driven business. I encourage you to keep the diversity and quality of our earnings in mind when considering how changes in trade policy will affect our business. Our wholesale transaction banking business covers much broader activities than those related to cross-border trade. And with our trade finance business, we have diverse products and cover all major global and intra-regional corridors. To assess the impact, higher tariffs could have on our business, We modeled scenarios that contemplate significant but plausible increases in tariffs by the world's largest trading blocks, resulting in a notable slowdown in global trade as well as a slowdown in global GDP growth. In a plausible downside tariff scenario, we estimate that there would be a low single-digit percentage impact on the group's revenues. Separately, our consensus downside scenario models a slowdown in global trade and GDP growth as a result of an increase in tariffs. The impact of this scenario would be incremental ECLs of $0.5 billion. On this basis, we remain confident in delivering a mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027 and are reaffirming all of the guidance that we gave in February. We recognize though, that the broader impacts of the current conditions are more difficult to quantify, and we will continue to monitor these as we formulate our ongoing outlook. Importantly, in the current environment, customers look for the strength, stability and expertise of a trusted partner. We are extremely well positioned to support all of our customers wherever they are; however, they need to evolve and whatever the market conditions. Finally, we're also pleased to announce an up to $3 billion share buyback and a $0.10 per share interim dividend, reflecting our continued focus on capital return to our investors. With that, let me hand over to Pam."

        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "Thank you, Georges. Thank you everyone, for joining. The momentum in our business has enabled us to deliver a strong first quarter performance headlined by an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We had very good underlying profit and revenue performances. Credit remained stable, and we maintained a disciplined approach to cost management. We are pleased to announce a first interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a share buyback of up to $3 billion. The buybacks we completed over the last 12 months have helped take us closer to our target range of 14% to 14.5% CET1. We will continue to return surplus capital to shareholders with buybacks remaining our preferred method. As always, a decision on any share buyback will be made on a quarterly basis. It will depend on organic capital generation and the capital needs of the business. Unpacking the revenue story, excluding notable items, revenue of $17.7 billion was up $1.1 billion on the first quarter of last year, driven by fee and other income. It also included a $0.3 billion increase in debt and equity markets driven by higher volatility and a favorable impact of $0.2 billion in the quarter from the disposal of Argentina, which we completed at the end of last year. On banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina, and other notable items, the banking NII run rate remained broadly stable for the -- on the fourth quarter. The impact of interest rate cuts and two fewer days in the quarter were offset by the repricing of liabilities and structural hedge assets and some favorable changes in asset mix. We continue to expect banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. As previously stated, this is not an underpin. It remains our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections. Moving to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was up 13% on last year's first quarter. This was driven by a strong FX performance as elevated volatility drove substantial volumes of client hedging activity. Excluding the impact of disposals, Global Payment Solutions was up 3% year-on-year, and Global Trade Solutions was up 6%. In Wealth, the strong momentum from the fourth quarter continued as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth. High client activity levels in Asia, primarily Hong Kong were the key driver, and there was broad-based growth. We are pleased that the investment we are making in our wealth products, distribution channels and customer journeys is translating into results. A record new business CSM 301,000 [ph] new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong and $22 billion of net new invested assets, $16 billion of which was in Asia. The CSM balance, which is a store of future value was up again this quarter. As you know, the CSM balance is subject to market fluctuations and sensitivities to key indices are in the earning release. On credit, our first quarter ECL charge of $0.9 billion equivalent to an annualized charge of 37 basis points as a percentage of loans and advances. This included a $150 million provision to reflect heightened economic uncertainty. Excluding this, the first quarter charge was broadly the same as in the first quarter of 2024. The credit risk metrics that we track remains stable, and we continue to monitor them closely. Thinking about the potential impact of tariffs on credit performance, ECLs will be sensitive to macroeconomic performance, the outlook for which remains uncertain. We consider a variety of scenarios as part of our ECL calculation. One of these is the consensus downside scenario in which an increase in tariffs results in a global economic slowdown. In this scenario, there would be an incremental ECL charge of around $0.5 billion. On costs, we are taking a disciplined approach to cost management and are on target to achieve our target of around 3% cost growth in 2025, compared to 2024 on a target basis. We are also on track to deliver $0.3 billion of simplification savings into the P&L in 2025. On loans and deposits, loan balances were broadly stable quarter-on-quarter, as growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking was offset by the reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio. Deposits were also broadly stable quarter-on-quarter with a partial reversal of some of the seasonal inflows we saw in Q4. Year-on-year, deposits were up 6% with growth in all entities and businesses. Our CET1 ratio was 14.7%. The reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio led to a $1.3 billion pretax loss in the quarter, recognized in fair value through other comprehensive income. This had a capital impact of around 0.2 percentage points of CET1. Looking ahead, we expect the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points in the second quarter. You will have seen that BoCom has announced that it is approved a share issuance of up to \u00a5120 billion. Upon completion, we expect to recognize an accounting impact dilution loss of between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on our stake. This will be treated as a material notable item and will have no material impact on CET1 and no impact on the dividend. Let me end by summarizing. First, we have momentum in our earnings. We had a strong first quarter performance with an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We have also continued to perform well in the quarter-to-date. Second, we have discipline in our execution. We are on track to deliver the cost actions we set out in February. Third, although the external environment is more uncertain we are confident in our ability to deliver, and we are reaffirming our existing targets and guidance. This includes a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Louis, can we go to Q&A, please?"

We were relatively early in the strategic refresh process, are the other geographies that you're also strategically reviewing the full-year results, you talked about $1.5 billion of gross cost saves. Now you're deeper into that process. Have you seen any potential to be able to achieve cost saves in excess of that target? And then secondly, one of the feature to your Q1 results was the strength in fees and other income. Can you provide some color on how sustainable that print is and how much is driven by the augmented volatility? Thank you."

And as Pam shared earlier, we are on track to deliver those, and we're moving at pace. We separately announced $1.5 billion from strategic reallocation of costs from activities that are non-strategic or low returning into our core strategy where areas of our competitive strength. We continue to progress at pace on those. And we've made a number of announcements, which we've shared, including the investment banking in Europe and the U.S., including the French insurance, the private bank in Germany, et cetera. And we're progressing with those at pace. And again, on both items, we continue the execution with discipline and pace and we're not faced -- we remain unfaced with the external environment for the execution of those. This is our primary focus now. It's just focusing on delivering those. Matter -- kind of cost efficiencies as a matter of BAU, if you identify cost efficiencies, we will, of course, be taking them as a matter of BAU, but our primary focus is to deliver on those commitments. With regards fees and other income, look, we've talked to the plausible downside scenario, which may put some -- that it's an adverse scenario, but it is a plausible scenario. And it will slow down parts of our business in trade flows, but also the implication it has on other aspects of our business, including the volumes in general. But outside, I would say, this adverse scenario, we continue to see strength in the wealth business, five quarters double-digit growth, which we expect to continue in the medium term, at least for the medium term, and we continue to invest in this space. And we continue investing in a number of areas as we called out in February, because we believe in the growth potential that we can exhibit in these areas. Thank you, Ben."

Also, I want to just remind that one benefit was also the Argentina headwind that we had of $0.2 billion in Q1 of '24, which obviously didn't repeat in this quarter because of the sale. But the key franchise factors are, wealth, it's a structural growth, and those dynamics will persist. They are driven by our brand, they're driven by the range of products we have to offer, the improvements we've made in terms of technology, and that investment is going to pay. And as Georges said, we stay confident in terms of double-digit growth in the medium term. On wholesale transaction banking, it remains an area of competitive advantage. We will continue to grow there, but it's going to be hard to predict quarter-to-quarter, especially in the current environment. Volatility has definitely benefited us in this quarter. So it may not repeat at the very high levels that we've seen in this quarter, but we are still continuing to see underlying growth as we have progressed through in Q2."

Can I just ask on the plausible downside scenarios for the low-single digit impact on revenue. I guess, what was the point of undertaking that exercise? Was it to basically show that the perception of the bank is a global trade bank in some ways, maybe exaggerated about how you're not -- basically, you're not overly reliant on any particular corridors. And I guess, what kind of elements went into that scenario in terms of magnitude of drawdown on trade. And then secondly, just on that, could you opine on any opportunities that you're seeing or that you foresee as a result of what's happening, not that -- what's happening is necessarily starting at the moment, but just any opportunities that you're going to see based on any initial discussions? And then I would presume that the -- you had a very strong new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong. I presume -- can you make any comment on April trends there?

But our trade covers a variety of products as well as we cover all the large corridors of trade, including intra-regional corridors, which have been growing quite fast over the last few years. The exercise that we've conducted is meant to basically evaluate the impact of plausible downside scenarios on our overall activities, obviously, including trade. But just to add on trade, number one, we have more than 5,000 trade specialists in 50 -- more than 50 markets. We're in a unique position to be able to support our customers with our expertise and trade, as the business environment shifts, the business outlook shifts, their trading pattern shifts and they -- our customers need to reconfigure some of their supply chains.

This quarter, we looked at the significant, but plausible downside scenario resulting from increase in tariffs. We homed in on one scenario after looking at a range of possible outcomes, which we, as you know are uncertain and remain very wide. So the specific scenario, which we homed into was based on significant increase in tariffs as well as retaliatory tariffs. We also took a holistic approach. We considered different businesses, different geographies as well as customer segments. And this scenario resulted in significant decline in trade and significant slowdown in global GDP growth. The impact of this, we looked at both in terms of revenue through lower balances, but also on flow-based income. In addition, just like we took a reserve of $150 million in this quarter from a downside scenario. We further looked at the downside scenario on a 100% probability basis and came up with a number, which is the $0.5 billion provision best estimate in terms of the tariffs."

First is also some follow-ups on the closable downside trade scenario. If we compare the -- you have two scenario tests, one for trade, one for ECL but -- and we got your set of assumptions for the ECL tests from your annual report. So if we compare those two tests, are there assumptions for the trade test, better or worse, than the -- I mean, the downside scenario better or worse than those set of assumptions used in the ECL test? And also is the low-single digit revenue impact, just for some one year revenue or for every year's revenue thereafter. Yes. That's the first question.

And we are comfortable based on the work we have done to reaffirm our guidance on RoTE. I just want to be clear that the scenario does not include the secondary impact of any change in policy rates in terms of the revenue-related scenario. Secondly, none of these two scenarios have what you call an extreme downside to scenario with like a double-digit contraction of GDP like we saw in the COVID period. So just to give you some guardrails. So in terms of Hong Kong CRE, this was a relatively quiet quarter. We did have one specific name, which in the performing book, there was a credit downgrade. Otherwise, there's really nothing more significant. We continue to look at our book in detail, and there may be a few names up or down on the credit curve with very modest impact on RWAs, but no significant impact on ECLs."

        "speaker": "Aman Rakkar",
        "text": "Hey, Georges. Hey, Pam. Thanks very much for the various updates and sensitivities that you've given us. I had two questions just around customer behavior. So I just wondered if you had observed any material shift in the way that your customers are transacting with you, you've seen any forward indicators around sentiment, any signs of derisking or deleveraging? Any shift in particularly your kind of corporate customers that might be on the receiving end of trade tariffs? Any insights there would be really helpful. And then the second is definitely get the message around continuing to execute on the existing strategy? I guess just two kind of related points to that, one around capital returns. I mean it's obviously great that you've announced a $3 billion buyback. You're talking about a more subdued outlook for lending by extension RWA. So presumably, you might be quite capital generative this year. So it seems like you're committed to distributions despite the uncertainty, right? It's an uncertain backdrop, but the pace of distributions that you're kind of executing on it, it feels like you're committed to that. Is that the right read? Should we be confident around things like the buyback sustainability from here. And just the related part of that question then is just around you talk about divestiture on track, the $1.5 billion, but in terms of the redeploy, because I think you talked about some potential revenue opportunities from the redeploy or cost savings if it doesn't come through, are you minded to delay any of this redeploy basically given the volatile backdrop? Thank you."

        "text": "Very good. Thank you very much, Aman. I'm going to take your first question about customer behavior, and I'll ask them to address both our capital return strategy as well as the cost redeployment from the reallocations. So in terms of customer behavior, I think nothing that would really surprise you. Corporate customers essentially are in a wait-and-see mode. So some of the CapEx or large investments are on hold. Certainly, some of the shipments from China specifically to the U.S. have slowed down, but we've seen no PMIC. So there's been no significant drawdowns. There is -- deposit behavior has remained normal. So nothing really to call out beyond the wait and see. In terms of personal banking and wealth customers activity. Actually, this has been quite strong. And remember, we have a diversified product offering. So we've seen customers rebalance their investments between various offerings and be it various geographic equity exposure or other assets such as mutual funds or structured products. And when customers want to take a risk of approach, we see the money flow into our deposit base, so we kind of capture the customer assets either in invested assets or in deposits. But when we look at our NNIA for the first three months of the year, it remained positive, strong. So we remain positive on the outlook of the growth in this business. Remember also, we're investing in this business. So we're capturing the underlying growth in the market, but we're also capturing market share in the way we're embedding in this business. Pam?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "Thanks, Aman. So just one point to add on the wealth customer behaviors. Our strength relies in our very broad product proposition. So as we see the mix shift between U.S. equities or Asian equities, or indeed into short-term fixed income products. We are there to support our customers as well as in terms of insurance on more protection and savings related products. So given that gives us confidence that this double-digit growth continues. And we've seen the same trend even through April and the same trend also no panic, no drawdowns and deposit behavior normal through April. So that's just to say that. So coming down to distribution. So just as a starting point, we have a policy on ordinary dividends. I'm assuming your question is much more on share buybacks. But let me see overall the process we follow. Every quarter, we look at where we are in terms of a CET1. And you know our CET1 operating range is between 14% to 14.5%. We also look at our capital generation, less the capital needs or capital deployment that we want to do. And what's very important is routinely, we look at a range of scenarios in terms of the macroeconomic environment. And then based on that, we look at the quantum on share buybacks. And clearly, if we have excess capital, share buybacks continues to be our preferred method to return capital. We have not changed our view on capital redeployment. But as I've said, we look at opportunities. We look at the generator capability quarter-on-quarter, and that's how we make the decision on the quantum of share buybacks."

The first, Georges, HSBC is a signatory to a letter suggesting to the U.K. regulators that ring fencing is something that should go, I think that's the right view. But we've got a lot of investor demand for sense from the U.S. to the motivation for that? What is it that you'd say in terms of OpEx, funding costs and what restructuring charges may go with that? So when you made that motivation, what was the next behind it? And then secondly, very strong performance in costs in Q1, but guidance held constant for the year ahead. I guess that implies potentially some slippage in efficiency ratios in the quarters to come, notwithstanding the cost saving actions that are underway. Could you talk a little bit about sort of the moving parts? Is it just quarter-to-quarter volatility? Is there anything we should be thinking about in the upcoming quarters as far as cost inflation that is concerned? Thanks very much."

      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Jason. Let me address your first question on ring-fencing, and Pam will take your second question on the cost. So our view on ring-fencing is that we've taken major -- I mean there's been major enhancement to the prudential regulations for banks in the U.K. in particular, the broader regimes of capital, of loss absorbency through MREL, liquidity, recovery and resolution, et cetera. All these measures have basically put the bank in a much better safer prudential space that have made ring-fencing effectively redundant. The second thing to say is that the U.K. is the only major economy that is applied ring-fencing. So it's quite unique to the U.K. So as an outcome, is increase the cost to operate as a bank. It created capital inefficiencies at trapped liquidity, it effectively exposed our customers, including businesses and SMEs to higher costs. It did somewhat also stifle competition. The bar to be able to compete in the U.K. for banks has become stiffer and more difficult. So therefore, we believe that removing ring fencing or at least scaling back on some of the ring-fencing considerations will improve the outcome for customers and ultimately, therefore will support growth in the U.K. Now just to reiterate, we are very supportive of the government's growth agenda and we will play our role in the U.K. for that. And as regard to the financial impact of the removal or the scaling down of ring fencing, look, we haven't done full analysis, but we believe this will be positive for both capital cost and ability to compete and support the growth of the U.K. economy and our customers. Pam?"

But just to clarify, our full year 2025 guidance of plus 3% is on a base of $31.9 billion, which is the full year '24, restated to the average FX for Q1 '25. So just unbundling that, the 3%, the dependencies on the inflation, investment, spend and the benefit of $0.3 billion so the 1% from the P&L sales from the simplification as we guided on the Q4. And the actions that are going to realize that $300 million in the year have been already broadly taken to the P&L will come through in subsequent months."

And I want to try to understand, first of all, your target and guidance around interest rates, in particular, but also GDP assumptions. You mentioned mid-April, but clearly a lot happened in April. So I'm just trying to understand what date or what week we should use as a guidance in terms of interest rate assumption, if you could give maybe GDP assumptions? And secondly, coming to your sensitivities or your analysis around tariff impact, if you could discuss again, interest rate assumptions, in particular in GDP but also your assumptions about China as a trading counterparty in terms of your revenues versus the corridors we talk about because clearly, really in the new world, the corridor seem to be impacted as well. So are you assuming corridors can grow? Or do you assume corridors would also be negatively impacted in a new tariff world. And lastly, in that context, can you just talk about cost flexibility as you didn't discuss it?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Georges Elhedery",
        "text": "Thank you, Kian. Kian, I'm going to make some broad comments on the view of corridors and overall our business. And I'll ask Pam to give you additional information on the tariff scenarios as well as in the cost implications, okay? So a couple of things to note. The first one is as we did say, the Lion's share of our banking NII is driven by our deposit franchise. This deposit franchise is a hallmark of our balance sheet. We run 50s loan-to-deposit ratio in three of our four businesses. And in the U.K., we're on 80s, which is the lowest, Therefore, we have deposit surpluses in every currency, every geography, every business line, and this franchise is very robust and is a driver of a very important lion's share of our banking NII, very important revenue stream. The second, when you look at our fee income, when -- so far has continued to grow at double-digit returns, and we do expect it to continue to grow at double-digit returns in the medium term, given the underlying market opportunities and market growth as well as our own investment to continue gaining market share. So transaction banking is the one we really are diving into. Remember, first, Transaction Bank is a wide set of products that cover various areas outside trade. And remember, a lot of our businesses, let's say with multinational customers operating in Asia or in China, a lot of their business is in China for China or in Asia for Asia, where they produce and manufacture locally and distribute locally with limited impact on tariffs, albeit some may be impacted by tariffs. But even within trade, we have seen growth of trade corridors intra-Asia or within Asia, Middle East at a very fast pace, and a number of these corridors have become structurally resilient and on a growth trajectory. Now some of the China plus one trade patterns that are still meant to ultimately distribute or export to the U.S. will be affected for insofar that there's intra-Asia trade flows for that ultimate purpose, but there is a much bigger intra-Asia, and Middle East trade flows that are two-way and that are related to domestic manufacturing for the purposes of domestic consumption, which we continue to see as structurally growing. Our scenarios have really looked at differentiation between the areas of structural growth and the areas that will be widely impacted by tariffs, which Pam can talk to."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "So thank you, Kian. So firstly, just to reiterate, the $40 billion banking NII continues to be our best estimate for full year 2025. Now we've looked at a range of reasonable upside, downside assumptions, including rates, but we are not immune to all scenarios despite the stress work that we have done. Our Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion puts us in a good trajectory given that range of scenarios you've looked at all plausible upsides and downsides. Now as always, there are four key drivers. The rates that we have included are based on the mid-April curves. The structural hedge will be a tailwind to this headwind of rates. We have $75 billion maturities in the remainder of the year, and they are on 2.8% yield at the moment. So there will be an upside to that. The other two elements are harder to forecast, particularly in terms of balance sheet growth, as we've said before and the loans stay muted. Having said that, loans and advances were slightly up in the first quarter of this year, primarily because Hong Kong loans and advances were stable compared to Q4 last year where they had contracted. Now the deposit migration trend from Hong Kong has stayed stable over last year into this year at 39%, and that is continuing even through April. So if I look at it in the round in terms of deposit behaviors of our customers, both from a corporate side and as well as from a retail side, we stay quite comfortable. So on tariffs, just in terms of the broad piece, what we have looked at from a tariff perspective is, and it's all in terms of seeing the various scenarios in terms of delivering the mid-teens RoTE. I mean firstly, we looked at our income stream beyond banking which is wholesale transaction banking. And it has many more products beyond trade finance. It also is in diverse products within trade finance and their diverse global and intra-regional corridors. Now when we have looked to the downside scenario, we've looked at higher tariffs. We have looked at impact on GDP. And we have looked more broadly on policy rates, inflation, the big picture. But again, to say we have not looked at GDP to the stress level of a downside scenario that we have called out in our release, which is like a double-digit contraction of GDP as we saw in the COVID period. So if you look at all that, we come to a low single-digit percentage impact on revenues. And within that and within the incremental $500 million ECLs, we stay very confident for our mid-teens ROTE for the next three years. Now the broader impacts are going to be hard to quantify. These are your second, third order impacts, but we'll continue to monitor them through our various scenarios and review them quarter-on-quarter. On costs, our cost trajectory is on track. And given this, there's no shift on that. And we will still continue through our envelope to be able to invest in the areas which we have been, as Georges has said, because we can see the direct benefit coming very quickly in those areas even in the current environment and continuing through April, and that's primarily on the well side."

Again, just coming back in terms of the broader profitability mid-teens kind of target. So essentially, you're saying that if we were to see that plausible downside scenario, you still believe you can achieve that mid-teens profitability level and that's before factoring in any further kind of cost actions? Or would that be with any kind of rejigging or additional cost action taken by the group to mitigate some of that impact? And then secondly, I just wanted to check, when I look at the downside 1 ECL scenario now versus a full year, it seems like the China and Hong Kong drawdown is not quite as severe. I see the U.S. is maybe a little bit 30 bps more severe, so I was also kind of curious why that downside scenario is not quite as negative perhaps as what you assessed at the full year stage?

But I think your analogy to say that it's a downside 1 like scenario in the sense that it is adverse, but plausible is correct. And within that scenario, without additional cost actions than the one that we have set out to do and are on track for doing and obviously committed to do. We are confident we can achieve our targets in particular, our targets of mid-teen returns for '25, '26 and '27. Pam?"

        "text": "Thanks. So just in terms of the scenarios just to confirm, they are not identical scenarios, but in terms of severity and plausibility, you're right in the ballpark because the ECL scenario stresses a lot of things on interest rates, inflation, et cetera, from a range of factors, and this one on tariffs is quite specific on the revenue line. And to clarify on ECLs, we had to build our reserve for this quarter, change the weightings of the downside 1 from 15% to 30%. And when we look at the $500 million potential impact, that is if you change that downside 1 scenario weighting to 100%. So just to say that's a $500 million additional to the $150 million. Now in terms of Hong Kong and China CRE, absolutely, in terms of both from an individual customer level as well on the forward economic guidance, given the starting point, there is a lesser impact, and overall there has been very little noise from a Hong Kong CRE and China CRE other than isolated names in this quarter. There can be credit downgrades over a period of time. We saw a few now, but the impact from an RWA perspective is very modest. If you look from a U.S. perspective, also there was a specific name. And when we look at the credit downgrades, so that's also in the quarter. I wouldn't really build any trend from this quarter into a full year. And all these factors, bottom line are part of the scenario analysis, which we do on upside and downsides before we reaffirm our OT guidance -- target."

        "text": "Thank you for taking my question Georges and Pam. Good morning. So really on banking NII, a couple, if I may, please. First is Q-on-Q. Banking NII held up pretty much flat, whereas interest rates would have added a headwind of, as per my calculation $170 million. So can you please double quick and tell us on how much was the benefit from the deposit pass-through being not that high and then improved asset mix and then the hedge structural hedge? That's one. And second, in the $42 billion, again, on banking NII $42 billion -- around $42 billion guidance, how much are we assuming for average interest-earning assets growth? Because that has, if I see deposit growth has been consistent, but that somehow on a YoY basis is now showing up as 4% growth. But then Q-on-Q, there is no growth and previously on YoY also, we could not show any growth? And then what is the around? Is 41.5% outcome around 42%. Does that tick the box and help us meet the target? Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Gurpreet. So firstly, banking NII was flat on a quarter-on-quarter on a constant currency basis, excluding notable items in Argentina. Now we don't split out the dollar impact of every moving part, but let me just unbundle. So the headwinds were to fewer days in the quarter as well as lower interest rates. But the tailwinds was reinvestment of maturing hedge assets at high yields, a bit of change in the mix of our market treasury assets as well as the benefit of deposit pass-throughs, particularly in the U.K., which come through with a delay of 90 days so the interest rate cuts, which we saw in August came in through for a full quarter in this quarter. And then we saw a bit of a tail of the November cuts as well. So that's how is the impact there. In terms of your other question, of course, we look at various upside and downsides in that $42 billion. And I just want to reiterate, that $42 billion is not an underpin, it is just around $42 billion. Our current best estimate based upon what we see in terms of deposit betas, based upon what we see in terms of actual deposit flows coming through updated not just for the quarter, but also considering the trend we've seen through April."

        "speaker": "Andrew Coombs",
        "text": "Good morning. If I could have a couple on the organizational simplification, and then also just one clarification on well. On the organizational simplification, you previously guided to $1.8 billion of restructuring costs. And you said the majority of that is expected to be booked in 2025. I think you only took $141 million in Q1. So presumably, we should expect a big step-up in the restructuring charges from Q2 onwards to the rest of this year? And then the second question kind of attached to this is, you said that the actions taken to date will already translate into $300 million of annualized savings. I appreciate in Q1, you've had very little of that. But nonetheless, you're still guiding to $300 million for the full-year '25 when you've already achieved $300 million annualized and there's presumably more to come over the remainder of the year with the additional restructuring. So can you just clarify it now on why more of the savings are not flowing into full-year '25 compared to '26? And then on wealth clarification, given the new segmental split, is it possible to get the split of the Asian invested assets and $16 billion Asian net new invested assets this quarter that's attributable to Hong Kong? Thank you."

Just saying that we will give, as I said earlier, we will give a more thorough update at the interim results. And on your final question, let us take it forward and see what we can communicate. $16 billion of net new invested assets in Asia with the majority in Hong Kong, but we will take it forward to see what additional granularity we're likely to share. Pam?"

      {
        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "Okay. Thanks, Andy. So firstly, in terms of the actions taken and the P&L being coming through for the year. The actions taken typically is when you have colleagues put through at risk and decisions made, communicated. There is always a time lag typically between that and colleagues leaving the platform. Typically, it tends to be about a quarter 90 days. So when you say an action has been taken, you know it saving is going to come through, but there is going to be a time lag between that decision and the savings feeding into the P&L. So when we said the majority of the actions have already been taken, the annualized savings that we calculated, it's for the full-year. So it's not as though these actions are already banked in and there's going to be further. So that's sort of the main piece. Now on restructuring costs, you're absolutely right that there is going to be the majority of the restructuring costs taken in 2025 rather than 2026. And I would expect most of that to come through Q2, Q3 and then some Q4 and then tapering down as we go into 2026."

        "speaker": "Edward Firth",
        "text": "Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I just had a couple. The first one, I noticed that your cost guidance is based on an average exchange rate in Q1. But the U.S. dollar, I think, is what off about 6% since then. So I assume that if we were actually to do that at today's exchange rate, your cost number will be somewhat higher than that. And I'm just trying to check, is your revenue guidance also based on those exchange rates. So should -- is it effectively like both where we should both gear up both revenue and costs for the weaker dollar in terms of our expectations. That's the first point. And then I guess partly related to that, are we actually in the plausible downside scenario now? I mean if I'm looking at trade flows from China to the U.S. are down, what, 45% bookings, something like that. I mean that feels to me like a pretty downside scenario. So should we assume that as we go through Q2 and Q3, we are actually in that scenario now. Is that effectively where we are, assuming nothing changes. And I guess nobody has any idea what will happen in terms of the changes, but assuming we stay where we are today. And then I guess my second question was just about BoCom. I just can't really understand the accounting, because you're still running with a valuation that's what, $10 billion above the market value, but you didn't subscribe for new shares with the capital raise, which I sort of assume you would have done if you had thought it really was worth that much more. So should we be expecting you to actually track that now down to what would be like a market price rather than just the 1.6 million, should we be revisiting how you do the sort of -- I think you call it value and news don't use something like that? Thanks so much."

        "text": "Thank you very much, Ed. Let me take your plausible downside scenario. And I'll ask Pam to address your, the cost question as well as the BoCom accounting question. So look, the adverse plausible downside scenario is a scenario that is further adverse from where we are today with significantly higher global tariffs on major trading blocks on an aggregate basis. And we've looked at their impact across, obviously, our trade business, but more importantly, across overall our volumes and the economic outlook of our businesses on the whole. We do recognize that there is uncertainty, and it's very difficult to understand how much downside or upside there is in the future outlook for this. But we believe this plausible downside scenario is not the expected scenario as in, it is a lower probability downside than the expected scenario. Pam?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "Yes. Thank you, Ed. So I agree the downside scenario is not something where we are now because the downside scenario clearly has a broader impact in terms of GDP and other areas, which then gives the significant impacts that we talked about, so just to make that clear. And you're absolutely right, the target cost base of $31.9 billion, equivalent to full-year '24 costs was rebased on first quarter's average exchange rates, all things being equal, U.S. depreciation would put an upward pressure on an absolute cost, but in the same way, it will put an upward pressure. I have some benefit on the revenues, and we will do that on the same principle quarter-on-quarter as we progress. And our FX rates have been volatile. We'll continue to update you quarter-on-quarter. So in terms of BoCom, just in sort of simple terms, at this point of time, we continue to say that BoCom is an associate. We have done the assessment as we do every year in terms of further impairment. And there has been no impact for this quarter. The dilution impact into P&L, we will have an accounting impact on the completion of the share issuance, and that's where that will be taken. But I just want to reiterate all said and done. There is an insignificant impact from this dilution on our CET1. And because it's a material notable item, there is no impact on dividend or distribution."

And with regards to the actual accounting value, probably kind of point you to the Investor Relations team, which can take you through some of the specificities of this equity accounting principles, which are quite unique in the way we treat the associate accounting BoCom. But I just want to reemphasize, we're happy with our holding in BoCom. We're happy with our strategic relationship with BoCom and the fact that they give us exposure to the domestic economy in China, be it retail, SME outlook, which is not something our organic business is involved in. And very importantly, what Pam said, the valuation in our NAV is deducted from CET1, which means these impairments do not have or have a very minimal second order impact on our CET1 ratio and therefore, also do not impact our distribution capability."

        "text": "Hey, thank you. I have two questions. The first one I still want to ask about the tariff scenario, because I think for analysts, at least our investors in this part of the world, I think it's partly -- it's widely expected that the Chinese government will have more stimulus policy, because of the tariffs. So in your downside scenario analysis, have you incorporated some of the positive impact from the stimulus policies, which could potentially be benefiting the Hong Kong China market? So I think this is number one. Number two, I still want to ask about the loan growth because now the guidance is that there will be muted loan demands in 2025. So what sort of tariff scenarios that we are -- like when we're giving this type of guidance, what sort of tariff environments are we incorporating? And also that is there any guidance on, say, for example, like deposit growth and also banking asset or interest-generating asset growth? Like how should we look at this thing? Thank you."

Katherine, I'm going to make some comments on your first question, and I'll ask Pam then to take it forward as well as the loan growth question, which gives you an overlook. So firstly, we recognize indeed, there is a lot of potential for China to take policy measures and other measures to stimulate the economy, and we would be very encouraged by that. We're confident about the outlook for China. We're optimistic that these measures as they are taken and they will be taken will have a positive impact on the economy. We believe in the foundational strength of the Chinese economy, and we're very encouraged to see the pickup in retail sales, and therefore, the pickup in domestic consumption also. so on the whole, our main scenario is that we are confident in the medium- to long-term outlook in China. This being said, in a plausible adverse downside scenario, we have not taken into account some of these potential positive impacts, which may be or not likely to come. Pam?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Pam Kaur",
        "text": "Yes. Thanks, Katherine. So absolutely being a stress downside scenario plausible, but severe, we typically take the downside. We don't take the upside of the mitigating actions or any other policy measures. It's purely tariffs and retaliatory tariffs in a plausible range. So all said and done, I just want to reaffirm, it was all calculated as part of the target RoTE guidance that we are giving. On loan growth, the situation is in some ways similar to where we were at the end of Q4 because macroeconomic uncertainty delays decision-making. So we are not seeing any of those CapEx decisions being brought forward or delayed. They were delayed. They will continue to be delayed hopefully at some stage when some certainty remains, there will be loan growth. We are also monitoring very closely to see if there is any increase in drawdowns just like we observed in Q2 of 2020. At this point of time, there's no increase in drawdowns. So overall, from a loan growth perspective, I would say, still muted in terms of what we are seeing. The only thing I would say is that if there is sort of continued tariff uncertainty, you will see maybe a little bit pickup from a OpEx perspective on working capital because when you have to pay import duties upfront and there's some delays in some of the monies coming and so on. So that kind of will have an impact. But from a materiality perspective, the real driver for our banking NII guidance of $42 billion is really deposits for which we have a very strong franchise. We are in a privileged position to be a trusted partner for our customers, and we expect that to grow. Of course, there will be a bit of seasonal fluctuation quarter-on-quarter. But overall, that trend has continued."
